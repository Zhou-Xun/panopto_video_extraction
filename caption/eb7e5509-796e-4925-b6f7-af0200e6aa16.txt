1
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:55,560
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. So.

2
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:42,100
Oh, no, I. Good morning, everybody.

3
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:54,990
Good morning. And glad to see you either safely here or if you're not here, I hope you are safely somewhere.

4
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,200
It's been a doozy of a morning. Been driving in fog for hours.

5
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,570
So hopefully everyone was able to be somewhere safe.

6
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:18,180
So today we are talking about non probability sampling, just announcements.

7
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,140
I will again announce that I will not be here next Thursday, so please don't come.

8
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:36,780
I'll be in New Orleans. Hopefully eating a tasty treat and learning more about evaluation and building my skill set.

9
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:54,860
Yeah. Other than that, um. Oh, in the quiz, don't forget that the quiz is opens and closes next week, so you still have a few days.

10
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,620
This is the last unit that will be part of Quiz three.

11
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,030
So you only have one more quiz to go. And then.

12
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
Yeah. Then you're good.

13
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:20,179
So today is actually, even though the title of the the lecture that's about to say something for some reason, lecture is non probability sampling.

14
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:29,930
There's actually a mishmash of things in here. So we'll also talk about two types of data sources and a little bit about mixed methods.

15
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,980
And then we'll get into the non probability sampling.

16
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,990
So with that said, well, actually, any questions about due dates, things of that nature.

17
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:54,290
All right. We'll jump in. So on Tuesday, we talked about qualitative methods.

18
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:08,060
Essentially qualitative methods includes any research method that uses data that that doesn't indicate some type of ordinal value.

19
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:15,540
So we're talking about text, we're talking about media, we're talking about audio.

20
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:24,120
Even so, any analysis or any data collection that is collecting things that are not ultimately numbers,

21
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:32,040
we're taught there's lots of different things that way that you could do that fall under the umbrella of qualitative methods.

22
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,370
What we talked about, our Tuesday observations, both unstructured and structured.

23
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:48,870
We talked about focus groups, and then we also talked about interviews which include unstructured interviews, semi-structured interviews,

24
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,840
which are typically what's used when interviews are used in evaluation work,

25
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,990
and then structured interviews with the difference being the degree of structure or shape and.

26
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,060
That is embedded into the protocol.

27
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,470
Oh. So before we come it, you know, again, I mentioned it's a mish mash.

28
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,409
So the first thing we're going to talk about is I realize that we're talking a lot

29
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,129
about data collection and specifically we're talking about primary data collection.

30
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:43,110
But I wanted to pause for a second just to distinguish primary versus secondary data, because in evaluation, you do use both typically.

31
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,919
So the first is primary data,

32
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:57,480
and that essentially means it's newly collected data generally is data collected for specifically for the project or the evaluation project.

33
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:06,209
In contrast, secondary data refers to existing data and that data could be old,

34
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:13,080
that data could be new, but it is data that is not being collected specifically for the project.

35
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:23,670
It is existing data. So primary data could include things like surveys, assessments, interview data.

36
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,819
Secondary data could also could include interview transcripts.

37
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,200
It could use it could include surveys that have already been implemented.

38
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,210
Census data also falls under that.

39
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:50,879
And in public health, we tend to, you know, capitalize on the data that's being collected in order to monitor the public's health.

40
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,840
Right. So we have data from American Community Survey.

41
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,160
We have the behavior risk factor surveillance system.

42
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,400
We have the youth version of that national health interview.

43
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,050
And there's a little there's a lot more data that is out there.

44
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:18,600
And just a happy tip for those who like to play with data or would like some experience playing with data.

45
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,470
I saw the Lord. Institute for something something C.

46
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,730
Political and social research. They also they keep a lot of data.

47
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:45,310
They have a data repository. And one of the wonderful things for you being a michigan student is that you can get access to that data.

48
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,770
Often times you just need to fill out a form and promise not to share the data.

49
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:59,800
I've got like three big datasets sitting that I played with to strengthen my analysis skills.

50
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,490
So that's just society. If you want to learn how to play with data.

51
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,710
There you go. Some data. Pump out some quick papers. Anyway, get back to evaluation.

52
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,150
So we take advantage of an evaluation of the data that already exist.

53
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:28,870
I mentioned before I'm doing one evaluation that I'm leading is looking at multiple covert vaccine promotion programs in three states.

54
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:40,900
Part of what we're doing as part of that analysis is looking at data on COVID vaccine uptake in the counties where that intervention is taking,

55
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:51,670
those interventions are taking place, and then comparing them to similar counties based on racial demographics.

56
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,900
Access to health care. We're matching them on those different, different characteristics to see.

57
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:11,130
What does vaccine uptake look like in these two clusters, if you will, intervention counties and the comparison counties?

58
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,930
So you can use it and you can use secondary data in different ways that contribute to

59
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:27,690
understanding the findings that you get from the primary data as well as I suppose you can even.

60
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:38,580
You could also use secondary data if you are working with a program or organization that regularly collects data,

61
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,420
for example, measures of youth empowerment.

62
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:56,580
So, you know, I always encourage new evaluators that if there's a way to use secondary data, consider that, because then you can.

63
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:06,490
Invest more resources into primary data that you really need to be able to fill gaps,

64
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,490
or you can use it to incentivize or compensate people for participating stakeholders.

65
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,320
If you have like an. Evaluation advisory groups and whatnot.

66
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,990
So secondary data is not like a second class, even though the word indicates that it might be.

67
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,000
It can be really useful in maximizing the resources and time that you have.

68
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,730
So but there are some benefits to using primary data.

69
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,360
You can collect exactly what you need, right?

70
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:51,610
If you know that you need to ask a question related to youth empowerment and use of condoms, because that's my favorite go to.

71
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:58,450
You can ask those kinds of questions. Whereas with secondary data, you may not.

72
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:04,660
You kind of have to work with what you got. You.

73
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,559
Also a benefit of primary data is that you have greater control over the quality because the truth is,

74
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,540
if you're using secondary data, you don't really know how it was collected.

75
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:24,400
You don't know, for example, if your data collectors follow protocol, you don't.

76
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:36,860
If you especially with qualitative data that's secondary, you have no opportunity to to ask questions that you might want to ask as a follow up.

77
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,230
Again, you have what you have.

78
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:49,370
And then a third benefit to primary data is that it's up to date, you know, that it's newly collected because you participate in the collection of it.

79
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,430
There are some, you know, as I've already stated, some benefits to using secondary data.

80
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:06,380
It's time saving. So, for example, if you are working with a project where there's probably a need for some more stakeholder engagement.

81
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,560
Using secondary data can free up some of the time because again, every hour you work, that's money.

82
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,160
It's cost efficient. It exists already.

83
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,980
So you don't need to spend the money to train data collectors.

84
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,410
You don't need to spend money to compensate participants or respondents.

85
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:35,160
You're good to go. And then another benefit is that there's often large sample sizes.

86
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,720
Now let's take that COVID, this COVID vaccine example.

87
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:48,360
There's no way that our team, you know, even though we have ample resources for the evaluation,

88
00:13:48,360 --> 00:14:01,800
there's really no way that those resources would allow us to collect collect uptake data in what probably amounts to be about 40, 50 counties.

89
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,820
We just don't have the resources to do that. So the secondary data allows us to look at a piece of the puzzle.

90
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:19,070
That is reflective of a population more likely to be a population level indicator.

91
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,800
So there are some challenges with primary data. It is time consuming and it's costly.

92
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,410
Whereas with secondary data, some. Challenges.

93
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,250
The quality can vary. It may be out of date.

94
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,980
Like for example, if you go to the I PSR repository, there's some datasets from the eighties seventies.

95
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,330
If it's a panel survey, maybe that's, you know, I, you know,

96
00:14:50,750 --> 00:15:00,020
nice because it connects to other data but sometimes it's just straight up out of date and then it's seldom a perfect fit.

97
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,420
And I don't think I think there might be a couple of PhD students in here,

98
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:12,140
but you might know you probably get encouraged to do secondary data analysis to just get you out of here,

99
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,760
which is a good which is good advice overall.

100
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:22,850
But that means that you're likely not to find the perfect fit to what it is that you're trying to understand.

101
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,330
So. Oftentimes with evaluation, we're going to use both.

102
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,400
We're going to use some secondary data. We're going to use some primary data.

103
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:43,920
Here are some examples or sources as I shared primary data surveys, the things that we're talking about in class.

104
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:55,980
Second, other secondary data sources state vital statistics administrative data such as student records and medical records.

105
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,160
Usually if you're using that kind of administrative data,

106
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:07,469
there's some type of oversight that you'll need to engage with oversight committee or some

107
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:15,240
process to ensure that you are not violating the rights of the respondents in that data.

108
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,010
So you should be prepared for that.

109
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:27,000
So, for example, if you think getting data from the Department of Health and Human Services in Michigan is a good way to go.

110
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:37,880
Keep in mind that there's lots of things that might stand in your way and you might even have to do a FOIA request to be able to get data.

111
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:48,750
So that's just something to keep in mind. Also, I'll wait for a second and then there's just other considerations.

112
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,580
How much data do you need? If you need a lot of data,

113
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:03,270
it will be better for you to do secondary or at least seek out some secondary data resources before you decide to go ahead and collect your own.

114
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,790
You have to consider the resources you have for collecting collecting the data.

115
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,000
We talked about money and staff and timing. Also, the physical infrastructure.

116
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:24,750
If you've ever done how many people have like at least seen the IRP application or kind of filled it out, saw a few a few people.

117
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,040
There's lots of questions about how you're going to store the data. Right.

118
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:34,380
Like, is the computer. Is it password protected?

119
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,200
Whose computer is it? If it's paper data, where is it?

120
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:51,510
Is that room locked? And these and when you are doing a project that is that does have IAB oversight,

121
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,669
it's important to make sure you're following those regulations, right?

122
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:09,660
So, I mean, you could get all of it. And if the door that the door to the room where the data is stored, that's not locked, that could be a problem.

123
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:18,690
And I did mention in on Tuesday that oftentimes evaluations don't fall under IAB oversight,

124
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:25,650
but that doesn't mean that we have them the ability to just ignore those regulations.

125
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:33,660
What that means is that we still have a responsibility, ethically speaking, to make sure that we are protecting data.

126
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:41,670
And so if you're going to do primary data, regardless of the IAB oversight, you need to think and consider on those things.

127
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:54,920
And then finally the credibility of the source. So if you are and this is in, you know, in particular for secondary data.

128
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,290
If you have paid attention to if you're like kind of like a research person, you might have heard stories about people who make up data.

129
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:19,360
And then when it comes down to replicating studies that people find out, all that data is just straight up, made up.

130
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,310
Right? So you have to think about credibility of the source of the data.

131
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:38,900
I wanted to point out or lift up rather one type of secondary data analysis, which is document review.

132
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,260
Because I did mention on Tuesday that that gets used a lot in evaluation.

133
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:52,880
And so this what document review is really is a systematic selection and review of media related to evaluation questions.

134
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,220
So selection, I want, you know, left back lifting up the word selection.

135
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,480
There's pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

136
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,100
So it's not just a matter of. Oh, you know.

137
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,050
What do you got? Let me just analyze it.

138
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:22,050
You need to be able to identify what belongs in the pile of documents and what won't be part of the the the pile of documents.

139
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:32,280
Right. So you might include, uh, you might decide that if you're going to do a document review of coalition meetings.

140
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,020
That you would include those that are part of the main coalition meeting,

141
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:48,160
but you choose not to use meeting minutes from secondary committees, for example.

142
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,960
So you also are when you're thinking about doing this in a systematic way.

143
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,860
You're thinking about the process of reviewing those documents.

144
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,010
You know, typically we will read over documents.

145
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:12,040
We treat them almost like we would document transcripts if we were calling interviews or focus groups,

146
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,470
review them, identify some code, some particular tags, if you will, of data.

147
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:27,160
Chunks of data within the documents so that you can analyze those just as you would.

148
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:37,570
The Interview. Transcript. Document review is particularly helpful if you are aiming for a more contextual view of a program.

149
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,110
So you need historical data about the program.

150
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:51,730
You are conducting evaluation activities about processes or systems, or you want more detail about specific interactions with participants or others.

151
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:58,540
And documents can be, again, very broad. It can be meeting minutes, but it could also be reports or briefs.

152
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:08,360
I have a valuation project we're working on. Workforce development and the system and the city of Detroit.

153
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:18,829
There's lots of actors in that space. So part of what I do is look at what briefs and reports are coming out of the from the different actors to be

154
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:27,940
able to answer questions related to how is a value and the for my client how what how are they filling the gaps?

155
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,490
In order to be able to do that, I have to know what the gaps are.

156
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:48,740
So it can be useful. So I'll pivot a little bit and talk about, well, you know, we've talked now about both quantitative and qualitative data.

157
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,350
How do you choose between them? Like what?

158
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,120
What should you consider? So a quantitative data, some benefits.

159
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,220
It's a rapid data analysis,

160
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:13,490
especially if you use things like or software like R or SAS or data that allow you to write the syntax and keep the syntax.

161
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:19,040
SPSS does two bits having to do it with SPSS.

162
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,510
You can keep syntax, the written commands for the software and just run it.

163
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:40,010
So for example, if we get more data, we do another data collection moment I have to do is push a button that's usually called run and run it again.

164
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,790
5 seconds where that. So it's pretty rapid.

165
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:55,880
Quantitative data also allows you to capture more people, a lot easier to collect 100 surveys in 100 interviews.

166
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,350
And then quantitative data allows you to assess validity and reliability.

167
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:13,010
And we've talked about how helpful it is to be able to look at the internal validity or external validity of a study,

168
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,709
to be able to understand how confident we can be or in terms of reliability.

169
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,550
We talk about how consistent is the measure.

170
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,510
It is easier to do that with quantitative data.

171
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:35,950
Some benefits of qualitative. Other than the fact it's measured, I preferred narrative data that's just more interesting to me.

172
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,640
But so other than that benefit, it provides a better understanding of context.

173
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:47,049
And that's what we mean when we say rich data. Because think about it,

174
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:55,570
if you're having a conversation to say you're telling somebody close to you a story about what happened to you on the day on Halloween,

175
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:06,070
you're probably not going to say this happened A, B, C, you're going to say A happened on that reminds me of something that happened two years ago.

176
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:15,310
Let me go back to B then. O B reminds me of something that I was thinking about doing or something I saw and then see.

177
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,130
So all those side though, I guess you would, you know,

178
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:30,940
think of a side note that's important to look at and think about and understand when you are and you get that when you're doing qualitative data.

179
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,969
So in some ways, a lot of times I'll be honest with you,

180
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:45,520
like the the contextual analysis or data that I collect is sourced from other data collection point.

181
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,960
So I might have an interview with the respondent and they say something about.

182
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,440
A conflict between people in the neighborhood that I know.

183
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,770
Oh, well, now I know I can go look and find out about this conflict that happened two years ago.

184
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:11,420
You can find out interesting things that way. It also qualitative data helps you answer the how and the why.

185
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,190
Because again, if you ask somebody, it's hard to kind.

186
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:27,450
You can do it, but it's hard to structure. Quest survey questions in a way that allow you to capture what why people are doing what they're doing.

187
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,310
And that's only even if you anticipate it in the first place.

188
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:39,450
Whereas with an interview or a focus group, if somebody says, well, I don't use condoms because.

189
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:46,380
You know, I just learned that, like. Well, you know, sex is.

190
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,950
Well, nobody's gonna say transactional, but they might describe some.

191
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:58,230
Well, they might. It's a very academic word to say that sex is transactional, and that's some language that we made up here in the academy.

192
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,090
But. Somebody might allude to that.

193
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,620
Like, you know, I learned from my family that, you know, I watched my mom use sex to get us food.

194
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:19,379
So then you can follow up. Right. And then that gives you a better sense of and a richer picture of what's going on and why.

195
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,780
And if you're doing it for a program, you can then go to your program, stakeholders,

196
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,320
and say, hey, what we're hearing is that there's family issues related to sexual behavior.

197
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,890
Perhaps you should consider that in the second revision of this program.

198
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,550
Some challenges to qualitative data. The just of it is less in depth.

199
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,850
It's just a bunch of numbers.

200
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:53,630
And I mean, I do like playing with numbers, but it's not the most exciting and it does require statistical analysis expertise.

201
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,390
You need to understand descriptive statistics, you need to understand inferential.

202
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:08,060
And even if you're not going to run that yourself, you need to, as I've stated before, you need to at least understand what it's about.

203
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,090
Because otherwise people can run stuff and you won't know that, you know,

204
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,690
they should have chosen one analysis over another based on the shape of the data.

205
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,499
So that's. Those are some challenges a quantitative requires and I think it probably requires more

206
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:37,100
investment in the analysis or learning the analysis than it does for qualitative.

207
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,249
In contrast,

208
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:49,520
a challenge to qualitative is that is very time consuming and then it's difficult to apply your conventional standards of validity and reliability.

209
00:28:50,360 --> 00:29:01,490
That doesn't make it less of them. It just simply means that a lot of those ideas or concepts were created with statistical analysis in mind.

210
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,460
So you just have to be creative and thinking about validity and reliability when you're using qualitative.

211
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:19,110
But you can also use both. And I would strongly recommend that you use both.

212
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:25,740
You do. And that part of your evaluation plan is going to require that you practice using both.

213
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,630
And I would say in the future, that's a good strategy to to use.

214
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,770
So mixed methods. It refers to gathering both quantitative and qualitative data.

215
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,630
And it's not just a matter of collecting the different types of data.

216
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:49,260
It's actually knowing how to use those piece, those different categories of data together.

217
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:59,480
And there are some even classes. On campus that are related to mixed methods, data collection and analysis.

218
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,980
For today, I'll just say that there's two ways that we generally will do a mixed method study.

219
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,810
One is to use one method to prepare for the use of the other.

220
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,470
So for example, here we have using focus groups to develop a survey instrument.

221
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,370
But we can also use mixed methods concurrently.

222
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,970
And that means using both methods at the same time.

223
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:39,540
And. At the same time doesn't mean literally at the same time, like I'm giving you a survey and a focus group, although you could do that.

224
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,510
You could do. You know, that was an example I gave on Tuesday.

225
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,040
You could use a survey to get some information before focus group and report on all of that data.

226
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:56,640
But it means roughly using it at the same time and for the same purpose.

227
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:06,840
So, for example, using focus group or interview data to help speak to or affirm the response validity of a survey.

228
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:18,160
Using different types of data. And it doesn't even need to be mixed Emacs methods, but using different types of data.

229
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:27,220
That process is called triangulation. And what it's really about is assessing whether the two or more.

230
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:41,690
I said the findings are in an agreement. I'm going to see the survey data says that people are not using condoms.

231
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,410
What does focus group data say? And if they are in conflict.

232
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:57,870
Why? And again, for an evaluation study, the stakes are me being able to, as an evaluator,

233
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,830
work with my stakeholders to understand where might there need there be a benefit to tweaking a program?

234
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:18,099
So any questions about any of those? All right, all right.

235
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,460
Come on. All right. So we're going to go back to sampling.

236
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,800
So just a reminder, like as we talked about last week.

237
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,900
Time to wash up the sampling frame. I kind of wish I put the sampling frame slide back in here too.

238
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,660
But so there's two rough groups or categories of sampling strategies,

239
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,330
their probability strategies, and then there's non probability strategy strategies.

240
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,730
Your probability threat strategies like yours are simple random sample.

241
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,420
Your stratified. Your cluster.

242
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,650
Those are methods of sampling that use some form of random selection.

243
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,090
What that means is that the units in your population have a known probability of being chosen.

244
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,350
And the probability does not need to be equal.

245
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:23,460
It does not need to be proportional. So you can have a 6030 depending on.

246
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,690
Know where you're coming from, like where the samples being drawn from.

247
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,600
Non probability sampling. Is any sampling that does not use random selection.

248
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,160
And so there's an unknown probability of being chosen.

249
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:52,020
So you don't you don't necessarily know. Okay. Am I drawing out 60% of the sampling frame, for example?

250
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:01,150
And again, just to remind you, a sampling frame is literally that list of people that you're going to draw your sample from.

251
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,320
So you might have a sampling frame of 100 people.

252
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,440
And then you're going to pull a certain amount from that sample sampling frame or that list.

253
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:21,800
Yeah. So non probability sampling. So.

254
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,360
Okay. Let me go back. So not probability sampling.

255
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:39,959
It may provide insight. Right. So if you're you're pulling people in a non random process, you will get insight into the question,

256
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,070
the evaluation questions and the findings that you get from the analysis.

257
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:54,660
But it's difficult to state that the sample was scientifically determined because it really is, again, in contrast to a random sample.

258
00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:02,430
It's possible that another sample will produce different results or your findings just might be on target.

259
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,660
Right. You don't know.

260
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:17,280
And when we remember, ultimately all these design choices are about modeling or at least trying to approximate some type of effect,

261
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,020
but also a potential counterfactual, what would happen if this intervention was not in place?

262
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,890
And the random sample is going to allow you to get closer to.

263
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:43,950
The true effect of a program or the true effect of whatever they are easier to construct.

264
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,240
You don't have to have a sampling frame to use a nonprofit.

265
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,590
Well, a probability sample. It's also less involved and cheaper.

266
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,420
So in. I tend to use a lot of non probability,

267
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:09,969
all in part because we're also sampling as many people as possible who were

268
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:15,780
participating in the program or in the case of like staff or other stakeholders.

269
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:26,049
We're trying to get as many people as possible. So it is a little quicker to, you know, not have to think about, okay, well,

270
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:33,280
we're only going to draw these people, so you get a quick estimate, but you may not get accuracy and precision.

271
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,440
Right. Because I might, you know, in that aim to get as many people as possible,

272
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,620
the people I don't get, there might be some significant reason why I don't get them.

273
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:52,350
For example, if I am doing a evaluation study on an intervention related to sexual risk behavior.

274
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,670
It's possible that the people that I don't get,

275
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:06,170
the people that are out of touch are out of touch because they have experienced some outcome related to sexual risky behavior like,

276
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:16,790
you know, some type of STI or maybe they became pregnant and moved away or you know, there's lots of things that could be happening that I won't know.

277
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,900
And so it's not as accurate and precise.

278
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:36,909
We'll talk about four strategies today, quarter snowball criterium and convenience, and what kind of end with a little game will probably end early.

279
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,450
Actually, I know you all are happy about that.

280
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:44,200
You can go back in the fog. Yeah, it's fog.

281
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,720
Tell me how this is the worst. I have not seen fog this bad in a very long time.

282
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:56,310
I was literally driving my kid to school this morning or my my dad's name was my light.

283
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,070
My oh, I'm so scared. So scared.

284
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:07,090
Like, oh, lord mercy. Anyway, call the sampling.

285
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:13,470
So call this sampling is similar to stratified sampling.

286
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,350
The biggest difference is that people are selected at random.

287
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:27,070
So you're determining a specific number of individuals to select in your sample and different different subgroups to match the population of interest.

288
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:35,350
So for example, I have a city level smoking ban program campaign, for example.

289
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,530
Most of you are not my age, but some of you are.

290
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:48,810
And you might remember being able to go to the store and go buy cigarets for people in your life.

291
00:38:50,280 --> 00:39:00,180
Then you might also remember when that became totally illegal and stores were being encouraged and invited not to not to no longer sell to you.

292
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:09,630
So you might have seen that transition. So there were around that time, there were a lot of campaigns with stores to.

293
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:19,510
You know, not sell cigarets to minors. And then increasingly now you see campaigns to not smoke at all.

294
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:30,090
So say you're evaluating one of those campaigns and you really want the sample to reflect the adult population based on this,

295
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,660
based in the city or in the city, based on age.

296
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,990
So you could use quota sampling to.

297
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:57,380
To simply walk around the city and make sure that as you're going and proceeding that you are ultimately you have 27% of 18 to 32 year olds,

298
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:04,760
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, to 11% of 65 and older.

299
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:13,730
Older. And you're basing the proportion of people in your sample based on some type of existing statistic.

300
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:20,000
Again, the biggest difference to stratified sampling is that you're not doing it at random.

301
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:27,950
So now that I said that you're walking around the city, you're you're doing a quick survey with whoever you speak to and,

302
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:36,050
you know, going as you go making sure that you're kind of filling in for that proportion.

303
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:47,220
You can also use it in qualitative research to apply a theoretical frame to your sampling of analysis.

304
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:55,920
For example, you might want to look at the impact of a campaign on different age groups.

305
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:07,350
So, you know, and you do interviews with a proportion of 18 to 32 year olds in a proportion of 65 and older.

306
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:17,980
I like using called a sampling in qualitative because it also lets you be inclusive without using that random sample.

307
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:28,750
For example, if I want to make sure I have a good balance of people of different racial ethnic groups,

308
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:37,420
all the sampling is very useful strategy for making sure that I have that existent existing proportion.

309
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:48,220
So for example, actually the example I wrote here is from the COVID vaccine uptake intervention that I'm evaluating,

310
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:59,890
I'm evaluating and multiple, multiple sites. And so I'm recruiting staff from different sites based on geographic location.

311
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:06,580
We're working in three states. So I'm making sure that I have a certain number.

312
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:13,990
And this is actually more of a static number. So I'm looking for a 3 to 5 staff from this cluster of.

313
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:21,910
This state I'm looking for through the five in the second state.

314
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,090
And I'm looking for 3 to 5. And the third state.

315
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:32,430
And that way I'll be able to compare now so what how that staff talk about program

316
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:40,170
implementation in these rural counties in this rural state versus this more urban area.

317
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,440
The second approach is snowball sampling.

318
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:58,960
I always love the word snowball sampling. Every time I say it, I just imagine the snowball, just like because I'm very visual.

319
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,110
But you start with a few key individuals or units and you ask them to recommend others.

320
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:13,090
They know with similar characteristics though, and those in your sample, they likely know each other or have similar opinions.

321
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:24,410
So there is going to be some bias. But this can be really useful if you're accessing hard to reach populations, for example,

322
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:33,320
like people who are using drugs or using I.V. I.V. drugs in particular, because that's a little more illicit in our culture.

323
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,810
So snowball sampling can be useful because.

324
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,080
Once you gain the trust and rapport with one person, they may refer you to others.

325
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,060
I find that this strategy works really well, too.

326
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,370
When I have money for incentives.

327
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:03,750
Not enough to be coercive, but enough that somebody is again, they're going to do the work of referring a few more people to you.

328
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:11,280
And that's work, right? Like the the they've got to either give you the name and phone number if maybe they want to get stopped by their friend.

329
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,480
Or what more likely happens is that they pass the information that I've given them and that person contacts me.

330
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,720
So that's work that I think deserves to be compensated.

331
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,200
So I find that it works better when I actually have something to compensate them with.

332
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:37,960
But aside from the compensation, if you weren't doing that, it can be cost effective because you're not really doing the work of recruiting.

333
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,060
You're relying on your parties, your respondents to do the recruiting for you.

334
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,690
But again, there's some inherent bias, right?

335
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:54,170
Because people tend to know each other. And so they're probably going to have similar opinions.

336
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,149
You know,

337
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:06,950
I imagine if I do some evaluation on something related to politics and I ask you to refer me to somebody who doesn't have the same politics as you,

338
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:14,390
probably not going to happen. More likely than not, there are for me to somebody who has similar politic political leanings.

339
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:26,600
So there's a bias there. Third sampling strategy that we'll talk about is criterion.

340
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,620
And this is where you are selecting all individuals or units that meet some predetermined criteria.

341
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:44,870
So this is what I was talking about when I'm talking about sampling all the participants or sampling all the staff, that is criterion sampling.

342
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:52,350
And so it's particularly useful for qualitative components of evaluations because it allows you to well,

343
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,450
one, you don't need the sample you get actually getting a population,

344
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:06,320
even though it's called sampling, in some ways, it's kind of not sampling because you're giving everybody if you're using it that way.

345
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:16,260
And or maybe for example, if in the model or in the example, that's probably more of a sampling.

346
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,730
Strategy or technique.

347
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:32,440
Say you do a survey and you have some people who say, Well, I dropped out of the program because the program was boring or it didn't fit my interest.

348
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:42,100
So you can recruit all the people who completed the survey and said that they dropped out to find out what was boring about it.

349
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:47,290
What did they engage or interests? And that information can be useful to a client.

350
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,640
Then finally, convenient sampling, often called grab sampling.

351
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:04,260
I will say that even though I've read that it's called rap sampling, I've honestly never heard anybody actually call it grab sampling.

352
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,580
But then again, I don't hear a lot of people saying that they're in regular language and talk,

353
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:14,720
saying, yeah, I'm using a convenient sample and what does that really?

354
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,880
But we write it in our plans and then we just move along.

355
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:23,130
But convenient sampling. Selecting the easiest to reach.

356
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:30,980
And those who are readily available. So for example, you.

357
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:41,700
You are doing an evaluation of a program that has an event associated with it saved.

358
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,560
You know, some type of dissemination event or some wrap up event.

359
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:52,520
And you go to the wrap up event and you survey everybody there.

360
00:47:54,370 --> 00:48:00,970
Very convenient. As you might imagine, there's probably some bias there because why?

361
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:07,160
Why is it that they're the easiest to reach? What about the people who weren't there at the wrap up event?

362
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,210
What does that say for them? Were they engaged? Were they not engaged?

363
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:18,500
You don't know because you just conveniently went through and collected data.

364
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:25,820
Now, that doesn't mean that. I wouldn't say this is the most rigorous sampling technique,

365
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:33,050
but some day sometimes there are situations where this is going to be your best, this is the best you're going to get.

366
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:42,230
For example, you might have concerns from your client about park or sampling from other events.

367
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:50,900
For example, I worked with a client once. They did not want me to come to any absolutely none of their workshops.

368
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:57,800
I understood part of it. It was with men. They didn't want a woman in a space is about, you know, being a father.

369
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:02,170
They're like, Yeah, you show up, you just look like their baby mama.

370
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,780
You can't come.

371
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:16,760
So I can only collect data when there were open events like like wrap up events or parties, they wouldn't let me come to anything else.

372
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:29,750
So sometimes just the best you can do with any strategy, whether it's sampling, design, etc., the way you develop a survey again.

373
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:38,270
Sometimes you just do the best you can do. You just have to be open when you are when you're looking at the results of that.

374
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:45,500
Right. And say, okay, well, this is what I see. But I have to remember and I have to tell my client it was a convenient sample.

375
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,810
So we don't know what the other the nine convenient people would have said.

376
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,720
So you just have to be open and and transparent about that.

377
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:12,019
So when do you use each strategy? You know and have alluded to some of these already call the samplings best when you have a population

378
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:18,170
with multiple subgroups or you're trying to do an analysis that allows you to compare by subgroup.

379
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:26,240
So you might have a reason for thinking that older youth and younger youth, for example, are going to respond differently to an intervention.

380
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:32,940
Or you just call them when you want a sample that closely matches the population.

381
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:42,520
Snowball sampling when you're trying to reach hard to reach populations or populations that.

382
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,070
Are in some ways purposely invisible.

383
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,600
For example, snowball sampling can be, you know,

384
00:50:53,600 --> 00:51:03,680
has been used successfully with studies with men who have sex with man sex workers where it's invisible.

385
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,240
You know, the membership in some ways is purposely invisible.

386
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:16,850
Snowball sampling can also be used strategically if you want participants to have those shared experiences and similarities.

387
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:26,930
And you know, that the like the the alternative would be doing a survey to find out do they have the similar experiences and similarities.

388
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,560
It's much easier to ask, ask somebody, Hey, can you refer me to another person that.

389
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:44,220
Uh, participated in. This program with you or this who feels the same way you do about.

390
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,660
All the political mailings that they're getting in the mail right now, I don't know.

391
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:58,970
You can ask and say these are the specific experiences or qualities I'm looking for in another person.

392
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:09,500
Can you refer me to somebody else? So it's useful in that criterion sampling when you're interested in a specific subgroup to examine more in depth.

393
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:16,100
People who dropped out of a program, people who came in in the middle of a program,

394
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:23,660
people who did, who really pushed against whatever was being taught in the program.

395
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,290
And then finally convenient sampling when no other options are feasible.

396
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:37,629
Or, you know, as I alluded to, if it's a situation where it's going to keep the peace between you and your

397
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:44,290
stakeholders and not severely undermine the quality of the evaluation study.

398
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:59,100
So any questions about sampling? I forgot to have two more slides.

399
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:05,310
Then we get to do the game. Game? So how do I pick?

400
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,680
I mean, there's probability. There's not probability. Ideally, we would always pick probability.

401
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:16,740
But let's be real. This now is going to happen. Again time, mommy.

402
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:22,590
Other resources. Intangible relationship related factors.

403
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,180
So what are advantages and disadvantages?

404
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:38,600
You know, again, probability sampling, you're more likely to get a representative sample of your population because it is randomly recruited,

405
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:45,560
so you're more likely to get the same proportion of the population.

406
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:50,500
You can generalize findings to your population of interest.

407
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:59,800
So in terms of external validity, a probability sample is ideal and you can replicate this study.

408
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:06,909
Because you again, you've done a random selection process.

409
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:12,220
That means that anybody who's trying to replicate can do a similar random selection process.

410
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:18,880
In contrast to non probability, where it's a little bit harder to replicate what the last person did.

411
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:26,950
Disadvantages low probability sampling. It requires a sampling frame listing those eligible units.

412
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:32,559
And remember when we talked about sampling frame, that means that you when you create a sampling frame,

413
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,410
you also have to create the way to contact those people.

414
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:45,700
And especially if you are working with populations where there's a lot of where it can be transient, like homeless you.

415
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,630
Or any, frankly, any individual that is unhoused.

416
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,000
Creating a sampling frame can can take up quite a bit of time.

417
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:04,110
So it's not as straightforward in every circumstance requires a disadvantage.

418
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:08,950
It requires a process where random selection, it's just not that big of a deal.

419
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:13,560
But if you're trying the sample, unless you're trying to sample large numbers,

420
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:22,320
because then you're sitting in front of that random number generator for hours trying to make sure you have enough people from your sampling frame.

421
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:31,840
And then it's time intensive and costly. With non probability sampling an advantage don't need to sample and frame.

422
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:39,760
It's time efficient and it's cost effective. But the disadvantage is that you don't know if the samples are representative and

423
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:45,190
you can't because of that generalize findings to your population of interest.

424
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,570
Okay. So other considerations. Do you need the random sample?

425
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,510
In some studies, random sampling is not necessary. Yeah.

426
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,999
Thinking about that criterion sample sampling example.

427
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,010
I gave you all the staff, all the participants. Doesn't need to be random.

428
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:17,080
What's feasible and again, feasible in terms of tangible resources like money,

429
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,940
but also intangible resources like your relationships with your clients.

430
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:27,020
Another consideration is how do I prevent biased results?

431
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:37,400
So you need to be aware of any sampling bias, potentially potential sampling bias if participants are recruited for special clinics or programs.

432
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:48,019
So there's for example, if you have a program that you're evaluating and like a clinical study might be something that is kind of

433
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:56,270
a good example where there might be some special criteria that they are picking or using to select people.

434
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:00,920
That goes beyond kind of the focal population, if you will.

435
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:06,890
You just need to be aware of that because that might again have an impact on the findings.

436
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,249
Like maybe they wanted, you know, with the clinical study,

437
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:19,850
maybe they wanted to make sure they got people who were willing to take a chance on a vaccine, like with the COVID vaccine testing.

438
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,950
Just need to be aware of any sampling bias in those those cases.

439
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:32,660
And then finally, how much time do you have if you don't really have time for a probability sample?

440
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:39,750
Now, probability is probably the way you want to go. Right.

441
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:46,150
So let's play with the red pen. It's my favorite.

442
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:51,370
See, this time I figured it out. Lesson space. Get smart in here, you.

443
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:04,040
I'm glad that I spent so much money to go to school to figure out what I mean.

444
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:10,220
Let me start with you. You probably are a man about tuition, but I'm with you.

445
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,210
I went to the same place you are, so I understand. It's really expensive.

446
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:19,220
So what kind of sample is it? But don't worry. You will get the job.

447
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,180
I promise you. You approach.

448
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,100
So you approach people in a mall in.

449
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:34,890
I'm hanging out to complete a survey on perceptions of COVID vaccines as part of a citywide poster campaign evaluation.

450
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:42,970
And by the way, this is both. It can be either a probability or non probability, but.

451
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,920
So you got, what, eight to choose from? So anyway, you approached people in the mall.

452
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,300
You're complaining to complete the survey on perceptions of COVID vaccines.

453
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,970
What kind of sample do you think it is? It is a non probability.

454
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:08,920
What kind of non probability? I have been quiet today.

455
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:13,770
I can't even make out any one person's voice. Take a chance.

456
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:18,620
Not. Yes.

457
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:28,270
And if anybody knows where the code is from, you get my I don't know undying appreciation and I have no money for.

458
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:36,360
I've been trying to bring you eye candy on Tuesday. I was like, if I get if there's Halloween candy leftover folks, I'm taking it to my class.

459
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,960
Thank kids. They took all our candy. So I can't ever bring you candy.

460
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,190
There was a lot of candy, too. Okay. Yes, convenience.

461
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:51,720
Because you're just walking around in the mall and like, hey, person who looks like they're not going to cut me out won't do the survey.

462
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,580
All I will say I've had some fun. I did that. But this was at a health fair.

463
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,959
I had a ball and I have five butts. They were excited about that.

464
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,030
Five bucks I like. I got $5 cash if you want to do the survey.

465
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:12,180
They were like, really in cash. I was like, Yeah, I didn't think it was going to work.

466
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:15,360
Somebody was like, Yeah, just going to $5 in cash. I'm like, This is not going to work.

467
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,260
People are excited about that $5. They start calling people all over.

468
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:22,799
You get fired. That's far, but you can't just do this.

469
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,060
Ah, anyway, I'm telling you, I was surprised.

470
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:31,050
Five bucks in cash. I'm like, that's nothing. They. They ate that stuff up.

471
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:41,370
Anyway. Second one. As part of a faith based COVID vaccine promotion program.

472
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:45,970
Well, you see, I'm trying to trick you because the other three examples are like that.

473
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,940
As part of a faith based COVID vaccine promotion program,

474
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:56,000
you sample a random number of members from three of the seven churches participating in the program.

475
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,680
So let's start like what is it? Probability or non probability?

476
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,350
In this probability. Random number.

477
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:14,090
Yes. You took a chance.

478
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:24,970
It's cluster y because I took three of the seven and I randomly sampled within the three of the seven.

479
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:37,290
All right. Number three, as part of a faith based COVID vaccine promotion program, you create a sampling frame,

480
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:43,740
sort the members into groups based on age, and then the randomly sample from each of the age groups.

481
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,219
So now probability. There are a probability. It is.

482
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,380
Probability is high.

483
01:01:53,500 --> 01:02:04,060
I heard a stratified. Yeah. So. The two like kind of words that let you know as probability sampling frame randomly sample.

484
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:13,440
That's true. And then we know it's stratified. Because for one I did the sorting.

485
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:22,690
So remember I said that helps to sort. And then each of the age groups.

486
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:28,420
So you're pulling from each of the age groups. And you're randomly sampling.

487
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:37,299
Number four, you interview a staff member from an organization implementing a COVID vaccine

488
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:42,790
promotion program and then ask for recommendations for other staff to speak with.

489
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:50,840
Is it? Yeah, it's mobile. So there's a probability and there's snowball.

490
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:55,270
Now. I was wonder if anybody was going to say criteria.

491
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:04,089
The reason why is my criterion. Because you're not getting everybody or you're not you know, you're not trying to get all the staff.

492
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:07,420
You're just asking, hey, who shot who? Who else should I speak to?

493
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,060
And then finally, as part of a faith based call, the Vaccine Promotion Program,

494
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:19,630
you recruit 30 survey respondents from each of the seven churches participating in the program.

495
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,660
Probability or non probability. It is not.

496
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:32,560
It's quota. Yup. So there's no random.

497
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:35,889
There's no random selection here. It's simply.

498
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:42,190
I'm going to. I know that I've got seven churches. And I'm going to grab 30 people from each.

499
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:52,140
And probably more likely than not, it's convenient, like in terms of literally convenience, not convenient sampling.

500
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,650
I'm conveniently just pulling the first 30 that call.

501
01:03:56,550 --> 01:04:04,410
Right. So, yes. So that's cool. So any questions before we jump into summary?

502
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,900
Doo doo doo doo doo doo. So I only have a summary for non probability.

503
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:21,170
So. The biggest difference between probability and probability is that non probability does not have random selection.

504
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,209
And then we talked about for today there are more just like what probability.

505
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:31,560
But we talked about qual the snowball criterium and convenience.

506
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:38,290
And so this concludes the units that will be included on Quiz three.

507
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:43,340
So. And I think now are we done?

508
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:47,460
We? We may be even done with step four.

509
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,120
And remember what I said was next. I think analysis is next.

510
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:59,940
All right. Any if no other questions. I'll save these slides like I do.

511
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:04,320
If I write on the screen, I usually save them back in the files as annotated.

512
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:09,720
So if you want to go back and look at my little notes with the red pen, feel free.

513
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:20,430
Other than that, you are free to go. Hopefully the fog has lifted while we've been in this room because I do not want to drive in it any more.

514
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:50,300
Have a good day. Yes, I do want to keep my annotations high for the lectures.

515
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:54,170
They it will be based on I they give it to you.

516
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:58,740
Did I. Oh okay. I'll let me just pull it up.

517
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:03,410
Oh I should be able to circle on it. Huh. Let's see.

518
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,749
Huh? Oh, I'm. Yeah, I'm.

519
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:14,450
I'm probably older than yourself, menopausal and premenopausal, so I get very.

520
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:18,780
Yeah, I just get randomly. Hi. This. I just thought it was really cool this morning.

521
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:23,730
Oh, we're not. Okay.

522
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:33,320
So this is due on Tuesday night. Let's see.

523
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:38,660
I don't know if he's gonna let me do it on the screen, but let's try. Oh, come on.

524
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:48,179
Hand-to-mouth. Okay. Now.

525
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:52,140
It's not gonna let me do it. But what I could do is this.

526
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,350
A picture of five?

527
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:03,680
Yep. Price Waterhouse.

528
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:17,840
And I already know you so much.

529
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:24,830
You're welcome. Any questions for me? Is that how it should be?

530
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:31,940
I'm trying to remember. I think it is either 20 or 18 because there's some short answer and they're just taking questions.

531
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:42,290
Okay. That's what it is. Yeah, because I usually try to stick to 20 points, but I'm like, wait, I think there's some questions with to our quiz too.

532
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:49,790
I mean, everyone do pretty well just I don't know if you if you were here when I talked about the two questions that people struggled on,

533
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:55,410
I think I might I don't know. I okay.

534
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,909
I like I miss my first year as a 30 something.

535
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:02,870
I can't remember the first or to the last question. Okay.

536
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:06,460
You know, that might have been that might have been the day I talked about the two questions.

537
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:12,310
Yeah, because you mentioned that there was a couple questions and I guess.

538
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:20,390
Yeah, so yeah. So if you go back on to Thursdays last, those days are recorded, you'll see the two questions.

539
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:33,300
Yeah. So we yeah, we basically discussed the two episodes so I had to in a just to make sure.

540
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:39,020
Oh, I mean, negative. Oh, that was a fair way.

541
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:43,080
But but. But you know what? I can remember what the quarantine rules were anymore.

542
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:47,060
I'm losing track myself. Yeah, I tested negative. Okay. Okay.

543
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:52,090
Okay. Well, I'm glad. Are glad you tested negative. I tested five days in a row.

544
01:08:52,420 --> 01:09:00,270
005. Oh, yeah. Well, let me go.

545
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,930
Oh, you're just like. I was nervous. I'm.

546
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:10,840
What? Have you had it before? Oh, yeah, it. It's like a cold, but not but worse.

547
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:15,879
I had it for me out. And so that's why I skipped class.

548
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,110
Just to make sure I tested negative and see testing myself all week.

549
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:24,010
Yeah. Because it's yeah.

550
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:27,760
It's really not the same. It, it, it's similar to a cold.

551
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,870
Yeah. But then there's one where you drop it off for.

552
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,430
Yeah. Yeah. Like, some people get really sick when they see opportunity.

553
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,280
Well, he was only. She only felt like a fluke.

554
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:47,130
Yeah. Yeah. Had to get the test for her, and she was positive.

555
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:52,360
That's how. That's how they my kids, they. They hardly call. They were because all of us got it.

556
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:56,379
But I was out for like two days, literally sleeping.

557
01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:02,530
And then my kids were like, I don't know.

558
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:06,660
I mean, they had so much energy was pissing me off. I'm like, I can't do anything.

559
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:11,950
I saw them running around like so I was nervous. I had to go to Costco to get the tests.

560
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:20,110
And then by the time I had the top ten, like so I said to myself, they did out five.

561
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,730
Let's see, what if I then I guess I'm like, well, you know,

562
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:32,800
and then I have to I keep saying to myself it was negative and I guess it was like I was like what my strategy was to stay away from home.

563
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:38,130
I didn't get home until midnight. Yeah, I'm just the same way I was when I was.

564
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:41,710
I was. I was. Was going. Have a good one.

565
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:46,000
Hello. So do you have a question on.

566
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:52,340
Purpose and validations. So we came up with the question and were wondering what?

567
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:58,210
Little questions, you mean? Yeah. Like in person.

568
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:08,340
Honestly, it doesn't. I mean. As long as it's clear, like you have like a number of one to.

569
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:17,870
You. You're so pathetic. I'm like Stu. Stu, this was this really very meticulous about.

570
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:23,360
Yeah. Yeah.

571
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:31,399
Because when I when I was in the school room where you you get what I get and I'll throw off it, but I don't think that's the same.

572
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,830
And even when I started teaching, it was like that. But people were just like, really, you know?

573
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,830
But as I teach more, I'm like, it's a different generation.

574
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:45,610
Yeah. I mean, some like, even. Like what? Formatting and stuff.

575
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:50,290
So that's why I think a lot of fans are now like, well, you could not imagine. Yeah.

576
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:55,980
But that's good. That's good. Is I'm just like, okay, whatever.

577
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:07,840
Right. I got the picture.

578
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:13,670
Mm. You know, I usually have lost my mind up to say.

579
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:23,910
Oh. Yeah. Just, you know, just email me and then we can just also.

580
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:31,459
Yeah. And. You should be able to fit it in if you email me as soon as possible,

581
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:36,680
because then we can try and maybe sketch or something from Monday or Tuesday before I fly out on Wednesday.

582
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:41,440
Oh, Monday would be okay. I'm okay.

583
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:47,359
And it's pretty open right now. In the Moscow and the afternoon.

584
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:58,550
So Monday. Monday afternoon. Yeah. So before seven weeks I have to be like classic Benjamin in this class to be what, seven.

Oh, my God. I mean, what's going to happen?

595
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:26,540
Okay. You also. Big fight.

596
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:50,590
I. Totally different.

597
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:51,810
I know it's so.
