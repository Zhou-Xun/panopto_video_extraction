1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,970
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,730
I had an issue with the commode. It was called the computer that uploaded the website.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,139
So I had to come in between class and get it off of the channel mode.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,090
And that was very stressful.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:26,330
I was stressed out thinking about whether it was going to upload or whether it would still be computer like while someone was in here teaching.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,970
So it's just like, okay, I got to get into like these classes.

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,969
Yeah. So, yeah, I think it's pretty easy.

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,480
Just use the mouse. It's like, okay.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,910
And then it's just up on PowerPoint, so.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:54,660
Welcome back again, everyone. We're really happy to have guest lecturer Dr. Lawrence for Boulder today to talk about Carcinogenesis.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,250
I guess Begona is a research assistant professor of Environmental Health Sciences in our Environmental Health Sciences Department,

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:13,350
Sydney, and also in pharmacology. Um, she studies sex specific effects of exposure to environmental toxicants during critical windows of development,

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:23,370
with a focus on epigenetic mechanisms and also studies how maternal diet and nutrition can modify the effects of developmental toxicant exposures.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,390
Um, and again, focusing on epigenetic programing and reprograming things like that.

15
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,660
So super interesting stuff. And with that, I'll hand it over to doctors Barbara.

16
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,100
So help me welcome her to class. We're really happy to have her.

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,470
Thanks. Thank you all.

18
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,450
Am pleased to be here. Just in case you're wondering,

19
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,969
like you didn't hear anything about cancer in the description of what I do for my research for

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,450
my post-doc I did my postdoc was focused entirely on cancer and pediatric cancer in particular,

21
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:08,950
and how development goes awry in the context of, of, of the formation of connective tissues in the body.

22
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,870
And that can lead to cancers. And this is a really common mechanism of cancer in children.

23
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,210
So I'll touch on pediatric versus adult cancers in here a little bit and how they differ.

24
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,860
But yeah, so for my or my current research, I've taken that, you know,

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,149
the cancer research I focused on developmental origins of cancer and then I moved into the developmental origins of cardiovascular disease.

26
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,100
But I also collaborate with a lot of people who are still working there.

27
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,860
So it's definitely an area of interest to me for sure.

28
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,750
I just want to briefly acknowledge Dr. Dustin Colosimo, who has taught this class in past years,

29
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,460
and I use some of his slides for today's lecture in addition to some that I had as well.

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,330
So for today's class, I want to give a quick introduction to epigenetics,

31
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,060
because it's hard to talk about cancer without knowing just a little bit of background and epigenetics.

32
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,830
Some of you may have this already, but just in case, I just want everybody to be on this page.

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,630
I want to also talk about the developmental origins of health and disease and how

34
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,810
exposures during early development can actually predispose you to cancer later in life.

35
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,820
And then give us some basics on cancer. What it what is cancer exactly?

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,310
And talk about how cancer we thought of as a genetic or an epigenetic disease.

37
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:41,650
And it's probably both. And then also talk about pediatric versus adult tumors and what are their potential environmental causes.

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,069
And I should note note that cancer is a enormously broad topic.

39
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,430
A lot of the topics that we cover in this class are very broad. And you could take one of these lectures and make an entire semester out of it.

40
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,210
So just keep that in mind that this is very much an overview of the topic.

41
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,059
And there are also lots of, you know, you'll have opportunities to do your research,

42
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,120
whatever you're interested in, to delve into something and much more detail.

43
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,590
So what comes to mind when you think about the term epigenetics?

44
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,430
How many of you how many of you have familiarity with it already?

45
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,820
Yeah. So what does anybody want to throw out?

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,510
Just what comes to mind immediately when you think about that term.

47
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,410
Histone modification. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,290
So there are modifications of the DNA.

49
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:49,460
There are modifications to the histones, which are the proteins around which the DNA is is wound, and they function to regulate gene expression.

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,780
Does anybody have any other thoughts, do you think?

51
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,340
Like just kind of generally, um, like what comes to mind is just how understudied it is.

52
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,459
I feel like there's a lot to learn about epigenetics, but it doesn't seem to be like a really big field.

53
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,540
Maybe like outside Michigan. Kind of. Yeah.

54
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,220
You know, in the context of cancer, epigenetics is huge.

55
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:21,500
It's a huge research area. Definitely. There's definitely a lot of interest and focus on epigenetics in the context of cancer.

56
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,980
But as far as other diseases, the field is still catching up,

57
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,200
whether it's environmental health and environmental health ties in closely with all sorts of

58
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,210
diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disease and diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

59
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:47,920
Yeah. So this is just an illustration of a drawing that somebody made of all of the various histone modifications.

60
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,989
So this was like histone H three and H four that they've sketched here to be the,

61
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,889
the various histone modifications that people have drawn up that can occur on these different histones.

62
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:07,210
And it looks like a gigantic mess. And they've drawn in here some proteins and some cofactors and things that are involved in the whole process.

63
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:15,879
But basically what I want to just convey to you is that the the the field of epigenetics and epigenome is very complex,

64
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,520
and there's a lot of cross-talk between the different modifications and and their

65
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,759
mechanisms of regulating gene expression are still very much an area of research interest,

66
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,300
and there's still a lot of work to be done to understand how,

67
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,870
how it functions and essentially what the epigenome, the term epigenome really means on top of the genome.

68
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,540
And these are chemical modifications that occur to the DNA itself or to the histones

69
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:51,190
that can turn a gene on or off or up or down so they can titrate gene expression.

70
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:01,420
And this can occur in response to either intrinsic factors like growth hormones or growth signals inside the cell or to environmental factors.

71
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:09,210
So epigenetics is typically defined as a mechanism for regulating gene activity

72
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,799
independent of the DNA sequence that determines which genes are turned on or off,

73
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,420
up or down in a particular cell type into different, different disease states.

74
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,550
Cancer we'll talk about today, that's the best characterized disease,

75
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:33,720
or I should say cancer as many diseases, the best characterized class of diseases where epigenetics go awry.

76
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,550
Epigenetic processes in response to a physiologic stimulus, as I mentioned,

77
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,680
so may be an intrinsic growth signal or in response to environmental exposures.

78
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:55,140
And basically epigenetic processes are what govern the differentiation of stem cells in our body to become all of the different cell types.

79
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:01,080
And so we start as embryonic stem cells in all of these cells.

80
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:09,899
So all of the cells in our body have the same complement of DNA, so then the same DNA sequence, but obviously a liver cell,

81
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,820
even though it has the same DNA sequence as a brain cell, it's a very different cell behaving differently.

82
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,970
It looks different. And why? Why is that?

83
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,420
The reason for that is there are epigenetic processes that govern the process of differentiation,

84
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,379
that guide gene expression in a way that drives a cell down to particular fate.

85
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,520
So down to a liver cell here, brain or skin or any other cell type.

86
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:48,540
And I like this illustration of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression because it kind of breaks it down all the way from the chromosome.

87
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:58,049
So you have your chromosome here. If you were to unwind that chromosome, you would see all of these chromosome fibers and these beads on a string.

88
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:07,350
So they're referred to, when you look at them under a very powerful microscope, are nucleosomes and these nucleosomes.

89
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,660
And then you have your DNA wound around the nucleosomes.

90
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:17,880
The nucleosomes are comprised of these histone proteins, and these histone proteins have these tails that are kind of waving out in space.

91
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,500
And it's at these tails where a number of modifications can occur.

92
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,850
And there are different enzymes that play a role in placing these modifications on the histones.

93
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:39,810
So you have Ryder enzymes. These would be like a DNA methyltransferase or a histone methyltransferase that methylated a particular histone.

94
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:48,600
These are enzymes that add those modifications you have or the DNA methyltransferase is what methylated the DNA itself,

95
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,860
not the histones, but the histone methyltransferase. This would modify the histone tails.

96
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,300
And then you also have enzymes that remove those histone modifications.

97
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,730
So this would be like a TED Deoxygenation.

98
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:10,530
Actually, that's a that would remove a DNA modification, a histone demethylation would remove a histone methylation mark.

99
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,770
So there are class of enzymes that remove the modifications.

100
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,120
And then you have a class of enzymes that are called readers that can go in and recognize a particular histone modification or DNA

101
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:31,800
modification and alter the they can recruit in other factors that can come in and regulate gene expression at that particular site.

102
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,940
And I should note that in the context of cancer, I'll touch on a few.

103
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,650
I just had one slide on a few epigenetic therapies that are approved for the treatment of cancer or are in process.

104
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,280
There's a tremendous amount of interest in developing drugs that target these writers of racers and breeders,

105
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,190
because often in cancer you'll see that these enzymes are mutated in cancer.

106
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,540
So there are dozens of epigenetic modifications that have been identified.

107
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,419
To date. These include modifications to the DNA itself.

108
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:19,110
As I mentioned, there's methylation, but then there's also a number of more oxidized modifications that can occur on the DNA hydroxy methylation.

109
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,340
Formal five formal cytosine.

110
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,640
So five hydroxy methylation is five hydroxy methyl cytosine.

111
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,580
Then you can get a more oxidized form five formal cytosine and five carboxyl cytosine.

112
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:38,549
And then there's also modifications that can occur on the histones, including acetylation methylation.

113
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,140
Those two are the best characterized.

114
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:50,550
Then there's also a whole other range of modifications, and each of these factors has been shown to be altered in the context of cancer.

115
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,810
And many have been reported also people by all two environmental exposures.

116
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,040
And whether environmental exposures play a role in cancer through modification of the

117
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:06,899
epigenome is an area of tremendous interest and that's still not fully understood how,

118
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:16,530
how mechanistically, how that happens. So my research in particular is focused on the developmental origins of health and disease,

119
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,210
and it's the idea that disease risk can actually be programed early in life.

120
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:32,560
And so you could have some chemical insult, say, during pregnancy or during during gestation or sorry,

121
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:42,030
during lactation, during early childhood that could increase the risk of various diseases across the life course.

122
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:49,860
And you could have potential interventions like dietary interventions or other lifestyle factors that may influence that risk.

123
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:59,490
But the idea is that, you know, insults early in life have the potential to affect your disease risk across the life course.

124
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:13,380
And that includes cancer. And this is a slide from Dr. Linda Birnbaum and others on the developmental origins of health and disease and the various.

125
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,790
So if you have a chemical exposure during early development, it can manifest as all sorts of different diseases across the life course.

126
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,009
So at the bottom here you see different ages.

127
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:31,260
And if you go out later in life where you're finding where you're more likely to get certain cancers like breast cancer, prostate cancer,

128
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:40,980
neurodegenerative diseases and whatnot, that some of these developmental exposures may play a role in the development of these various diseases.

129
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:48,900
And this stage of development influence is a susceptibility to a particular chemical as well.

130
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,570
So different organs form at different times during early development.

131
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,010
And so if you have a hit during the time when you have a peak development of the heart,

132
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,860
for example, you're more likely to have a congenital heart defect.

133
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:13,980
And so the stage at the time of the exposure influences outcomes during the period of organogenesis, the embryonic stage of organ formation.

134
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,090
It's also the time of maximum maximum sensitivity to malformations.

135
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:26,070
If you have a hit during the fetal period, then that tends to be a sensitive period for functional deficits as well as some cancers.

136
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:35,520
So this there have been there's a couple of research groups that have focused on this concept of silent epigenetic

137
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,710
programing by developmental environmental exposures and how they can influence cancer risk later in life.

138
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,090
And so this is work from Dr. Cheryl Walker's group at Baylor.

139
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,570
And what they found is that this is in a rat model.

140
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:57,780
And they found that if they treat rats with bisphenol A at this very just short window right after they're born,

141
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:05,190
what happens is there's this cascade of molecular processes that occur that are a little bit beyond the scope of today's class.

142
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:15,450
But essentially there are some cellular signaling pathways that are activated that result in activation of this particular epigenetic enzyme,

143
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,780
this histone methyltransferase called Mello.

144
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:25,680
And it results in a histone modification at the transcription start site of several hormone responsive genes.

145
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,850
And those genes, the expression of those genes isn't affected at the time that the developmental exposure occurs.

146
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,640
So you have this programing of the epigenetic mark that occurs and then the

147
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,550
animal goes on to be just fine the rest of its life until you get to adulthood.

148
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,370
And if you hit these animals with a hormone with a hormonal insult,

149
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,370
what you find is that those genes that are hyper responsive or that have this

150
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,650
histone modification early in life have become hyper responsive to the hormone,

151
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,170
and they're more prone to developing prostate cancer. And so this is kind of the idea in the context of an animal model,

152
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,940
how a developmental exposure can program the epigenome in a way that increases the risk of cancer later in life.

153
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,180
Now, whether this occurs in humans is much more of an an area.

154
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,660
It's more. It's fairly poorly understood and not well defined yet at this point.

155
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,930
But animal models are obviously more tractable because we have we can control the exposure and the timing and and everything,

156
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:39,429
but obviously that's much harder to do in humans. And so that brings me to the question when considering environmental contributors to cancer,

157
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:45,340
why do you think it's so difficult to determine how our early developmental environment affects cancer risk?

158
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,040
Anybody? Have any thoughts on that?

159
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,140
Yes. It's pretty hard to isolate like a single cause to.

160
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,600
They are attributing a single cause to that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

161
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,840
So let's say you were let's say your mom smoked when you were pregnant.

162
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,270
If she was smoking when you were pregnant,

163
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:18,170
maybe she also had other socioeconomic factors that were maybe she was in an environment where they didn't have good access to health care.

164
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,400
Maybe there was an if she was in an environment where there's more pollution, air pollution, whatever.

165
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,920
So it is hard to to pull out a specific factor that may have been contributing.

166
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,090
Anybody have any ideas?

167
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:40,159
I know particularly especially when you're dealing with young children or babies, I mean, oftentimes you can't really get much biological samples.

168
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,360
And so oftentimes they'll just use like a fingerprint. But then you have to do many, many, many samples to get any kind of conclusion from that.

169
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,439
Yeah, yeah. That's a big and I'll touch on that later on.

170
00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:01,400
When we talk about pediatric cancer is that the access to samples is really tough, especially when it's when you're talking about little kids.

171
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:09,190
Yeah. Any of the cuts. I don't know if it's more complete similar to what I said,

172
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,669
but it's like cancer has a very long latency period, so it takes a really long time to develop.

173
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:20,120
And then by the time it's like you really old and then you have all these other diseases, it's hard to narrow it down.

174
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:27,590
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. That's one of the most frustrating things about studying cancer is the latency period, especially in humans.

175
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:37,400
And yeah, by that time, who knows all the million things you've been exposed to throughout the course of your life in which one was a contributor?

176
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:46,880
And that's why, you know, it's when you're establishing cause and effect in terms of a chemical causing cancer,

177
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:54,470
you have to eat the chemicals where you really where there's a strong association between the chemical and cancer,

178
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,130
like something like aflatoxin, something like cigaret, smoke.

179
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:05,390
I mean, it's just a slam dunk in terms of the odds ratio, you know, exposed versus not exposed.

180
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:12,560
But there are other things like that are more subtle, like your diet, for example,

181
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,620
or a lack of a particular nutrient and that type of thing that have much more gray area.

182
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:27,630
And so so it's very challenging. So what is cancer exactly?

183
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:35,740
Anybody want to throw out a definition of cancer? When controlled growth.

184
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,400
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's pretty, pretty simple in there.

185
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:50,910
You get a lot of definitions in there that that I think are important to to to know if you're going to be working in the cancer field.

186
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,500
So the the process of Neoplasia is defined as new or autonomous growth of tissue.

187
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:07,379
This is not necessarily a problem, but it obviously is often a precursor to a more serious problem,

188
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,020
like a cancer, a benign neoplasm can be like a benign tumor, for example.

189
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,940
A benign growth typically is a slow rate of proliferation.

190
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,890
And importantly, there's no invasion but a malignant neoplasm.

191
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,790
This is where these are the serious health concern.

192
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,810
You have an invasive lesion. It's capable of spreading to other tissues.

193
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:40,890
And if you, for example, have a breast tumor that, you know, like the tumor in your breast is not what's going to kill you.

194
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,290
It's the metastases that the metastases to the brain, to the bones and other parts of body.

195
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:54,960
That's what kills patients. It's not the the single localized tumor unless it's in the brain,

196
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,810
because obviously any space occupying occupying lesion in the brain is going to be a problem, whether it's malignant or not.

197
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,130
Metastases are secondary girls derived from that primary malignant neoplasm.

198
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,240
And then when you're talking about a tumor, that's just a lesion characterized by swelling or an increase in size,

199
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,790
and again, that can be either benign or malignant,

200
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:29,130
whereas cancer is typically referred to, it is an uncontrolled cell growth and more commonly used in the context of a malignant tumor.

201
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:37,410
A carcinogen is a physical or chemical agent that causes or induces the process of neoplasia and eventually cancer.

202
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:47,020
So there are a few additional definitions that I'll also just touch on because you'll see these in the literature.

203
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:55,840
It's important to note the difference when it comes to cell and tissue morphology changes in cancer development.

204
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,150
You can hear the term hyperplasia and hyperplasia simply means an increase in cell number.

205
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:10,060
This is typically a response to a stimulus, for example, a hormone, and the cells look microscopically normal.

206
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,200
So you have your normal cells here. They still look normal. There's just more of them.

207
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,610
This can be a perfectly normal physiologic process.

208
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,840
Some of the cells may increase in size a bit and that's hypertrophy.

209
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:31,510
So you have an increase in cell number that's hyperplasia and you have an increase in cell size and that's hypertrophy.

210
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,010
And then this can be either normal, perfectly normal, or it can be pathological.

211
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,010
There's also the term of plaza that you'll see.

212
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:51,780
And this is a abnormal cellular differentiation process in which you get the replacement of one differentiated

213
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,090
cell type with another mature differentiated cell type that is not normally present in that tissue.

214
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:06,180
And this is an adaptive response to injurious environmental agents or microorganisms, chronic inflammation.

215
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,200
And it can be a precursor to dysplasia and eventually cancer.

216
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:17,310
And it occurs at sites where you see a lot of environmental insults, a lot of irritants,

217
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,230
inflammation, environmental agents such as the lungs and the GI tract.

218
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,330
And so an example of this of this metal process is Barrett's esophagus, which is a precursor to esophageal cancer.

219
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,050
It doesn't always proceed to esophageal cancer, but it often does.

220
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,770
A third term to know is dysplasia.

221
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,040
And this is another process of abnormal differentiation where there's here.

222
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:53,900
This is more concerning in the context of if you're thinking about cancer, so you get a partial loss of tissue organization,

223
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,089
you get a slight increase in cell number, you get cell structural abnormalities.

224
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,950
The cells just start to not look like the cells of that particular area.

225
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,500
And then this can be potentially reversible as well, depending on how far along it is.

226
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:15,410
An example of this would be for those of you who have to get pap smears,

227
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:22,550
they're looking for cervical dysplasia and cellular abnormalities that could be a precursor to cancer.

228
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:32,620
So many cancers follow this process where you start kind of with the normal epithelial

229
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:39,009
layer here and then you start getting some hyperplasia and you have more rapid

230
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,360
cell growth and then you start getting dysplasia and you see that these cells are kind

231
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,690
of looking different from the normal cells of origin for that particular tissue.

232
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,150
And eventually that can progress to cancer.

233
00:24:52,510 --> 00:25:04,210
And this process occurs through this gradual acquisition of genetic and epigenetic mutations that eventually lead to cancer.

234
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:13,120
Now, I'll say in the context of, say, certain pediatric tumors like Ewing Sarcoma, the tumor that I studied, which is a bone and soft tissue tumor,

235
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:20,589
those cancers do not follow this process in which say you have you start with a perfectly normal tissue

236
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:28,000
and then you get this gradual progression to cancer in places where it does like in the cervix,

237
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:39,879
where you can do a pap smear and you can catch it early or in in the colon where you can get obviously a or a colonoscopy,

238
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,620
a very effective method for detecting early precursors to colon cancer.

239
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:52,350
It's really great that you have that ability to prevent the cancer or prevent yeah.

240
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,010
Prevent some intervene someplace, someplace early before the cancer occurs.

241
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:03,760
But then there are certain cancer types like pediatric tumors, where once you have some abnormality there, it's there.

242
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:10,330
Like there is no there's no kind of gradual progression from a normal cell type all the way to a cancer cell.

243
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:19,960
In fact, Ewing Sarcoma and some other bone and soft tissue tumors, we really don't know that the cell of origin to begin with.

244
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,000
And that makes it tricky to understand the biology of that tumor and how to treat it.

245
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,770
Does anybody have any questions at this point? Just stop for a second.

246
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,670
Make sure. All right.

247
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,930
So cancer often follows.

248
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:49,799
As I mentioned, this multi-stage model of carcinogenesis in which you have a normal cell that undergoes some process of initiation,

249
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:58,110
where it acquires some DNA damage, and if that cell is capable of repairing itself, then there's not a problem.

250
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:06,750
And in fact, we get tons and tons I mean, thousands of probably thousands of DNA mutations that happen,

251
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:15,390
if not millions every day, just as a result of going outside and getting exposed to sunlight or something in your food.

252
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:25,350
But our cells are able to repair those. Thankfully, we have very high fidelity DNA repair pathways that keep us from getting cancer and dropping dead.

253
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:33,270
And but often, actually, I shouldn't say often, actually, cancer is a pretty rare condition.

254
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:43,980
So in rare cases, you have that initiated cell that acquires the ability to proliferate and develop a focal lesion.

255
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,429
And typically, this is the cell.

256
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:56,430
If it's able to proliferate and kind of outcompete its neighbors, it's gotten a particular mutation that has allowed that allowed it to do so.

257
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:06,090
That's allowed it to evade signals that tell you to be a good neighbor and only proliferate when you're supposed to not take up too much space,

258
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,460
not take too many resources.

259
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:18,400
But and that typically is aided by a promoter, as I'll talk about and I'll talk about the difference between an initiator and a promoter.

260
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:28,330
And so at this point, you have a focal lesion. Again, if you have the B cells can undergo apoptosis or programed cell death.

261
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,050
And if they do, then the lesion is not permitted to progress.

262
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:40,500
But often, as I mentioned, cancers will acquire various mutations along the way.

263
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,329
They'll get one mutation that will give it a little bit of an edge,

264
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,459
and then I'll get another one that keeps it from undergoing apoptosis, for example.

265
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,950
So then you have you have even more of a survival advantage and so on and so on.

266
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:03,190
But as you as you progress along this pathway, you get defects it about ptosis defects and repair,

267
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,510
increase in proliferation that can eventually progress to cancer.

268
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:16,500
So the process of initiation is a stable, mitotic herebut heritable change.

269
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,000
This is typically in the form of a DNA modification. So it did a mutation.

270
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,150
It's usually caused by a GENOTOXIC agent,

271
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:33,930
and a cell will typically need to undergo a division to kind of lock in that mutation and pass it on to the next generation of cells.

272
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,970
And it's usually not enough, though, to induce a neoplasm.

273
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,410
And so some of that undergoes an initiation process.

274
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,460
It can remain static and just not divide.

275
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,370
A lot of times we have pathways in our cells that recognize some DNA damage.

276
00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:02,430
And if the if it's better for the survival of the organism that is us or an animal or whatever,

277
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,959
then that cell will just undergo a process of programed,

278
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:16,380
cell death or suicide, because we don't want cells or DNA damage proliferating and going on to pass their mutations on to the next generation.

279
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,230
And in the unfortunate situation, that cell can divide and pass its mutations on.

280
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,250
And this is one of the processes that sets you on the road to cancer.

281
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:34,440
Now, with regard to GENOTOXIC agents that initiate that are responsible for this initiation process,

282
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,270
there are two kind of they're kind of divided into two groups.

283
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,800
In the toxicology literature, you can have either direct acting agents or indirect acting agents.

284
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,780
So a direct acting agent is an activation, independent chemical.

285
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:58,830
There is no need for metabolic activation. So this would be an example like a nitrogen or sulfur mustard.

286
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,460
These are just already in their parent form, highly reactive, highly electric filled.

287
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:15,430
And so an electric file is a chemical that will attack electron rich, electron rich molecules in the body.

288
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:24,659
So like DNA proteins, lipids, nucleic acid, other nucleic acids and whatnot, sulfur, oxygen,

289
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,990
nitrogen have these unshared pairs of electrons that are really attractive to electric files.

290
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:38,140
And they typically cause cancer at the site of exposure because you don't need to metabolically activate them first.

291
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,479
For the second class of GENOTOXIC agents would be your indirect agents,

292
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,600
and these are turned pro carcinogens, and so they have to be metabolically active first.

293
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:55,330
And these include aflatoxin, micro toxin or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

294
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:04,750
So these have a a benzene ring that has to be that actually undergoes a reaction that then

295
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,760
in the liver with cytochrome p450 is I should have included that slide on here but I didn't

296
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,489
but that they they're activated by cytochrome p450 is in the liver to get these really

297
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:23,440
react to the pack sites that then can go on and attack DNA or other molecules in the body.

298
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:33,460
And but the point is the patches aflatoxin they typically cause cancer at the site of metabolic activation.

299
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:42,730
So for example aflatoxin is a very potent E.P.A. toxicant undergoes that undergoes activation in the liver.

300
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:52,510
The process of promotion is a clonal expansion of that initiated cell population.

301
00:32:52,810 --> 00:33:03,550
So you have the genetic hit and then you have endogenous or exogenous factors that can stimulate the growth of that initiate itself.

302
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:12,040
These are usually non genotoxic and they drive cellular proliferation or they inhibit apoptosis.

303
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,450
So some examples here are hormones.

304
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:25,720
For example, hormones will tell cells to start proliferating, and if that cell has already undergone some deleterious DNA mutation,

305
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:33,190
then that can promote the the expansion of that population of cells with that DNA mutation.

306
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:40,750
It usually requires a repeated or constant exposure, and there's often organ specific effects.

307
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,909
You'll also hear in the cancer literature this term malignant transformation.

308
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:59,510
And this is the process by which you get a conversion of a benign lesion to an invasive cancer, and this requires additional DNA mutations.

309
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,060
So again, you'll have an initiated cell that has, you know, a single mutation.

310
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:12,500
And it will look as as it progresses down this process to tumor formation.

311
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:21,500
It will acquire subsequent mutations. They can become very large scale, like chromosomal translocations.

312
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:30,140
These cells, when you look at adult tumors, in particular, the epithelial tumors, breast cancer, lung cancer.

313
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,329
They look like genetic train wrecks because over the process of your life,

314
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,930
you're getting all these environmental exposures that cause these genetic mutations.

315
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:48,950
And then also in the cancer itself, the cancers, once they develop, they acquire these mutations and the ability to just keep on proliferating.

316
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:53,569
A lot of the time they just sort of throw up their hands and they they don't have the good

317
00:34:53,570 --> 00:35:00,530
DNA repair pathways anymore and they just plow through cell division without repairing DNA.

318
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:11,750
And so when you get to a more this more progressive form of cancer that you have these very large scale genetic lesions.

319
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,250
These cells are able to outcompete their surrounding cells.

320
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:22,610
They need to be able to attract their own nutrients so they're able to stimulate the process of angiogenesis,

321
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,620
which is the growth of new blood vessels to feed that growing tumor.

322
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:37,520
And they develop a number of molecular pathways that allow them to invade this surrounding stroma and metastasize in other tissues.

323
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,890
So it's actually quite remarkable what these cells have to do.

324
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,130
You know, you have your epithelial cell here and it looks like an epithelial cell.

325
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,090
And in order for this cell to be able to reach the basement membrane and move through the stromal layer,

326
00:35:53,090 --> 00:36:01,220
it has to activate all these pathways that shut down this epithelial program, allow them to detach from their neighbors cells.

327
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,640
They become more mesenchymal in their gene expression signature.

328
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:12,410
So a mesenchymal cell is a cell that's that forms the connective tissue in our body.

329
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,060
So they acquire you'll hear the term epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

330
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:27,680
So they'll transition to a more mesenchymal cell type. And then they're able to develop pathway, acquire pathways that allow them to migrate as well.

331
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,620
And then once they migrate, they have to get through all of these different tissue layers and into the bloodstream.

332
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,410
And then once they're in the bloodstream, they have to be able to survive the the.

333
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:49,900
Immune system, for example, in all of the hostility of this new environment in the bloodstream and be able to

334
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,030
travel through the bloodstream to a secondary site and see that secondary site.

335
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:04,520
And so you can imagine that cells would really have to acquire a lot of a lot of different

336
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:10,010
processes and advantages and pathways that allow them to survive this whole process.

337
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:18,780
Yeah, I have two questions. The first one, going back to the indirect like carcinogens, the ones that require the metabolism,

338
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:26,140
then like does the health of a person's metabolism determine whether or not they'll actually see like the onset of cancer?

339
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:33,800
If you have contact with an efficient one, would that be more likely to take one of those indirect carcinogens and turn it into cancer?

340
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,150
That's actually a good that's a good that's a good question.

341
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:51,740
And yeah, so for example, sometimes if you have let's say if you drink alcohol, it induces different cytochrome p450 in the liver.

342
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:00,080
And if you have a if you have a secondary exposure like carbon tetrachloride,

343
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:06,320
you're more likely to suffer severe health effects like liver damage and cancer from the carbon

344
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,420
tetrachloride if you also drink alcohol because it's like an opportunity cost of using that enzyme.

345
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,190
Yeah. So because you already have that and you have higher expression levels of that enzyme,

346
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:22,220
so it's there to, to convert that carbon tetrachloride into more, it's more toxic.

347
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:32,300
Such a tri chloral radical metabolite that can go on and do the that one that that's the metabolite that actually does most of the damage.

348
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,950
So yeah, I think there are genetic factors that can affect, you know,

349
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:47,690
the expression levels of different enzymes in the liver or in other tissues in the body that metabolize different chemicals,

350
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:59,120
whether they be drugs or or environmental agents that can influence your your ability to metabolize different things more efficiently.

351
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,529
Less efficiently. Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,620
And another. Another way that health can influence.

353
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,250
Cancer risk would be, for example, if you.

354
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:22,680
Like if you have if you are a smoker, if you are a heavy alcohol drinker, you're also going to tax your levels of food if I am in the body.

355
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,839
So you have this load of iron antioxidant that detoxifies a lot of chemical agents.

356
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:36,510
And if you have if you're already getting all of these other environmental insults or you're in a state of poor health in general,

357
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,860
that can predispose you to more health conditions as a result of that.

358
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,920
You know the questions.

359
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:59,860
So one example of this classic progression from healthy tissue to malignancy, this is probably the most the best characterize example is colon cancer.

360
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,200
And thank goodness colon cancer proceeds through this mechanism.

361
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,040
And we have very effective methods for detecting it early.

362
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:17,139
And so everybody everybody should get their colonoscopy at that age that they're that they're recommended to by their doctor,

363
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,400
because although it's not a fun procedure,

364
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:31,630
it's relatively painless and it is far more uncomfortable and awkward and painful, you know, to have colon cancer.

365
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,780
And there's a not just with colon cancer, but other cancer types.

366
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:44,860
There's just been an increased number of people under the age of 50 who are getting these lethal cancers.

367
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,979
And there's various, you know, some of it's environmental factors, some of it's diet.

368
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,080
There's all sorts of hypotheses for why that is.

369
00:40:53,080 --> 00:41:01,930
But it's important to stay on top of the the tests that we have available that have been shown to effectively prevent these types of cancers.

370
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,010
And so you have your normal colon here.

371
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:12,100
This is a colon from a patient with a this is called familial adenomatous polyposis.

372
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,270
This is a mutation in the APC tumor suppressor.

373
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:22,780
So these people are have almost like 100% chance of getting cancer,

374
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:29,020
colon cancer and other cancer types in the body, people with these different familial cancer syndromes.

375
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:35,260
And so you'll have your normal epithelium that allows your second copy of the APC tumor suppressor gene.

376
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:44,740
And then you can develop through this process of dysplasia, adenoma carcinoma and the metastatic cancer eventually.

377
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,069
And you can see that first. The first head is to the APC tumor suppressor, and then you get a second hit,

378
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:56,080
for example, and crest, which is a molecule that promotes cellular proliferation.

379
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,580
You get loss of p53, which is a tumor suppressor gene.

380
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:06,490
You have all of these redundant pathways in your body to prevent this process from occurring,

381
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:16,380
but it still fails in many cases, and especially in the context of a familial where you already have a familial genetic hit.

382
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:25,820
So is cancer a genetic disease or an epigenetic disease in the.

383
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,930
I mentioned at the beginning of the class, I sort of already answered it that it's kind of both.

384
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:39,109
That kind of it is both in cancer requires disrupting key genes is characterized

385
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:45,710
by a loss of function of tumor suppressor genes and an activation of oncogene.

386
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,290
And so tumor suppressor genes normally protect cells from developing into cancer cells.

387
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:58,550
They're important for DNA repair. They're important for a pap ptosis for regulation of the cell cycle.

388
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:06,200
Examples of this are p53 arby, which is retinoblastoma and APC, which I talked about a minute ago.

389
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,710
And they're commonly mutated in different cancer types.

390
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,860
You already have a head. If you have a familial cancer syndrome related to one of these genes,

391
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,910
or you can get a mutation that occurs that is the result of that environmental factor.

392
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:27,590
Oncogenes, on the other hand, are a gene that has a potential to cause cancer when mutated.

393
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,650
They're referred to as a protocol gene when they're not mutated.

394
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:41,720
So rats, for example, I talked about Crass on the previous slide and how it drives tumor growth and cell proliferation.

395
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:51,080
But RATS is a is a mitogen it's a it's a molecule that promotes cell growth in the body and it's there and important for normal,

396
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,610
healthy cellular processes.

397
00:43:53,090 --> 00:44:02,680
But when it acquires this, when it acquires mutations, it becomes hyperactive and it's not shut down when it's supposed to, that it becomes a problem.

398
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,000
Then it's an awkward gene. And so that's the difference between a protocol gene versus gene.

399
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:16,250
They usually cause cells to proliferate when they shouldn't, or they ignore the signals that tell them to commit suicide.

400
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,730
Or he purchases rats, for example,

401
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:29,030
when it is a growth factor that is critically important to normal development as well as MC MEK is another transcription

402
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:37,760
factor that is highly important in normal development but is mutated and I don't know most every single cancer.

403
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:48,660
At least a majority of cancers that and the PI3 kinase, which is another growth signaling pathway.

404
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:55,560
Again, these are also commonly mutated in cancer. I will say with regard to cancer therapies.

405
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:01,790
It's much easier to develop a therapy that targets and hyperactive oncogene than it is to

406
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:08,000
develop a therapy that turns on a tumor suppressor gene that's been shut down or mutated.

407
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:18,920
If there's an epigenetic repression of a tumor suppressor gene, then certain epigenetic therapies can turn those tumor suppressors back on.

408
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,310
And that's an area of research interest.

409
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:31,850
But most cancer targeted cancer therapies that aren't just general cytotoxic agents, they are typically targeting activated genes.

410
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,450
And the mechanisms driving cancer. Multifaceted. So cancer is a genetic disease.

411
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,370
Familial cancers, as I mentioned, are characterized by inherited mutations.

412
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:52,329
Many cancers harbor DNA mutations and genomic instability mutations.

413
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:55,570
Things that mutate your DNA are often carcinogenic.

414
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:02,020
Not surprisingly, in introducing mutations, DNA mutations into mice can result in cancer.

415
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:11,860
So cancer is certainly a genetic disease. The cancer is also an AP genetic disease and that cancers have defects and cellular identity.

416
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:22,360
One of the hallmarks of cancer is you will you know, an epithelial cell has a distinct appearance under a microscope.

417
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,990
It looks like a it looks like a skin cell or it looks like a cell that lines the epithelium of your GI tract,

418
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:36,100
whereas a cancer cell does not look like an epithelial cell, in most cases, they become differentiated.

419
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,910
So they sort of look like. Not like a stem cell, but closer to it.

420
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,570
You know, you have this like continuum from a stem cell to a differentiated cell.

421
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:51,050
They sort of progressed backward on that continuum. They have genetic damage.

422
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,220
The genetic damage in cancer often involves proteins that regulate the epigenome.

423
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:04,190
So I mentioned a few slides back that histone methyltransferase is histone demethylation and certain

424
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:11,660
breeder proteins can be mutated or hyperactive or not active enough in the context of cancer.

425
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,840
Cancer cells can harbor epigenetic damage in the absence of genetic damage.

426
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,630
This is really common in pediatric tumors.

427
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:33,050
And so if you look at a continue on, if you look at if you see plot like the number of genetic mutations in from zero to,

428
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:41,630
you know, thousands of mutations over here, you have these pediatric tumors that have maybe like one or two mutations,

429
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:49,639
and then you have breast cancer and lung cancer and these epithelial tumors that commonly target adults that have that look like a train wreck,

430
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:57,470
that have thousands of mutations. But what drives a lot of pediatric tumors are these epigenetic processes.

431
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:07,490
Carcinogens can also be epi mutations, so they can cause epigenetic changes that predispose to tumor formation.

432
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:15,230
And at least in a mouse model, we're not fully sure if this occurs in humans at this point,

433
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:22,940
but at least in a mouse model of you can introduce an EPI mutation that's sufficient to induce cancer in mice.

434
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,880
So there is a great deal of cross-talk between genetics and epigenetics.

435
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,450
You really can't separate one or the other out when you're talking about cancer.

436
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,350
Yeah, this is like kind of touching on the colon cancer point.

437
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:47,259
But like African-Americans have been asked to get like colon cancer screenings earlier, like 35 instead of 40,

438
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:54,999
which is the normal age as have been found to be like a genetic predisposition to getting colon cancer at a younger age.

439
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,820
Or is that more of like an epigenetic factor, like an increase of cortisol because of environmental factors or something like that?

440
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:07,780
Yeah. Yeah. You know, I'm not my area of expertize isn't in colon cancer, but from what I understand,

441
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:14,259
there are hypotheses in both areas that there's potentially some genetic predisposition that

442
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:19,230
isn't fully understood at this point and that there's also potentially a genetic factor or sorry,

443
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,100
environmental factors that that play a role there.

444
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:33,580
But there's almost certainly some sort of epigenetic underpinning to that as well, because, again, it's really hard to separate the two out.

445
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:40,420
But what drives that that predisposition, we don't fully understand at this point.

446
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,700
But yeah, and there's a lot of you know,

447
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:54,249
there's there are differences between males and females in the risk of cancers and in the effects of environment.

448
00:49:54,250 --> 00:50:03,820
And also different different, you know, populations of people, depending on their genetic background, also differ as well.

449
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,090
Yeah. The other questions.

450
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:20,210
So there's cross-talk between epigenetics and genetics in the context of normal differentiation, normal development, and also in cancer.

451
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:33,440
So for example. You can get a genetic mutation that results in alteration of an epigenetic enzyme that can reprogram the epigenome.

452
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:41,579
Similarly, you can get a changes in DNA methylation or histone modifications,

453
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:51,960
changes in non-coding RNA that can affect the stability of the genome, resulting in genome instability and more gene mutations.

454
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:59,550
And so there's this interplay between these two processes that that plays a role in cancer development.

455
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,500
And the reason that DNA methylation, like if you disrupt DNA methylation,

456
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:12,670
you get genomic stability is because genome DNA methylation in the gene body,

457
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:20,650
you know, outside of promoter regions of genes plays a role in repression of repetitive elements.

458
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:29,380
It represses expression of repetitive elements, retro transposons that can jump around in the genome and disrupt,

459
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,090
you know, turn on genes that shouldn't be on and that type of thing.

460
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:39,160
And so DNA methylation plays a really important role in maintaining genome stability.

461
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:44,980
So again, genetics and epigenetics are kind of interrelated processes.

462
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:55,580
In the context of normal life in a cancer. A lot of drugs that target the epigenome, as I mentioned, are used as cancer therapies.

463
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,180
These include DNA hyperventilating agents.

464
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,890
And these, as you might expect from the name target DNA methylation.

465
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:14,690
This includes the drug, the site of being, and this is approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in the UK.

466
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:24,919
I will say that epigenetic agents, we've had more we as sort of the scientific community in general have had more success

467
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:30,920
in developing epigenetic agents that target blood cancers compared to solid tumors.

468
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:34,850
But this is still very much an area of research interest.

469
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:46,610
It's still METHYLTRANSFERASE inhibitors are another class of class of drugs that are being developed to treat various cancers,

470
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:53,010
and they target histone methylation. I apologize.

471
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:53,980
Make sure it's a little dry.

472
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:03,630
So these include, for example, there's a histone methyltransferase called SDH two that's hyper activated in a lot of tumor types.

473
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:14,010
And inhibitors of this histone methyltransferase are in clinical trials for select hematologic and and solid malignancies.

474
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:24,479
And then one of the inhibitors that I worked with when I was studying Ewing Sarcoma are we found that this complex,

475
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:32,940
this histone methyltransferase Mallow which partners with this scaffolding protein called men and it's this big

476
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:39,060
multi protein complex a lot of these epigenetic modifying complexes do kind of following these big complexes.

477
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:48,930
We actually found that this male all men in complex is hyperactive in Ewing Sarcoma and that we could use

478
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:55,140
inhibitors that block the interaction between these two proteins and it would kill the Ewing sarcoma cells.

479
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:04,800
Obviously you can it's very easy to kill cells in a culture dish and it's easy ish to cure tumors in mice.

480
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,979
But it's very difficult to a lot of the drugs that effectively cure tumors in mice or

481
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:17,040
here kill cancer cells in a cell culture dish are completely ineffective in humans.

482
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:25,260
And so that's another area that that people are trying to develop more effective therapies.

483
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:33,020
More effective means of translating therapies from the cell culture dish to the patient.

484
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,400
So cancers acquire several hallmarks.

485
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:48,290
And if you are interested in cancer, I would recommend you check out this review by Carnahan and Weinberg.

486
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,390
It's been cited thousands and thousands of times in the literature.

487
00:54:52,400 --> 00:55:00,680
It's one of the most well, it's probably one of the most famous cancer papers in the recent in the last 20 years.

488
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,980
They also have a second paper which all show some additional hallmarks that they have reviewed.

489
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:14,840
And essentially, this breaks down the various the various molecular hallmarks of cancer.

490
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,770
So the cells are able to sustain their proliferative signaling.

491
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:25,280
So normally cells, you know, a hormone binds to a receptor on a cell.

492
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:30,500
That receptor then activates a pathway inside the cell downstream of it.

493
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:38,630
That results in the proliferation of that cell. And without that hormonal factor telling that cell to proliferate, it won't proliferate.

494
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,760
At least that's what happens in a normal cell.

495
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:49,350
But in a cancer cell, they develop the ability through various molecular mechanisms, to proliferate without needing the hormone.

496
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:54,770
So they'll just keep on growing no matter what. That's the process of sustaining proliferative signaling.

497
00:55:55,490 --> 00:56:00,410
They're also able to evade growth suppressors. And this is sort of the the yin and yang of that.

498
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:08,480
They there are normal molecular signals that tell a cell like, hey, it's time to stop growing.

499
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:15,620
And they're like, now we're just going. Keep on going. Activating invasion and metastasis pathways.

500
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:25,280
As I mentioned, there are a number of pathways that need to be turned on that allow these cells to invade through the stroma,

501
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:31,070
get into the bloodstream, travel to a distant site and colonize that distant site.

502
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:38,400
They're able to replicate, enabling replicative immortality.

503
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:44,329
So essentially, they're able to just keep on replicating nonstop normal cells in the body.

504
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:51,110
Will, after proliferating so many times, will reach senescence,

505
00:56:51,860 --> 00:57:02,389
which is a process where they just sort of stop proliferating and they can stay there in a in a senescent state or eventually undergo ptosis.

506
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:10,250
But cells, normal cells in the body, have mechanisms that keep them from proliferating indefinitely, but not cancer cells.

507
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,080
Cancer is also need to be able to induce angiogenesis.

508
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:22,970
And so let's say you have a tumor that's growing in your colon and the tumor is getting bigger and bigger.

509
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:28,250
Those cells like that are inside the the core of that tumor are going to become blood

510
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:32,300
starved pretty quickly unless they develop the ability to recruit blood vessels.

511
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:39,220
And so that's one of the mechanisms that they that they develop to survive.

512
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,510
Survive is to bring in more blood flow and nutrients.

513
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,700
And then, of course, they resist cell death.

514
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:59,670
This paper came out in 2011 by the same the same two scientists where they talk about the next generation of cancer hallmarks.

515
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:08,850
And these include tumor promoting inflammation, genome instability and mutations.

516
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,590
And these are factors that enable tumor formation.

517
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:20,340
And then there's also these emerging hallmarks, including avoiding immune destruction.

518
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:25,500
And so there are a number of cancer types, for example, melanoma,

519
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,260
where there are drugs that are then that are effective for some types of melanoma

520
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:40,380
that can allow enable the immune system to attack the cancer and destroy it.

521
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:49,380
Normally, if you have a cancer, a malignant cell, your immune system can often recognize it and and target it.

522
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:53,880
But what happens in some cancer types is the cells develop the ability.

523
00:58:54,390 --> 00:59:03,240
There are molecules that tell the immune system to stand down like, hey, I'm okay, you don't need to attack me.

524
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:09,059
Cancers hijack that. And they tell the immune system to stand down.

525
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:14,640
So the immune system no longer attacks that cancer cell and they're able to avoid immune destruction.

526
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:18,120
And so there are therapies, again, as I mentioned,

527
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:26,340
that are being developed to research this process and allow the immune system to once again recognize these cancers and attack them.

528
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,770
And then a second emerging hallmark is deregulating cellular energetics.

529
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:43,350
This is an area that I didn't touch on today, but it's very, very cool and interesting topic in my in in my opinion.

530
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:53,480
We found in Ewing Sarcoma, for example, that Ewing Sarcoma tumors hijacked hijack the Syrian biosynthesis pathway.

531
00:59:53,490 --> 01:00:01,410
So a lot of tumors will reprogram their metabolism in a way that provides them with more growth factors for rapid proliferation,

532
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:12,149
that minimizes oxidative stress and that allows them to acquire what they need without necessarily

533
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:19,680
having to go through the the oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain and everything.

534
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:25,020
And that's a whole area. Cancer metabolism is a huge exploding area of research,

535
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:30,419
and there are also drugs that are being developed that target different amino acid synthesis pathways,

536
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:34,770
for example, that are hijacked in cancer like serine biosynthesis, as I mentioned.

537
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:44,670
And so that deregulating cellular energetics is a is an emerging hallmark and a really interesting and very,

538
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,800
very exploding area of research on cancer.

539
01:00:52,200 --> 01:01:05,250
So cancer, whether it's in adult cancer or especially in a pediatric cancer, is characterized by hijacking of normal developmental pathways and so on.

540
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:11,460
And you have in adults, you have a population of stem and progenitor cells in various tissues in the body.

541
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:18,540
And certainly during embryonic development and these stem and progenitor cells start to

542
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:25,950
differentiate and they become they acquire the properties of various differentiated tissues.

543
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:33,360
But what happens is often during this process of progression from the stem and progenitor cells to a differentiated tissue,

544
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:42,360
you can acquire genetic mutations or epigenetic deregulation that can put you on the pathway to a malignant tumor.

545
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:56,300
And. So in the context of hijacking normal development, that includes upregulation of normal developmental pathways, like when notch hedgehog.

546
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:04,880
If you get into any developmental biology, these are pathways that are just canonical developmental pathways and they're often mutated in cancer.

547
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:16,160
It allows the cells to proliferate extensively. They hijack invasion programs like the epithelium in zinc camel transition.

548
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:25,340
I should note that these pathways that allow tissues to cells to invade and migrate are really important for normal development.

549
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:34,940
And then they become hijacked in cancer. And these developmental pathways are also I mean, obviously,

550
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:42,200
we need to be able to recruit the growth of blood vessels for various tissues in our body during development.

551
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:49,250
And cancer cells hijack these pathways, initiating the growth of new blood vessels.

552
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:54,280
And hijacking of development is especially true in the context of pediatric tumors.

553
01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:02,800
As I'll touch on, I'm an understanding developmental biology helps in understanding cancer biology and vice versa.

554
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:15,340
So. This just provides another kind of illustration of how you have your normal development over here.

555
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:24,220
Your normal pathways of stem cell differentiation and these developmental pathways can become hijacked and cancer.

556
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:31,900
And so you have embryonic stem cells that are taken from the blastocyst that can be removed

557
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:38,170
and grown in culture and differentiated into different types of cells in the body.

558
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:46,780
And there it is of great interest to use these stem cell derived cells to regenerate tissues,

559
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:53,920
develop organs and tissues ex vivo, and use them to repair damaged tissues in the body.

560
01:03:55,060 --> 01:04:03,250
And then there's also stem cells that can be derived from various tissue types that can be reprogramed into induced pluripotent stem cells.

561
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:11,980
These are the types of cells that I work with that our research team works with that can also be differentiated into different cell types in the body.

562
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:16,180
But in cancer, you have adult in certain adult tissues.

563
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:23,740
For example, the epithelium, there are stem cells that are there to repopulate the normal.

564
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:31,180
So like the epithelium of the colon is turning over constantly and you need to be able to repopulate that epithelial epithelium.

565
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:36,129
And so you have these stem cells that that are responsible for that,

566
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:43,060
that can then differentiate into new epithelial cells and then repair the linings of various organs.

567
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:48,460
But they can develop these various genetic alterations and undergo malignant transformation.

568
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:59,049
And there are these cell types called cancer stem cells that are particularly nasty in the context of cancer because they

569
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:09,310
can acquire the ability to self-renewal similar to a stem cell and give rise to multiple different cancer cell types.

570
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,980
And the cancer stem cells in particular are not the most frequent cell type in a tumor,

571
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,059
but they are the most difficult in terms of targeting therapeutically,

572
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:25,120
because they are they are relatively slower proliferating and they're more they're less

573
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:30,670
sensitive to cytotoxic therapies that that people normally receive in the clinic.

574
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,390
And so there's a lot of this isn't my area of expertize.

575
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:41,049
Dr. Cassino does a lot of work with cancer stem cells, but there's a lot of interest in targeting cancer stem cells,

576
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:50,380
in particular for cancer therapies, because they have this ability to to evade therapy and also see new tumors in the body.

577
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:58,130
So how do cancers and kids differ from those in adults?

578
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:10,839
Pediatric tumors really are developmental diseases in that you have different cell types, different stem cell types.

579
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,430
During early development, you have neural stem cells, neural crest, stem cells,

580
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:21,400
mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells.

581
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,500
And each of these cell types gives rise to different tissues in the body.

582
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:30,790
So neural stem cells in neural stem cells give rise to nervous system tissue.

583
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:38,170
And then the mesenchymal stem cells give rise to bones, muscle, connective tissue,

584
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:46,180
and then hematopoietic lineage, hematopoietic stem cells give rise to the metabolic lineage, normal blood cells.

585
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:53,470
But if there is some mutation that occurs in this process of differentiation of these different cell types,

586
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:56,320
you can get different malignancies like brain tumors.

587
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:04,030
If you have a hit in neural cross stem cells or mesenchymal stem cells that can give rise to Ewing's sarcoma,

588
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:08,800
neuroblastoma has a neural neural cross stem cell origin.

589
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:16,660
And then there's also other other mutations that can give rise to osteosarcoma,

590
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:26,830
rhabdomyosarcoma and then the different the very common pediatric but also adult malignancies adults get AML in particular.

591
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:31,630
Have any of you known somebody who's had cancer as a kid?

592
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:39,700
So there's always a couple of people. And so it's extremely rare, but it's certainly not unheard of.

593
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:48,430
I had a college sweet mate who had osteosarcoma, and she actually had had to have like part of her shoulder removed.

594
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:52,749
She had osteosarcoma when she was like right at the end of high school and she

595
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,710
was in remission and was able to start her freshman year at Michigan State.

596
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:05,600
Back in the day when I was in college and she relapsed during during our freshman year and ended up passing away.

597
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:15,340
So again, it's not unheard of, even though, thank goodness, it's pretty rare, but it's still quite devastating.

598
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:28,850
This is a figure from 2019 looking at cancer incidence and mortality for children ages 0 to 19 years.

599
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:34,420
And you can see that. As a scientific community in general.

600
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:44,020
In the last 30 years or so, we have made significant strides in treatment, a lot of a lot of these cancers resulting in reduced mortality.

601
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,379
But interestingly and disturbingly,

602
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:56,350
the incidence of pediatric cancers and sort of steadily been increasing over the last couple of decades in particular.

603
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,450
And we don't really understand why that is.

604
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:11,200
Again, it's probably a combination of it's probably you know, our genetic background hasn't changed that quickly, but our environment certainly has.

605
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,419
So there are probably some environmental factors here.

606
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:22,270
And again, because of some of the things that we talked about in terms of the ability to get tissue samples, how rare pediatric tumors are,

607
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:28,150
it's very difficult to understand what the underlying factors here that are driving this increased incidence.

608
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,910
But the trend from 1992 to 2016 was statistically significant.

609
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:43,840
I always find this pretty disturbing that cancer is a leading cause of death by disease among U.S. children up to age 15,

610
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:47,710
only accidents and injury caused more deaths in children.

611
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:54,489
And once you get to the adolescent phase, especially now suicides, that really become a problem,

612
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:59,110
especially in the last several years, there's been a spike in adolescent suicides.

613
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:08,120
There's approximately 11,000 new cases of pediatric cancer diagnosed annually in children in the U.S. and worldwide.

614
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:16,880
The incidences even far greater. And so one in roughly one in 330 individuals is diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20.

615
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:25,440
But when you talk about cancer in kids versus cancer in adults, this is not your grandparents disease.

616
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:29,000
When you have when you think about adult tumors,

617
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:39,020
you think about epithelial tumors or tumors that occur in that outer lining of particular organs in the breast and the prostate and in the liver,

618
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:43,190
in the in the colon.

619
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:50,809
But in kids, they're more mesenchymal in nature, or they have a neural stem cell neural crest.

620
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:53,840
STEM cell origin story to keep you convinced you're behind me.

621
01:10:55,430 --> 01:11:01,700
So if you look at the different types of cancers in kids, most commonly it's leukemia,

622
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:07,160
but also some of these bone and soft tissue tumors and lymphomas.

623
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,700
And then there are brain tumors that also occur in kids.

624
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:12,620
But the brain tumors are also different.

625
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:20,480
The brain tumors tend to occur in like in the lower brain, whereas in adult and in adults you see things like glioblastoma.

626
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:26,270
In children it's more medulloblastoma and these different tumor types.

627
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:31,280
So so the brain tumors are are different in adults versus kids.

628
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:44,220
And so why do people get cancer? And in kids in particular, it's likely a combination of genetic, epigenetic, environmental and behavioral factors.

629
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:53,940
And the president's cancer panel stated in 2010 that the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.

630
01:11:54,930 --> 01:12:01,770
And identifying the environmental contributors to childhood cancer prevents presents significant challenges.

631
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:04,840
And why why is that one of these?

632
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:08,460
One of the reasons that I mentioned is that these cancers are super rare.

633
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:21,990
And so you can imagine that if you have a, well, Ewing sarcoma, for example, how many one in is it like one in.

634
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,840
3 million. To remember the specific.

635
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:31,280
It's extremely rare. So you can imagine that if you have a cancer that is that rare.

636
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:38,600
How do you do an epidemiologic study to actually figure out what an environmental contributor is to that cancer?

637
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:43,270
It's difficult now. It's not that rare.

638
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:49,640
It's two to 2 to 3 per million. That's what the Ewing sarcoma, its statistics are.

639
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,990
And a lot of pediatric cancers roughly have those types of incidence rates.

640
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:59,480
But that's still it's still pretty rare and it still makes it difficult to do an epidemiologic study.

641
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:06,500
There's a limited availability of tissue samples. A lot of these tumors have biological heterogeneity.

642
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:12,320
That makes it difficult. Case control studies are often subject to recall bias.

643
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:18,890
So you can imagine that if you have a mom and a dad and they come in and their baby has leukemia,

644
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,260
they're going to be more likely to recall, oh, you know,

645
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:30,020
I had a glass of alcohol and I didn't know what I was I didn't know I was pregnant yet or gosh, you know,

646
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:36,620
I worked in this factory and I was exposed all these chemicals and I don't really could this had been the case.

647
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:42,440
Whereas if you have a parent of a healthy child, that's their child's healthy.

648
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:47,210
So they're not going to be like inclined to think of all these horrible things that they could have been exposed to.

649
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:53,090
And it's difficult. Like if you have a if you have a pediatric cancer in particular,

650
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:57,410
or some of these adult tumors where we think that there's potentially in a developmental origin,

651
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:04,340
it's difficult to go back and know, like what your mother or your grandmother was exposed to, let alone what you were exposed to.

652
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:12,640
And so when we talk about, like all the differences, the different types of cancer, it can occur like in a child, for example.

653
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:18,460
Is it like one toxic? It usually leads to like one type of cancer or is it like one toxic?

654
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:23,450
It can lead to like four or five, depending on the genetic dispositions of that kid.

655
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,390
That makes sense. Yeah.

656
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:34,670
And then it's just difficult at this point to know what the environmental contributors are to two pediatric cancers in particular.

657
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,570
So I don't know if I can really answer that at this point.

658
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:49,520
Yeah. Like. One of the one of the best characterized contributors to pediatric cancer would be like benzene, exposure and leukemia.

659
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,830
That's really just leukemia that that it causes.

660
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:01,399
I don't know that it causes other cancer types, but it's possible that that a single exposure could cause multiple different types of cancers.

661
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:07,210
But again, it's just the fact that they're so rare and so difficult to study that it makes it hard to tell for sure.

662
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:17,750
Yeah. And I think, you know, that what's alarming is probably more than this at this point.

663
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,420
I don't remember when I got the statistic is a couple of years old,

664
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:24,770
80,000 chemicals on the market in the U.S. Most of them have not been thoroughly studied.

665
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:32,510
So we sort of have this innocent until proven guilty way of thinking about chemicals and in this country.

666
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,750
Potential environmental triggers, particularly for childhood cancers.

667
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,250
There's no clear, common, toxic or environmental cause.

668
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:53,540
They could be prenatal or postnatal, but some factors such as tobacco, smoke, pesticides, traffic, pollution, paints and solvents.

669
01:15:53,570 --> 01:16:02,660
Interestingly, there's been some associations with leukemia outbreaks and certain like viral outbreaks.

670
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:10,460
There's been a few leukemia clusters that have occurred secondary to a swine flu outbreak, for example.

671
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:17,600
And this is believed to be so so a lot of cancers like like pediatric leukemias.

672
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:23,870
One, they may have one genetic hit that occurs in utero, and then a second hit is necessary,

673
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:33,950
such as some something goes awry with the immune response to it, to a flu, for example, that can that can bring on leukemia.

674
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,760
Maternal alcohol consumption, chemotherapy, all of the classic carcinogens,

675
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:47,090
ionizing radiation and UV exposure, certainly skin cancers in young people.

676
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:53,600
I hope that tanning salons are not as popular in your generation as they were when I was in college.

677
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,650
In high school. Yeah.

678
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,010
So it looks like we're just a couple of minutes. I'll just finish the slide and then.

679
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:15,350
And then we'll be done. And this is one example where there was an established link between a prenatal exposure and a cancer in young people.

680
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,180
Vaginal cancers are extremely rare, especially in teenagers and young adults.

681
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:29,690
But there was a cluster of rare vaginal clare, cell carcinomas and teenage girls and they eventually linked those to prenatal estrogen exposure.

682
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:39,650
And this was due to Diablo Sylvestre All, which is a classic toxicant that you'll hear about in the context of environmental health studies.

683
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:53,180
And it was prescribed to women and from 1938 to 1971 and to prevent pre-term labor and other complications during pregnancy.

684
01:17:53,960 --> 01:18:00,290
And yeah, it resulted in, in several cancers and young women.

685
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,770
And then there are various genetic triggers that I wrote.

686
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:17,450
I'll go ahead and leave off here. But I basically this was the last slide of the of the lecture just breaking down

687
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:21,020
some of the various environmental factors that we know contribute to cancer.

688
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:30,740
Interestingly, tobacco's huge, as you might expect, but there's a very large range that could potentially be due to diet.

689
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:35,810
And this is, I think, an interesting area as well. Yeah.

690
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:46,100
I'd like a quick question. Yeah. For the increase in childhood cancers in that I think early 2010 or 2016 period,

691
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:50,510
is there have been any showing that that has been related to like failings in

692
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:55,190
infrastructure like in the previous years leading to an increase in childhood cancers?

693
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:02,150
I'm thinking like lead paint like in 50 year old buildings that might correspond to like the increase around that time,

694
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:08,790
like other changes in like policy related to infrastructure that sort of like showed aftereffects.

695
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:12,890
An increase of childhood cancer was a really no correlation that we're seeing.

696
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,899
I don't know I don't know if anybody has looked at that at that at this point.

697
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:24,260
But that's a really interesting point is. Yeah, what about what about our infrastructure and how that that might be contributing to that?

698
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:30,170
And again, because of this latency thing, it's really difficult to determine cause and effect.

699
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,670
I'm not sure if anybody looking at it is definitely an interesting question.

700
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:39,740
Yeah. All right. Thank you all so much for your attention.

701
01:19:39,860 --> 01:20:02,569
You know, Tribune email will if you have any questions I might ask you just because I feel like I have a good day in office, I really think that time.

702
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:06,290
But it's like, thanks again so much.

703
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:11,860
Yeah, that's really great.
