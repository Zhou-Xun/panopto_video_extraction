1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:14,760
Not to eat. All right, I'll.

2
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:26,580
Started in the second half of the start.

3
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:43,380
I want to mention a little bit more about the losses, at least in the marketplace, and got to or at least had to get started with using cotton,

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:57,870
because I think a lot of women come up with an idea of starting how it works and then when it's in the future, it's a little place to start.

5
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,940
Would you like to use this one today?

6
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,010
I think it's the only thing after this final assignment.

7
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:16,260
So let's do on Sunday, the end of the day, Sunday, another madness.

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,779
This will last close for 5 minutes or so.

9
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,410
A lot of information.

10
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,480
Think about. Oh, well.

11
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,390
So we're going to be reviewing this 19 downline.

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:52,020
The data set in 1977 and focusing on the details of density and density has just been released a smoother

13
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,810
version of existing around roughly think of it as an estimate of kind of a distribution function,

14
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,960
almost like a continuous, continuous variable.

15
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:13,380
So this dense at least if you're using based on density is kind of a function of the type of.

16
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,410
Yeah, yeah. Very.

17
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:28,590
Do you think that this is what it's doing, a combination of a histogram and density plot.

18
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,230
I mean the same thing in the same thing here.

19
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,040
So I didn't want to talk about the box, but I'm saying that.

20
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,450
So basically box plots,

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:52,770
I think it's one useful way to display the distribution of a continuous variable across different levels of a categorical variable.

22
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:01,590
If you have something like four pages, maybe a continuous variable and you want to get,

23
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:09,080
you might see distribution might vary across treatment groups, for example, a nice way of displaying that is is a box plotter.

24
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,620
I need a collection of box plots on a on the same thing.

25
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:20,790
That's why I usually use a box. So basically at least the default box plot for R is the following.

26
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:34,410
These once box plots do this sort of charge a slightly modified version of this and in some cases basically for a box by the box in the middle,

27
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:42,240
that's basically going from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile for that variable.

28
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:52,860
So basically the bottom of the box, the height of that represents the 25th percentile and kind of the top of the box is the 75th percentile.

29
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,480
There's like a line in the middle of the box that's roughly the middle of the box that's represents the median.

30
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:12,660
And then you have basically. If you have outliers, at least according to this criterion, it'll kind of display those individual data points.

31
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:23,300
Those are basically points that are more than 1.5 times the IQ are greater than the 75th percentile.

32
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:36,470
And similarly, 25.5 IQ are less than 25% difference between the 45th and 75th percentile.

33
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,400
And those lines are called whiskers.

34
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:50,450
They go from either the top and the bottom of the box from from the top of the box,

35
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:59,930
from the 75th percentile, which is the smallest or is the largest non outlying data point.

36
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:08,270
And that's that's all the components of a box plot, at least the whole box plot an arm.

37
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,660
So this would be within a box, but a life expectancy, this looks like what you do in an hour.

38
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:27,190
You can just give it at least for a single box plot. All you have to give it is a very accurate kind of single bottom line here in the Middle East,

39
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:37,010
the median of the 75th percentile here on the 25th percentile.

40
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,250
So there's no outline, at least according to this definition of an outlier.

41
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,750
There are no outliers in this list. There are outliers.

42
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:55,610
You're going to plot some points. There would be some extra points either here or up here.

43
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,470
So there's no outliers for this very is the fourth tier.

44
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,390
And so if you want to add a white label and title, it's kind of the same.

45
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:16,370
You find out how many of this kind of same plot in our five functions.

46
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Well, here's just another example. So here's an example where we do have outliers.

47
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:32,090
So you can see here there's three or three outlying points.

48
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,600
So this is kind of what it looks like. There are outliers.

49
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,360
Another thing that I noticed about this figure,

50
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:50,780
it's kind of it's not like the distribution of the it's variable is not symmetric around the with of a lot of the data

51
00:06:50,780 --> 00:07:02,450
points are in this type of range in a small range in that there's an equal number of data points over this margin range.

52
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:13,760
Okay. So usually when you see something like that, at least if it does get non-negative variable, usually the log transformation works pretty well.

53
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:21,500
So if you want to do that, you can just take the log factor itself and the box part of that.

54
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:32,130
So here the butterfly looks pretty nice and symmetric and there's actually no there's no outliers in logging.

55
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:45,090
All right. So I think that's just the basic argument, which you just basically to make it work, you just have to give it a numeric vector of data.

56
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:55,880
I'd say this this kind of setup is probably more useful, at least it's kind of I use something like this a lot,

57
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,459
basically where you have a continuous variable or that you want to look at how

58
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,550
the distribution changes across different levels of some categorical vector.

59
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,910
So that's an example of this.

60
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:17,600
Here is where we have GDP per capita or or low GDP per capita if we want to display out of distributions varies across different continents,

61
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:26,330
typically the continents. Okay let's let's do this for each undefined comprehensive data set.

62
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,060
Now you do that. All you have to do is kind of this tilde notation.

63
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,250
Give the name of the variable on the left hand side.

64
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,020
That's kind of the thing that will be on the y axis, the log of GDP per capita,

65
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:55,429
and then the categorical variable and I'm on the right hand side and repeat the name of that dataframe first with the dollar sign,

66
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,670
or just put the names of the variables and then the name of the dataframe with this data.

67
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:19,300
Okay. So that's. So this is basically how you to do a box plot where we have to display something different across different levels of a category.

68
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:32,380
Okay. I just wanted a quick exercise if we wanted to make like a scatterplot of life expectancy versus GDP per capita.

69
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:45,340
And how to do that with two panels on the same figures with a regression line with the scatter plot points.

70
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:55,090
So the way you do this with like base R is this you basically it's really you're modifying the graphical parameters.

71
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,370
So this is really modifying the graphical parameters before you go and plot.

72
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:08,680
You know, if you do this math row and you get a few of these will be displayed.

73
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:15,499
So this is I would interpret this as it's going to display the figures as one row of two columns.

74
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,909
So if you look at this, this kind of figure, this is like one row of two columns.

75
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,960
If you want to have four figures like here, here.

76
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:38,320
And then to the low end, we do two to you want to have six figures with like a three by two format and then for a we will see through the power to.

77
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,670
And so here is actually another thing in which if you want to create just an empty plot,

78
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:54,070
you can type close in on your plot and then you could add points later.

79
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,100
That's an alternative way to do it.

80
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:06,540
So I just added points, which basically if you give it to numeric vectors, it'll create like a scatterplot, which a point.

81
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,719
So basically create is a figure with two panels.

82
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:33,940
And then we have the scatterplot for the 1977 data here and then the scatterplot for the 27 over three feels like, you know, just to put all of the X.

83
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,599
Okay, so I actually applied the same collection of points.

84
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:49,600
So this should be 27 here, but you have the way to do it is the same.

85
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,560
You should replace this with 27. Okay.

86
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:05,469
Okay. And then that way you can just want to add a straight regression line through each like we talked about last time.

87
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:18,160
You can generate a regression using the line function and use this AB line that gives the a line with with this intercept and then the slope.

88
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:28,540
Okay, so let's see. So that's what it looks like if we just do the best fit in the regression line.

89
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:37,920
This is the well, it's really the actually it's this is the 1977 data and that is supposed to be the 2070.

90
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,049
And that's a just kind of a general point. I was going through this exercise.

91
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,660
When you see something like this, it's kind of again, everything is tangled.

92
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:02,440
Distribution and GDP per capita is kind of squished together on the small scale and not as squished together for larger values.

93
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,030
So you see something like that. You also want to do a lot of transforming.

94
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,230
Even sometimes the square root transform works reasonably well.

95
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:22,150
So if we do a log transform, it kind of looks a lot better, or at least it kind of if we're thinking of adding kind of a linear,

96
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:34,480
a straight line, just kind of fits, satisfies the assumptions of a a linear regression a lot more closely than the original GDP per capita.

97
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,850
And it's. Oh yeah.

98
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:51,530
This just adding extra. Usually want to add better labels and my labels and titles and things like that.

99
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,880
Excellent. I mean, so this would be like a I think this is.

100
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,120
Yeah, this would be like, like probably the final version of your graph.

101
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,710
I think this is pretty cool. So.

102
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,640
In for face to face graphics.

103
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,220
I guess we'll just talk a little bit about G plot two to finish up.

104
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,880
So Game Plot two is basically just a just another.

105
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,780
It's an off another R package, but it's probably it's kind of very widely used now.

106
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,309
So a lot of a lot of people use Geechee plot to graphics.

107
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:51,300
So you will see it a lot. Yeah, I would say it's probably the most widely used kind of separate color package for data visualization out there.

108
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,000
So that grade basically stands for grammar of Graphics.

109
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:07,680
It's basically there's this kind of was based on an idea for a specific system for how to construct a flash based,

110
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:20,129
the idea kind of way it sort of forces you to make graphs as as this kind of start with, I guess, an empty plot or a nearly empty plot.

111
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:27,270
And, you know, you're basically adding layers to the plot to kind of get what you want.

112
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,129
And I think I just added an extra reference.

113
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:45,210
I mean, a brief intro, if you want to add a lot of more details throughout the various features of the plot to this is a pretty good reference.

114
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:59,790
Okay. So I think the easiest way to get started with a few examples is to is just to create a basically an empty plot.

115
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,130
So the way to do that is just with the Geechee plot function.

116
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,990
I mean, first you have to kind of install the library as slowly as by using the library and changing plot to.

117
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,670
But the way you can create an empty plot is just plot.

118
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,760
Yeah, just using the things you find funny and using that data, you have to give it a name.

119
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,479
Basically, they're saying that it doesn't show anything on the graph,

120
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:43,830
but that's basically saying that the features of this data frame are going to be what's used to construct the plot once we have an extra thing.

121
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:56,340
So as you'll see in a second, once you set kind of this background, we're going to add various features to the plot based on the the gap finder data.

122
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:09,080
Okay. So I mean, a lot of times you do a lot of these extra things in one step, but I'm just going to walk through kind of hash,

123
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,910
and I think it's a lot clearer if you just kind of add one thing at a time.

124
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,240
So I think probably the first thing you might want to add is just what the the x axis will be targeted is the variable,

125
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,600
the exact variable that's going to be used for the X axis.

126
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:39,270
So this is here is this is not you didn't say which variable is going to be used for the X axis or the Y axis.

127
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,630
So the first thing is to add this A s argument stands for statics.

128
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:53,280
So as an X, there's various things that I think is referred to as esthetics.

129
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:01,319
So one thing is the next what you're going to use for the x axis of all this command is just saying

130
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:09,420
that the variable GDP per capita is going to be the variable used for the x axis of this plot.

131
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:23,820
And you can see here, when we run this, this little thing at least constructs like an excuse for us, but it does give us a label.

132
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,060
But if you want to change the label, you can do labs.

133
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:34,140
That's the thing for juju plot two that allows you to specify the labels for the x the x axis.

134
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,910
So we're just kind of adding different things as we're going along.

135
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,540
Another esthetic as well.

136
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:50,970
Basically the Y variable that we're going to use for the yeah, basically the variable that we're going to use for the Y axis.

137
00:18:52,170 --> 00:19:02,340
So here we're just telling it that this plot is the variable that's going to be used for the y axis is life expectancy.

138
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,400
So you're kind of constructs a plot with this country.

139
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:16,590
Nice line. They go through two sets up the limits for the y axis and the x axis.

140
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,390
At least hold it which variables will be used for the x and y axis?

141
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:37,050
And here again, I was using this lives function and adding a different y label label for the y axis.

142
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,670
Okay. Okay. So here's, here's what you actually are actually plotting actual data.

143
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:54,360
So here you can just add or you can think of it as a layer to the plot where you see this geo underscore point.

144
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:09,600
All that's doing is it's, it's going to do a scatterplot using the technique, using the variables for X and Y axis that we've already already defined.

145
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:17,610
So since we've already defined the variables for the x and y axis are we just have to do this genome plot.

146
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,100
We don't have to give it like an extra three since it already knows that.

147
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,100
It already knows what the x and y variables are.

148
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,670
Okay. Okay. Another esthetic that you add is color.

149
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,560
And so esthetics are things like color of or size or shape of the points.

150
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:53,620
So if we just specify a color is that X usually give it a variable for which to vary the color by.

151
00:20:54,250 --> 00:21:02,050
It's usually a categorical variable or something that could be thought of as a categorical variable.

152
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:11,460
Yeah, I think you can give it a something that's continuous and we'll create like a try to create like a separate color.

153
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:20,319
But I mean most of the time you'll use a color where you have only a handful of colors,

154
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,709
a few colors where the color varies across the levels of this categorical variable.

155
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:36,830
So this is kind of a nice thing to add. We had sometimes you have a different color for each column, okay?

156
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:45,100
And then it kind of automatically will add this little color legend here on the right hand side.

157
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,550
Oh, yeah. Like I said, another esthetic is the point size.

158
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:09,750
So we add an esthetic we this size esthetically a lot of times you want it to be proportional to the values of some numeric variables.

159
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:18,360
So if we want the size of the points to be proportional to the country population, you just have to do size equals population.

160
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,459
And you can see here the size of the points, at least very somewhat on the right hand side.

161
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:35,640
It'll give us a kind of a size, which is at least a little bit helpful to go to kind of size as correspond to.

162
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,240
On fire, 25 million or something like that.

163
00:22:48,330 --> 00:23:02,250
And then another thing is that you have kind of two categorical variations that you want to, I guess, display information about artists,

164
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:13,620
display how the the values of a numeric variable vary across the levels of the combination of two categorical variables.

165
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:25,620
So you can combine a color with with these with with the different panels in that with this extra term a facet group.

166
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,110
Okay. So that will give us a separate plot for each for each year.

167
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:40,829
Okay. So you can see that color varies across country or sorry, combinations within here.

168
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:49,290
So within within each level on here we have we can look at the variability across across continents.

169
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:59,489
So you can see here and we can adjust the way we build these plots is just kind of adding one thing at a time as,

170
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:09,270
as starting from kind of a very basic plot and we'll get additional features from your data.

171
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,370
So we did this kind of one at a time. We added these esthetics one at a time.

172
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,479
You can, you know, for some things,

173
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:27,450
I think it's it's a little bit easier if we just kind of combine these into a single step, like if you want to add the.

174
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,240
The X axis or y axis information and the company information.

175
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:39,160
At the same time, you can just put all of those and the esthetic function, okay.

176
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,940
As long as you specify kind of which esthetic you're referring to, like color versus size,

177
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:53,410
and then you can include the like the x axis labels in a single labs function.

178
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,840
All right. Okay. It's mostly finished.

179
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:09,940
So, oh, here's just a little bit of a thing about how you can make a histogram reducing plot, too.

180
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:19,929
So I think this is this is kind of a basic scatterplot with different plotting, different levels of our scatterplot.

181
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:26,770
So a scatterplot has basically two main variables that you're interested in with the x and y axis.

182
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:35,049
For a histogram, it's a little bit different. You only have only have in a sense, there's kind of only one variable that you're looking at.

183
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:43,300
You're going to have one variable that corresponds to the x axis.

184
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:51,370
Okay? So what you can do is, is kind of at least the way you start out is a little bit similar.

185
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:03,819
Again, I do a plots to kind of create a an empty graph and I can tell it what variable I want to be on the x axis.

186
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:12,070
So this will be like the excess x axis for the histogram so we don't have any kind of one extra thing.

187
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:19,120
And then the way you are constructed, histogram is just going to underscore histogram.

188
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,700
So that first scatter plot is just point histogram.

189
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,500
And then since we've already told it, which variable will be on the x axis?

190
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,649
We don't really have to do the extra argument for just the genome of the store.

191
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,210
Histogram with the empty nothing in the parentheses.

192
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:57,790
Okay, so I was just about done with just a few extra features you might want to change.

193
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:02,560
Like the bandwidth is basically how how wide these little intervals are.

194
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:14,890
If you want to change that, there are kind of few arguments in the genome histogram function that you can change.

195
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:23,560
So if you want to change the bandwidth and just do bandwidth equals something bigger, I just define the bandwidth as that.

196
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,909
So BW has the range of the data divided by 40.

197
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:39,280
So we have about 20 intervals and the bandwidth will look something like this, but it's a little bit wider than that.

198
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:46,749
And then the default was, yeah, there's other arguments that you can add.

199
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,910
I mean, we can't really remember all of them.

200
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,010
And sometimes when you're constructing these types of graph,

201
00:27:54,010 --> 00:28:01,210
you can look at the documentation for a genome histogram just to see what options are available.

202
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,990
Something you might want to change is like the color that's filled in for these hours.

203
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,130
I've done that here. I've filled everything in with white.

204
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,309
I think for me, like the edges of the bar, all you have to do is do this color argument.

205
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,880
So maybe the edges of these bars are are black.

206
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,270
Choose something else. Yeah.

207
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,570
These are other things.

208
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,160
Oh, this was just. Okay, so I've just changed the x axis and y axis labels with labs.

209
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:58,730
You can change the font size of using this so that we have the same function with the axis titles and for both X and Y.

210
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:15,570
You don't have to remember the exact syntax, but you just put it this just so you're aware of kind of what to use to change the font sizes and sets.

211
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,170
Oh yeah. I think this is basically the last one.

212
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:31,710
And finding a histogram with a density function is a little bit easier with changing plot to y compared to reason.

213
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:39,600
All you have to do is just add this extra genome density which you don't even have to give it an R if you wanted to have certain.

214
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:50,520
If you want it to look a certain way, there may be extra arguments that you can add if you just want a basic and a density plot on top.

215
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,720
Here's the ground. All you have to do is just add this to density.

216
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:11,100
Okay? You come along. Maybe I'll just let's say on the show how to make a fox.

217
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:17,140
So but the Fox plot, it's actually pretty similar.

218
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:21,760
You just create an empty plot like we had before with good plot.

219
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:27,579
And then you might you add your esthetics for just telling all this is just telling

220
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,350
you which variables will be on the x axis and which variables will be on the y axis.

221
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,650
So this is saying cotton actually on the x axis of GDP per capita will be on the y axis.

222
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:46,210
Once you have that, you just have to have G on box plot to automatically do this in a nice box plot.

223
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,490
I mean, there are extra arguments you can add if you want to have a certain color or something like that.

224
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,580
But if you just use it like this, it will create a pretty nice box.

225
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,090
This is basically kind of the same box plot that we had before at the beginning.

226
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:09,340
Okay. So these are these are just doing the same thing to change the font sizes and things like that.

227
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,150
Extra features to change. Get the font size is a figure which.

228
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:26,889
Oh yeah. So I think we'll stop there. But yeah, let's just do the I just mentioned an alternative to Fox Sports,

229
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:36,879
which is something that is probably more popular recently, a little older, and that's bio and plots basically for a violent plot.

230
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,320
And it's kind of just it basically displays the same type of information,

231
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,760
but it's a little bit the same type of information as a box player and stuff.

232
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:56,680
But it's, it's, it's it's just a little bit more so the way the box plot, um, sorry, a violent plot should work.

233
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:06,100
So for each level of the categorical variable, you're supposed to interpret this as kind of a density each.

234
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,230
Like if you look at it from this on this direction,

235
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:20,530
this is like the density of the data for the Americas kind of there's this is where most of the data is coming out.

236
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:27,610
And there's maybe one data point out here, you know, if you look at you're out there any one or two data points here,

237
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:36,159
but kind of most of it's here in Asia is kind of I guess the middle is about here, but it's kind of spread out a lot.

238
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:51,940
The data is spread out long enough. So it's just an alternative to what's the situation where you want to use plots or violent plots is on

239
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:59,109
the which is kind of whatever you prefer and satellite plot and it's basically all the same thing.

240
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:05,410
You just use the G on your square, violent rather than a giant underscore box plot.

241
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:21,790
Yeah, I, I think that that concludes our own image.

242
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:34,320
I guess we can use to use this for technical assistance.

243
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:45,970
And I'm just saying, if you remove Oceana's the ocean in the U.S., it's on the Australian beaches and these things violate policy.

244
00:33:48,070 --> 00:34:00,960
So the point is, that's why it has to be question number 42,

245
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:13,280
which is so the quiz is basically the last thing for today, which is just remember that the the, the final yeah.

246
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,659
The final is due on Wednesday.

247
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,230
On Sunday.
