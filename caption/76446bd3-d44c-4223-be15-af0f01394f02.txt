1
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:25,130
So said it fact. All right.

2
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,810
No. We're going to get started.

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,840
Hello. How are you all doing today? All right.

4
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,630
Welcome to Week three. I can't believe we just started already did more with three time this morning.

5
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,720
So we'll go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:52,470
I will start off with some announcements and then talk about our plan for today and then start with the lighter slides.

7
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,780
So the first announcement here for today is that the vital statistics exercise key has been posted.

8
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,340
Take a look. If you have any questions or if there's anything that's not clear,

9
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:11,690
please stop by our office hours or you can email us and then we can help you with any clarifications.

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:19,480
Back later. Question three There's really no key because, you know, it depends on which outcome you select.

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,040
But if you once like, step by step, walk through the process.

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:34,879
Please reach out and you'll be happy to help me with that. So the leader from the session from last week is available,

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,850
and that's for anybody who wants to go back and review everything or for those of you who are not in class that's available for you to use.

14
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:54,169
So last week we announced that we'll be helpful if you don't already have stuff on your computer to test connecting the voter sites,

15
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,780
or if you have already done that because you had to do so for another class, that would be great.

16
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,460
If not, I recommend that you try the process beforehand.

17
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:14,090
If you have any questions, reach out. But it would just be helpful to be sure that you were able to access that about a virtual science.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,330
Just a heads up was one. We're opening next week, Tuesday after class, and it's due on Friday.

19
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,330
So you can open the quiz. You can refer to your notes.

20
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,020
The quest is math time, so you can take as long as you want.

21
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,910
But just know that by 1159 on Friday, the quiz will automatically submit.

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,970
So if you're not done, is going to submit just where you stop.

23
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,990
So be mindful of that and we shall if you have any questions.

24
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:00,210
Hey, you sent an e-mail last week that she's updated for officer of specifically for the time frame on Monday.

25
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:12,690
They want is their time frame is still the same so from 11 a.m. to 12 noon, but for Monday it's now 12 to 1 p.m. please take note.

26
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,930
The Zoom link is the same and then next week I will be traveling for conference.

27
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:29,190
So the U.N. is going to lead the session and then you will be working on an exercise comparing names and purpose.

28
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,720
And it's really interesting to give you an opportunity to see how the two data sources overlap and how they are different.

29
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,570
Any questions about. So.

30
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:59,940
I don't know whether, you know, there are going to be any more on the Clinton rather than like hands or feet.

31
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,390
And so understanding the types of data you can get from a data source.

32
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,610
True or false question what the popular structure? So you're not going to have to go to the data source to directly influences.

33
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,030
Any other question about. All right.

34
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,720
So today we'll be talking about and he in his is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

35
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:42,209
And it's really interesting that the wealth of data collected by this program is and continue to be amazed by the fact that you can just

36
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:52,260
go to some of these data sources and click a few buttons and be able to download a whole data set to do Web analysis that you want to do.

37
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:59,310
So we will see today get an overview of the wealth of data collected by income.

38
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:10,020
So the program's goals really are designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S. And you will see

39
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:21,090
over time how the focus changed in terms of the surveys that were conducted and what's currently is the on for it and going in he survey.

40
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,600
So the program began in the early 1960s and it continues today.

41
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,099
Again, like I say, it's changed over time. And so nowadays, when you hear somebody say this enhanced,

42
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,629
they're really referring to the continuous and he's in the wanted to talk about

43
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,200
something prior to that maybe they will give it a specific enhanced name.

44
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,780
But generally when you hear in Heinz,

45
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:55,100
it's referring to the last change that was done in 1999 and is called continuous thinking or just referred to as.

46
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,420
So the news is administered by the National Center for Health Statistics.

47
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:11,300
If you recall from last week, the NCA is the same unit that's in charge of biostatistics data.

48
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,330
So they have their hands full with the different data sources that in.

49
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:23,930
So what types of data collected by a whole range of data.

50
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
So as a start, risk factors.

51
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:38,320
So sometimes you're interested in data on smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, dietary intake, which is a key aim of the enhanced data program.

52
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,440
And then also reproductive health, breastfeeding practices and so on.

53
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,950
So that's just for risk factors. For outcomes.

54
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:56,860
They have a range of outcomes and of those key in that category will be nutrition, but also collect information on anemia,

55
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:06,670
diabetes, environmental exposure is something that I'm interested in, infectious disease or how you name it.

56
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,079
And you will see when you get to go over our reference, which will be next week,

57
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:23,500
you will see that there are similar types of data in terms of categories, but they're 14 distinctions between the two programs.

58
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:31,840
And you will see as we go through the slides today and then next week how those programs differ from.

59
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:45,220
And then and he's collects biological samples, sort of like blood, urine, hair and white blood cells from which to extract DNA.

60
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:53,380
So they collect both measures in there from those measures that able to quantify key measures.

61
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:06,340
So for example, macronutrients, Courtney, which is a biomarker of exposure to cigaret smoke, cholesterol, inflammation, drug vasculature.

62
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,380
And then also having better exposure and a range of other measures.

63
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:23,050
So the program is actually aimed at collecting a sample that's representative of the non institutionalized U.S. population.

64
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,310
So the survey really aims to represent the U.S. population at all ages.

65
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:41,490
And then because in certain areas you have some groups that might be underrepresented,

66
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:51,129
the sample is actually drawn to oversample certain groups and the goal is really to have reliable

67
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:57,790
estimates and for those estimates to represent the distribution of the U.S. population.

68
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,460
So we'll do an overview of how the current NHANES program came to be.

69
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,100
So it's sort of based on a National Health Survey Act in 1956.

70
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:20,360
And the program was established to provide health information on the status of U.S. residents.

71
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:28,459
And this particular program is restricted to people living in the U.S. But you can see when you've all heard the reference data,

72
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:40,250
that they also include the territories. So just keep in mind, when you're trying to compare the two data sources to make sure you select the group,

73
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,950
that would be a true comparison between the two datasets.

74
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,820
So the precursors to the NHANES program included the National Health Examination Survey.

75
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:05,800
So the first one was from 1959 to 1962, and the targeted individuals 18 to 79 years old.

76
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:14,080
And they enrolled all around 6700 individuals.

77
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:22,660
Then the next wave was an issue s two from 1963 to 1965.

78
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:32,350
And you see now the focus is a different age group. So from a kids 6 to 11 years, a little over 7000 participants were enrolled.

79
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:40,570
And then in year three, also running in another study in the 1960s.

80
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,480
So 1966 and 1970 enrolled over 7000 participants.

81
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,520
This time around, age group 12 to 17.

82
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:59,290
So you can see them at three different. And yes, but each survey covered a different issue.

83
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,700
So I started off with one age group, which is focusing on adults.

84
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,610
Apparently, they realized that this program would be successful. So then they decided to fill in the gaps.

85
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:17,710
Border issues. Interestingly, initiate three had a one third overlap with an issues.

86
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:26,770
So some of the participants in the energy as to what will be an issue is three because they had reached the age group by that time.

87
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:37,360
So the overall and NHANES program has lots of all study weights.

88
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:47,930
So the first one was 1971 to 1975, then destination NHANES one epidemiologic follow up study,

89
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:58,970
then enhanced to Hispanic and he's in his three and he's continuous, which is what we now refer to as end means.

90
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:07,100
And then a National Youth Fitness survey, and we'll go over the of a description of youth for each survey.

91
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:17,690
So one key distinction I would like to make is that what our section of the NHANES one epidemiologic follow up study,

92
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,670
all of these surveys are cross-sectional study. And this is a key distinction because sometimes it's so easy to forget that we are

93
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,830
collecting this data on an annual basis and the data are released in two year cycles.

94
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,950
So sometimes it's easy to confuse that these are longitudinal follow up, but they are not.

95
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:44,300
They are a snapshot of the population in time and those individual and then necessarily include it in the next week.

96
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,260
That's not to say that maybe somebody will be lucky to get into the subsequent follow up.

97
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,650
But the goal is not to follow individuals over time to say, you provided data to us in 2000.

98
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,220
We're following you in 2002 to see what your new status is and that the intention of the program,

99
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:12,650
the program is to collect data using a cross-sectional approach, a snapshot, snapshot of the population in time.

100
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:26,580
So anyways, one we signed up in 1971 as a national wide nationwide probability sample around 32,000 person,

101
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:36,060
the range from 1 to 74 years and the other sample groups for high risk of malnutrition.

102
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:44,520
And I want you to pay close attention to the different surveys because they had different groups that were oversampled.

103
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,800
So it's not consistent across time.

104
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:53,820
So if you want to know which groups are oversampled, then you have to go and check the documentation for that particular survey.

105
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:02,850
So for any, here's one low income individuals, preschool children and women of childbearing age and the elderly.

106
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,790
What was oversampled the.

107
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,560
And you will see as we get into details about the continuous NHANES program that usually one group gets the interview.

108
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:27,960
And the goal is for everybody in that interview group to get the laboratory report that we know or we conduct study.

109
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:37,550
Sometimes we will ask people to follow up. So some people do not get a chance to complete the laboratory and in-person exams.

110
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,520
So the NHANES one epidemiologic follow up study.

111
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,410
This is the only program within the enhanced program.

112
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:57,840
That's a language in study. Many individuals were enrolled and then they were followed at select points in time.

113
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:10,110
So from the NHANES one, they had individuals from 25 to 74 who completed the medical exam, and we'll talk about that.

114
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,800
So around 14,400 individuals.

115
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:23,580
And the goal was to investigate relationships between clinical, nutritional and behavioral factors assessed in enhance one.

116
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,900
So they had opportunities to follow these individuals in four different ways.

117
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,219
So the first one was 1982. Then 1986, 1987.

118
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:44,260
And then 1992. And unlike some longitudinal studies where you lose a lot of people to follow up,

119
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:54,129
the follow up rates have been really great, with greater than 90% of participants who were followed in the first wave.

120
00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:00,270
Being able to subsequent get information on those individuals was such a large undertaking.

121
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:07,430
Sometimes you lose participants over time and still have the participation rates over time still be greater than 90%.

122
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:22,530
I think that's a healthy place. So for enemies to that wave of hurt, I shouldn't say a wave because we've indicated two of our people were attacked.

123
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:35,870
So any to which was conducted between 1976 and 1983 included over 25,000 individuals from six months to 74 years of life.

124
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:49,530
Age range. And this time around, the sample group was included children and impoverished individuals because of higher nutritional risk.

125
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:59,610
Again, the goal of enhance is really collect a lot of data, both keenly to pay attention to nutritional factors.

126
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,640
Then there was the Hispanic MP.

127
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:17,400
So after our enemies want an end to good living, it became clear that the program was missing data on some ethnic groups.

128
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,010
So the generated a new survey to collect information on Hispanic individuals.

129
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,260
And because Hispanics were steadily increasing beginning in the 1960s,

130
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:40,620
they decided to examine the largest three subgroups of Hispanics in the U.S. so Mexican-Americans, Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans.

131
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:52,740
So the survey obtained basic data on certain chronic conditions and then also baseline health and nutritional information.

132
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,350
And then in these three months, this time around, they had no upper limit.

133
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,950
And they survey almost 34,000 individuals.

134
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,120
They had a range of topics. And we wish to highlight that data.

135
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:18,629
And this can be very useful because some of the variables collected, even though they could be classified as outcome,

136
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,710
you can also use that as exposure for whatever data you want to analyze or what research questions you have.

137
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:33,490
So as you can see, just a range of of data points on like this census data, NHANES,

138
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:40,589
you can get information at the individual level so you don't have a specific ID to identify the person.

139
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,310
So it's the objectified data, what is at the individual level?

140
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:56,230
And now continuous energy which is what we currently that's that's a program that's currently going on now continuous

141
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:06,559
in he in 1999 the program became continuous because if you noticed the previous waves we had 7019 71 to 1975.

142
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,320
So it was a set point in time. But now the data, I just collect data on an ongoing basis.

143
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:23,959
So the previous data sets you if you saw they had huge sample sizes, 25,000, 32,000 plus for the continuous.

144
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,940
And here you have around 5000 persons who are interviewed each year.

145
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:40,280
So for any 1999 to 2000, it has an oversampling of low income persons, adolescents,

146
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:47,090
2012 to 19 persons older than 60, and African-Americans and Mexican-Americans.

147
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,270
So even though the data collected annual basis, they are released every two years,

148
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:03,440
you can't analyze data from a single two year cycle or you can combine the data if you want a larger sample size.

149
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,270
So what does it take to participate in these ideals?

150
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:19,409
You are going to have an opportunity if you are invited to participate in needs to be transported

151
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:27,390
to and from the mobile center and participants receive compensation for participating in games.

152
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:33,900
And because of the range of tests that they have an opportunity to conduct.

153
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,750
They also get a report of their medical findings from the program.

154
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,060
You will see for reference that it's a totally different setup.

155
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:51,660
The survey is completed by telephone and everything there is self-reporting.

156
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,950
So for the first step in the NHANES, so in this case is continuous.

157
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,070
In the survey, there's an in-person interview.

158
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,780
So these interviews are conducted at the individual's home and they are administered by an interviewer,

159
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,350
and they use this computer assisted personal interview technology and is very helpful because

160
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,950
anybody who has done data collection once once you collect the data on a question on the air,

161
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:31,050
you take it to analyze it and you find some errors that you have to either delete the observation or try to correct the data.

162
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,150
So what the computer says, that personal interview, they have certain boundaries.

163
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:46,350
So, for example, if you are collecting information on age and you wanted to type in 15, you mistakenly added a zero and 150.

164
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,459
So you will get an alert telling you that's outside the range.

165
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:57,240
And maybe at that point you have an opportunity to correct it compared to not being able to correctly.

166
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,330
If you were doing a paper survey and the person is completing the survey,

167
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:08,550
you take it to the data analysis program and then realize you have a person who is reporting their age to be 150.

168
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:18,390
They also have bilingual interviewers available to be able to make the interviews more representative of people living in the U.S.

169
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,040
And then the second step is where participants get to complete the MC exam.

170
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:35,100
So the mobile examination exam, when interviewed, was more confident.

171
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:44,249
The whole interview, like a week or two after the interview, they are invited to mobile units so it units.

172
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:54,870
Once the program has identified an area to survey the bring those trailers as you can see the picture there in the parking area.

173
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,980
And these trailers have labs, physician offices,

174
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:05,790
pretty much anything you need to collect the types of data they need in for physical examination, all participants.

175
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:14,610
So they conduct physical exam, body measurements, allergy testing.

176
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,000
A whole range of exams are done, including dental.

177
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:24,480
They also collect specimen and then they also use that opportunity for a personal interview.

178
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:33,930
And I know you might be thinking, but an in-home interview was already done maybe a week or two prior to the examination.

179
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:43,140
But there are some topics that sometimes people may not be possible completing or talking about if they are within earshot of other people.

180
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,740
So this is an opportunity to talk about certain sensitive topics, such as tobacco use among youth,

181
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:59,460
sexual experience, depression, and then they also have the opportunity to do cognitive tests and also learned test.

182
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:08,379
So something that should be closely associated.

183
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,590
When you think about NHANES data, the data on that collected using a single sample, random sample.

184
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:26,170
Again, the goal is to actually collect data on individual such that they representative of the entire non institutionalized U.S. population.

185
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:34,720
And because of that, they have to use a complex, multistage probability sampling design to be able to select participants.

186
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:43,870
Keep in mind, a sample does not include people in nursing homes, armed forces, or institutionalized individuals.

187
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,490
So this is a visual that shows how the sampling works.

188
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,970
So you have the stage zero wishes, reality strata for which people are grouped.

189
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,590
So let's try to abate.

190
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:14,130
Estrada will be based on the geographic location and also the distribution of the different racial groups in that particular area.

191
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:22,830
And then the first thing is where you have a primary sampling unit, a PSU, and this is usually at the county level.

192
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:31,350
Is it a single county or multiple counties if you have smaller counties adjacent to each other?

193
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:37,890
And this sampling is actually done by probability, proportional to size.

194
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:47,430
And this is done to indicate that the larger the county, the probability of being selected is higher.

195
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,740
And then PlayStation two, you have also select selected based on probability, proportional to size.

196
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:06,000
And this is where you have city blocks or equivalent. And then after that, you have stage three where you are then sampling households.

197
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,230
And this stage is done using a random selection.

198
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,100
And then for stage four, you have a sample persons.

199
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:19,250
And this is random within age, sex and racial means.

200
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:31,740
So you start at the level where it is based on geographic location within the U.S. and the distribution of ratio in different groups.

201
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:42,810
And then you go to counties for counties, you go to city blocks that have lots of households and in some households who are sample person.

202
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:57,170
And if they're over assembly plans in place, they're actually happy at this stage for where they're trying to increase the support for certain things.

203
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:12,410
So as we mentioned earlier, oversampling really is designed to make sure they have a true representation of the US population.

204
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:21,710
So for example, all the groups that were oversampled in the 1999 to 2004 surveys include African-Americans,

205
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,459
Mexican-Americans, low income white Americans.

206
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:34,400
So beginning in 2000 and adolescents aged 12 to 19 years and persons aged 60 and older.

207
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:45,530
So keep in mind, if you want to be sure vote which goes by sample, you have to go and get information on that particular.

208
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:58,050
And it is it's good to pay attention because if you're going to buy to go in combines, sampling cycles,

209
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,680
you want to be careful how you are combining the samples because you might have different groups that were all the sample.

210
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:16,550
Because the data are not collected using simple random.

211
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:28,629
Selection you need to account for dosomething with the sampling weights are really the way to assign to each individual

212
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:35,440
in your survey so each individual could represent a certain number of individuals to match the U.S. population.

213
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,729
So when you go to analyze your sir your your data,

214
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:47,680
you have to use the sample weights assigned because that's the only way you can have the individual accurately

215
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:56,560
represent the number of individuals that he or she was intended to represent based on the probability of selection.

216
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:04,000
So if you fail to account for the sampling parameters, you will have a biased estimate.

217
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,370
And in most cases you will overstate the significant level associated with your analysis.

218
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,900
So you will see an example that you will work on next week,

219
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:20,980
that you have to use either a special statistical software or you will have to use

220
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:30,730
specific programs where you have the ability to incorporate the weights in your analysis.

221
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:43,460
So in general. So you have a sense of how using online using sampling weights in a sample could by design variables with actual parameter estimate.

222
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,010
So the the weights which affect the parameter estimate.

223
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:56,840
And if you incorporate the sample, the complex sample design, it will affect the arrest estimate.

224
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:05,630
And to do that, you have to make sure that you are able to get your accurate test statistics and the confidence intervals.

225
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:21,049
So four simple ways you will see that. Each person enrolled in the study as a waiver.

226
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,920
And I mentioned at just XYZ ago that each person has a sample.

227
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,340
Wait until I do that sample.

228
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:38,600
Wait. You have to adjust using the the interview weight associated with the data that you've collected.

229
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:49,550
So the interview wait will be the data set that would be the largest because if you remember as the

230
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:55,460
first step in that first step is where you have the most individuals are being enrolled in the study.

231
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,799
And then the second step will be the next exam, which is usually smaller than the interview.

232
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:11,210
Wait, because not everybody makes it to the interview and the exam, the more vaccine.

233
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:22,110
So then you might be wondering how do I collect or at least correct the weights for my and his analysis?

234
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,230
I'm going to be using data from the interview. I'm also going to be using data from the exam.

235
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:38,410
So which way do I use in order to have the correct information that you will have to use the smallest population?

236
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:46,090
So if you have data from the interview and data from the mechanism, you have to use the methods.

237
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:54,980
And because it's usually a small sample. So let's look at three different scenarios.

238
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:04,520
So the first scenario, you are performing an engineering analysis using the 1999 and 2000 data release.

239
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:14,150
And you want to analyze the association between race, ethnicity and poverty on all previous diagnoses of diabetes.

240
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:24,410
All of these variables were collected in the interview point of the program, and the sample size here is 10,291.

241
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:31,520
Which way would you use for your analysis to make sure that you are using the appropriate

242
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,820
weight and assigning the intended representation for each individual in the sample?

243
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,250
Any. Anytime. What's the plan?

244
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:25,040
To you. The this one in this case is going to be the one on her, because we are using variables that were collected in the interview.

245
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:38,930
Dataset. Right. So the MC will be the full sample weight for those in who completed the physical exam and collected samples.

246
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:47,780
Any questionable wish while we select the before interview to.

247
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,830
There's another question. So make sure you understand as the form of the next question.

248
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:09,469
So the next question, you are performing in NHANES 1999 to 2000 analysis looking at the Association of Race,

249
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,630
Ethnicity, Age, poverty and prevalence of high blood pressure.

250
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:25,520
All three demographic variables were collected during the interview phase of the study, and the sample size was 10,291.

251
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:34,130
What BP was collected doing the neck exam and this was collected on 9471 participants.

252
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:45,530
The max sample is a subset of those interviewed in the warm survey, which we would use to conduct the analysis.

253
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,300
Yes. The man is in the magazine.

254
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:04,550
Wait. Has that only because you see, we have data saying that the magazine is too small of the two data sources.

255
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,140
So the magazine will be what you will use to be sure that you have the appropriate width for your analysis.

256
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:21,680
Then you decided to do something else that includes additional data points.

257
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:34,580
So you are performing it in his analysis using 1999 to 2002 data and you want to look at the Association of Race and Ethnicity.

258
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,900
A blood pressure. Pressure and fasting.

259
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,920
Triglycerides on persons age 20 and older.

260
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:49,850
Race, ethnicity and age where available from the interview phase of the project.

261
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:58,760
So you have 10,291. BP came from the Mac and then the next sample, which is a subset of the whole each of you.

262
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:07,830
Fasting triglycerides were collected from a subsample who did a nine hour morning fast.

263
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:16,910
The group is approximately half the sample of those who were in the MEK, as in a total of 4151 participants.

264
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:27,850
Which week? Which is? For your.

265
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,430
Ezzati Thank you. So in this case, as you noted, there's a slight change.

266
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,600
The first two questions we looked at 1999 to 2000.

267
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,639
So that's two years.

268
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:49,190
And that's why we selected a two year interview, wait for the first question and then the two year mechanism, wait for the second question.

269
00:36:50,090 --> 00:37:00,470
This time around, we're using the first thing subsample for year met weight because we're using of 1999 to 2002 this was four years.

270
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:12,290
And because we need to use a smaller sample in this case to be the group that had fasting information

271
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:18,860
on the sample fasting subsample any questions about how we go about selecting which way to use?

272
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:41,050
So because the program has progressed from collecting data on 25,000 people or 32,000 individuals, and now is now to 5000 individuals per year,

273
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:51,430
you might be able to get greater reliability in your estimates if you combine the cycles, but if you do so, you will have to calculate new weights.

274
00:37:52,120 --> 00:38:05,080
And because people have the flexibility to combine any combination of cycles and hence the thing automatically generates the rate, the weights.

275
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,610
They have a formula that you can use to calculate the weights for whatever cycles you decide to combine.

276
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:34,410
So a key part of this process really is to be able to estimate the variance for this kind of complex survey design.

277
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:45,299
So you need to use the strata, which we said earlier was the geographic location that was determined based on the

278
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:52,440
population distribution by racial or other factors and the primary sampling units.

279
00:38:53,610 --> 00:39:05,850
But in these in the program, they pay special and close attention to make sure that they maintain confidentiality of the data they are collecting.

280
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:12,389
This is a little bit different from census data where you're collecting information where people may age,

281
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:21,150
but this time for any field collecting information or DNA laboratory tests and a whole range of factors.

282
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:32,580
So in this case, most attention to making sure that there's no opportunity for somebody to identify individuals in the study.

283
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:40,980
Because imagine if you have data on the strata and then you have information maybe on the primary sampling unit,

284
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:47,580
if somebody had enough time there to go into that and try to identify an individual what might save a lot of time,

285
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:51,540
but he doesn't want to take that risk.

286
00:39:52,080 --> 00:40:03,380
So what they do, they have a masked variant unit and these are not the actual strata in a primary sample of sampling units,

287
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:10,050
but they allow you to have as close as possible an estimate of the variance.

288
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,069
So you do your sass example.

289
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:24,840
Next week you will see that these variables would be what you will use the SD and VCR A for the strata, and then the SD and B PSU for the primary.

290
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:32,850
So again, primarily to protect individuals who are participating in this data collection.

291
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,410
So there are publicly available data sets that you can go and download for.

292
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,870
And here's what they are some of the data that are restricted.

293
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:55,310
So surveys that have been linked to mortality data, those are not publicly available.

294
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,169
You can request them and you can go through a process that will allow NHANES

295
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:06,110
to review your proposal and see whether they want to share the data with you.

296
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,450
But in this case, it has to be a process that's not publicly available.

297
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:23,000
Medical, Medicare, enrollment and claims data, Social Security benefits and other types of data are available and primarily because they

298
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,280
are connected to individuals and they have information that can identify individuals.

299
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:35,300
For example, the Social Security number. So these are available in, but you have to go through a separate process.

300
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,080
And he also has genetic data.

301
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:48,950
These also are not publicly available, but you can submit your proposal and then at the review you may be granted access to the data.

302
00:41:51,610 --> 00:42:03,070
So from the mechanism, the samples that are collected in his will analyze the different pathways that we want to run.

303
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:10,330
What? Because to collect these samples and to collect extra, they do have surplus virus specimens that form.

304
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:22,390
So if somebody has a project or they have grant funding for a particular measure that was he collected by in his or was it measured by NHANES?

305
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,400
This person can apply to have these samples provided.

306
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:36,220
They can measure whatever they want to measure in those samples, and then they will be able to use them to analyze the data or the research question.

307
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:49,830
Because the app, these are publicly available data. This individual who has paid now for quantifying by specimens in no particular measure.

308
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,020
The data would be put on hold for accuracy and to be able to analyze the research question.

309
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,270
What time frame after that data will then become available for anybody would using.

310
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:15,840
So I have three examples. Just so you have a sense of some of the types of data and some of the reports that have been generated from NPR.

311
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:28,590
So the first one is an example that shows what percentage of individuals age 28 and over who use a prescription opioid drug in the last 30 days.

312
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,500
And this is my sex and age. This is using data from 2013 to 2016.

313
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:44,820
So you see on the x axis we had the total population that was analyzed and then it is broken down by men and women.

314
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:57,750
And then on the Y axis you have a percent. So you see a similar pattern for the total population compared to men and women.

315
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:13,670
But you have lower. Percent among men compared to women with the highest percentage of adults who use

316
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:19,880
a prescription opioid dropping highest for women in the six year older age group.

317
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,450
And these differences are significant at a p value as opposed to.

318
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:37,990
The second example looks at urinary iodine levels in the US and the age group here, 60 to 74.

319
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,240
And in this analysis they are looking at and means one.

320
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:52,389
So my Sandoval said before any means 398 to 91 and in enhanced tooth and because these data are

321
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:58,120
collected over time again remember on a snapshot of the population at a single point in time,

322
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:04,540
this gives you an opportunity to see how high the levels are changing in the US.

323
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:18,820
So you can see the median level here for the first in him is 32 and his three is 14.5 and then four in 2000 is 61.

324
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:30,820
And the median that's acceptable to say that our population is sufficiently in taking iodine levels will be around ten.

325
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:42,580
So you can see is going down that well from in he's one two and his two a went down drastically and then by 12 he won't fall.

326
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:54,100
So these that are just routinely collected can be useful in understanding the health status of the nation for select measures for.

327
00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:02,040
Interesting. Urinary iodine levels are around 90%, is secreted in the urine.

328
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:08,450
So it gives you a sense of how much before in taking and in what the remaining 10% be retained.

329
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:16,130
So it's useful information that you are able to collect on individuals in the U.S. over time.

330
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,280
We are going to do a specific study of this so it can be very useful.

331
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:33,860
And then the final example here is the prevalence of age adjusted hypertension among adults age 20 and over, using different ways of the survey.

332
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,990
So you see, we have individuals 20 to 39.

333
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,930
We have they were female, 40 to 59 and then 60 and over.

334
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:58,220
So as you can see, individuals who are in the youngest age group, you have females having a lower percent of hypertension.

335
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:04,430
And then the same pattern occurs among individuals, 40 to 59.

336
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:16,190
Interestingly, for individuals, 60 and over, females have a higher percentage of hypertension compared to men.

337
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,370
So the first two groups were similar.

338
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:28,670
And then for the turkey, if looks way in, females have a higher percentage of hypertension in the second order.

339
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:38,390
So these three examples are just snapshots on the different ways that and these data can be used.

340
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:47,990
And you will see when you decide to select your paper for the final project that there are multiple ways the data can be used.

341
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:55,760
It can be used to describe trends over time. It can be used to answer a specific research question in multiple ways.

342
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:04,070
And I promise you that when you select your paper, whether it is names or different data source,

343
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:10,820
that your paper be one that's evaluating a research question, not one that's just describing trends over time.

344
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:22,879
So for those of you who may be interested in learning more about the different surveys on canvas on the schedule for today,

345
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:30,320
there is a link to a PDF document that gives you additional information on the different types of surveys deliverable.

346
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:40,190
In a little brief overview of what's included and who is the target group for those surveys or too?

347
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:47,480
I mentioned that marriages and divorces and that collectively divide US statistics program any longer.

348
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:53,990
Previously that was the case. Now that information can be found in the National Survey of Family Group,

349
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,450
and if you are interested, that information can be found here as well as these.

350
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:13,590
So before we move on to the final project, do you have any questions related to any type of data collected or the program itself?

351
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:29,110
So it's time for the final project. And before I go into details about the project,

352
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:35,709
I just want to spend a moment just providing some ground rules that you can use within

353
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,560
your groups to ensure that everything works smoothly as you work on your final project.

354
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:49,390
Keep in mind that group interactions are to be rooted in a fundamental understanding that.

355
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,510
You are going to be mutually respecting one another.

356
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:58,640
Listen carefully to others to ensure that all voices are heard.

357
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,700
Ask questions to clarify. Somebody says something and it is not clear.

358
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,880
They'll just move on and you can stop for a moment, ask the person to clarify,

359
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:15,290
and then it gives that person an opportunity to contribute to the discussion and contribute to the project.

360
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:21,740
Acknowledge contributions from group members and ensure that when you do a

361
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:27,170
science task for your project that you have each person who is assigned a role.

362
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:34,640
And then because of COVID, because of people schedules.

363
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:45,050
Just because life happens, sometimes people may not be able to attend class, so maybe you won't be able to participate in the group that day.

364
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:51,730
So I encourage you to develop a plan to keep in touch in case somebody is not available that day.

365
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,460
They may not be pleased, but they still may be able to work and contribute to the group.

366
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:07,760
So if that means taking a list and doing an email list, or if the feature in canvas allows you to send a message to your group members,

367
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:11,720
then maybe utilize that so each person is able to contribute.

368
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:19,380
What are in class? So for the fun of the project,

369
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:29,820
the purpose is really to provide an opportunity after hearing about the different data sources to get an in-depth

370
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:42,390
understanding of what the different programs offer and to be able to go in and see how those data were used in an analysis.

371
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,920
For example, the paper that you will select.

372
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,820
In order to ensure and facilitate group work, we will make time doing class for you to work on your project.

373
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,939
It may not be the only time that you are going to work on a project,

374
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:04,700
but we will make sure you have time to plan, come up with strategy and an assigned text.

375
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:13,129
And when you come back, people report and you can make progress with your paper if you will see like one of the datasets covered in the course.

376
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,560
So it could be datasets we've before Retina or the ones that will be published later.

377
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:27,710
You can select one of those data sources and assign a published article that will be used that

378
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:34,490
the article that selected that particular data source and use it as a research question.

379
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:40,339
You can confirm with Haiyan or NI, what are your selected articles susceptible?

380
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:45,950
Is it just helpful for us to take a look and make sure that you are finding an article

381
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:51,110
that has an exposure in an outcome or one that meets the needs for the final project?

382
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,870
Project is feel they are divided into two groups, two parts.

383
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:06,140
The first part is really you letting us know you've read the paper and you understand what the study set out to do and to summarize the results.

384
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:14,960
The second part would be using your AP skills and the overview you've learned in this course to evaluate the study.

385
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:24,270
For your right of use the problems that are in the questions.

386
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:32,190
So if. QUESTION The first question is asking you to provide information about the study.

387
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:37,530
Then make sure you keep that from so you're not writing like a paper per se.

388
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:47,729
If you are answering and put in text on a question or issue, your submission should be less than or equal to 2500 words.

389
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,290
Excluding references. We have a rubric provider on campus.

390
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,270
Take a look. Ask if you have any questions or if anything is not clear.

391
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:05,790
And the final project is due on campus on Friday, October 14.

392
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:11,790
By midnight, reach out if you have any questions any questions about the final project.

393
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:23,770
All right. So next week, we will be covering the behavioral risk factor surveillance system.

394
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:31,630
You will complete an exercise after the first part of the class where you will compare data from energy and reference.

395
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:37,600
And then finally, remember to test what are you able to connect to a virtual site?

396
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:45,960
So now the second part of this class, you will have an opportunity to meet your group members.

397
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:51,060
So if you check candidates, you should be able to see which group you're in.

398
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:57,030
And this is the point now that we move around and go to groups.

399
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,710
So will come this table at table one. So this is less is a one time thing.

400
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:10,050
So let's do that with three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

401
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:44,240
We have one extra table. Okay.
