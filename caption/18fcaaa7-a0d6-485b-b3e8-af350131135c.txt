1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,900
All right. Okay. Hello.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:16,560
Sorry. I wish I could give you more, but if you finish early, you can get a new class outside.

3
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:29,160
So it doesn't make you waste my time in trouble anyway.

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,980
Yeah. Okay. Let's try a little bit of work here.

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:47,160
And this person is some questions later you might be asked, but let's try to get you set to work.

6
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,260
So that's a real energy.

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,550
It's I, by the way, next, this is my son teaching another course.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:07,440
And this is the same type of four seven where you run on the infection and the chronic disease.

9
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,809
We're going to visit it at the same time as this one. Yes, yes, that's it.

10
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:21,630
It will be summer. Hopefully, if it's not not the pandemic, everything would be better and that would happen.

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,490
That is the going to be on a Friday or now.

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,140
Yes. What time? The same time. Oh, yes.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,850
I know. It's a link between infectious disease and controversy.

14
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,820
What's the title? Title? Oh, of course.

15
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:48,980
Yes, of. What about me?

16
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,920
You know, Jillian. You don't like Fridays. You don't like on Fridays.

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,169
How do you know?

18
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,920
They don't try to. I used to have very good skating.

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,000
And, you know, my Tuesday, Thursday, my boxing class was awesome.

20
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:18,060
I, I, I'm just trying to, you know, make it less conflict.

21
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:31,350
So that's an interesting student. I don't really like Paul said it because otherwise I have only like a monday which date from eight.

22
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,600
I think it's also hard. I do not like people, but I'd rather do Monday.

23
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,600
You rather do, are you? This is like the only class I have on Friday.

24
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:51,450
So then I feel like I'm trying to get homework done all morning and then I tired, but if I start the day with it, then I can just do it.

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,550
And I understand that. I sort of it's a hard for people, kids.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,380
So I really it is hard when I wasn't thinking past number two, I see students are running for late and I do.

27
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,500
I usually prefer students missing the last part if they have to miss the beginning.

28
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,230
Okay, cool. That's the same. Yes.

29
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:30,150
Oh, even one on Friday. I never I wouldn't I really never go even to people from my house where there are you know I'm watching Maxim works

30
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:44,160
the good the room is the and can be more effective for you please we start to the look of the results hopefully.

31
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,490
Maybe. So putting your.

32
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,130
Have you seen the answer? All right, I can.

33
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,270
Yeah. One of the sons things. I want you here.

34
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,590
I just want to talk. That's enough evidence and can be eradicated.

35
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:34,060
That's definitely. And here not only can be eradicate, that's for sure.

36
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,570
And we already know what takes.

37
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,530
So when you say these, of course, not to eradicate.

38
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:49,310
I if I ask you why you were thinking about those conditions that have to be met.

39
00:04:49,750 --> 00:05:00,250
So every disease, when you think about that eradication, you were saying about that and then under the effective strategy,

40
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:07,270
you were saying that if there's effective effects, if there are many different strains, that can be difficult.

41
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,950
And also, yes, equity.

42
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:29,499
When people strive toward the eradication, they always the one comment is how good the vaccination scheme is more effective than mass vaccination.

43
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:37,840
Mass vaccination. I'd like to focus on that point discussed a little bit.

44
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,240
So mass, massive vaccination versus vaccination.

45
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,549
I just. I just thought I'd come.

46
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:57,740
And it's rent. Vaccination is more effective than massive.

47
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:06,140
So the my follow up question is, does everyone share the same sort?

48
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:22,250
Or you want to add something or wants to change sets of statements in some way or think that the statement needs to be is to under certain conditions.

49
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,630
I guess it would depend on the epidemiology of the disease. Like for tetanus or vaccination system.

50
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,910
Probably wouldn't work because it's not communicable. So you in that case, you want to do that.

51
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,770
Or like if you don't if like you don't know necessarily, you will be super, super contagious.

52
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:52,860
And it's like there's a long you then you probably wouldn't go go you wouldn't be able to identify the people who need the vaccine as well.

53
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:03,480
All right. Good points. Yeah. And I think it's good is looking at the smallpox eradication,

54
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:11,450
I you may think oh run vaccination eventually don't work the answer that's open to the massive but an answer

55
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:22,110
just like say it's a different epidemiology of the pieces if it's in a time when the disease is widely,

56
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:31,710
you know, prevalent and then if whatever the massive vaccination that's what's the polio vaccine

57
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:38,790
mentioned before prompted the strategy you have for infants routine immunization.

58
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:46,890
You have a national day you'll have include surveillance and then you finally have smallpox.

59
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,780
My property, in a way is similar to that of run vaccination.

60
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,900
So it depends on which stage you are in. Another thing is think about how you could finish off the disease from human to human.

61
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:09,510
And the with the polio, it is it's infectious seven, ten days before onset.

62
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,230
If you just wait and your you know,

63
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:23,280
and runs vaccination with the disease or really identify the case you may lose some

64
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,210
of the in that case if the population overall is vaccinated they are protected.

65
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,090
Then at the end of the game, you will be.

66
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:48,900
This is so I think for human to human transmission disease in general, you need to first package the high risk population, a risk population.

67
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,970
Anyone who has the potential to get this disease should be vaccination or any likely date.

68
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,550
Next, that should. This is America we do with COVID 19.

69
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,450
Everyone gets right with pneumococcal vaccine.

70
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,300
You have infants. You have also senior people, grandparents like.

71
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,710
So this is a important to differentiate.

72
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,930
So just to you think about the communicable.

73
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,230
Yeah, not all the disease can be. It's easier to Iraq because of the virus, which you.

74
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,219
The only reservoir is human. Definitely. Yeah, that's definitely good.

75
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:43,770
You can continue to think about this. And at some point we want to summarize all these, put in a summary sheet.

76
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,870
I'll give you opportunity to discuss this more. Okay.

77
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,540
Very good. And Q Now let's go to different.

78
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:10,880
How many of you have you got the vaccine during when you were a child?

79
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,340
How many of you have heard the alarms or been exposed to pneumococcal vaccine discussed?

80
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:38,230
Okay. All right. This will help me to see how much deeper I can cover first.

81
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:50,710
Well, I think the sense I would like to use this vaccine to introduce you to some important concept in facts and vaccinology.

82
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,470
That's why it's SarahPAC.

83
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:06,340
Back to your super PAC, because for many passengers, this is such an it's a big area of research identify particular serotypes that cause disease.

84
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:24,820
They are bacterias that has many serotypes but include that could do more to the bacteria and it also has some other flu, a number of them.

85
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:36,670
So what is the center of type examples? And then pneumococcal vaccine history research findings that and we talk about the vaccine replacement.

86
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,990
You can see this lecture is focused on vaccine replacement disease.

87
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:55,110
This has important implications for you to working publishers and setting the practice agency.

88
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,710
If you want to track disease, you have to have this concept.

89
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:11,470
So what is the SarahPAC? If you look at this slide and there are many different sources of information, you can find the definition.

90
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:22,750
What's the survey? It's a subdivision of a species or subspecies distinguishable from other strains on the basis of antigens.

91
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:30,580
So here we talk about the antigen basically is based on the characteristics of antigen.

92
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:39,730
If you look at to all these different, different lesions, but they all have more in common.

93
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:52,450
Come on. Point is this is a reflects the different antigenic characteristics and the CDC

94
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,540
have a definition serotypes are groups within a single species of microorganism,

95
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:05,500
such as the bacteria or virus which share these distinctive surface structures.

96
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:12,160
This a surface structure basically is what we call the antigen.

97
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,460
So how these serotypes are detected, it's based on serotype.

98
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,430
It's a subtype has some difference in fact to your surface surface.

99
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:30,420
And so it's based on antigen, antibody reaction.

100
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,890
It there are two terms why it's a sirup piping is a test.

101
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,800
It's a method to determine which is serotype.

102
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:50,080
This patient is isolates belong to another term is called the serology that's

103
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,110
referred to the antibodies that form because of a viral or bacterial infection.

104
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:10,270
You may sera sera ology basically it's a reflects what kind of antibody response may be sent after the

105
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:22,150
infection by a bacterial occurs while serotype is basically it's a mass laboratory test to detect it.

106
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:34,020
So examples of bacteria, third type salmonella bacteria and they have different antigens on the surface of salmonella bacteria.

107
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:38,260
You have heard of food borne disease. This is very common.

108
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:46,450
And so how many is serotype based on these two major antigen surfaces structure?

109
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,990
Can you guess or you have this information?

110
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,420
Here's very interesting. More than 2500 serotypes have been described.

111
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,270
Some are real found only in one kind of animal or in a single place.

112
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,800
Some are found in many different animals and all over the world.

113
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,429
Isn't that amazing? And less so only.

114
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:28,100
But among these tools, some 500 less than 100 SERA packs account for most human infections some can cause especially severe ear is when the.

115
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:35,010
People. So when we do vaccine development, you all answered this.

116
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:39,220
We need the rational development. We need to identify antigen.

117
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:48,740
Now, you could, based on this lecture, you could even extend for an antigen identification.

118
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:55,050
We also want to identify which is Sarah packs to be packaged.

119
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:03,740
So this is one extension from your concept of antigen identification antigen from which is strength.

120
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,500
When we do molecular epidemiology study, we describe in population eight,

121
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,730
this particular serotype is very prevalent, but it may not be true in another population.

122
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:24,980
The different population are exposed to different and medical health interventions, drugs and treatments.

123
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:33,920
Those all can contribute to the selection of for particular types of strains or serotypes.

124
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,110
So this is again how epidemiology can inform the decision.

125
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,010
So we want to know which is serotypes, you know,

126
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:56,900
the the knowledge of less than 100 serotypes of someone a pathogenic that's a piece of epidemiological studies and or clinical microbiology.

127
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:07,940
And so that's another thing is I mentioned the age flu and it's a type of bacteria cause the year is basically in young children,

128
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:18,350
especially a major once the infection is a pandemic in both this age, flu and of course, immediate infection.

129
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,750
So that's they've had four or six identifiable attacks.

130
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:34,670
This is another interesting study for you, not just the one species for which you have many different several times.

131
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:43,360
They have also had some serotypes that are typhoid means there's no antibody to to identify them.

132
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,810
And perhaps some of the type for a strain may even be.

133
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,460
And the infections we used to have.

134
00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:01,190
Our peak researcher, Dr. Jennifer, appears of a pediatrician epidemiologist.

135
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:13,280
Her whole career of the research is focused on the type of of each food so, you know, find the disease causing strain.

136
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:23,240
So this is even more general. And then streptococcus pneumoniae that's what we are talking about today is it has more than 90

137
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:33,640
some introduce you even see 100 serotypes based on the outer co coding or capture the virulence.

138
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:41,180
Correct. But only less than ten of response for the most invasive infections in the US.

139
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:47,780
And talking about us and the preferences have may vary across geographic regions.

140
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:58,550
Why? Because different geographic regions have been exposed to different environment factors,

141
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,780
medical practice and even exposure to drug resistance, antibiotics differently.

142
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,060
So. So these require regional study.

143
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,870
Protective antibody is type specific.

144
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:24,050
This means if you induce the the production of antibody in one population,

145
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:33,680
it is for one therapy, the microbial it may not to protect to other therapies.

146
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:45,210
Another question I always want to ask what is the relationship between Pipe and the general public here?

147
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:58,490
So for those of you who have done a little molecular epidemiology where health, serotype, genotype,

148
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:09,320
genotype is really based on the genomic contents of the pathogen, while serotype is based on the outset.

149
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:17,530
Member A.G. of the. Pencil.

150
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:25,650
So why is the thinking structure variation determining the difference in general

151
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,450
practice and the one stereotype that can come to many different general practice?

152
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:37,650
But today we are focusing on serotype pneumococcal disease.

153
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,990
It's described for the first time, 1800.

154
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,760
It's a common cause of mobility. What kind of word? Why the majority of the deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.

155
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:05,999
The second the most common cause of vaccine preventable disease and preventable deaths in the US under COVID 19 pandemic.

156
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,750
Because the most common of the extremes of age,

157
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:25,520
young children and people over 60 major clinical symptoms and pneumonia to you have meningitis so streptococcal pneumonia this is what it

158
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:39,510
looks like it's form these chin it's tend to grow in pails and the chains and it's lancets or bullets shipped as you can see from here.

159
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,630
Again we can talk about the vaccine without talking about.

160
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,420
Epidemiology reservoir. Human is the only period.

161
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,530
It's a respiratory illness.

162
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:11,540
What does that mean? Until, you know, killing. Have you heard this term from any infectious disease at.

163
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:22,280
You look like you basically you you got this infection amplification through your own carrier,

164
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:31,940
your own normal back to your population under certain conditions.

165
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:42,690
Some your normal flow could become disease causing bacteria.

166
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:54,590
So that's of inoculating. It's not you get from other people, you get from your own care because these are carried by many people.

167
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:06,410
They don't cause disease. There's a temporary pattern coming in to keep energy not so clear for as long as the organism in respiratory secretions.

168
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,920
Definitely something you need. We need to remember.

169
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,510
So look at the license and pneumococcal vaccine here.

170
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,510
I want to if you have any questions when you look at these.

171
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,690
Yeah. We talk about polysaccharides, banks and conjugate vaccine polysaccharides.

172
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,129
It's a sugar small molecule and it's a small molecule.

173
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,780
Thousands of go to German center of in the spleen.

174
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,190
So the immune generated would not be so robust.

175
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:50,300
That's why it has to be chemically linked to some protein antigens.

176
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:56,360
That's where it stimulates a more robust response.

177
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,820
Why so many different villains?

178
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,940
Some 23, some 14, some seven, some ten, some 30?

179
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:17,060
What is the difference of valence? What what's the has the driving the development of the different valence vaccine?

180
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:26,130
Based on what this is, you could. This is find the one word.

181
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,170
It has to do with your friends with. There were times at the time.

182
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,370
Or, like, resistance. It's that way.

183
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,430
It's epidemiology. Yeah.

184
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,660
To determine how much infection is caused by one particular attack.

185
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:56,299
So here's what a licensed summer for children 23 is for.

186
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,310
And old and seven. And then all these are for different.

187
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,780
Why is this? That becomes the topic of what we are going to discuss today.

188
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:19,810
So you can see here different definition of four different vaccine covers different serotype.

189
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,800
This site is the serotype. This is a vaccine name.

190
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:32,950
A different version of vaccine. So if will why we have this meaning?

191
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:37,660
Because of epidemiology informed vaccine.

192
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:47,920
Because of the finding of all the different serotypes causing disease in different age groups, different population.

193
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:57,070
CDC current recommendation all children younger than two years old or adults 65 or older.

194
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,220
You need to, but I'm not going to pursue any this kind of person.

195
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:13,090
Another thing to note is for people who are not at the extreme age group,

196
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:24,680
they can also be the recommended the recipient for vaccine for your maximum and who smokers cigarets.

197
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:32,740
Why? Why we need to also recommend people in this age group despite their age.

198
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,940
It's not age group. Why? Why we need to recommend this group.

199
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:52,390
What does smoke does to people it compromise the host immunity right.

200
00:26:52,440 --> 00:27:05,730
So puts them at a high risk. You talk rifaximin purified a capsule polysaccharide antigen from 23 types of

201
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,730
pneumococcus that account for 88% of all bacteria in pneumococcal disease.

202
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:17,220
Course react with pipes cause an additional 8% of the disease.

203
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,300
So what this tells you is epidemiology.

204
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:35,340
Epidemiology studies show you how much you know, how how many of the population have,

205
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,240
what proportion of population reports, what kind of bugs, what's their type?

206
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:52,740
Then if you look at that, this wasn't initially developed for general use, but then when you look at that in the young children,

207
00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:05,190
it's not idea is only 60% to 70% against the invasive disease, which is the most severe type like meningitis.

208
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,350
Very much less effective in preventing pneumococcal pneumonia.

209
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,450
That's also invasive.

210
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:21,710
So this means for young children, we may need to search for different vaccine.

211
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,380
And this is how PCV surveillance, PCV is developed.

212
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:41,430
And it's also not just that, it's also linked to active serial talks, because the children, the immune system is less developed.

213
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:49,320
So their immune response would be even less robust prior to complete develop.

214
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,280
So that's why they have this conjugate vaccine.

215
00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:03,160
And it's also composed of some serotypes that were not in the previous vaccine.

216
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:15,740
And then when you look at the the epidemiological results, 86% back to your and it is 3% meningitis, a mature younger than six years.

217
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,040
So it's a pretty good coverage. And how do you know this?

218
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,410
You have to do epidemiologists. You do clinical microbiology studies.

219
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:35,160
Epidemiologists are working with clinical microbiology and it's 97% against invasive course by vaccine serotypes.

220
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:45,930
So this is the vaccine. Serotypes means if this disease were caused by the serotypes in the vaccine, it has 97%.

221
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:59,970
Anyway, what these the slides tells you I hope you were gets from these is you really want when you have cancer gene has many different serotypes.

222
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:10,510
You want to find the. Disease causing serotypes among all the existence.

223
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:24,070
Serotypes and the disease causing serotype should be studied in the context of full population, in the context of age groups.

224
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,190
These are some take home must not necessarily remember what percentage.

225
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,520
As for these and it's also can be different by disease.

226
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:49,150
Some serotypes may be more likely to cause, you know, meningitis, while others may be more to a cause pneumonia.

227
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:58,180
So you have to put these in the country. This is why we talk about the new vaccine licensure approval.

228
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:08,170
What information and do you need to also include the demographic in one of the remarkable fourth answer?

229
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:18,010
Yeah, because all these it's in the context of population of certain characteristics.

230
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:25,810
This is the why vaccine clinical trial three need to be done in representative population.

231
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,700
If it's designed for children, you have to have children in the population.

232
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay. So yeah, I, I see as you can see here and for different disease.

233
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,840
The protection is not the same. Different.

234
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:55,180
Right. So what? I show you all the statistics, but I don't really expect you to remember all the details.

235
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,330
I won't be remembered myself, but it's a to see what happens.

236
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,670
What's the take home message? What's the general counsel?

237
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,830
No. You can see this way.

238
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,300
If we say ask you to design, you know,

239
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:26,740
and what you need to monitor if what passage and many different forms of disease you would definitely want to prove, concede, measure, outcome.

240
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:39,400
It's not so simple. Pneumococcal disease. Then in your clinical trial design, you were see measure the occurrence of pneumococcal disease,

241
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:53,740
pneumonia or pneumococcal disease which could be pneumonia, could be otitis media, it could be meningitis.

242
00:32:54,100 --> 00:33:01,360
So this is an extension of what we talked about previously.

243
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:06,250
So outcome of a disease can be a wide range.

244
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,850
And so this the example shown here is really varies from type.

245
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:24,430
Okay. Here I have a couple of slides I would like to ask you to tell me what tells you this slide.

246
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:55,150
But the incidence of the disease decreased for both groups.

247
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,740
And even though the susceptible group does have a slightly higher.

248
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,540
Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's exactly the observation.

249
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:22,710
You know wax and definitely are very useful and to protect against the both antimicrobial resistance and the susceptible strength.

250
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:31,060
So the best one of the things that I discussed in my HP two, six, eight class, I didn't teach last year.

251
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:36,460
Um, we would talk about the, my, you know, uh.

252
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,950
Antibiotic resistant control.

253
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:52,440
The first very first step is get people vaccinated and the vaccine have a direct protection against the both risk and the disease.

254
00:34:52,710 --> 00:35:00,010
But they also reduce the use of antibiotics by reducing both types of the disease.

255
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,420
You definitely reduce the use of antibiotics.

256
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,350
Then you reduce the chance of misuse of antibiotics.

257
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:17,940
Right. Or if you reduce the need, then you will see that's the CDC 12 steps for controlling anti microbial resources.

258
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,090
And you start with get people vaccinated.

259
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,140
Or good that's outside. And what's this tells you?

260
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:55,510
This is a rate of vaccine hype. Basically, this is the type that's in the vaccine and not that invasive and after introduction.

261
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,700
You have four server age groups. This is the PCV seven package.

262
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,800
So what's the you see here for me?

263
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,310
How to vaccinate vaccines, only targeting this group.

264
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,900
Each counterpart represents a particular year can.

265
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,650
Okay. When's the last night? We see 2000 vaccines introduced.

266
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,570
So basically this is where the vaccine introduced.

267
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:54,380
And what you see in the packet. It's you can see how the introduction of vaccine has the impacts of the disease across different age groups.

268
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:57,590
And tell me, what's that?

269
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,760
Which group would benefit the most from the introduction?

270
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,550
That's a. Yeah.

271
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,710
Yeah. The package tactically they have directly impact.

272
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:17,390
Right. And then which is the next beneficiary?

273
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:28,930
Who. It doesn't look like that's why they didn't get vaccine.

274
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:39,590
They definitely probably that's why they got some more indirect effect than other age groups.

275
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,299
Probably because they're generally more susceptible to they are also more susceptible.

276
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,410
They are a higher risk population. That's definitely another analysis.

277
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,280
These are poor impairments. So there's more.

278
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:03,790
Yeah. Yeah. Are generally. So you can see this start with a lot of things.

279
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,620
And so they are also a high risk group. Very good.

280
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,610
Thank you.

281
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:22,330
And the direct the benefit of vaccination or IPV, invasive pneumococcal disease, vaccines, serotype and the rates children younger than five.

282
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:29,980
We can definitely see significant reduction of the disease.

283
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:37,120
Okay. And then another thing, it shows you the direct indirect effects.

284
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:49,330
This is estimated the number of cases of vaccine type fundraiser for pneumococcal disease prevented by direct effects and the indirect effects.

285
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:57,820
So indirectly fact it's even more but you reduce this infectious source.

286
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,150
So this is definitely very beneficial.

287
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,260
You see in the U.S. Okay.

288
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:16,100
But if we now think about something else.

289
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:25,759
First of all, routine vaccination of the children aged less than 24 months and for children 24 to 56 months,

290
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,540
which is five years with a high risk medical condition.

291
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,930
This is a recommended vaccine.

292
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,220
Later, the children more than seven months would require fewer doses.

293
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,550
Some children may not get immediately.

294
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,620
So this is the vaccination.

295
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:57,650
Then following that, you can this is shows you because this has been a long used vaccine, very effective impact on major vaccine preventable disease.

296
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,630
So after the general population study, you can see and the recommendation made for the children,

297
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:14,990
what happens next is to move to other populations where you may have more challenges.

298
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:27,770
And so this is the seven different parts and in HIV infected adults and you go out to your initial target population.

299
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:41,940
Why are HIV infected? And that needs is because they are immuno compromised and the more prone to be infected by pretty much any kind of pathogen.

300
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:47,480
Right. So that's what the act and then it's the to protect.

301
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,430
But there was shortly after the introduction of.

302
00:40:54,390 --> 00:41:01,070
Well yeah. It's just a few years after the introduction of surveillance.

303
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:10,160
So some challenges have been identified in this paper in to published to some.

304
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:21,470
You can see why the current seven variant conjugate vaccines are highly effective against invasive disease caused by vaccine type.

305
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,900
Have the vaccine have seven covered the seven types of amber and is seven.

306
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,910
When you cover that as a high dose, the disease were effectively controlled.

307
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,040
That's the replacement by lung vaccines.

308
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:49,910
Therapy resulting disease is a serious threat for the near future, especially disease caused by those that are antibiotic resistant.

309
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:58,110
So this is another lesson you'll want to think about when you do vaccine development.

310
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,970
We have to. So, Minister, to you first, the package and the most prevalent disease causing types.

311
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:13,700
But then when you successfully introduce that, you you control to those serotypes represented in the vaccine.

312
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,980
And then that adds a lot of prevent serotypes that could take place.

313
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:31,910
Those therapy could also include some talk of resistance as showing in this paper diversity and antibiotic resistance among non vaccine serotypes.

314
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,909
These articles I put here serve as a good example.

315
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:49,819
It also show you, you know, the the continuity of vaccine research which is stuff you have the of the answer of course in the

316
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:58,280
last the question of the exam was pretty well done by most people and students generally got paid to

317
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:09,680
wear that and that was a priority license here this vaccine I select to show you some of the suppose

318
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,750
the you research need to be done important the course in to become CE so you need to surveillance.

319
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:31,419
Certainly if it's a protected. And sort of finds some time this is supposed to have their facts and then found

320
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:38,709
that to address all the challenges this 13 variants of pneumococcal vaccine.

321
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,160
What's the difference? Basically, it's a cover.

322
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:50,560
The previous one. It also introduces some duty replacements of disease caused by.

323
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,710
So what's the what is the vaccine replacement?

324
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:08,460
The disease. It's a disease caused by lung vacs and silver patch.

325
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:21,880
Following the introduction. Successful introduction of a vaccine successfully controlled the vaccine serotypes.

326
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,170
Well, I didn't really write out, so I don't know.

327
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:33,810
I may have if I didn't. It's because I expect you to be able to come up with this.

328
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:47,590
It is nice that we talk about less so than post licensure study for PCV and then also other studies for 23 variants in adults.

329
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:56,080
And this vaccine, this tropical to date, this pneumococcal vaccine.

330
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,710
It's to give you some good examples.

331
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:09,729
What's the you always say even in that's the question I only ask you prior to the licensure but many

332
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:17,710
of you mentioned after licensure continues which is great I'm glad you got to ever in your mind.

333
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,580
But what's the actually I what's your question you want to ask what the

334
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:32,170
surveillance you want to do continue after license to date pneumococcal vaccine.

335
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,640
Sort of an excellent example to show you the challenges.

336
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:45,370
The continual research is needed and you can think even more from the more than what I have to show you here.

337
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:53,690
So how we solve the problem. And so you have learned the synthetic vaccinology or both.

338
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:04,480
But this is also and I said to show how we can develop new vaccine, we have to choose the antigen.

339
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,520
We have to choose serotype, we have to choose the particular strengths.

340
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:22,980
So how we can really manage to do that. We got the basic research and to understand the biology of the molecule, coding, the on site.

341
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:37,270
We have all these and then we have molecular epidemiology to this to identify prevalent serotypes strengths.

342
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:43,120
So then computational biology, we make epitope prediction.

343
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:49,570
We all this will work together to develop a new vaccine.

344
00:46:51,570 --> 00:47:01,410
So to summarize the leading cause of smoking mortality, especially in middle income countries.

345
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,800
For those of you interested in global health, you know,

346
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:14,940
United Nations sustainable development goals include to reduce the deaths in children under five.

347
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:27,930
And this is the package, the disease surveys that have had a tremendous effect on reducing pneumococcal carriage and invasive disease,

348
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:35,400
because pneumococcal pneumo can present, as you know, in your normal form.

349
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,440
So the carrier study could also be interesting.

350
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:46,290
So you can suffer. Just check how many active disease you reduce.

351
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:55,530
You could also probably check the carrier and its reduction issue ceremony to the address,

352
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:03,570
this setting or the high risk population specific optimization of vaccine formulation and vaccination schedule.

353
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:13,770
You need to maybe even monitor how long these antibodies which exist and then the impact of the serotype replacement

354
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:22,980
following PCV use and the characterization of transmission of new concern in high burden site settings.

355
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:34,019
Because you want to understand the transmission that you can identify, population that can benefit.

356
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:39,830
And most as we know, those countries are very have very limited the resource.

357
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:49,470
So package the vaccination would be important long term protective immunity against the current because of

358
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:57,690
the possibility of outcome prevention that will require you to also pay attention to that long term carriage.

359
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:03,690
Yeah, that's all I have to say today. And I thank you for your attention.

360
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:11,190
I know it's not easy, but you seem to be doing well and it's very important both for today.

361
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:17,430
Think more about the take home message here instead of, you know,

362
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:28,010
just pay attention to the numbers or try to remember no need to remember number what it is, what you want to get, what those numbers tell us.

363
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:31,770
One sentence to summarize the is useful.

364
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:38,460
Okay you have a wonderful week in at least this week is a relatively short term.

365
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:52,499
Yeah because I need to reduce this and also working very next to a good plan come to talk

366
00:49:52,500 --> 00:50:00,320
to his your paper and so I did the history paper as undergraduates and research also.

367
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:13,440
Is this for you? Yeah. Yeah. So is it for those of you who want to talk to me, if you could talk to the person, he's coming in person.

368
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,330
Unless something went wrong. Was this morning.

369
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:26,069
Yeah. I said it would be really cool giving a number for the future.

370
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,390
You probably see a lot of.
