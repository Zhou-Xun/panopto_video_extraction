1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,430
So previously, we've considered why children might be more sensitive to air pollution than adults.

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,580
We talked about reasons like their inhalation rates,

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,360
their developing lungs and the time that they spend outside and concluded conceptually that we would expect

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,870
stronger associations between exposures to air pollution and poor lung health in kids than we would in adults.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:42,190
In this particular video, we're now going to talk about how these differences in association or effect modification appears in epidemiological data.

6
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,730
Specifically, we're going to start by refreshing our memories as to the definition of effect modification.

7
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,260
And talk a little bit about what synergism and antagonism are.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, then spend a moment distinguishing effect modification from confounding,

9
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,420
since these two concepts often have a similarity in the sense that there's this third variable coming into play.

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:14,080
An introductory AP students often get confused between the two, recalling from the last video and your previous coursework.

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,719
Effect modification is defined as a situation in which the strength or direction of an

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,270
association between an exposure and an outcome differs according to levels of a third variable.

13
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,910
Synergism is when the risk factor is stronger in the presence of a third variable,

14
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:37,330
whereas antagonism happens when the risk factor is weaker in the presence of that third variable.

15
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:46,960
While effect modification often sounds very similar to confounding because there is this third variable that we're talking about.

16
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:53,500
It differs very importantly from confounding in that it's not a form of bias that we have to remove,

17
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,930
but rather a real phenomenon that is of interest because of this.

18
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,440
What we want to do when we see effect modification is report group specific associations.

19
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,739
In other words, that way we know the relationship between an exposure and an outcome for the

20
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,550
different groups of individuals because it does differ between those groups.

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,500
This is in stark contrast to confounding where our confounder is actually this nuisance variable

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,420
that's introducing confusion into our associations between our exposure and our outcome.

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:37,419
And what we really want to do is get rid of the impact of the confounder and report some average association for a full

24
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:44,980
population after isolating the impact of our exposure of interest on our outcome without the impact of the confounder.

25
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,250
So let's now talk about how we detect effect modification in our data.

26
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,800
There are two main approaches to do this. We'll start with the first.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:07,420
In that approach, we evaluate whether or not the effect of an exposure on an outcome differs across levels or strata of a third variable.

28
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:16,540
So let's take, for example, some exposure here shown on the X axis as E minus for those people without

29
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,900
exposure and a plus for those people with exposure for each of these groups,

30
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:29,350
you'll notice that there's some risk of an outcome that's been expressed per thousand on the Y axis.

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,890
If we were interested in some third factor Z as a possible modifier of the associations between our exposure and our outcome,

32
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:47,920
we might plot our data of E or exposure versus our outcome by levels of Z here shown

33
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,530
as Z minus for those people without Z and Z positive for those people with C,

34
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,390
if it's easier for you to think about, you might want to keep in the back of your head that e could be air pollution levels,

35
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:08,050
the outcome could be asthma and z effectively could be being a child versus being an adult.

36
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,690
Now to check if the association of interests between our exposure and our outcome differs by Z.

37
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:26,860
Whereas, modified by Z, we can simply calculate the risk difference for people in the Z positive group and those in the Z negative group.

38
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,129
Separately, if you see here,

39
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:40,090
we've calculated that among those people in the Z positive group we have a risk difference of exposed versus unexposed of 60 per thousand,

40
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,080
whereas for the Z minus group we see a risk difference of exposed, minus unexposed of only 30.

41
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,279
In other words, the association between our exposure and our outcome is nearly twice as large among

42
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,180
us people in the Z positive group as compared to those in the Z negative group.

43
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,420
You can also see this visually as well by noticing that the lines diverge from one another.

44
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,170
Again, if it's easier for you to conceptualize it,

45
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,820
you can imagine that this is the expected difference in association of air pollution, asthma between children and adults.

46
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:24,110
Now, what would the same graphic look like if we had no effect modification present in this situation?

47
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:30,770
We would expect to see parallel lines suggesting that on the additive scale, meaning looking at risk differences,

48
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,320
there is the same difference in outcome between the exposed and unexposed populations.

49
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,880
Regardless of whether or not people are in our Z plus group or Z minus group.

50
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,090
Hopefully these visualizations were helpful.

51
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:54,990
I also wanted to add the statistical model as well because in the real world very few people will ever look at effect modification by hand.

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,230
One of the reasons is just because once you start doing strata of strata, it becomes quite complicated.

53
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,420
In addition, we also are almost always adjusting for confounding factors and other features of the data when we're doing our analysis.

54
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:20,070
As a result, the way that people actually ask this question in the literature is whether or not associations differ by strata of Z explicitly.

55
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:28,200
The way that we look at whether or not the association between exposure and outcome differs by strategy is to include an interaction

56
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:37,460
term between their exposure and their effect modifier the amount by which are associations between the exposure and some outcome.

57
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,940
Why differ will now be estimated by the parameter B three.

58
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,769
In other words, that parameter, if non-zero,

59
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:57,360
is going to tell us that there is some sort of synergy or antagonism between our exposure and Z to see if this is a really important effect.

60
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:04,620
Most people will test for the statistical significance of this term before moving on.

61
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:14,580
I just wanted to add a very brief note that if the exposure is modified by some third variable Z, then inherently Z is also modified by the exposure.

62
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,970
This is a concept that's called reciprocity.

63
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:27,270
Now, with reciprocity, you might be thinking to yourself, Can I just as easily redefine Z as my exposure then and my exposure as my modifier?

64
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,160
Well, the answer, of course, would be yes. Mathematically, it has no difference at all.

65
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:39,030
Instead, in order to decide which needs to be the exposure and which the the modifier,

66
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,050
you should be thinking scientifically about your questions of interest.

67
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:53,820
It's also quite common for people to consider factors that can be intervened on as exposure and factors that are not changeable as their modifiers.

68
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,000
So now we're ready to talk about the second way that we can detect effect modification.

69
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:07,170
This method effectively looks for the presence of synergism or antagonism using joint exposures.

70
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,640
In this approach, we use the idea that if no effect modification exists,

71
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:21,260
then two independent risk factors of an Z will simply add together perfectly as shown in this graphic.

72
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:28,370
In other words, there's some baseline risk that's present for everyone, and it adds some amount of risk.

73
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:39,560
The also adds a different amount of risk. And when E and Z co-occur, the joint risk is the sum of baseline, the risk from E and the risk from Z.

74
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,160
When there is a fact modification.

75
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:52,430
However, we would expect to see that the joint exposures of E and Z is either much more than the sum of its parts with synergism,

76
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,560
or much less than the sum of its parts, as we would see with antagonism.

77
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,880
Now, going back to our previous example, we can again check for effect modification, using numbers,

78
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:12,650
using the same concept of comparing the joint effect of an Z and the sum of the impacts of an Z separately.

79
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,180
To do so, we must first isolate the impact of each and Z.

80
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:25,880
We do this by looking at the difference in our outcome between those who are exposed and unexposed, among those who are in the group without Z.

81
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:36,020
Similarly, the difference in outcome between people with and without Z can be estimated among those without exposure.

82
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,660
As shown on this slide, we see that the independent impact of E on the outcome is 30 per thousand,

83
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,850
whereas the independent impact of Z on the outcome is ten per thousand.

84
00:09:51,710 --> 00:10:03,770
Therefore, you might imagine that the expected impact of Z and E together is 40, but the observed impact of Z and E together is much closer to 70.

85
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,190
This again demonstrates the synergy that we saw before, and we can still see in the graphic,

86
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,410
just by the eyeball test, by virtue of the fact that the lines are diverging from one another.

87
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,110
Now, in contrast, I'm here showing you a scenario where the joint effects are exactly as predicted,

88
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,560
indicating no effect modification on the additive scale.

89
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,930
Well, I'm not going to go through the math on here. I do show it to you in case you'd like to see the logic.

90
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:40,440
Now importantly, you can use either method for detecting effect modification in your data.

91
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,120
And interestingly, and perhaps critically, they result in the same answer.

92
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,059
The key takeaways from this particular video are that effect modification occurs

93
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,260
when an association between an exposure and outcome depends on some third variable.

94
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,000
We've learned how you can detect effect modification by looking for differences in

95
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,950
association between exposure and outcome across different groups of your modifier.

96
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:13,500
We also learn to look for synergism or antagonism by comparing the joint effects of what's observed with

97
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,530
the exposure and the modifier as compared to what you would expect from the individual effects alone.
