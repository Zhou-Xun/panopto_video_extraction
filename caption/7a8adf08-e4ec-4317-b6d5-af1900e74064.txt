1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:15,340
It does whatever it takes to fix if you want to get rid of everyone.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,550
Let's get started. What's up tonight?

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,190
So happy Friday. We have one week until the poster session.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:38,000
So things are moving right along. And okay, so today we'll get through some logistics and for just like, you know,

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,419
five or 10 minutes and then we're going to jump into a mock poster session.

6
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:54,570
So this is really a chance for you to practice talking about your poster and what you did and to familiarize yourself with your posture.

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:05,879
Okay. So today we are going to do some informal okay.

8
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,350
So through that Mark Poser session, this is a chance to practice.

9
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:21,809
And so during the session you there's two rounds, so one round you're going to be a presenter, another round you're going to be a judge or vice versa.

10
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,160
So you're going to act as a judge.

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:34,070
And so it's also a chance it's not formal, but it's also a chance to just give some informal feedback to your peers as well on their poster.

12
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:43,320
Um, what you're you're posters, the drafts are submitted and we're going to do a really quick turnaround time as quick as we can.

13
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,480
So by Sunday you should have instructor feedback on these posters.

14
00:01:49,080 --> 00:02:02,460
And then I really encourage you to block out time Sunday evening or Monday to be able to update your poster to its final version,

15
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,989
because we need to have these printed. The goal is by Tuesday.

16
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:18,240
So on Tuesday, again, carve out some time on Tuesday to get these printed and I'll talk about that in the next slide.

17
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,510
But, you know, if you you know, you're ready to do it on Monday, do it on Monday.

18
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,640
If it has to go to Wednesday, do it. But I really just want to make sure that these can all get printed.

19
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:37,440
You know, if there's an issue with printers at FedEx or something like that, that can always come into play.

20
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,200
Okay. So. On Tuesday or whenever you're ready with your final version of your poster,

21
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,630
you're going to look at either the poster, draft assignment or the final poster.

22
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,120
Assignment in Canvas has part two of the instructions for poster printing.

23
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,389
And so on the first day of class, if you remember,

24
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:12,760
you all went through the process of part one and you got an email sent to you called The subject line should be something like you to quote,

25
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,150
put to order a printing supplier response.

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,370
So just make sure you can go back and find that email and then it'll give you directions on where to go.

27
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:32,710
I think it'll tell you to go to manage quotes. There's a space for you to upload your PowerPoint file.

28
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,030
And then I don't know what happens from there.

29
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,260
So I just assume it's going to be straightforward.

30
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,280
It's going to take you to like the FedEx site.

31
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:53,709
And what I what I would love is if someone does this on Monday, if you could just shoot me an email and just tell me, yes, this works.

32
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:59,740
It's really easy. Or if you run into any issues that would be really helpful for future.

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,640
Yes, you answered the well I'll be sending them the best version of the PowerPoint or just PowerPoint.

34
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,200
Please use the PowerPoint slide. Please use your PowerPoint file.

35
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:22,900
Yeah. And if you submitted a PDF to canvas it, if you could submit a powerpoint, it's so much easier for feedback.

36
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,950
That would be really helpful if you could. I don't know if you can.

37
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,110
Since the deadline has passed you can re-upload, but just shoot me an email with the powerpoint.

38
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:44,550
Okay. Any questions on this? But are we it from FedEx and if so, which?

39
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,110
Yes, great question. I hope I have this in the direction though I might not.

40
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,439
So. That's a really great question. So, yes.

41
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:01,420
So once you submit this, I'm hoping it's just like a couple hours and your it'll be ready to be picked up.

42
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,910
But yes, you have to go pick it up. It's the FedEx delivery.

43
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,020
It's about 10 to 15 minute walk. Yep.

44
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,480
Once we pick up the posters, are we potentially able to store them here anywhere?

45
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,950
I take the bus that I took particular if you not hearing anything in my office.

46
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:32,010
Okay, so I'm in my office or just somewhere, maybe like in the Nutritionals Sciences suite, like by the white brick.

47
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,780
Just public. And poster fare posters that you just saw around there or something like that.

48
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:46,500
Yeah. I don't think anyone's going to steal your. Any other questions?

49
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,760
There's going to be time at the end for questions, too, but ask as many questions as you need.

50
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,930
It's not really about the printing, but I know you said that like half of us next week,

51
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,380
half of us will present for the first hour, half for the second hour.

52
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,980
Are we going to know which one we are? Yes, I'll I'll I'll put that up at the end of the class.

53
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,930
Yeah. And it also gives you a little bit, too.

54
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,490
So I'll, I'll tell you what session you're going with the first one or the second one,

55
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,020
if you have a really strong preference, like you just want to be in the first session and get it out of the way.

56
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,230
I can try to accommodate that. I just want you guys to all feel comfortable.

57
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,060
Okay when we heard that and they might have already said that.

58
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:38,550
But when we present, do you want us to have just like a little spiel that we say first or just to have it ready for when people come up to our poster?

59
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,860
Yeah. So that's the point of today, right? Yeah.

60
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:49,500
The point of today is to practice your little spiel called Elevator Speech, but I'll talk more about that in just a couple minutes.

61
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,280
Yeah, I don't I don't know if somebody asked this already. And what is the dress for the poster session?

62
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,480
Is it like business casual as a form? Yeah, business casual.

63
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,500
It's a professional event. Professional development event.

64
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,090
So I would just keep that in mind as you're getting dressed for the day.

65
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,590
We keep moving forward, but stop me at any time. All right.

66
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,300
So we are going to use this time today to practice talking through the poster.

67
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,760
This is what today will look like. I'll just spend like 5 minutes.

68
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:38,159
I want to start with a quick reflection and then just talking you through what this mock poster session will look like.

69
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,430
And then again, we have two rounds.

70
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:51,400
Each will be about. About 20 minutes each, maybe a little less than that.

71
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,860
And then at the end, we'll just make sure we have time to answer all your questions.

72
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,580
Damian Okay.

73
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,000
I never look at a presenter view. I'm here, so I'm like all tripped up because it's on.

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,320
Presenter Okay, so. Me Okay.

75
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:19,620
So I just want to pose as last week we talked about what makes an effective poster presentation, which does involve an oral presentation part.

76
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:29,220
I just want to focus on that today. I'm just asking you guys what comes to mind when you think what makes an effective oral presentation?

77
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,330
Yup. Being comfortable with the content you're presenting, but not being too rehearsed?

78
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,740
Absolutely. Being comfortable with it. But you don't want to sound robotic.

79
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,240
So making sure, you know, it's not totally memorized.

80
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,200
In some situations, actually having it memorized is good.

81
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,330
But in something like a poster presentation, right? You just want to feel more like a conversation.

82
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,730
Engage the audience. Not speaking too fast.

83
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:07,360
Yes, absolutely. So making sure you're aware of your audience, engaging them, not speaking too fast.

84
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:15,050
Absolutely. No.

85
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:24,270
Making sure you're available to answer questions and being mindful to actually answer the question kind of going on.

86
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,050
Sometimes that might be like a rehearsed like piece of information.

87
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,660
Yes. And I guess going along with the engaging. So it's kind of similar to all the comments so far.

88
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,350
Absolutely. No, I think I mean, I can see it in a different way, just being open minded and taking in all the questions.

89
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,940
I think that's part of also like actively listening to your audience as well.

90
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,690
Being concise but not abrupt. Absolutely.

91
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:01,739
This, you know, artwork of brevity that we talked about on the first or second day of class and just knowing,

92
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,700
you know, how much information you have to give for it to be useful.

93
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:22,170
Oh, yeah. So if I were talking and you were something, the fact that I'm showing, I tend to bring the focus to the section that I'm talking about.

94
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,620
So people might be looking and not knowing what I'm talking.

95
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,299
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

96
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,900
You're going to have this video, you know, especially in this context, you'll have this beautiful visual aid that you've worked really hard on.

97
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:43,829
So when you are talking or going through your elevator speech or whatever, or just talking in general, answering questions, be again,

98
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:49,049
being comfortable with this visual aid that you have to know where you where you

99
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:58,230
need to guide the audience member to projecting your voice so they can hear you.

100
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,620
Yes, absolutely. Projecting your voice. I'm so familiar with that.

101
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:09,330
I'm such a soft spoken voice. So just being very comfortable, knowing your voice and how you have to project it.

102
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:16,590
Thinking about it might be a little noisy in the spaces that we're going to be in, so thinking about that aspect.

103
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:29,650
All right. All wonderful answers. These are just some things that we've probably already touched upon.

104
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:39,810
But, you know, the majority of the connection made with the audience is really not that visual connection that you have that poster behind you.

105
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,750
It is actually the face to face communication.

106
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:54,870
So just really being aware of things like making eye contact, if you are comfortable with being enthusiastic.

107
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,130
Make sure, you know, bring that that day.

108
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:07,000
Not all of us. It's not supernatural to be super those yardstick, but just make sure you have energy.

109
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:13,260
We're all going to have adrenaline on Friday. So just, you know, utilize that adrenaline that'll kind of come out naturally.

110
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,840
But I always just want to say, don't force that enthusiasm just if it's natural.

111
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,690
But you all will have some energy to work off of.

112
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,659
Just think about, you know, make make sure you're very comfortable with the audience and who you're talking to,

113
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,990
a first year student versus a faculty member.

114
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:43,810
Just think about that being open minded again to feedback actively with men, answering questions, opening up a conversation.

115
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,579
And this last thing which I want to touch upon just a little bit,

116
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:56,920
it's kind of an interesting question to think about, but promoting equity to your audience, right?

117
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:06,970
In what ways can you promote equity or inclusion when you're doing an oral presentation or in this case, a poster session?

118
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,930
You can be sure to use language that is appropriate for your audience.

119
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:25,360
So, I mean, here we're talking to your communications. But if you are, these are to general public speech.

120
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,730
Communicate in a way that isn't having jargon.

121
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,760
Absolutely.

122
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:39,040
But I even think in this case, that works like a first again, a first year student versus a Ph.D. student, whoever you're talking to, avoid jargon.

123
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,640
Right. Use language that everyone is going to understand.

124
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,630
That's a great example. What else?

125
00:13:53,930 --> 00:14:01,730
Yeah. Like most people at your post there, you make eye contact with multiple people rather than just one to make them feel very exclusive.

126
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,790
Absolutely. Yeah. Some of the answers are actually already listed on here are potential answers, right?

127
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,690
There's lots of ways to promote equity, but if you have multiple people at your post or just focus on one person,

128
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,370
try to include everyone to sort of scan your audience, it'll help them feel included and like you want them to be there.

129
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,190
Be mindful and sensitive to the fact that everyone comes from a difficult place and, you know,

130
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:36,170
the people you're presenting, you may not be as familiar with the subject matter that you're presenting.

131
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:44,170
So just present in a way and disseminate your information in a way that everyone can understand.

132
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,040
Absolutely. Coming back to that sort of that awareness that we're all at different levels

133
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:55,280
and we want to make sure that information can get across to everyone and.

134
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,870
Other specific strategies for a poster session.

135
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,700
I know some of you have probably done poster sessions, but some may have not.

136
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,930
So oftentimes you'll be talking to someone and then maybe one or two people will come in the middle of the conversation.

137
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,190
Just stop and pause and say, Welcome to poster.

138
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,809
You know, let me know if you have any questions. So just pause.

139
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,879
But then you can go back to that conversation.

140
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,830
So just sort of, you know, not making it awkward and someone just comes in, tries to like jump into your conversation, but just welcoming them,

141
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,680
they're just some of you might be I've talked to some of you if you have like

142
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,249
videos that you want to show on the side that was like one of your products,

143
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,630
just test it once you're in the room, just the wi fi, make sure that works.

144
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:56,650
And then just things like some people might just want to come and read your posters so they might not say anything to you.

145
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,920
So again, just give them the space to read.

146
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,300
I think some people are slower thinkers than others, so just be mindful of things like that.

147
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:14,799
So if you encounter someone, you just want to read your poster and you've been practicing kind of like this spiel.

148
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,020
How do you guys like when you should say your spiel and when you should just let someone read your poster?

149
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,640
Yeah, that's a great question. If they ask, right?

150
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,940
If they don't ask, don't jump into it. They might just not even want to talk to you.

151
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,210
They might just want to digest the information on the poster.

152
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:37,690
Right? Like some people are introverted, shy, like just be respectful of what they want.

153
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:49,030
So I guess that's another question. Should it be more just like a conversation instead of like a whole oral presentation?

154
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,800
Yeah. Yeah. So well, that's a great question.

155
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:02,740
And I, I'm going to jump into that because it kind of goes along with the mock poster presentation and preparing yourself to be a judge.

156
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,880
I would say one of the most common questions people come up to you and ask is, Tell me what you did.

157
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,040
Or walk me through your poster.

158
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:21,010
And so that's where that sort of like sort of elevator speech or just having something there that's probably like two ish minutes,

159
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,600
2 to 3 minutes or so is really helpful and useful.

160
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,179
And to be on that line, then they might interrupt you in the middle of the elevator speech and ask a question.

161
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,950
So that's where like the conversation, like just having a conversation with them comes into place.

162
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:46,879
You had that picture? Oh, but I thought so. I thought it was auditory in speech, but it was actually like a job fair.

163
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,580
Had the different posters on the wall or something like that. That was just a stock photo, I felt.

164
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:58,460
Oh, I'm sorry. So basically, he's whoever stop by and and you just talk a little bit like that, right?

165
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:05,900
Oh, oh, yeah. Oh, for the day of the poster session now.

166
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,459
Well the judges asked like you the question or should you know who the judges are?

167
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:18,260
Initiate that contact. Yes, great question. So the day of the poster session, you'll be assigned 2 to 3 judges.

168
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,049
Ideally, you should know who they are. It just kind of depends on who the judge is.

169
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:30,200
And if they make it obvious or don't make it obvious, some just bring, like, their little scoring sheet and do it like right there.

170
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,030
But some just come in and talk to you and try to kind of be sly about it.

171
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,200
So just don't I wouldn't even just don't worry about it.

172
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,370
Just be prepared. You know? You're going to be prepared after today.

173
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,670
You can work on it a little bit this upcoming week. But yeah, that that's a great question.

174
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,470
We kind of tell them to just, you know. You know, don't make it obvious that I'm just you.

175
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,350
Any other questions before we get into the moth cluster session?

176
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,770
You could probably think of more questions as as we keep moving forward.

177
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,930
But the macros are session again. Two rounds I'm going to put up.

178
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:26,900
Doesn't look like everyone is here, which is really unfortunate. So if you're a person you're supposed to judge is not here, just that's okay.

179
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:40,100
But if you're a judge, what I want you to do is first just sort of act like a judge, like a faculty member or staff or Ph.D. student and go in there.

180
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,399
And I have a guide here.

181
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:54,140
I think it's also on canvas, but here's a paper copy with a list of potential questions, common questions that are asked at a poster session.

182
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:03,350
So you can just pull from there. And when you're the judge, you know, just ask one or two questions or more and just actively listen.

183
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,860
Jump in with questions whenever you have questions.

184
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:13,760
And then once you guys sort of feel ready and, you know, maybe it's time to move on as the judge,

185
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:23,390
if you see any sort of any room for an adjustment or improvements on the poster itself, it's a time for just informal feedback.

186
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,260
Nothing formal, just informal if if there is anything but notice.

187
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,830
All right. So that's the judge part. If you're a judge, I just want you to be aware.

188
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,880
You have to peers that you're going to judge. Okay.

189
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:47,270
So you'll be able to find the two peers that your name is by on the next slide, but just make sure you have time for that.

190
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,530
So about 8 minutes of each peer. Right.

191
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,470
And then as the presenter,

192
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:03,170
just the time to become aware of your poster of how you're presenting and how you're talking through your poster are just sometimes a practice.

193
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:12,700
This is meant to be like a safe space. Okay. So just, you know, if you mess up, if you want to just start over, if they ask, you know,

194
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,860
tell me what you did and you talk through it and you mess up, you say, Oh, can I just like start over?

195
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:23,710
That's totally fine. So this is what it is for. Okay.

196
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,690
Any questions? All right.

197
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:37,349
Again, it doesn't look like everyone is here. So if you only have one here to judge, I guess that's fine.

198
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,210
Or you might just only have one judge. If you have no judges that are present company.

199
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,950
No. So this is the first round.

200
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:56,010
I have 15 minutes. I'll probably give you 20 if you have to come closer to see the lines and feel free.

201
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,260
And I have the paper copy of these potential questions.

202
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:17,610
Thank you. The Library of Congress for some time.

203
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,530
I really like your first one.

204
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,070
Oh, it's just.

205
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,510
No. Okay.

206
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,580
I'm judging. Yeah.

207
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,130
Judge 180 minutes was extraordinary.

208
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,920
I think it was like a shot.

209
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,980
I think I was I was starting, which was I don't know.

210
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:03,180
I think I think that's why I have the three.

211
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,360
I know. Where do we go for that? Why?

212
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:13,570
I mean, I don't know what to say, that's for sure.

213
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,090
I'm doing okay. Wow.

214
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,750
I know. I'm sure it's okay.

215
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,880
Yeah, I think everyone's just to make sure.

216
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:48,390
Oh one. Oh, oh, yeah, I think so.

217
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,820
Yeah, I just. I don't think so. Oh, okay.

218
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,040
Yeah, I guess so.

219
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:12,060
Yeah, I think so.

220
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:21,020
Yeah. I mean, it's entirely up to you.

221
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,210
Oh, okay.

222
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:44,610
You describe as like, you would tend to go whatever.

223
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:56,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:21,450
I really don't know where you find everything that goes on here is quite something that I.

225
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,020
Yeah, I think I feel like.

226
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:50,900
I mean I do say so myself, but I know for sure if I had to say yes.

227
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:11,460
Yes, yeah. Chances are you've got choice.

228
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:19,830
You can choose what I like.

229
00:26:24,680 --> 00:27:04,540
I said, I can't see what's happening in my life with these guys.

230
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:17,040
I know what I want.

231
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,340
I see what I.

232
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:43,060
I don't know who's actually fighting.

234
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:24,090
So I felt like I was isolated somehow because like I said, I felt like I had try to do it.

235
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:29,930
And it was like, yes, yes, I.

236
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:45,800
I just didn't think there was anything like you.

237
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,420
So I was like, Oh, my God.

238
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,030
Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,900
So different. But that's.

240
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:10,840
We can see how something like.

241
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:28,100
I just want to circle straight for you right now.

242
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,670
I think I know what you meant, what you said.

243
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:51,430
Yeah. I mean, because I was like, yeah, I, you know, I had.

244
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:15,380
Yeah, that's. Yeah, but it only lasted for me.

245
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:34,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

246
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,950
I like it. I read that.

247
00:30:49,040 --> 00:31:29,950
If you like that, I really feel like you have to get out of the house right now.

248
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:57,470
So they find out about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

249
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:08,040
I got a copy it.

250
00:32:11,070 --> 00:33:07,940
Just like, yeah, that's really where they have University of Michigan or something like that.

251
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,110
Yeah, I think so.

252
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:32,630
Yeah. Yeah. Actually right now, like when they were writing that.

253
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:44,430
I did. Yes. Oh, my God.

254
00:33:45,410 --> 00:34:17,959
I have to tell you, I guess I'm like, you know, yeah, I feel pretty good about it, that that's what I want to get out of that.

255
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,840
I guess I try to be.

256
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:46,540
Yeah, I want like I did like it all seems like I just want to go and get everyone.

257
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,730
I got two people to go to I'll try to spend time with.

258
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:07,250
Now, here's my take.

259
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:23,860
So much of that series of stories.

260
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:33,750
Oh, yes.

261
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:49,460
I'm here to to know if you like that guy.

262
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:09,390
And I like that.

263
00:36:09,650 --> 00:37:08,610
Yes. I think the fact that I don't think it's an attractive I guess it was another round at least six months or a year later, I was like, oh, my God.

264
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:20,330
So I think, what's the high school students?

265
00:37:20,340 --> 00:38:07,270
I think it's important to make sure that all these kind of things, I mean, I, I, I know.

266
00:38:07,460 --> 00:39:21,100
So whenever I get out of there with the ten year old, I was like capitalizing on and I felt like I was like today because I always like to go, I mean.

267
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,970
I mean, it's crazy.

268
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:52,390
It's like you're crazy, right?

269
00:39:56,610 --> 00:41:03,440
Going to. I swear, I have no idea how much African Americans are speaking out about that.

270
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:33,540
I mean, I was like I was like, oh, my God, oh, my God.

271
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:45,170
I was like, oh, my goodness.

272
00:41:47,010 --> 00:42:00,530
So I, you know, I think it's not easy to.

273
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:30,610
I found out that we found them there.

274
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:39,770
So they were here in your house.

275
00:42:42,710 --> 00:43:05,110
So I was like, Oh, my gosh.

276
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:29,150
I didn't see that when I was.

277
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:43,640
Would you do another one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

278
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,870
Oh, yeah. Oh yeah.

279
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,270
It was very quickly. Yeah.

280
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:47,090
I want to say like, oh she's like she's like I mean these are literally it's just hard, but I think there is no such thing as I don't know.

281
00:44:50,910 --> 00:45:18,720
What do you think about whether they're actually going to be like just like everybody is saying that.

282
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,580
Yeah, okay.

283
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:38,050
I like to say I actually like.

284
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,810
Oh, yeah, yeah, I think so.

285
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,760
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:37,170
Like I know I know that I can be customized to meet your needs.

287
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:46,169
And it's been it's actually been over 20 minutes. So I want to move on to the second round presented last time this week.

288
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:52,229
You're going to be a judge and vice versa. And I realize a couple of things.

289
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:57,780
Okay, guys, I'm talking about equitable teaching or presentations.

290
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,560
I probably should have provided first name tags. I'm really sorry about that.

291
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:09,840
Last year's part was trying to make you a little bit bigger, so very sorry about that.

292
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,990
Let me know if you just need to figure out who's who.

293
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:19,200
Second, it's not uncommon poster presentations to just be standing around and no one's got your poster.

294
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,690
So if both of your judges were with someone else and you're just waiting, that's totally normal practice.

295
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,320
Okay. All right, so let's switch.

296
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:36,970
Switch roles. Yeah, yeah.

297
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:44,460
It's actually magic, so I'm gonna let you see that.

298
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:53,460
Oh, yeah. No, no, I'm just having an overview of your life.

299
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:00,330
Yeah, right. Okay. Ready?

300
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:11,970
I was kind enough to look at my time here.

301
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,190
All I wish I could. You know, she's on my way to.

302
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,150
It's not like. Yeah.

303
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:43,020
Yeah. Okay. This is my average Michigan State.

304
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,940
Yeah, that's all I had to answer.

305
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:52,650
That they were going to end.

306
00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:06,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:12,030
She's. She's high energy.

308
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:53,740
So I thought I had a lot of times with, like, I was told I should be shot.

309
00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:14,340
So I said I was sorry, but I just think it's not all my stuff.

310
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:51,790
So, you know, I was in jail and I had less than 100 shots, so I just gotta go.

311
00:50:52,160 --> 00:51:29,820
So let's see how this plays out.

312
00:51:35,030 --> 00:52:06,270
So I guess if you have one of those articles, I think if you have any circumstances.

313
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:20,390
So I went so far when I came up with this idea to join our team,

314
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:40,870
they were working with prevention money from my sister and I was like, How do you balance?

315
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:58,990
All right, that's got to be so I mean, I really like I said, I know just like extra.

316
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:15,470
So I think that if you have.

317
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:33,330
So that's kind of what I hope my future work. I mean, how do you get 500 pages throughout the world?

318
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:46,090
And I do not think an exercise.

319
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:04,900
I think think it is.

320
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:22,880
Yeah. I think I know what I think in a lot of people.

321
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:31,240
So. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:43,020
Like, you know, I like the audience, but I don't know, I guess I don't know.

323
00:54:47,070 --> 00:55:28,000
So I think whatever value point and then I also like yeah, you know I don't really have anything to say about people's ability to like.

324
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:44,190
Yeah. I just want to keep it quiet.

325
00:55:44,490 --> 00:56:07,270
I, I really like, I got, I think they're all three and I took it off, but I thought was to be someone else.

326
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:52,380
Yeah. I mean, I guess I am trying to think about how to stand on it, I think.

327
00:56:54,510 --> 00:57:28,630
Yeah. Yeah. I have to tell you, I thought that was really great.

328
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:46,210
Way to make sure to switch on.

329
00:57:46,660 --> 00:58:05,000
You're thinking about, like, so many things like that.

330
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:26,730
And I'm like, Oh, yeah, I know. I know how you like, you know, they're like, Yeah, yeah, even.

331
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:50,440
I need to know how I see that program.

332
00:58:54,080 --> 00:59:01,710
I think it may turn out all the time.

333
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:37,210
And I think that when I say some of these things, I would ask you talk.

334
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:54,690
I want to try to figure out what I want to say.

335
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:58,240
I'm not all right.

336
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:23,370
Things that matter to me. For the first time, I was proud to be like Jesus Christ was for me, I think, by now.

337
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:28,460
But I don't know.

338
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:43,450
I just Larry, I think I can make sense, but I think I do.

339
01:00:43,450 --> 01:01:20,190
But I think I can make it easier for maybe my friend to get a hold of you for myself, like a nine year old across the street there.

340
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:38,350
And I was like, you know, Ellie?

341
01:01:48,570 --> 01:02:09,510
Yeah. So that's kind of people.

342
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:28,200
I felt like I was like, I think you're right.

343
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:42,450
I should be right. And then it sounds like, yeah.

344
01:02:43,150 --> 01:03:28,130
So I was like, I won't tell you, but I feel like especially I know that I don't like it or not.

345
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:36,920
I still that in the show and I still there.

346
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:46,390
So I think it makes it harder to see your body.

347
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,450
That's what I was thinking.

348
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:30,870
But I feel like. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

349
01:04:35,600 --> 01:05:04,770
Because he was like, you know, start over literally.

350
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:10,040
Like, I don't think right now.

351
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:15,410
Right now. Oh, no, I haven't.

352
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:41,620
So I don't I don't know.

353
01:05:41,960 --> 01:06:02,960
I don't know. I want to make it all comes down here, so.

354
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,750
Yeah, exactly.

355
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:17,080
Yeah, exactly.

356
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:27,350
No, not at all. Right, right.

357
01:06:31,190 --> 01:07:11,390
I mean, it's just, you know, you don't want to be like, you know, I was thinking that I don't I'm not I don't have any money.

358
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:50,270
So it's like, well, I think I can, you know, maybe I'm like, Oh, my God.

359
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:20,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

360
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:34,660
I think I would say.

361
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:47,330
Well, it's like a long time to.

362
01:08:52,590 --> 01:09:58,390
I was never laid down, you know, in the dead of winter time that the fastest growing segment, I don't know, use a lot of seats in the House.

363
01:09:59,090 --> 01:11:00,899
I just want you to know that whenever I see your house, I think I like well, I just said, yeah, I think we're gonna like this.

364
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:09,570
I think we're going to ask if you guys want to see three year old.

365
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:28,059
All right. So I want to hear from you guys.

366
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:35,120
Maybe, you know, anything that's worth sharing with others, but what did you guys learn from this poster presentation?

367
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,760
Yeah. Practice. Yep.

368
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:43,910
Practice. No. Any oral presentation.

369
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:50,050
It's just funny how you just always have to practice, like at least three times or something.

370
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:57,890
Yeah. Anything else mean is, like, either hard or.

371
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:05,620
I think what you said is so much better. Just be comfortable and very considerate because you don't want to give a great speech.

372
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:10,850
And someone asked you a question and you're like. I know, right?

373
01:12:10,870 --> 01:12:15,860
Yeah. Just that time to get familiar with you. You made it, right?

374
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:22,280
You make it. But if you never look at it intently, it's surprising how unfamiliar you can be.

375
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,130
And a similar idea to you with your poster is helpful.

376
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:33,569
Having to talk about it because we do identify which parts of my poster I found are most important.

377
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:36,900
So when giving that sort of elevator pitch, I can really focus on.

378
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,850
Certain like key points rather than reading the whole thing. Right.

379
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,110
Yeah. The important point of like articulating out loud or to someone.

380
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:51,090
Right. You can practice things in your head, but it's just not the same as out loud.

381
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:55,110
Your voice is actually being heard. And you have two things.

382
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:06,600
I think along that line talking about it and then realizing I can add more to my poster, like discussing it.

383
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:12,629
And then we had a great feedback like you can add that into your poster,

384
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:17,100
like I hear you talking about it, but it wasn't in my post or some tips like that.

385
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:24,929
Yeah. Yeah, that's a great point. And also thinking like this is a it's tricky because it's an oral presentation and a visual presentation.

386
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:27,630
So not everything has to be in your poster.

387
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:37,170
There's things that you can just say too, but trying to find that fine balance of what could be in the poster and what I just said.

388
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:45,830
Know that sometimes even though you have like your elevator speech, depending on who you're talking to, it might not just go that way.

389
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:51,370
It might the conversation might be directed in another area if they have a question in the middle of it or not.

390
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:57,880
Yeah, absolutely. Being able to sort of think on your toes is really important in these situations.

391
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:05,090
Oftentimes we just want to get through the whole summary or elevator speech, and if you're interrupted, it can throw you off.

392
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:13,390
So just, you know, being aware and just trying to calm yourself, slow down and you can jump back into it if needed.

393
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:21,470
You know, I need to simplify my statement straight to the point.

394
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:31,520
Yep. So, yep. Just again, figuring out the brevity of the poster presentation, what's what's important and what's what's not important.

395
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:47,540
Anything else? All right, here is a chance to just ask questions.

396
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:52,860
I know I already answered a lot, but does anyone have questions before next Friday?

397
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:59,450
Yes. So I know you sort of alluded to it by. So I asked the question,

398
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,909
like describe like what was your experience basically in kind of like waiting to hear elevator speech and like halfway through,

399
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:14,310
they do ask you a question that kind of derails you. Is it preferred to go back to your elevator speech afterwards or like continue asking questions?

400
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:22,700
Yeah, I think it's just you have to assess the situation. They ask, you know, if they ask a question, you answer it.

401
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:27,120
Maybe it elicits more conversation. You probably don't have to go back to it.

402
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,940
If it doesn't, if it's just sort of you answer a question, that's it. Then you can probably just jump back into it.

403
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:37,230
I think you just have to get a feel for how it's going. Everyone's could be a little different.

404
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,510
Sir had said that if we wanted to have our products there, he wanted to have a video.

405
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:47,740
Is there like a table or kind of how it is that I like? Yes.

406
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:56,650
So the posters will be on a easel that are all set up on tables so that you'll have a sitting in front of your poster.

407
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:03,000
I'll have a table right next to you. Yep.

408
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:11,230
If we wanted to bring like, like, for example, since I did like a sports setting one, like if I have like gear that I wanted to bring,

409
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,610
like, well, we have our own table where we can, like, lay things that we got and that like.

410
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:19,750
So I'm like, you will not have a ton of space.

411
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:28,100
I'm trying to think. So it'll be a tables just lined up like this.

412
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:33,380
Posters are pretty close together. Let's see, there's 38 of you.

413
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:38,390
Actually, we might. We might be able to spread you out a little bit because we also have two rooms, so.

414
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,910
Let me make a mental note. I think you'll have enough room.

415
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:50,290
I think that's just the question. If not, what the shift like we saw there.

416
01:16:53,390 --> 01:17:00,050
I have a question about printing. So if we submit it to FedEx on Tuesday, would that be okay?

417
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:13,040
Like that? Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, I think once you submit to FedEx, it's probably just an hour or a couple hours until you pick it up, maybe 24 hours.

418
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,629
So. But they are going to be getting 38 of them in a small period of time.

419
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:23,890
So just keep that in mind. But honestly, for them, it should just be a click of a button and the prints.

420
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:32,600
So yeah, that is just like I haven't done it beyond the uploading in our system.

421
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:41,570
So if anyone does this on Monday, just please shoot me an email and just let me know how it goes or if you come into any issues.

422
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:47,330
Because then I have we have to do like I have to figure it out or we have to do something else.

423
01:17:48,890 --> 01:18:00,970
But it should be fingers crossed. It should be on. Any other questions?

424
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:08,490
Okay. Just let me know if you have other questions this upcoming week.

425
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:17,280
This is how I split the sessions up. So each session is 45 minutes in your session asks Why does he stand by your poster the whole time?

426
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:22,350
If you are not presenting, you are expected to still be there and support your peers.

427
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:26,460
So even if you're presenting at 1045, you still need to be there.

428
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:31,020
At ten, you have to set up your poster anyway. Your poster should be hung the entire time.

429
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:37,380
So try to get there at like 950, 955 so you can have your poster.

430
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:40,889
So that second one is supposed to be till 1130, right? Yes.

431
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:47,260
1130 and only a 5304.

432
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:50,060
So is there any pro hard advice?

433
01:18:50,070 --> 01:19:00,060
Because I know in 1681, like everyone was talking at once, that can be kind of hard for account balances as I protocol or any advice from.

434
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,290
I don't think so again. Hopefully we'll be able to spread out. We also have 16.

435
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:09,870
I think we can fit quite a few people in there.

436
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:13,310
So that really helped last year in terms of numbers.

437
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:19,890
I think it will be about the same. I think it will be pretty doable. If you're hard of hearing, let me know.

438
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:25,610
We can put you in 1690. It'll be a little quieter in terms of cause I do.

439
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:31,000
If you're comfortable letting me come. Okay?

440
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:35,400
Yeah. So where do we show up next Friday?

441
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:41,070
So it should be in the syllabus. If you have any doubt, it should be in the syllabus.

442
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:45,960
If not, let me know. But 1680 and 1690. So that's like the CIA.

443
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:51,810
Okay, it's like right when you walk to page one. But you.

444
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:07,380
No question. But there. Be expected to be at this session.

445
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:10,670
We are not in this, so. Yes. Okay. Yep, yep.

446
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:16,330
You're supposed to be there for peer support and everyone should have their poster hung by 10:00.

447
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,620
You just have to bring a poster. Okay. We have slips and everything to.

448
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,940
We will find it. We'll have our name somewhere.

449
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:35,849
Yeah, I'll probably. I'll send you guys a canvass announcement because I'll update this because also, again,

450
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:41,280
if you prefer one session over the other, for whatever reason, I've already had a couple of people.

451
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:48,090
Let me know. I'll send this in a canvas announcement and I'll actually put your poster numbers in here as well.

452
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:54,630
The abstract booklet. I'll have to check with Casey.

453
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:58,260
Usually the abstract she is. This is the first time she's doing it.

454
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:02,349
Carol usually does it. That usually has the poster number in it.

455
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:08,890
So I'll just make sure she hasn't printed it yet that the poster numbers are in as well.

456
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:14,560
They will also in a campus announcement with more more info or updated info.

457
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:27,650
Okay. So he said, I just want to walk through some of these things.

458
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:38,360
Just a reminder. Finalize and poster by Tuesday, the 27th that runs into Wednesday, it's probably fine.

459
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:47,030
Thursday might be a little too late. Okay. So just again, just in terms of organization and having these things on your calendar,

460
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:54,110
making time for them on the poster fairs on Friday, you'll each have at least two judges.

461
01:21:54,500 --> 01:22:01,680
There's monetary prizes. That's the purpose of the judges and monetary prizes for first place, second place.

462
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:07,870
And then there's I think there's an honorable mention and a student choice.

463
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:19,240
So the first year the votes are evaluated, and I think the first race of her first place is like 150 bucks.

464
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:24,170
So it's pretty, pretty good deal. I think the honorable mentions are like 75.

465
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:29,570
So it's a nice chunk of money. Yes.

466
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:35,180
Is the judging just for that or is it probably. I agree.

467
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,470
Yeah. In terms of. No, no, no, no.

468
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:44,729
I'm not judging since I'm creating. I'm not judging. There is a bias.

469
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:54,530
And so that's where ever since I started doing this, the also the I think I consider the judging criteria just so you guys,

470
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:57,870
you get sort of a sense of what they're looking for. Someone just asked about that.

471
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:10,020
Okay. I think that's an. The Introduction to Interprofessional Education Module is just reminders to October 2nd.

472
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:11,580
If you haven't done it yet,

473
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:19,079
if you want to do the poster from Friday and then just do the module after it so you don't have to think about both of them simultaneously.

474
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:24,330
And it's totally fine. Just give yourself about an hour to do that module.

475
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:33,360
And then October 7th we're doing an in-class group project and presentation.

476
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:42,240
So you're going to be working in a group and you're going to work on a case where you're going to think about proposing a healthy,

477
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:48,330
safe city on based on complete streets, if you guys have ever heard of that.

478
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:55,890
But I'll talk a little bit about that on October 7th, this is going to meet an MPH competency.

479
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,840
So class is required. Attendance is required that day.

480
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:04,209
If you cannot be here, you need to let me know.

481
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:08,550
So we need to figure that out. Okay. I'm.

482
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:20,510
But me know if you have.
