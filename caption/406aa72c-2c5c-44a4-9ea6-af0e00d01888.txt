1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:13,320
Davis. I.

2
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,850
Sorry. This has all been festering within the world. Operating now.

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,490
All the what? Drama. Chess. Drama. Oh, no.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,480
Because I missed something. It's a big fat. Oh, interesting.

5
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,350
This is. I have.

6
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:46,170
I feel like I lately I've not been able to, like, get out because not being able to catch up on stuff and then I get behind the world where I live.

7
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:54,090
The idea that the crew is going to give us a cultural scandal presentations.

8
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:05,350
I mean, so so many I know I feel like well, we're certainly well with, you know, like everything is relative.

9
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,230
Everything is relative. But we were having this was like a world history test today.

10
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,900
Like it was just like it was wrong. And I was like, why don't we do more about this?

11
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,670
Why don't we do more about this? But it didn't connect. And that was like a great, amazing discussion.

12
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,360
I was like, There's just so much history. It adds on every year.

13
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,089
Like, it's was like an art history. It's over, you know, in this country, like, so limited.

14
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,500
And think about all these other, you know, so he was just like a little like 14 year old mind was like.

15
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,720
And so it was like, yeah, yeah.

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,090
Like really enthused about it. But I was always like, ripped from the headlines.

17
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,650
Like, there's so much. Oh, it's going on.

18
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,700
Let's see. Okay, so this is good. Just we were just.

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:05,310
We were, like, so deep into this conceptual model, this focus of, okay, I gotta go, but okay, so we want to hear from.

20
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,380
And then we said we would do conceptual models first and then you can, because I'm getting blinded by this thing like this.

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,980
Cool. Okay. So I will also say, like, well, we can come back to and do conceptual model stuff,

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,890
but I'll just run, run through some, some stuff and I just don't see that.

23
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:38,090
She's a weird. I feel like these things are just. Somehow they've been moved around.

24
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:46,670
Is that. Yeah. It's like it's weird and it's like the wheels lock, so I got to go.

25
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,520
I don't understand why this is the way it is. Okay. Sorry.

26
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,300
I can see some of that better. Look at this.

27
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,670
Is this bizarre? All right. I may call them after that.

28
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,240
Okay. So we can talk about conceptual models.

29
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,050
We'll hear from quiet and then have like these sort of navigating the Ph.D. kind of like.

30
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,860
Slides sort of an overview which we can also point to another day, but I'll get there.

31
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,760
So I wanted to dove in a little more deeply into those conceptual models.

32
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,999
We didn't because we did all of your guys conceptual models last time, but so we didn't go through the readings ones.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,750
And I just like to kind of go through these. And again, you guys all are like at a good high statistical level of your all taking the 700.

34
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,990
So I think that that's, you know, some of this might be like very straightforward, but it's always good to kind of review.

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,010
So one of these really is readings from last week that were like studies that are testing different conceptual models.

36
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:09,730
So this Gonzales study was asking about do like social determination, theory, constructs of autonomy, relatedness and competence.

37
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:18,100
Explain the association between X and physical and mental health control and person covariance.

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,400
So like it's kind of straightforward question, big question, but straightforward.

39
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,850
And then I would say like from this question, can you identify like what would be the mediator variables?

40
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,110
What would be the predictors and the outcomes? Sorry.

41
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,100
And I said already, but any other variable types here. Sorry.

42
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,780
It's really. Oh.

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,240
Perfect. Okay. I just need to get that report out of the way.

44
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,530
So what do you guys think here in terms of these variable types?

45
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:13,010
What the predictors are. What the outcomes are in this research question.

46
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:26,930
Socioeconomic status. He gave it by the time of the.

47
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,180
Exactly. Awesome. And it helps, you know, to draw it out.

48
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:43,180
But I think that's it's a good illustration of just like getting in your head, like, okay, this is my research question.

49
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,059
It leads me to this kind of conceptual model and here's what the picture looks like for them.

50
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:58,990
And I said, it's like straightforward, but it's not simple because, you know, this is complex to measure here, like some covariance.

51
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:05,050
And here are the measures that they're looking at is physical health authorities are they're putting a lot of things,

52
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:13,870
mental health authority in a lot of things. So just to kind of make the point like here's our conceptual model, our predictor outcomes that are here.

53
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,530
And then this is the like causal model diagram.

54
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,319
So there's all sorts of boxes and circles that, you know, we talk about in structural equation modeling,

55
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:30,790
which I'm not going to talk about, which is just sort of so like even this kind of simple question, you know, we empirical variance.

56
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:38,290
So we have a lot to to measure and look at and consider that's the mediator example.

57
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,610
And then the other example, which is.

58
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:52,600
RAZ is a little bit more complicated because I think moderation is always a little bit more complicated.

59
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:06,399
But this one is basically looking at this question about how do gender roles, beliefs about gender roles, moderate or I'm sorry,

60
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,610
how do you how do these norms moderate the association between gender role attitudes and dating violence?

61
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:21,010
So that's like their research. QUESTION. So basically they're saying, you know, if there were a straightforward association.

62
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,809
With between gender roles and dating violence.

63
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:34,879
We would just see that people with more traditional gender roles are endorsing more dating violence or engaging in more dating violence.

64
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,540
And that would be like that simple, positive correlation association.

65
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:51,770
But what they are testing is whether the person's belief system, like these norms about the normativity and acceptability of dating violence,

66
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:03,890
whether that is actually the moderator, like the conditions under which you see them and the association between general norms and dating violence.

67
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,180
And that relationship is not there if the person doesn't hold those beliefs.

68
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
So that person could have traditional general attitudes.

69
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:22,100
But if they don't believe that these norms are if they don't buy into the norms of dating violence as prevalent and acceptable, then they don't.

70
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:30,950
Then there's no association. And that's, like, overly simplifying, but that's the idea of the moderation.

71
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:40,850
Mm hmm. And then here are these results, as we would present them in the table.

72
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,390
And one can, like, always think of this, like, especially with moderation, because it's so visual.

73
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,910
I'm like, I could, like, hack my way through the table and understand it, but it's helpful to see the visual.

74
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,510
And I think that's helpful for like for you guys when you're like thinking presenting your moderation results to other audiences,

75
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:08,960
like how can I visualize these results or show these results in a way that the take home message is clear?

76
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,920
And I think particularly for moderation, because you're splitting things up into groups or levels.

77
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,130
It's much more powerful, though, like show the picture.

78
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:31,580
And so here's the picture for this one, which is that here, like if we had no moderation, if beliefs about,

79
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:39,300
you know, dating violence did not matter and we got in general predict general attitudes, predict levels.

80
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:48,620
We just see that. Nice positive line here. But what we found and it's kind of a that's like a pretty awesome moderation grass

81
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,880
like they're not usually they're not ads always like so dramatically different.

82
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,150
But what they found is that here if you have low acceptance that dating violence is okay.

83
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,780
Like you don't believe dating violence is okay. You don't buy into that.

84
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,870
It like breaks the association between gender role attitudes and dating violence.

85
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:21,050
Like there is no association. But if you have high acceptance of dating violence being okay, then the more traditional your general attitudes are,

86
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,160
the more you be likely to engage in dating violence or received any violence.

87
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:36,860
So that is the kind of key relationship there. And it's only true under the condition of having that belief.

88
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:49,309
And so I think what's and I like this example, it has a little a little bit you know, look, people are not in this field.

89
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,270
It's a little tricky to wrap your head around the variables a little bit.

90
00:10:52,280 --> 00:11:02,930
But I think what's cool about this is that it shows like if we were going to do an intervention to like prevent dating violence.

91
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,440
What would we do? And this kind of guides us to say, Huh?

92
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:14,680
It might be kind of wasted effort to just ask people about what are your general attitudes?

93
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,600
And use that as like our screening of like who might benefit from being in this intervention.

94
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:26,500
But what we should be looking at is, you know, here, do people have high acceptance of dating violence?

95
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,490
And that may be like.

96
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:39,820
The both a way to screen the people who might benefit from an intervention or we might want to focus on in an intervention and enroll.

97
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,050
And also, it could be like the target of the intervention.

98
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,559
I hate the word target. I was try not to use it, but it's such a handy word sometimes.

99
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:54,430
But like the focus of the intervention could be on dating violence beliefs as opposed to

100
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,270
trying to change people's general attitudes because that just may not matter as much.

101
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,710
And so I think that's a good example of I often use the phrase like moderation.

102
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:12,040
It's important to look at moderators so that we can find out what works best for home in interventions.

103
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:19,570
And I think this illustrates that well because we want to know what kind of intervention,

104
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,330
what's the focus of the intervention, and for whom would we be trying to do this intervention?

105
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,380
And I think I often put that like this is just like a.

106
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,200
It's something to think about for like paper writing or framing your research or writing a grant.

107
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:45,709
Like if you're going to have a moderator in your model or in your hypotheses, like you're like, I really think that this variable moderates,

108
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:55,160
things like the way to kind of link that to intervention is really that what was well, what works best for whom idea.

109
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:05,150
Because moderators really help us focus like limited resources in interventions on the people who are most likely to benefit from it.

110
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:19,510
And then in contrast, mediation is more the question of what are the mechanisms by which this relationship gets established?

111
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:29,970
And then when you have a research question like that, that's more like exploratory maybe or, you know, I want to do this intervention here, too.

112
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,510
You know, again, it kind of disrupts in a different way. That's a threat.

113
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,240
Mediation moderation can kind of be tricky to tease apart.

114
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:46,770
But if your focus if your primary focus is really on like what are the mechanisms by which this association emerges?

115
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,810
And if like mechanism or pathway is in like your thoughts or your writing, then you're talking about mediation.

116
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:04,770
And then if you can frame your question as what are the conditions under which this is true, then you're talking about moderation.

117
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:15,330
And so just kind of. It helps to kind of put your like align your your questions,

118
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:23,700
the variables that you have access to and your statistical analysis and make it all like a clear progression.

119
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,980
And I will say here, too, about moderation.

120
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:40,980
I often talk about like gender as a moderator variable because most data sets, it's split into dichotomous, you know, two different variables.

121
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:47,770
And that's like a clear moderator because there's two levels of that variable.

122
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,050
Again, in most data sets. With a variable like this.

123
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:01,469
They probably had to play around with their cutoff of how how high a level of dating violence.

124
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,090
Do you have to have acceptance of dating violence? Do you have to have before you're in a high group?

125
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:10,130
Like, where do we split? So do you guys have played around with interaction effects before?

126
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:16,530
Moderation. People do like a median split of, you know, above and below the median.

127
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,900
People say like, oh, you have to be a standard deviation above.

128
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,900
So like, people kind of play around with that moderation thing, with moderation groups, with continuous variables.

129
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,959
And so that can, again, like kind of add just the level of complexity in terms of which variables are thinking about as

130
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:41,780
a moderator of associations in your in a research question or where different variables fit.

131
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:49,110
So these are kind of again, these are like real but simple ish examples,

132
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,470
but there's a lot of like thought process that goes into sort of presenting is finished results.

133
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:04,100
And then I like to kind of really harp on mediation of moderation for a while because it gets like, again, once you guys are in,

134
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,769
in with your own data and they're like figuring out like everything could be a mediator or a moderator, like how, what, what's the answer?

135
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:19,889
And like there's no answer, but like, these are these different ways to, to force yourself to make it go in one direction.

136
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:25,350
And then at that direction, you're like, Oh, I really thought it was mediation and it's not.

137
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,970
And I'll talk more about then you kind of can retool the way you're thinking about associations in your models.

138
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,900
Okay. The other thing.

139
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah. Let's talk about this a little bit more. Um, this.

140
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,450
This is kind of more like what we were doing the other day.

141
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:56,820
So this idea of here's my model of, like, everything going, you know, all the different things that might be affecting the process I'm interested in.

142
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,710
And like, that's not really a testable model, but it's a good like this is what I,

143
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:10,620
how I think the world works kind of model and you could break it up and do a lot of different studies with it like you could do here.

144
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:18,720
Thinking about the piano worms. They could be like. You know, there's an association between poor coping strategies and disordered eating,

145
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:26,880
but maybe peer norms and moderate that because you might seek help to get better coping strategies and reduce your disordered eating.

146
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,210
But that's like a small part of that model. Okay, there's my favorite slide again.

147
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:43,620
Okay. And so thinking about how we, you know, develop these we've talked about this a little bit.

148
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,810
And this just again, to kind of link back to those earlier ideas we've been talking about.

149
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,260
Keeping track adequate time.

150
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:02,490
So we read all those articles about like how to skim, how to read the literature, how to be like scholars before researchers.

151
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:11,250
And so all of that is like you guys are marinating and like steeping in your topics and getting to know your topics and you know,

152
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,060
figuring out like one of my little search terms, all of that stuff.

153
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:22,110
And it's all very like broad and, and, you know, mastering like, you know, huge body of literature.

154
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,249
Um, and I think this is such an important part,

155
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:34,680
and that's sort of like when we're in the depth of statistical analysis and like fighting with our statistical programs like this can kind of go away.

156
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,660
But then it's like, you've got to come back and be like, Okay, what's the big picture?

157
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,690
What other people found? Where should I place all these things in my model?

158
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:52,350
And then the other thing that we haven't totally talked about a lot, but you know, it's super relevant for grant writing as well as papers.

159
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,319
Is that like what are the measures that are out there?

160
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,430
And I would argue like I have on my files, like on the server, I have like a just a file, it's called measures.

161
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,970
And as I like come across measures and I try to sort them, I have like parenting measures,

162
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,650
depression measures, child emotion regulation, like billions of measures.

163
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,220
And I sometimes go to that file and just cruise through to see what I have thrown in there,

164
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,469
because you could be reading a paper on a totally different topic and you're like, Oh, they measured my constructs.

165
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:32,340
Like, I'm going to grab that measure. And the thing is, is like what your forgets where you found it.

166
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,749
And it's helpful to just like kind of stockpile measures that you think might

167
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,360
be of use to you in a very specific place that's like around measurement,

168
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,370
because when you need them in a hurry, like if you're asked to purchase paper grant proposal or something provides,

169
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,480
you have a measure of this and they're not like searching the literature of new to find those measures.

170
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,960
So that can be helpful. Um, okay.

171
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:05,670
And then we also talked about practice based evidence already in terms of just what works in the real world, where are the gaps.

172
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:16,250
And that Perez reading was another one from the other week where they really I think it's a nice paper because

173
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,640
it this is this one that's talking about the modified theoretical framework that I have a few slides about,

174
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,320
but they're really using this sort of practice based evidence to say, okay, we have this model that we're testing,

175
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,240
this intervention now, we're going to very systematically integrate like our practice based evidence of what works in the real world.

176
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,670
And we have to adapt our theory driven model to new and new context.

177
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:58,730
Um, and so this is this example of the other four as one is this with this existing model, this, this conceptual model, again, looks kind of simple.

178
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,950
We can all imagine ways that this model like becomes super complicated really easily.

179
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,450
But the basic idea is like, okay, we have information about adherence.

180
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:17,450
We have motivation to adhere to our, you know, medical regimen or our diet or whatever our, you know, adherence goals are.

181
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:24,170
We are getting those are those are getting us skills that we can adhere with.

182
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,110
And then we practice adherence behavior. And then if we practice adherence behavior, we have better health outcomes.

183
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,880
So like, that's this, you know, basic model of adherence.

184
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,809
And so what these guys did is they looked at like this idea of practice.

185
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:51,770
They use practice based evidence to sort of adapt, evaluate and adapt to this model, this concept of these models in this very particular setting.

186
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:58,700
So they were conducting like qualitative research. They're an HIV treatment setting in Uganda and Nigeria.

187
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:05,600
And they were saying, okay, taking that conceptual model, like, how does this work in our context?

188
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,430
And I think what I like about this piece is that it kind of goes ticks.

189
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:18,590
It's like it ticks through the steps of like, will this work with my contacts, with my population and why not?

190
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,139
And are there concepts that are missing?

191
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,720
So then you kind of go back to that, like throwing up your concept conceptual model on the wall and like putting in new concepts.

192
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
And then this is again where like measurement comes back in.

193
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:39,979
So we all know like you can translate a measure in a language, you can check in with people from the culture to which you're translating the measure.

194
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,850
And they might be like, What the heck? This is a goofy measure. It means nothing to me.

195
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:52,610
I don't get these constructs. So like there's different levels of that translation of measures for sure, as well as concepts.

196
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,290
And then does your model that we're working with capture the complexity in new settings?

197
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:04,700
So it's like those steps we all kind of go through those, but it's nice to kind of see them presented in this kind of formal way.

198
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:15,010
And then the Perez article, which is this one, is the one that says, okay, we modify, you know,

199
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,989
because of these tensions that we've uncovered when we went through the steps to say how this model doesn't totally work,

200
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,910
we have to do things a slightly different way.

201
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:31,640
What's fidelity to the original model and what's like adaptation that will like make this model relevant and actually work in this setting?

202
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,570
And so they present this model of like how to go through that adapt adaptation process,

203
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,889
which I also kind of I just as you guys can probably tell me, I love papers where they like lay out the process for you.

204
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:56,630
It's so helpful. And what they did was they talked about they added variables like setting situations.

205
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,950
What, you know, these, these things are maybe moderators of whether your intervention is going to work or not.

206
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:11,000
And then they looked at adaptation and fidelity instead of that sort of strict adherence.

207
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,470
And then they adapted also the terminology of the variables that we're talking about.

208
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:25,040
So here they were talking about like how did that intervention get used as opposed to like did they do the intervention right?

209
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:33,829
And so I feel like that in behavioral interventions is such a critical piece and people do it all the time,

210
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,909
but they don't always like formally talk about it and how they did it.

211
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:47,569
And so, you know, those of us who've done adaptations either like purposefully and plan fully or like on the fly when you're like,

212
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:56,930
Oh my gosh, this isn't working, what are we going to do? Like these are kind of all the steps that we tend to go through in that in that process.

213
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:06,230
Okay. So I know that's a lot of like heady information for like early in the morning.

214
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:17,629
Um, but I would say that, that her read like that piece, this Perez article, it's, I like it because it does sort of go through these different steps.

215
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,810
And so it's probably a good one to like hang on.

216
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,930
And if you're, if you find yourself in that space when you're like,

217
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,709
if you're writing about or thinking about adapting to adapting an existing intervention or theoretical model,

218
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,640
this is like a good one to say what are the steps?

219
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,570
And it's, you know, like a reference to say, hey, sometimes the models need to be adapted.

220
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:47,400
There are actually systematic steps we should go through when we're considering how to adapt our theoretical models and our organizations to,

221
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,450
like, meet our population. Um.

222
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:57,160
Okay. So that's those like articles. And then I just have a few other.

223
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,280
Little slides to go through. I'll go through those and then we can and then we can hear from Quayle, or I'll think about all these variables.

224
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,540
Okay. So this idea of moving from conceptual model to research question.

225
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:23,840
This is, again, like thinking about that article where we have like X and SD T variables and health outcomes.

226
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,640
So our predictors here are x a predictor.

227
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,020
Very simple. Why is our outcome and is our mediator?

228
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,410
And I don't know how much you guys are doing of this.

229
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,510
If you're doing this in 700 or another world or if people have done mediation.

230
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:57,000
But this idea of mediation, there's definitely there's sort of a history of different ways of testing mediation statistically what people use.

231
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,270
Well. It's still kind of true that people require that this,

232
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:11,070
but it is true that people require this relationship between X and Y to be there before you can talk about mediation.

233
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,229
That's that sort of classic mediation. So like X and Y are associated.

234
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:25,770
But when I put in M, it explains more of the variance between X and Y, like it makes the relationship between X and Y directly.

235
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:37,110
Does Part C shrinks when I put in because M is doing a really good job explaining the process, the mechanism of association between X and Y.

236
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,490
So that's kind of a classic way to think about mediation.

237
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,249
And then I would say, and this is where I would ask Justin, people like Martin that questions.

238
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:55,140
But recently people talk more about like the passing of different paths and different variances.

239
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:03,990
And so the idea that like how much is part A and B, these indirect paths,

240
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:11,350
how much are they contributing and how much is C contributing and how much in total are they contributing?

241
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:20,970
So there's a very strict like test of mediation that says like Path C has to go down by X amount in order for mediation to be present.

242
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:27,240
And I think in like more recent modeling, that's not always required.

243
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:39,870
But this is the idea of mediation where like chunking up the associations into these indirect paths here, and this is still the direct path.

244
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:46,020
If you're for mediation, the direct like that part will like cease to exist.

245
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,380
So basically like. Social Determinants.

246
00:28:49,640 --> 00:29:01,410
Social determinants of self-determination model variables explain the full relationship between ESCS and physical health,

247
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,770
which we know not to be the case. Right. So we know there's still like something going on or maybe other mediation or moderation.

248
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,080
But so how much of the variance are those guys explaining? Okay.

249
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,420
And so we can ask tons of those.

250
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,050
What are the process by which research questions with meanings.

251
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,930
And then again, like, we get more and more complex groups, we get a little more complicated and we say like,

252
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:37,620
Oh, we think that both of these predictors, multiple predictors contribute to shaping our meeting or.

253
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,800
And then go on to why. So we could think about like what?

254
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,270
What are the things aside from X that might shape social.

255
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:55,110
Yeah, I keep saying social determinants because that was my first call and they're like the same acronym but self-determination theory.

256
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:03,450
Could it be like there's X and here's like, you know, grit or something?

257
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:11,250
Right. These can both shape our our likelihood of of endorsement, of social determination,

258
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,460
self-determination theory and then help them so we can spin this model out in many ways.

259
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:29,940
And then we've talked about this before in moderation. So the idea with moderation is that, again, we still have our predictor, our outcome.

260
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,450
And now Emma's our moderator and I always put conditional variable there.

261
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:43,190
Um, and then this is the kind of research question again, like what works best for whom, under whose under which conditions?

262
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:54,150
Is this relationship true between X and Y? And then this is that same graph that just sort of broken up to show that group one,

263
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:02,050
we don't have to go through this, but group one is that group where that has a positive association between X and Y.

264
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:12,090
This is how we're splitting up and testing our moderation. And it's these guys with the high acceptance of domestic violence and or dating violence.

265
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:19,080
And then Group two has this non-significant relationship looks like it's a little bit negative stuff, like you test the slopes.

266
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,620
You guys have talked about that or done that. You want to test that.

267
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:30,810
You have moderation because you could have moderation like this and like this and then both slopes would be significant.

268
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,670
But here, only one that's significant, that's like more positive association.

269
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:41,190
This one is not associated, but this could be negative or it could be differentially positive.

270
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,620
And this is again, just like to go with that previous example.

271
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,200
This is how they break it up and group. Um.

272
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,299
Okay. I think this is what I was saying before.

273
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,830
I like how you define your groups. Really does drive interpretation of your findings.

274
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:08,330
So, again, it could seem simple at first you could find moderation and say, Oh, wow, I found moderation.

275
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,879
And then you like go back to your data like, oh, it's opposite from what I said,

276
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,290
but it's actually working in a funky way, and that's when you want to go back and do all those processes.

277
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:25,330
I would say, look, for like understanding how your variables work together, why this might be and selects which of your variables as a moderator.

278
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,150
Okay. And this is an example of that.

279
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:38,740
This is like a border in my in my experience, like moderators don't really cleanly divide all the time.

280
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:48,370
And so this is more of a like kind of typical example. So here we have this association between stress and depression, predictor and outcome.

281
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:55,510
Social support is our moderator. So we're saying that like under the condition of no social support or low social support,

282
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,470
there is an association between stress and depression that's positive.

283
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:07,510
If there is high level of social support that can disrupt the association between stress and depression.

284
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:17,020
And so that's what we see on the graph. So here, stress and depression, you'll see like there's a positive association kind of no matter what,

285
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:23,920
between stress and depression, it's just that social supports, depending on the level of social support, kind of comes in.

286
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:33,580
And like I think it is like in like polls the the association a little bit flatter little but down the slope when you have low social support,

287
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,030
that's the highest levels, the steepest line here.

288
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,910
There's a really robust risk relationship between stress and depression because we don't have like social support as that buffer.

289
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:59,620
That's another key moderation. Word is buffer. But as social support gets higher of that, that relationship gets dampens down a little bit.

290
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,699
So the condition of having social support and here's a nice continuous variable because we see like,

291
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,870
oh, you know, like at each level of social support, the relationship shifts a little bit.

292
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,920
And I feel like this is a to me it's a helpful example because it,

293
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:22,120
it reflects reality a little bit more like often we're not dealing with variables

294
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,200
that are truly like different groups and it's kind of an artificial divide.

295
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,650
But if you divide it in these three levels, still artificial, that you can kind of see like, okay, this, this.

296
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:42,890
This is how the relationship goes across time. And this is also a helpful way to think about graphing the continuous variables.

297
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Again, this is a pretty simple example, but a little more complex than just the two groups,

298
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:55,130
because often we're in this world of like one continuous variable moderates,

299
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:04,790
the association between two other continuous variables, and like how to visualize that you can do it more complex, you know, fancy in a fancy way.

300
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,559
But this is a simple way to visualize it.

301
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,830
And also just check to make sure your moderator variable is acting in the way that you would think it would be.

302
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,680
So let's see, I think. I know.

303
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:33,410
I just jam through that and I'll share these slides, but also because I think you guys are all doing statistical statistically savvy.

304
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:43,040
And I think if people don't have experience to some of these models or ways of thinking about it, it can be a little challenging.

305
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,620
So I think that that's why I kind of break it, keep it kind of simple.

306
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,909
And I. I've said this already, but when we apply it to our own work, it all of a sudden gets much more complicated.

307
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,180
Even if you're like, Oh, I totally get it. And then you're like, Wait, what? How do these things go together?

308
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:09,210
So that's that's why I kind of like have these sort of broken out slides for you guys are really nice because in the end stats are like really in it,

309
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,880
right? You're like ready to be like, Oh yeah, that's what we're looking at.

310
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,589
Oh, good, oh, good. Because I think it's like there's so many levels, right?

311
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:25,110
It's like we have our conceptual piece in our day, in our like literature and like, what do people measure?

312
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:32,330
And then it's like you kind of zoom over here and they're like, My code doesn't work like that.

313
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,629
I think it looks like that. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

314
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,840
Oh, good, good. That's great. That's great.

315
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,249
Because, yeah, I think that's the thing.

316
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,889
Like that's why I, you know, again, like even on this phone call I was just on, we were like, what's the conceptual?

317
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:55,260
Not like what are because that really does then everything flows from that, but it's easy to forget and make sure it matches again.

318
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,350
Once you're like I measures, are they valid?

319
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:04,499
What's your in all those details? And so it is going to kind of just get back back to basics.

320
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:14,040
Yeah, I so okay good good good good. I'm glad that that is works with your class it's real it's again like not everybody has taken

321
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,660
700 and certainly not at the same time and so I think it's great that you guys are doing it.

322
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,629
Okay, so I don't know if we need a category,

323
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:31,620
but I wanted to make sure to allow a lot of time for this presentation so I can hop out of

324
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:41,290
these slides and we can we can take a mini break and then you can take over the slides.

325
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:47,900
Um, do you need to plug in and the log in to my emails?

326
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,660
Oh, brilliant. Okay. And I will let you know if you have to do a speaker.

327
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:01,940
I know it's kind of a scary. Over across.

328
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:29,140
Those were great articles to show how good I felt like they were like in that everyone would kind of figure out what's going on.

329
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,870
Just like I hear the stuff here know. Yeah, there was a scoping review and I was like, maybe this is too broad.

330
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:41,529
But it went across, I think, a lot of different concepts of coffee comedy.

331
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:48,050
It because it's so broad and there's so many different, there's not one singular like way to do things and has to find.

332
00:38:48,070 --> 00:39:02,460
I thought that one would be good. Never.

333
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,330
It's just time for me to get a big donation to the Alzheimer's Center.

334
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:43,150
There was just the news like yesterday about when an Alzheimer's drug was effective.

335
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,310
So I'm like, Oh, my goodness, I wonder about this effectiveness.

336
00:39:48,750 --> 00:41:02,230
The. Three people are.

337
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:55,920
Today. It's actually perfect, too.

338
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:03,620
There's a few conceptual models that I put in here. So if you have more to say, feel free to use those examples.

339
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,879
Yes. So I don't know if you all had a chance to kind of skim the articles or anything,

340
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,760
but I'm going to be talking about culturally competent health care today and how cultural

341
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,670
competency and cultural humility can impact communities engagements with health care systems.

342
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:35,759
I'm kind of on a broad level, so before I get started in that, because I wanted to do a brief overview of what is culture,

343
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:43,889
and I know we've seen this graphic before and culture is so broad and encompasses all of these things.

344
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:51,990
And so obviously we think of the. Things that we can see first language, clothing, things like that.

345
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:56,790
But there's so much more that goes into what makes up a courtroom, what makes up with people.

346
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,550
And especially in a country like America where there's so many overlapping cultures and intersectionality,

347
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:10,410
that becomes a really complex concept, embracing cultures and working with communities across cultures.

348
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:19,600
I have this brief video I want to show you all really quick.

349
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:25,360
That kind of helps to frame how cultural competency comes to play in the health care system.

350
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:37,000
Let me know if you can hear that. I.

351
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:46,110
And I come from a long line of persons. My generation.

352
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,620
My grandmother. My.

353
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,680
I want. His daughter also was.

354
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:06,650
A surgical nurse. Almost three years. I have two daughters that are also nursing.

355
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:13,540
Nurse. And not only American.

356
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,570
So I think my rich cultural heritage is one of the.

357
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:30,610
I have always been to India. At an early age, how important it was.

358
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:38,990
Understanding your patients from the perspective. So what is cultural competence?

359
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,480
Well, I know you all are aware that you can go to ten different boats and find.

360
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,440
I think that to me it's a continuum. One in.

361
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,070
Is cultural competency. Humility is on one bar and on the left.

362
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:13,480
But with extreme it's. On the extreme humility on one extreme subjects on the.

363
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:23,560
So what is extreme humility? The au contraire humility was actually a term that was coined by two positions in 1998.

364
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:34,500
And they decided that they wanted to incorporate this. And it's come a long way since.

365
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:47,800
But cultural humility means that you sit down. You listen to them knowing that you're not necessarily the expert on health.

366
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:03,180
Suspended. Hold them close.

367
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:14,000
But you are not the expert. So when you're sitting down and listening to your patients, you're also learning from them.

368
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,670
Also humble enough to say, I don't know the answer to your question at all.

369
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:35,070
On the other end of the spectrum you have. What that means is.

370
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,100
You suspend your beliefs, hold impulse, but you don't.

371
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:52,490
It means it's hard to respect different. It means.

372
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,530
So as you can see, if you move from one end of the continuum to another.

373
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:14,870
I want to tell you a story. When I was first out of nurses two, I took a job in the US.

374
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,910
Working up several months. I'll vacation for a few days.

375
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:29,590
And catching up on. And the nurse that gave me the report just said.

376
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,130
You'll be happy. Have an elderly man tonight.

377
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:40,250
This is. To his family's.

378
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:48,950
His wife has always said his. There's only one thing I want to.

379
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:55,400
Specifically about. The nursing staff has noticed that every time the room.

380
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:06,310
What it means. Tell me more. I it mean?

381
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,260
Figure out there newspapers and. What does that mean?

382
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,600
She said, Oh, no, nothing like that. It has to do with movement.

383
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:19,970
The. They keep moving equipment around, moving chairs.

384
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,280
No matter how many times the nurses have said this is not a good idea.

385
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:35,080
We need the equipment where it's located for. A while after they had.

386
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,480
Everything orderly. You know how we. Just a block place.

387
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:57,910
Have you ever watched a nurse or yourself body? You line them all up on the bedside table.

388
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:07,110
You just are overly by nature. So this was really frustrating to Steph that every time they came into that room.

389
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:13,300
It was a disarray. Thank you for telling me how to find out.

390
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,890
So I went in, introduced myself. Checked on the patient.

391
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,559
And then I asked her if I could come back in a while and talk with her.

392
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,850
But I wanted to get to know she and her husband.

393
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:35,950
It went off 30 minutes when I get that. Superficial chitchat.

394
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:42,610
As for sequester. She told me today she and her husband had moved here three years ago.

395
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,700
They were living with their sons. So.

396
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:52,200
Out of their comfort zone. Here in the United States. Especially in the health care system.

397
00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:00,240
I just continued the lessons that she taught. And when she was finished, I said, you know, I have a personal question to ask.

398
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,880
The nurses have told me that. They have noticed that.

399
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,930
And she said. We're Muslim.

400
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:31,240
The person that has died had to shoot. So that's why we didn't.

401
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:49,120
Furniture manufacturer. My husband's. The was.

402
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:59,760
So I think. And I said, you know, I'm really glad that you shared this information if you don't mind sharing this stuff so that they can stop giving.

403
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,110
Around there and everybody understands. She said that.

404
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,920
I discovered. Even the smallest thing.

405
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,910
Different than yourself. So.

406
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:27,290
So in that context. You know, that was really about humility.

407
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,950
I sat down and listened to her. I learned from her.

408
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:41,370
And then. Accommodations. So what I want you to realize is that.

409
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:49,230
It's not about. Listen, Ginger.

410
00:51:50,010 --> 00:52:04,920
Politics. Well. You have to be culturally tolerant to.

411
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:11,200
You should have. I want the patients to have a meaningful hospital experience.

412
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,620
So how do you help? Especially when there was no.

413
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:34,160
The big question is how? Bottom line is it's about openness.

414
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,430
Every. Please.

415
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:56,700
Detention. Well, I just want to kind of frame the discussion and show an example of how cultural competency is used.

416
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:13,050
I thought that would be good. So he kind of framed what cultural competence is on our large scale.

417
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:21,630
The only thing that's a little different and he used that arrow going from cultural humility to this concept of open cultural openness

418
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:30,840
and framed it as if moving from coloniality moves you closer cultural competence where a lot of people now are saying to adapt.

419
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:39,810
There's sort of one in the same. You can't really have you can't be culturally competent without embracing cultural humility at the same time.

420
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,079
And so cultural content is an overlapping set of attitudes, knowledge, skills,

421
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:53,160
and an awareness and intention to power differences which enable effective care to culturally diverse populations.

422
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:59,610
Surely this knowledge of different cultures and how they work together and how you communicate with these cultures.

423
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:09,020
And so their specific cultural competence, which is learning about a specific cultural group or dynamic in order to better care for them.

424
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:15,740
And then there's generic cultural competence, which is just the knowledge of the interactions between various cultures.

425
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:20,540
And so we start talking about developing interventions and things like that is

426
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:25,490
important to kind of understand which aspect of cultural competence you're looking at.

427
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:32,749
Are you working in a community with as majority one cultural group and specific cultural competence with survey data?

428
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:38,960
Or is it kind of the inner workings of a lot of different cultures and their cultural content and what works better?

429
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:45,290
Or even thinking about maybe in medical school, they can offer a more generic cultural competence.

430
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:49,220
And as you move to residency or specific training, you get more specific.

431
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,410
And so they do lay out these layers of cultural competence, too.

432
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:59,090
And so the first one is this map or layer, which is more of a societal level.

433
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:05,209
These are talking about policy planning and advocacy work and where the funding goes to

434
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:12,110
really promote cultural competency on a larger scale at the national level or federal level.

435
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:18,650
And then there's two groups of this meso or this middle ground of competence.

436
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:23,930
The first being institutional level. So I like to think about it in intervention terms.

437
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:27,710
And so I think about it as like a hospital system, for instance,

438
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:34,879
implementing DIA trainings or other forms of concepts to really get the staff

439
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,250
and the doctors and everybody grounded to this idea of cultural competency.

440
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:48,230
And then there's the programmatic level, which is also a message level that our policies and regulations,

441
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:52,310
but again, thinking of it as intervention turns.

442
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:57,490
I like to look at it as like the surgical unit.

443
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,310
They're learning about the cultural competency for their specific practice,

444
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:06,170
and they can really implement that based on their specific field of practice.

445
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:14,920
Is apparently the macro level, which is a level that I'm very specifically interested in as individual clinical level.

446
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:20,470
And it's really that efforts from individual clinicians or practices to promote

447
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:24,100
cultural competent practices relative to the community that they're serving.

448
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:29,709
So that's more of that specific cultural competency and really understanding where you're

449
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:34,780
located and what community you're serving and how you can best communicate with the community.

450
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:46,630
And so I come in here and there is this idea of cultural competency versus cultural humility, although they are, to me, one in the same,

451
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:54,400
where cultural competency is more of maintaining this knowledge and assessing your knowledge and skills

452
00:56:54,410 --> 00:57:00,040
of cultural communities and how to use that knowledge to communicate and to work with the communities.

453
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:07,990
And coffee humility is more of a mindset. So you're really taking your own culture and your own ideas about yourself,

454
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:17,080
where how those create biases of other cultures and putting that on the back burner and putting understanding on the forefront.

455
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:27,340
So to me, cultural competency is the at hand in their practice and cultural melody is the mindset needed to allow cultural competency to occur.

456
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:37,030
And so now we're getting to the conceptual models. There are few models of cultural competent care.

457
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:42,880
There are so many different ways that people have started to implement these ideas.

458
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:49,420
A lot of them are surrounded kind of on a human resources level or infrastructure level,

459
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:54,790
and now they're moving more towards that micro clinical practice level.

460
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:59,290
And so different models will address different levels of competency.

461
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:07,350
This first one, the culturally competent communication model, is all about how clinicians communicate with their patients.

462
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:18,310
So moving towards their traditional ways of communication, encouraging patients and working towards increased cultural competence, which involves.

463
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:25,419
Six main categories of communicating. And so there's the non-verbal skills,

464
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,790
which is just how you are interacting with a patient and making sure that they're comfortable when

465
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:37,000
they come into the clinic and assessing kind of how your body language is expressing yourself.

466
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:44,840
And then there's the variable behavior skills, which involve a lot of communication about how everything is doing.

467
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:49,760
Understanding them. There are limitations to this, obviously, with time constraints,

468
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:59,450
but people are really working more towards doctors interacting with patients on a personal level in these verbal behavior skills.

469
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:09,170
Then there's the recognition of cultural differences, which involves a lot of work on the front end for the clinicians to really understand

470
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:13,130
the community that they're working with before getting into this setting.

471
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:20,729
And then there's the incorporation of an adoption to cultural knowledge yet again involved

472
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:25,559
this work on the front end for the clinicians before coming into these interactions,

473
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:31,170
but understanding that there's more going on than just what's happening in this interaction.

474
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,790
And then lastly, there's the negotiation and collaboration. So assessing the needs of the patient,

475
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:44,550
is it just looking at their heart rate and understanding how they're feeling in the moment and prescribing medicine,

476
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,639
but looking at how cultural aspects of a patient come into play when trying to adhere to a

477
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,830
treatment plan and negotiating and working with the patient to come up with a plan that.

478
00:59:56,610 --> 01:00:00,269
Promotes healthy behaviors and good health outcomes,

479
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:07,650
but also takes into account their cultural abilities and their backgrounds and what makes them most comfortable.

480
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:17,540
And so this is just a basic level of kind of parameters that people are starting to set in medical settings.

481
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:23,840
For practitioners, that's not that specific. It's a little broad, but it helps to kind of set a groundwork.

482
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:36,250
This framework is a lot more specific and provides a lot of the mediators that we were just talking about here, and it has the healthcare,

483
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:44,830
environment and policies, provider behavior and staff behavior and how these things work together to improve for better cultural sensitivity.

484
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,420
And so in turn, this sensitivity increases success in the provider.

485
01:00:52,020 --> 01:01:01,230
And it's believed that the stress in provider increase would increase a person's control or feelings that they feel in their health care environment,

486
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:09,150
the autonomy over their own health care, the satisfaction that the care and the medical system and not only the physical stress,

487
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:19,650
but this model takes into account racial stress in drama and whether it's experienced or perceived racism.

488
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,450
They believe that this improved cultural sensitivity and improved as a provider

489
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:29,640
helps to mitigate the impact of that perceived or experienced racial crime.

490
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:39,840
And so, in turn, all of these improvements work to improve health, promoting lifestyles here in Atlanta and medical and as well.

491
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:50,989
And so I really like this model because it takes into account that racial stress and founder before we were

492
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:57,020
talking about kind of how that plays into a specific conceptual model and how they've got that in their.

493
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,879
In the connection between you and the mediator, there's really two levels of outcomes when you think about it.

494
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,820
There's a slight increase in gold and decreases further increase in satisfaction,

495
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:14,550
and then in turn, the secondary outcomes of improved health behaviors and adherence.

496
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,890
And then the last model was kind of a combination of the previous two.

497
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:29,490
It really takes into account all of the different aspects of girls from that macro level,

498
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:37,139
all the way to the micro takes into account the legal structures in place in whatever society is looking at how at a

499
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:45,270
broad macro level they need to assess the changes and develop action plans and really work with the systems at BEA.

500
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:52,590
And then down to the micro level of family unit and physicians working with the families and communities,

501
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:58,740
understanding and inviting in interpreters and working inside the community to really understand them.

502
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:10,600
And it outlines intervention strategies, whereas the other models kind of leave it to interpretation and development.

503
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,800
This one kind of lays out some strategies and it came from the article.

504
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,120
They did the scoping review.

505
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:25,680
And so based on all of those, I believe it was about 15 different studies that came from they developed these kind of plans of action moving forward.

506
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:38,719
And so obviously this is ideal and these culturally competent care is what we aim to do.

507
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,360
But there are structural limitations.

508
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:50,239
Is funding the mission before in medical settings, you really doctors have like five, 10 minutes max with patients, nurses have a little more time.

509
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:56,480
But if there's a specific health problem that somebody is coming in for, you don't have a lot of time for background information.

510
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:09,710
And then a lot of the articles in the reading that I did point to this idea of the balance between cultural understanding and stereotypes.

511
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:17,719
There's a very thin line between understanding a culture and learning about a culture and then making your own assumptions

512
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:24,080
and putting those ideas on to a person without really listening and getting that understanding from the individual.

513
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:27,140
Because there are multiple intersections at play.

514
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:35,030
And so then you also get this idea of clinical professionals,

515
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:42,769
doctors becoming experts on a culture that they're not a part of and believing that there is a way that you can study enough to know

516
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:50,750
about a culture and then not have to do these interviews and listen and understand and base it on the knowledge that you're learning.

517
01:04:51,500 --> 01:05:00,170
And so this aspect of cultural competency really involves a constant interaction between the community and practitioners and

518
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:06,920
always listening and understanding and working and having cultural humility to really push those biases to the background.

519
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:17,780
And so what's next? The research that I that you all and then some other articles to them listed in the back.

520
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:25,370
So when I post this, if you want to go to the other articles, they show some very specific connections between increased cultural sensitivity,

521
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,930
satisfaction with care, and adherence to treatment plans, which is really, really good.

522
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:38,179
But there's more research that's needed to develop these specific trainings and interventions and really figure out how do we

523
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:46,070
translate these ideas of cultural competency into practical implementations of solutions that are on the ground and working.

524
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:52,750
And so these concepts and these interventions as they're being developed need to be.

525
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:59,979
Hopefully community sooner and hopefully inform rethink about ideas of CPR and hopefully informed

526
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:08,350
interventions really making sure that it's not coming from ideas of community or readings,

527
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:20,059
but actually the community that is being served. And thinking about policies and ways to build in these ideas of cultural competency and cultural

528
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:24,740
ability into the training for medical professionals before getting out into the field.

529
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:30,910
And so as this is going on, there needs to be continuing research.

530
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:39,280
These studies are great, but there are still kind of gaps in the field and pull in validity studies and make

531
01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:43,410
sure that everything is kind of based in our research and has that foundation.

532
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:48,910
So the more research in the field, the better. And here Americans.

533
01:06:52,410 --> 01:07:08,150
Yeah. Any question in the definitions of cultural competency.

534
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,590
I was interested diversity in its culture, humility.

535
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:21,210
I thought that was really interesting because I felt recently for to this movement to use the word that you can be.

536
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:28,790
Yeah. Health and culture is more of a push to suggest that just work.

537
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:35,360
Your thoughts on that? That's what I thought for a while, too.

538
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:41,260
I kind of have been circling this idea of cultural competency for a while, and then I saw this with humility.

539
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:48,700
I was like, Oh, that's really good. Now this sinner and that person's culture and understanding, but from doing this research,

540
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:56,860
it kind of feels more like competency is the action and the understanding that work needs to be done in order to embrace culture.

541
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:06,790
And so I think they're both necessary because I'm looking at cultural competency not so much as being competent in the culture,

542
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:15,340
but competent in the skills to listen and understand other people's culture more than competent in someone's culture itself.

543
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:22,120
Okay. But yeah, that's what I think they're moving towards now, people that are still embracing that phrase.

544
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,840
Yeah. Yeah. Because it had to be either or. Yeah.

545
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:33,040
Different functions. I actually think lots of humility replaces more that idea of cultural sensitivity.

546
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:35,800
That used to be the phrase that people used a lot.

547
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:43,450
Hopefully melody does seem to be a good replacement for that, but I don't think it's a 1 to 1 for cultural competency.

548
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:52,700
Yeah. We're pretty excited. You're talking about the challenges to culturally competent care.

549
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:58,660
Yeah, I'm curious with those. What is most great for.

550
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:19,930
So if anything, I think that they're the more screenings and the more kind of formalized ways that people go about understanding culture, the better.

551
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:26,259
I think we've kind of seen those changes in how medical professionals address mental health and other screenings.

552
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,219
When you walk into the room first and they're kind of asking these baseline questions

553
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:35,980
and it's kind of assumed that doctors are understanding and checking for mental health.

554
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:47,290
The movies that I have seen kind of some people play around with the idea of the way that medical professionals are trained when they go overseas or

555
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:55,149
go to another country and how they train them to put their cultural understandings in the backburner and learn about these cultures and address them.

556
01:09:55,150 --> 01:10:01,959
And I think there's some validity in looking at those types of trainings when doctors are going into communities

557
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:08,320
that they're not from here in the States to an understanding that just because we're all from America,

558
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,450
we all speak the same language or something.

559
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:16,390
It doesn't necessarily mean that we all come from the same cultural backgrounds and the same understandings.

560
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:23,200
Especially doctors working in community clinics or things that are very specific to a certain community,

561
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:32,170
having some sort of baseline trainings or laid out guidelines before bringing them in,

562
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:44,150
I think could have some real benefit to what that looks like exactly, because I think it's different for every culture in every place.

563
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:48,520
So I don't know if you can necessarily break it down to these are the questions you ask.

564
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:57,310
This is how you ask them as much as these are the spaces where it's definitely necessary, maybe that's the most you can do.

565
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,910
Yeah, it's interesting, like just thinking ahead of the existing and I think that's a great question.

566
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:10,070
Like where? Where do you see?

567
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:16,260
And if you're situating at least this first part. According to her research.

568
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:23,200
And with those kind of programs like prepping physicians.

569
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:30,280
Do we know at all?

570
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:37,420
You know what I mean? Like, is there. Yeah, there's. I did like a really great literature, a very,

571
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:45,489
very brief literature review masters program of those programs being overseas and looked at how it could possibly translate here.

572
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:49,240
But that was five years ago.

573
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:53,110
Now, I don't know if people have done more work in that sense,

574
01:11:53,110 --> 01:12:00,280
but I know that there are a lot there's a lot of research showing kind of the different structures set

575
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:06,730
up to fill in these positions as they go overseas and the benefit of doing so with these communities.

576
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:15,940
And so it's a little harder to do in the States just because of overlapping.

577
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:24,819
But I think there are a lot of communities that have these like very unique, very specific social identities that you can kind of save.

578
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:30,670
And I know in the Pacifica my grandma used to go to a clinic that she would give birth to,

579
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:35,590
and it was very specific for older black people and it would all go there.

580
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:43,510
And doctors from like Beaumont and the other hospitals would kind of volunteer their time to do shifts and rotations there.

581
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:48,120
And you could kind of tell that that's not where they're always they always are.

582
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,470
They don't really know how to interact with the community there.

583
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:56,170
So if there was some sort of like intake process to before you start your rotation here,

584
01:12:56,530 --> 01:13:01,180
we're going to do some trainings and some things that you can understand the community you're serving a little better.

585
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:07,670
Um, yeah. So I think when you talk about starting my research and then starting this,

586
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:16,420
these projects, I'll probably start focusing on looking at the need for more.

587
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:26,020
There are some studies that show that, and I think it's like adding to that first and then building on that to my goal goal.

588
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:32,409
My ultimate goal is to do some sort of like CPR where I'm working with communities to develop a

589
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:37,810
training or something between medical school or a residency program or some sort of training,

590
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:44,200
medical training program and the community members kind of so that they can kind of inform how

591
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:49,899
this training goes and what information these doctors need to know coming into the community.

592
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:53,020
That would be a goal for me.

593
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:01,650
And so it's like I really like how you broke out of that the different like areas like that that sort of general.

594
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,720
Specifically if. Melanie.

595
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:14,620
I think about the like, yeah, two part two part training and you know points also.

596
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:19,470
With no medical experience.

597
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:29,310
And when you like such. In terms of an individual's training trajectory, like you said, maybe.

598
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:35,320
The president said, you know, he went into this specific experience last year.

599
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,790
Three. Yeah.

600
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:45,580
Yeah. This one was interesting, too, because it brought in this is basically what I was trying to draw out.

601
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:52,840
Yeah. I mean, where was this? I think this idea of physical success,

602
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:58,749
but in terms of race related stress and family and kind of they use a measure for success

603
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:06,820
over a specific measure for stress and trust in provider in this specific research vertical.

604
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:12,309
And I think kind of making this get into health outcomes in the long run,

605
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:20,950
but really this aspect of the trust in provider and the satisfaction and care, belonging, control and lowering that stress is at step one.

606
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:29,110
So if I can work on an intervention and then measure just the feelings of the interactions before even looking at,

607
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:33,690
okay, what physically is happening after those feelings, but are the feelings getting better?

608
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,420
Are the interactions improving between a provider and a community?

609
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:44,170
This baseline, I think is really great. So I cut it off you first and then open it up to the rest.

610
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:55,730
Yeah. I thought it was interesting that this is your communication model.

611
01:15:56,630 --> 01:16:02,280
I want to kind of be with Santa, like one of those circles in the next model.

612
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:07,400
In the ancient experience.

613
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:16,880
As like those if the inter-personal control dissatisfaction and those in the House cut it off earlier.

614
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:23,810
Look at those at your house so that any of that trust in provider as your mediator.

615
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:32,230
Intervention three circles on the side of what you're trying to work in those spaces.

616
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,260
Mean, you just want to go to space and. Increases.

617
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:43,600
Activity aside, general cultural humility.

618
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:56,340
Your version too is specific to this population that is coming in the cultural ability to know that mastery of the details of this culture that.

619
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:06,820
It seems this one does seem to fit here because this even if you just break it apart and make them individual, I mean, this is a good aspect.

620
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:15,569
On the policy level, I'm looking at kind of the regulations on health care systems and cities and even the country federally.

621
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:20,010
But you can look at these training programs in these provider behaviors.

622
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:23,040
Like you said, take that other model and communication.

623
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:28,470
And if you're training physicians, I'm kind of those interview skills and communication skills.

624
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:39,510
How does that impact? So yeah, break them apart and do kind of separate training or even I've seen clinics where the practitioners are,

625
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,700
they kind of embed themselves in the community,

626
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:48,450
so they do little classes and we go like how to manage diabetes or high blood pressure or things like that,

627
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:53,190
and they're free and open to the community and how clinics like that,

628
01:17:54,120 --> 01:18:01,680
how the feelings about those clinics are different than the ones where you have to make an appointment three months in advance and you have 4 minutes.

629
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:08,050
Yeah, right. It's going to be interesting to see the thing.

630
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:14,899
But I think the key part with all of that is having the community a part of these interventions from the start.

631
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:24,559
One, and instead of trying to see and guess what communication styles work best and what interventions and what training programs are,

632
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:32,209
then having the community tell the health care systems kind of what would be best

633
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:36,290
for them and what would help increase their own trust in the medical system.

634
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:47,960
That's been excited to be the villain. Actually.

635
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:53,200
Oh, actually, there was a study about there was a race.

636
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:58,340
Connection? Yes. So where was that?

637
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:09,010
Yes. So they use this measure of half the perimeter and they divide it up between rates.

638
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:17,829
And so one of the limitations to the study is they only looked at non-Hispanic white Americans and non-Hispanic black Americans in the study,

639
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:22,390
but they found that there was an increased cost of provider.

640
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:28,150
It was higher for white Americans than black Americans. But the decrease in physical stress,

641
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:37,390
the decrease in satisfaction with care and interpersonal control was higher for black Americans when the cultural sensitivity aspect was higher.

642
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:49,430
And so that was really interesting dividing up first and provider I've seen specific outcomes but never this moderator divided like that so.

643
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:59,190
And interest was still lower, even though these things are higher with the caucus and said to be behind the trust aspect.

644
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:07,980
Wasn't there necessarily. So is this a meeting for the is the crest necessary if the sensitivity is there and I know.

645
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:19,590
But this protein is so is the stress, the racial trauma, filth, all of it.

646
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,160
I mean, they included an aspect of racial stress in there,

647
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:35,500
but they're using a measure for racial stress and then they're also using a biological measure of stress just overall during the visit.

648
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:52,850
Yeah. The city was really. Like.

649
01:20:54,750 --> 01:21:01,370
I feel like both hands would be the best, but. You were sort of bringing in the community.

650
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:06,440
And obviously community is like any great idea.

651
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:10,080
I really like the articles that were like making that point.

652
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:15,190
It's not a specific piece of knowledge that in any event.

653
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:24,840
No. Yeah. But like, at what point would it be particularly critical to have that getting feedback?

654
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:28,150
I think like definitely in terms of you're trying to develop something that.

655
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:37,540
Specific cultural competence. Absolute feedback from whatever community is that the community that you're

656
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:43,960
working with get multiple members of the panel disagreeing with this specific.

657
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,350
But then also I was just thinking like, how could you these?

658
01:21:51,350 --> 01:22:00,139
Community members from different communities around the sort of more general cultural humility training to, you know what I mean?

659
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:06,740
And maybe it is, maybe it is. More providers go and have a lived experience in the community.

660
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:16,460
There's a certain musical that it's in D.C. One of the communities I worked with just couldn't say.

661
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,559
I think they're promoting healthy eating and all these things.

662
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,330
And then we sat down with them.

663
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:28,650
We were talking about what's actually getting in the way of doing this now that the closest grocery stores and they had a bus ride

664
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:35,880
with you and then you want us to give you healthy foods and you have to carry them back home and they go back to so frequently.

665
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:41,200
And maybe if there's something around the corner that we didn't pick up and bring home and it was a quick trip,

666
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:45,960
it's not quick to get to a grocery store to begin with, so we're not going to do it.

667
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:53,790
It's like, Oh yeah, that makes sense. And then doctors just keep coming in to their, Oh, we'll eat better and you'll be better, whatever.

668
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:57,300
And then they're not realizing there is no mechanism to do that.

669
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:02,159
So you need to find another. There has to be another solution, there's something else.

670
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:07,950
And also that the things that I think if you're not aware of the community that

671
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:12,149
you're serving and you kind of keep giving them advice that is medically sound,

672
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:15,510
technically, I mean, it makes sense, but is it practical?

673
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:28,660
Is it going to provide solution? So you mention like programs that send doctors up here about looking at like models the Internet,

674
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:32,839
like how like how many will be infected versus the numbers.

675
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:42,330
That's like the cancer regimen. But are there other models for practitioners to be?

676
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:47,049
Very sensitive to their populations, like in other countries.

677
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:52,480
Like I was thinking and I was on note, I went to a clinic and there was a coal mine resident there.

678
01:23:52,480 --> 01:24:02,800
So as part of his program that there was an hour around that time and I wonder if they have different ways of exposing them to different people.

679
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:10,150
I wondered how they felt for Canada is a demand for that and Australia is also a good model for that too,

680
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:16,089
because they have such large native populations and they vary so much.

681
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:22,810
I know that they have. They're not perfect by any means, but they have some good studies and models kind of examining that,

682
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:29,170
especially cultures where technically everybody has kind of this idea of Australian or Canadian or whatever.

683
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:35,880
But there's so many different aspects like America, whether they have different backgrounds.

684
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:48,790
I know there have been some studies in those populations that kind of like introducing native concepts and ideas and not pushing Western medicine

685
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:56,880
or ideas on people first kind of understanding where they're coming from and their preferred mode of health care first and then working with that.

686
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:04,650
We ought to be interesting. But actually the model I was looking at was from the Peace Corps training.

687
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:11,049
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was wondering, like, so Peace Corps, we send people abroad, but what about, like,

688
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:16,060
AmeriCorps when they place people in communities to teach schools one is or,

689
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:19,299
you know, different parts of the country that would actually be interesting.

690
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:23,080
Anything where they have. Yeah, this nation is safe, right?

691
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:26,860
Yeah. Yeah. They have to have and have to do them for us.

692
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:35,440
Like they put us in post families for three months infantry to do like our competency training and like that is like full immersion.

693
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:39,260
Yeah. You're for it, right?

694
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:43,550
Yeah. Every doctor, like, find a home and let them live. Yeah.

695
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:47,870
And I went the Doctors Without Borders, I think a lot of people in.

696
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:54,060
To see if there was another one.

697
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,540
What's the one for? Emergencies and all of our calls.

698
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:08,030
Yes. The when they deploy people based on they have training things, too, but mainly for those abroad situations when it's not right.

699
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,390
But those kind of trainings and other things, they can be used here, too.

700
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:19,940
I just don't think a lot of people think about doing that, but they're very laid out processes and things like that.

701
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:26,149
I mean, even as much as communities where, you know, the majority of the community doesn't speak English,

702
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:29,719
but they're not requiring doctors to get training or whatever.

703
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:35,270
Language is the preferred language in that community before they start serving.

704
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:41,870
And so we're having interpreters there, something like that. And so patient, of course, being a family member or something like that.

705
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:45,830
And then that's another barrier to even getting to a doctor's visit.

706
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:54,470
Right. And so much misinterpretation. Yeah. I'm going to let you have your six year old child translating his medical term.

707
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:01,520
He said traumatic. Yeah. Yeah. And that's like a that's like, you know, like a policy.

708
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:07,690
It's like a service policy that would still be a chance to implement.

709
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:16,429
But I feel like that's like a step one. But I mean, universities in terms of like needing interpreters or things like that,

710
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:21,110
they've created these structures where you have, yeah, you could have requested and things like that.

711
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:28,220
They should at least be a process where a community can come and say, Hey, you're in our community, serving us our medical needs.

712
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:32,150
We require an interpreter at this clinic or something like that.

713
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:32,389
You know,

714
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:41,480
there should at least be some sort of formal process for these people to do anything like legislating that they're supposed to provide interpreters.

715
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:47,240
So. No, no, no. I'm not sure about this, but I've been in some situations where has it been ordered?

716
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,670
Like they were like that would be. Yeah.

717
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:59,570
Yeah, it's to be. Yeah I think it is.

718
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:02,990
Yeah, I think it is a it is a.

719
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:12,550
Yeah, I know. Well, federal policy, small hospitals and the like.

720
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:24,950
But I think also just practically, yeah, there are interpreters available, but that's not the way they come in in the Middle East.

721
01:28:25,010 --> 01:28:29,870
So in practice, yeah. But you have.

722
01:28:33,630 --> 01:28:38,950
Um. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. I love that we get all these models around.

723
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:45,429
You know. Different. Very overtly you're training or going somewhere else.

724
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:49,620
And actually, where do they call it? What do they call it?

725
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:54,620
Without any question. And I know they've developed now more medically focused people.

726
01:28:56,810 --> 01:29:00,950
But because before I was there. But now they made it for nursing and doctors.

727
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:16,480
But it also happened in labor. I remember that your numbers differ, but I can give that to you.

728
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:22,750
Yeah, I think whether it's training or something like a pre-service training and if there's that in.

729
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:28,450
But yes, the even baseline,

730
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:35,190
the aspect of knowing that you're going to need some sort of training or to go into a community that will not have that right.

731
01:29:35,980 --> 01:29:43,410
Yeah, I think a lot of times here people are assuming that like, well, with the doctor and patient, there's that mismatch anyway.

732
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:50,379
I don't necessarily need to understand the community because I'm the doctor just giving the medical advice versus having that

733
01:29:50,380 --> 01:29:57,940
baseline of I'm entering a community that I'm that familiar with and do some sort of briefing or understanding before hand.

734
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:03,510
And then they're very right. That cultural humility aspect, I think that's so great.

735
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:17,950
I know for a while and. Listening tours like that type of model to where you can like build an expectation that.

736
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:25,350
The sun is shown getting to know the community or potential community in many different parts of the.

737
01:30:26,850 --> 01:30:34,380
It is important to us that one expectation, which I think is becoming more.

738
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:43,250
Now, how would you like to get into curricula, for example?

739
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:51,319
Because medical I think they have they have all the training, I don't know.

740
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:55,370
But they have so little choice over where they end up to.

741
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,010
That there's such a small learning hit.

742
01:30:58,010 --> 01:31:04,520
That they'll end up in a community where they're from, you know, just because the medical school in itself is hard to get into.

743
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:10,970
So you get it. You go in, you get in, in, in residency at all hands and wherever you that can, you get to go there.

744
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:17,030
So a lot of times it's a completely even if you may have some sort of shared social identity,

745
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:22,820
it's most likely not the community that you grew up in and your friends, you still have some sort of.

746
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:26,540
Everybody's got to do some of that. Right. Right.

747
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,860
So the residency can be the best time.

748
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:41,580
Or maybe like even second or third year, because that's when they start doing those like clinical rotations and things and working with patients.

749
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:50,520
Just getting that idea that like understand the community you're serving isn't secondary or oh added.

750
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:57,030
Plus it's a necessary step to creating the community building that in as long as professionals are being

751
01:31:57,030 --> 01:32:01,200
trained kind of the way that they're starting to add nutrition to medical school and they're like,

752
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,850
Oh, was that an added bonus to ask about eating habits and nutrition and things?

753
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:09,540
That's a necessary part of shooting patients.

754
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:15,000
Same with understanding culture and cultural humility and things that it should be.

755
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:19,500
It's a step you have to include. Yeah.

756
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:25,910
Because that has been such a struggle for so barely there.

757
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:30,260
Yeah. That's it's still very much like hundreds.

758
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:34,980
Me I think that getting it earlier in the curriculum.

759
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:46,860
Important things like sailing or having those first couple 4 hours and then just thinking too of like talking about those the other day.

760
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:51,850
But you know, so much in medical school. Information is being lost.

761
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:59,640
Fast forward on video. It's like just the format, you know, I used to put it on three speed.

762
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:04,680
I would do my. You.

763
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:14,529
So I just think about like, okay, what kinds of things could possibly do know like ideally to do multiple.

764
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:23,689
Could you do like a light touch? Video introduction and importance of the concept that like 30 minutes in here jam

765
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:28,180
packed in a first section of the medical school minutes early on in the course.

766
01:33:28,220 --> 01:33:33,940
The of the length or people. And then I just heard.

767
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:41,260
More touch points across time. You know, how could you balance that with, like, those intensive training?

768
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:53,079
And I think low levels are important kilo for thinking about like mackerel like obviously that's going to be you're going to do those training.

769
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,549
That's a different thing. But like the programmatic side, you can really tailor it.

770
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:01,180
So like maybe surgeons get a certain level of coaching,

771
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:06,669
competent care and understanding because they really don't have that much face to face patient interaction

772
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:13,450
where when they're awake versus a primary care physician who needs like loads and loads of this,

773
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:16,629
they're really interacting with patients on a constant basis.

774
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:24,420
So, you know, adjusting it based on the doctors that is relevant to what they're doing and how they're interacting.

775
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:30,970
You're not going to get it like, Oh, we go in and say, Can you give an anesthesiologist which is different in our acute.

776
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:36,870
And I like them so that she was. I like that video to the nurse.

777
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:41,880
That sort of idea of the staff. Yeah.

778
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:53,340
Yeah. And coming from understanding and knowing and you know, they have so much patient interaction, too, I think, you know.

779
01:34:54,420 --> 01:35:00,900
That cultural humility aspect. Yeah, I really like that video because it comes from a direct experience in a direct connection.

780
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:08,670
I skipped over, it's a training video and so I skipped over cookies asking the nursing students questions about their personal nursing.

781
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:12,810
But that's not necessary. It was perfect editing.

782
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:21,780
You're like, Alright, you know, I really like I practice that, so I feel excited, you know?

783
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:31,080
There's that. There's just so much. Yeah. In terms of just sort of modality and format training and.

784
01:35:32,710 --> 01:35:39,800
Such huge literature and thinking about what went practically my heart.

785
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:45,640
Sort of sexual. Just can go forward.

786
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:51,850
Never before, like, lost it.

787
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:58,950
Yeah. And then and we'll get to like your specific stuff, but.

788
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:05,130
In the work that you're going to be doing now, the project.

789
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,950
Then we can see some of it around some of the terrain.

790
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,260
Is it like most of this stuff?

791
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:21,239
Well, all of it on the rig side, he does a lot of like health behaviors.

792
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:29,130
And right now I'm working on the social support people and seeing how that meets my medium.

793
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:30,990
I'm still working on that now.

794
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:44,130
But the interactions between racism and racist experiences and mental health behaviors and health behaviors of adolescents,

795
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:51,149
and so it's all mainly mental health focus, but we're working on developing items right now.

796
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:56,250
And with that, I can add in some health behavior items into that too,

797
01:36:56,250 --> 01:37:03,309
to kind of look at how these aspects of support and really this cultural sensitivity and this provider training,

798
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:07,770
this is another aspect of support, looking at support from the providers.

799
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,500
And so I've been looking at community support thus far, but now I'm like, okay,

800
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:20,820
we see that more support impacts, better health outcomes and improved health behaviors and things like that.

801
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:24,900
So what would support and provider do with support from the community can do that.

802
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:31,950
What if your provider became a part of your community or not even it, but like was involved more, you know.

803
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:45,680
So I think it'll build on that. But this aspect of health, communication and health care systems are kind of is the part that's missing right now.

804
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:50,210
But I saw who is it, Brian? He does the impro cause.

805
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:56,630
He teaches the health communication. So then I think let's see if I can fit that into my for next semester.

806
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:04,810
Yeah. I think he's going because that Yeah. We haven't totally time yet about like classmates and all that of thing.

807
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,820
But it feels like your case.

808
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:11,840
Yeah. Like figuring out that Bryan's part of that.

809
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:15,730
Yes. That sounds like communication.

810
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:26,030
It really is in the medical school and out of medical school, he says, because it feels like like you won't be doing this in your future.

811
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:32,560
Like gaining some, like, vision and expertize. And I'm like, How can I get these ideas?

812
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:40,070
Yeah. He has space. Feels like it will be important for you to kind of be thinking about like on board.

813
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:43,680
Yeah. To gather like that.

814
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:48,670
So yeah, that would be. That would be really. Yeah.

815
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:57,340
It's just always about time there crunch time that there's so much around the medical education space and also maybe.

816
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:02,970
I'm learning health science. Oh.

817
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:17,710
Are you there? Never remember what their position is, but there's this learning health sciences group we really focus in on, like medical education.

818
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:23,110
But also from this like big pull in like public health, really.

819
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:31,020
And it's almost like very much like. Foundation. It's an effective manner.

820
01:39:31,170 --> 01:39:40,460
So that might also be another system to sort of think about. And Gretchen Peters is one of the people.

821
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:45,210
Does work and type in this space and time in between.

822
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:48,470
Like implementation, science, communication and. And like.

823
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:55,090
PR. I feel that, you know. Kind of bridging those spaces.

824
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:58,629
I think it'll be interesting to see. I think partly one of the things.

825
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:00,820
One that will happen. Yeah. Yeah.

826
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:08,560
I think it's important to stay involved with that medical psyche because I think a lot of times coming at it from an outside point of view,

827
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:15,880
medical people tend to view. Yeah. What do you what do you know about these things if you're not an immigrant?

828
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:20,700
Right. It makes sense. Like you're kind of learning about their context and what they need for their contacts.

829
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:26,080
Yeah. To get these ideas and the space.

830
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:34,450
And I did come from a, I've been doing more of the medical science master's is at the medical school and doing all that for a long time.

831
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:39,969
But I think I realized that it's kind of it's really,

832
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:47,379
really hard to look at the medical system from a bird's eye view when you're in it and kind of

833
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:52,090
understand all the systems at play and how they interact and really how to best serve communities.

834
01:40:52,090 --> 01:41:01,240
While you're engaged in all of the biology and chemistry and things and all of that, you really have to take a step back and see it from the outside.

835
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:06,270
So. Yeah.

836
01:41:06,930 --> 01:41:12,920
Yeah, I think that there would be. He starts this.

837
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:17,260
The. That our. They're thinking in that space.

838
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:21,150
So, you know. Thank you.

839
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:29,930
And. Just think about if you are interested in the Department of Learning.

840
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:35,720
That's why they have like a collaborative that meets monthly. Oh, I love the survey.

841
01:41:36,530 --> 01:41:43,450
Yes, definitely. Something like that.

842
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,470
Yeah, exactly. I'm like. I felt like I was looking at you, like, my whole life.

843
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:53,340
Yeah. Yeah. So my dad was in the war.

844
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:58,120
He was around. Two years ago.

845
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:08,900
I told you that I'm working. It was like something out of a crime, usually like an agreement like this, you know?

846
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:12,780
That's great. Oh, yeah, that's really cool.

847
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:16,800
Yeah, there's just. Yeah, there's. There's so much.

848
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:30,720
Sprinkled around the university. Plus we do a little mini break and then talk more about some other stuff.

849
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,960
This aspect.

850
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:49,450
I'll move this stuff over. Hey.

851
01:42:52,910 --> 01:43:00,810
Quickly. My little sister was like in college.

852
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:02,540
She's in medical school right now,

853
01:43:02,540 --> 01:43:12,260
and I think they made me do MPH first because I think she had like one cultural competency class and she was like, You hear that?

854
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,250
Oh, it is a therapist, my friend at the law school.

855
01:43:16,250 --> 01:43:24,050
There are so many. But I feel like the people at Syracuse, the schools know nothing about them.

856
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:27,500
Yeah, allegedly one of the students here and they're like, pretty.

857
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:31,870
They're really stupid. And she's kind of like an aunt.

858
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,250
She's really. Yeah.

859
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:38,460
She had a hole. She had a hole in after that first.

860
01:43:38,670 --> 01:43:43,440
She's in her third year now. The pregnant woman, she first got better do that.

861
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:48,740
Oh, it was really disturbing. The conversations we had about.

862
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:54,750
Another fast track. Fast tracked. Right at us.

863
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,140
Yeah, well, that is.

864
01:43:58,330 --> 01:44:01,500
Yes. But what is why?

865
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:07,970
This is going to be one race class in class.

866
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:17,140
I'm going to have to be so glad we.

867
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:27,820
During the launch party including. And.

868
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:40,540
It's funny because you're kind of single here in D.C. right now. Oh, it's mainly moved here over my friends.

869
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:44,899
And it, you know, like it's on on application, like, guess to a large extent.

870
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,880
Maybe. Just maybe, it's just. I don't know.

871
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:54,740
I do know that there's a bunch of people and they don't get that.

872
01:44:56,360 --> 01:45:02,900
But it's an ideal also that I wouldn't put me on that list.

873
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:10,730
Their Captain Love is blind in Detroit right now. Really?

874
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:18,389
Wow. Oh, that's bad. Mainly because they're Chicago.

875
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:26,270
So I guess they're just like, Oh, we're here a little Atlanta versus Chicago.

876
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:37,380
Another doing the city attorney. There was someone here who used to be Ellis, who's a grad student, and then he came here for a while.

877
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:44,430
But then I see him, like, multiple times, maybe to be on Survivor.

878
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:51,440
Like, wow, you're really poor. But I don't think.

879
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:56,300
Was not on it. But, like. Wow.

880
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:58,180
Even to sort of be in that space.

881
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:09,750
I think that we're a little more that there's this reality show for families, but it is like old timey can't wait is not technology.

882
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:15,920
So he said it applications. Why do you keep doing.

883
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:21,870
My brother will help you back in here then.

884
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:27,270
Welcome here. The good guy live here.

885
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:33,430
I took him to our colony.

886
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:36,670
So we're going to build bridges.

887
01:46:44,430 --> 01:46:51,500
So we'll see. Like 12 my friends, to me the love of my life because I could go, okay, you guys are right.

888
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:57,540
But, but yeah, that would be wow, that could be impressive.

889
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:02,010
That would be a really good, fun fact about that.

890
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:08,880
Right. I know. Well, there's I would say there's so many people that are on the was one thing that really hit.

891
01:47:12,730 --> 01:47:17,450
There's a lot of people that were on it and you'll never know. But that's an ideal situation.

892
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:25,930
You don't have to be like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that.

893
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:33,030
You don't even think about it.

894
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:41,450
I love it. I love. Oh.

895
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:46,380
Oh, man. Um, let's see.

896
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:56,690
I was going to check, and we just had our, like, faculty retreat all day on Friday, and I was going to see if there's stuff.

897
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:06,020
I think the main thing for you guys that came out. Um, we talked about the ADP a little bit like the assignment.

898
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:10,130
I can't see about like half the people are like.

899
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:15,180
Didn't know that's an assignment and that's totally unnecessary.

900
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:21,690
But there was discussion about like, Oh yeah, we could make this sort of a bigger, you know,

901
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:26,600
just like not even a bigger piece, but just sort of a formalized thing that everybody does.

902
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:30,240
And, you know, and I was like, Yeah, that'd be great. And, um,

903
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:36,089
kind of having a standard format and then using it as like a check in for everybody

904
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:41,460
so that it just becomes more like in the fabric of everybody knows what that is.

905
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:49,170
Which I think is good because in this department, not everybody supervises these students.

906
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:55,980
And so often, usually the faculty retreats in like May, which I was not the last one.

907
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,120
Is that true? Yeah,

908
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:03,269
I wasn't like the last one because I was on sabbatical and that there were all these like references to like following up from the retreat in May.

909
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:10,060
And I was like, I don't know what happened, but people, you know, got it.

910
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:15,600
There's like a review, kind of an oral review of like graduate student progress, like Ph.D. student progress.

911
01:49:17,810 --> 01:49:23,620
But then I think it's also like one of these things where people tune out a little bit if like they're not involved with the students, you know.

912
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:28,190
So I think we were just talking about like ways to kind of engage.

913
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:38,660
You know, and I think especially as we're all hopefully coming out more covered, there's more opportunity for like you guys to meet people and just,

914
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:48,050
you know, feel comfortable approaching faculty who are just hanging around, not involved in the Ph.D. student education.

915
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:56,780
Me formally, but like could be and should be, you know, so like pulling people in for prelim committees,

916
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:01,430
certainly for dissertation committees, um, and that kind of thing.

917
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:11,690
So I think it was a good discussion and I think like I've kind of purposely left the format a little bit more open for how people want to do it.

918
01:50:11,690 --> 01:50:18,860
But if you guys have opinions about like what format would be helpful or what do you what,

919
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:24,520
what would you after having kind of done that exercise, like, what do you think might be helpful for going forward?

920
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:31,670
Like, let me know. And um, I think that that whole idea space is like still evolving.

921
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:38,180
Um, and there's not a, you know, and of course the challenge is like not one size does not fit all,

922
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:41,780
but like we probably could pick a format and just go with it and like people can use it.

923
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:48,090
And I like I mean, some people are fighting for grants, right?

924
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:52,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We've reviewed a ton of ideas.

925
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:58,040
He's right. You feel like making sure you're looking?

926
01:50:58,070 --> 01:51:06,110
Just kept writing there. Yeah. It's pleasant present for a good junior year, right?

927
01:51:06,110 --> 01:51:10,010
Even if you're applying to, like, the major. Yeah, I agree.

928
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:19,130
You. I mean, even as I was in a postdoc in internal intramural, I had to submit one for every renewal every year.

929
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:25,560
So I think that was really good. I mean, at the time, right.

930
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:35,870
It was a really good thing to do even though I know that like at the year end of the deciding to say like.

931
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:46,450
Republican have it right now. And it was a formal thing that we have had to deal.

932
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:53,290
And even that's different. When I worked on the Grateful, I.

933
01:51:55,680 --> 01:52:00,330
Two. Yeah, and that was the reason for that. It was my role.

934
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:07,010
No. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Forward.

935
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:17,920
I think it does. I mean, it adds to transparency and evaluation, you know, and if people have seen it.

936
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:22,629
I think also coming from this particular perspective of like talking to the faculty

937
01:52:22,630 --> 01:52:26,260
and that's like more informal because like we all we never all see each other either.

938
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:32,650
Like just everybody's like I look around, I'm like, Oh, I haven't seen like some of these people in two years, you know?

939
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:40,510
But if everybody's kind of filling in the same format, then people can.

940
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:43,899
I think it also can help like spark ideas for faculty.

941
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:51,190
They may be like, Oh, I could help you with solve. You know, this, this is relevant to me in this way that like this Ph.D. student and their mentor,

942
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:54,609
like, might have no idea that this person is doing stuff.

943
01:52:54,610 --> 01:53:00,080
And so I think it might be a really nice way to kind of present, you know,

944
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:07,959
your guys progress and everything like that at these in this faculty settings where people are like, you know, generating ideas.

945
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:16,810
And and I think actually that ADP is really they they certainly, you know, postdocs have had to do them for a long time.

946
01:53:16,810 --> 01:53:23,770
And anybody who's going to get the NIH funding. So like there are so maybe I'll pick your guys brains a little bit more about

947
01:53:23,770 --> 01:53:27,909
what formats and stuff might be the most helpful and most broadly applicable,

948
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:31,270
because I think that the downside, of course, is that like, you know,

949
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:35,469
somebody who's coming in to like a research project that like pumping out papers and they're like,

950
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:40,990
great, you can be on like five papers and you know, that person's like really different from somebody who's like,

951
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:46,629
I'm going to try to learn all these new skills and do primary data collection and have no data for two year, you know?

952
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:54,220
So that comparison thing, which happens at all levels of, you know, everywhere, can get a little tricky.

953
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:59,260
But I think it's good to kind of formalize and bring it together and I think there is a desire for that.

954
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:03,129
So that seemed good. Um, yeah.

955
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:06,460
Yeah. And, uh, it's always sort of interesting those meetings.

956
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:17,920
Um, but actually that does kind of link us to the kind of stuff the rest of the stuff I was gonna chat with you guys about today,

957
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:28,780
so I'll just put these up, but I know that like probably I've been doing a sort of like intensive conceptual model stuff,

958
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:37,360
but also this is like a little bit of a pull back session and figure out like what is helpful in this navigation space.

959
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:45,340
And I have a few that do I have a bunch of things we managed to make it through everything so closet.

960
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:53,379
Okay, so wanted to talk about. I think I bumped conferencing for the next week when we talked like the panel too.

961
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:58,090
But conferencing also with COVID, as we all know, is like a totally changing space.

962
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:03,729
So there's some things around conferencing that we can for sure talk about.

963
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:08,620
And is everybody or is anybody going to any conferences this year that they know of?

964
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:12,460
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I. Yeah.

965
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:16,120
In my case, I've been here. Not actually.

966
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:23,620
But I wanted to go. And I know he gave you some suggestions to, but I don't know.

967
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:34,060
Or even where they look for the simple things. Right.

968
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:37,630
And it's like, yes. Yes.

969
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:45,540
We definitely. I feel like that, I think. Actually when he just took my files because I was editing this stuff.

970
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:51,060
Confirm now revise week seven. So that's in it. Okay.

971
01:55:51,070 --> 01:56:01,200
When we talk about the panel, I mean, it's not like the answers and that's your background where I guess I would say I mean,

972
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:05,970
definitely asking what were the ones he just out of curiosity, do you remember the ones that he recommended?

973
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:12,420
He said, okay, and then and I'm going ask you before that.

974
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,950
Oh, yeah. I was like, he was someone I had a lot of public health.

975
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:21,440
I mean, a lot of people still. And a lot of.

976
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:33,930
And so those are the two. But those are just the number I know and I'm for.

977
01:56:37,570 --> 01:56:44,420
Yeah. One of the ones that I. So Apache is.

978
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:50,879
I've never been to APJ, but I think it's similar to like American psychological,

979
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:56,280
sort of like a big, big conferences that are like 10,000 people or more and.

980
01:56:57,450 --> 01:57:02,969
It's it's a good type of conference to go to because you just get like that flood of

981
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:06,930
information there over it's a little overwhelming but there's a bunch of stuff to do.

982
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:16,710
There's you can make a lot of connections. You can kind of grow your, you know, like Touch Network nicely and just sort of figure out like,

983
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:23,519
it's also a good place to go see like superstars that you have are big fan of in their writing and give the talk.

984
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:30,749
And I just feel like that's like really fun and inspiring and so I feel like those big ones are good for that.

985
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:39,030
And then also APJ, you know, it's always in the news and there's always, you know, so it's, it's very yeah, it's like very energizing.

986
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:45,390
I think it's in early November and I don't know where it is.

987
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:53,599
Boston. Okay. Yeah. So, you know, a little bit of a hike, not as far as it could be.

988
01:57:53,600 --> 01:58:01,669
Appears like, um, there's some, like the Society for Prevention Research is a nice youth focused one.

989
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:06,930
I don't know, Amy. That feels like one that you would. Yeah, that's one that just. That's pretty complex.

990
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:15,320
Yeah. Uh huh.

991
01:58:15,470 --> 01:58:20,020
Yeah, they're nice, but they're a great early career Congress.

992
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:27,200
Like, they just put a lot of energy and effort into early career people and opportunities.

993
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:28,310
I think they're really good.

994
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:37,130
Like they align well, like they sort of grew out of these interventions that were very school based violence prevention type interventions.

995
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:43,549
There's there's a lot of research focused on youth and but it's also a bit more broad than that.

996
01:58:43,550 --> 01:58:46,220
And it's also not huge, which is nice.

997
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:54,650
I feel like that's one thing to think about around conferencing like a huge APJ, but then also something that's a little more like internet.

998
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:59,300
I don't know how big the ACR one is. It was because it was still co I mean.

999
01:59:00,110 --> 01:59:04,970
Yeah. But I mean, I was like I kept running into the same people.

1000
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:08,710
Uh huh. Okay. I'd say it's pretty small numbers.

1001
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:15,210
Yeah. It's a fairly. Fairly small as.

1002
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:25,370
And you can like connect like it's I think it is a good sign if you are running into the same people because you could then have that little like hey,

1003
01:59:25,370 --> 01:59:28,879
you know, like just sort of goo it's goofy but it like matters.

1004
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:30,590
And then you kind of keep running into people.

1005
01:59:31,410 --> 01:59:37,700
Um, the Society for Behavioral Medicine is one that a lot of people attend, and I have gone to a few times.

1006
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:41,600
I think I'm in it. Well, we submitted a bunch of stuff. We'll see if it gets accepted.

1007
01:59:42,110 --> 01:59:46,880
And that's in March. I want to say that is in Phenix.

1008
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:53,540
So the deadline for submitting an abstract to that has passed, but one could still go the downside.

1009
01:59:53,540 --> 02:00:01,339
It's like costly. And if you don't submit an abstract, then sometimes you get don't get access to the funding like if they're not a presenter.

1010
02:00:01,340 --> 02:00:09,260
So there's some, some funding streams like from the department and stuff that you can have access to if you present at the conference.

1011
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,500
But you have to send it a little like, here's my evidence I present.

1012
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:17,579
So thinking about what still has upcoming deadlines is good.

1013
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:26,120
Too good to do. There are nobody in here, certainly like eating and physical activity nutrition.

1014
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:32,920
But there's. It has been is a conference that does that international society.

1015
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:37,700
Physical activity, nutrition. And.

1016
02:00:39,570 --> 02:00:45,190
You know, let's see. I still I if people are youth focused, I still tend to go to SIRC,

1017
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:51,069
which is the Society for Child Development Research, and they have an adolescent one on off years.

1018
02:00:51,070 --> 02:00:58,870
That's only two years. That adolescent focus, once again, that may not be applied to New in adolescence, but maybe not.

1019
02:01:02,060 --> 02:01:08,510
I'm trying to think. SBM definitely has a lot of kind of the communication piece.

1020
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:15,130
And it would be interesting. It might be interesting for you to just think about your presentation and for you, Clara,

1021
02:01:15,230 --> 02:01:26,780
in terms of going on there and seeing like what what tracks in interest there are because the benefit of SB, it's often like I,

1022
02:01:27,650 --> 02:01:33,410
I've kind of characterized it in the past as like, you know, a bunch of like, you know,

1023
02:01:33,410 --> 02:01:40,100
nutritionists and physical activity people who are super fit saying like you should eat and exercise, you know what I mean?

1024
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:45,980
And it's been that kind of historically like a bunch of like health psychology people.

1025
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:55,370
But I feel like because that is not a very successful approach to behavior change, people are like being broadening in that space.

1026
02:01:55,370 --> 02:02:02,080
And I feel like I was learn a lot when I go to that meeting and I want to say that's like about it's like a few thousand people.

1027
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:09,950
That's not humongous. And I know people in this department who go to that are like like Christie Gambrell goes to that.

1028
02:02:09,950 --> 02:02:19,700
And I think can Resnick also like this sort of you know, the think about like clinic communications spaces specific you know,

1029
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:23,959
illnesses chronic illnesses that would be representation at SBM.

1030
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:28,970
And they do have it's expensive to join, but almost everything has a student rate.

1031
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:34,670
And SBM does offer a lot of trainings and webinars that you can access if you join.

1032
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:38,180
So I kind of I think that's kind of a good one too.

1033
02:02:39,590 --> 02:02:44,750
And definitely asking mentors, you know, what might be good.

1034
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:54,080
It's also kind of nice to think about like kind of either like just regional or hyper focused conferences that are small,

1035
02:02:54,890 --> 02:03:00,560
hopefully be nice if your mentor was attending as well, because then that can be,

1036
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:06,080
you know, like even a few hundred person conference like where everybody's kind of in the same

1037
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:10,129
room to hear talks and then all kind of poster session together and have like snacks,

1038
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:19,880
you know? And that is the kind of conference where you really, if you're deeply in that area, is a good one, a good type of conference to find.

1039
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:26,970
I'm just sort of mentally scanning everyone's interests and thinking of what might be helpful because I totally agree.

1040
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:31,530
It's sort of really hard to find things and it's sort of like cultural knowledge that people pass around.

1041
02:03:33,900 --> 02:03:37,950
And generally both. We can talk more about this too, but.

1042
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:42,920
Yeah. If people come across, then it's good to share.

1043
02:03:42,950 --> 02:03:51,460
You know, there might also be some information on specific conferences in that canvas file that's about professional development.

1044
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:54,590
H b g. I can't.

1045
02:03:54,830 --> 02:04:00,740
There is stuff on conferencing, kind of approaching conferencing, which I talked about two in like two weeks, but.

1046
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:13,120
Definitely ask around. Also, we can ask the panel also in two weeks about what is helpful, what they have found helpful conference wise.

1047
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:22,150
Yeah. And in general, which makes sense. Like those littler conferences are more focused on specific topics.

1048
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:27,070
And so I feel like having a balanced combination of conferences is good.

1049
02:04:30,170 --> 02:04:32,540
Okay. So let's see.

1050
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:46,310
So, Romeo, I had a few of those readings on, like communities of practice, which is that for that term, I feel like it was borrowed from.

1051
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:54,340
Well, a few different things, but initially, I guess more sort of clinical work.

1052
02:04:55,930 --> 02:05:04,990
But this idea and it does relate to conferencing, I think actually pretty significantly because if you think about like out here,

1053
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:12,520
like this is like you're at a type conference, like you're big conference, like, okay, I'm on the job market, I want to network.

1054
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:16,750
I just want to like make loose tie connections with like as many people as I can.

1055
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:24,790
And this is that idea of the really broad place where our doctoral training sits.

1056
02:05:25,330 --> 02:05:30,309
And then here we've talked before about all the resources that you have, an institutional context,

1057
02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:36,520
like not every university has a Learning Health Sciences Institute makeup thing and then

1058
02:05:36,520 --> 02:05:40,510
sort of like what is immediately available kind of in your department or discipline.

1059
02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:49,770
And I think those are helpful ways to jump above thinking about what your, you know, everything from like your ADP training opportunities,

1060
02:05:49,770 --> 02:05:57,160
your conferencing and like that, just the different people that you might encounter or at all of those levels.

1061
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:04,640
And they all kind of shape and form like a community practice.

1062
02:06:04,650 --> 02:06:13,790
So this idea of who are in your community practice, you know, like it evolves over time, changes over time.

1063
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:23,780
You know, people can be kind of in or out of your research and your community practice, but these are these sort of ways to think about it.

1064
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:31,879
And I always talk about like the loose ties and conferencing because you just never know like that person that you keep going to ST Sessions with.

1065
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:35,240
Like if you're in three sessions together, you're pretty much interested in the same stuff.

1066
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:42,379
So it's good to like, you know, acknowledge that and that, you know, you guys have, you know,

1067
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:47,810
guardians or mentors and then coordinates and then there's sort of like online connections

1068
02:06:47,810 --> 02:06:53,720
or looser connections can also be important to kind of keep keep growing and.

1069
02:06:55,340 --> 02:07:08,719
You know, cultivating empathy. And so just, you know, these are ideas or examples within Ann Arbor.

1070
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:13,220
And also, more broadly, the ways that we can build our communities affect us.

1071
02:07:14,810 --> 02:07:23,780
And I'd like to just sort of highlight, you know, we're heading into this beautiful in the middle of this beautiful fall season.

1072
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:27,799
And these pictures are like from the Beauty Times.

1073
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:37,340
I mean, I'm here. But even if it's like when it's like wintry and cold, I think it is helpful to think about be proactive,

1074
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:41,690
I guess, in in terms of ways that you're going to keep COVID connected with people.

1075
02:07:42,290 --> 02:07:51,050
And I think that the writing group, if there are like people either like again in your lab,

1076
02:07:51,260 --> 02:08:01,969
if you're in sort of a research group together or as a cohort, it can be a really nice way to sort of build accountability and support for writing,

1077
02:08:01,970 --> 02:08:09,110
like doesn't matter what you're writing, but especially as we all kind of like, you know, focus in,

1078
02:08:09,110 --> 02:08:17,269
in the winter months, I think it can be nice to think about just proactively making those kind of connections gathering.

1079
02:08:17,270 --> 02:08:24,170
And this can also be like studying for 700 or whatever it is, like thinking about ways you can share that time.

1080
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:29,809
And the other thing around community practice.

1081
02:08:29,810 --> 02:08:36,350
So like these are just, you know, sharing some social time, but we are doing this a little bit here.

1082
02:08:36,350 --> 02:08:40,549
So like the idea of friendly presentations and whenever you can sort of present

1083
02:08:40,550 --> 02:08:46,490
your work and get it out there in a low stakes way that helps your audience,

1084
02:08:46,490 --> 02:08:53,180
like mentally build your community of practice because they can like make connections for you about what their work makes you think about.

1085
02:08:54,810 --> 02:08:58,730
So, and like this is just like working together and research groups.

1086
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:03,980
So those are all like sources I guess I would say of community is a practice that

1087
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:10,040
I guess I would argue are like important to consider like actively building.

1088
02:09:10,220 --> 02:09:16,640
And I put virtual conferencing out there even though, you know, hopefully we'll move to more in-person conferencing.

1089
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:23,900
But like I just don't know, you know, I don't know how it's all going to go and I don't know how many people are going to be like,

1090
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:30,680
we can't wait to go back to conferences and like, here we go. Or if it's going to, some of them are going to stay virtual.

1091
02:09:31,490 --> 02:09:36,160
I was just talking to someone yesterday who said I think he said it was last year at AP,

1092
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:44,120
a they had early career presenters kind of all present first virtually, and then like senior presenters present in person.

1093
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:48,829
And he was like, it was great to see these senior presenters, but then like none of the senior people came to the early career stuff.

1094
02:09:48,830 --> 02:09:57,409
So it was like the hybrid thing is a little funky and I don't know who does it well and it's hard to say in advance.

1095
02:09:57,410 --> 02:10:01,129
So, you know, at the same time,

1096
02:10:01,130 --> 02:10:08,000
I think it's probably even this is a decent way to build like loose networks and it's really easy to chat and email someone.

1097
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:16,580
So that's like almost easier than like the person, you know, you have to like break the mascot engagement ball or whatever.

1098
02:10:17,930 --> 02:10:26,509
Okay, so there's like this idea of community practice and then I like this article because it kind of goes through this stages of communities,

1099
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:36,080
of practice, of building them. And again, like talking about loose ties, you see 73 times a meeting and then you're sort of,

1100
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:40,730
you know, you maybe chat about ideas and say like, oh, we think about this the same way.

1101
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:45,379
Like, Oh, I didn't really think about that distinction between like cultural humility and cultural competence.

1102
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:47,420
That's really interesting. That's going to inform my work.

1103
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:54,080
And you just have like a casual chit chat and then maybe you say, like, we knew that you want to pull together.

1104
02:10:54,500 --> 02:11:02,389
You know, it's because conferencing like, like a session on, you know, cultural humility and you do health care and you do education.

1105
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:06,800
But like, maybe we could do it to get, you know, do this session together. And we work on a shared project together.

1106
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:15,380
And then, you know, you kind of can be really active and have a lot of this shared activity and partnership and shared research and stuff.

1107
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:20,760
And then you may not always stay in that like active zone, and that's okay too.

1108
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:28,129
But the idea of okay, our like flurry of intellectual engagement has like led to these products and now

1109
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:34,070
we're both kind of moving over here and doing some different things and like, we're still taking that with us, but we can also move along.

1110
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:40,790
And so I think, you know, again, you guys are all coming in with a lot of different experiences,

1111
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:44,360
but I'm sure you've kind of gone through these processes.

1112
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:48,800
I think what's different about like doing it in the context of like.

1113
02:11:50,830 --> 02:11:55,060
It's it's sort of hard sometimes to figure out who your groups are going to be.

1114
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:59,860
And they're going to be multiple groups and they're probably going to be new groups from what you were doing before.

1115
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:08,440
And so kind of actively thinking through like, okay, where do I want to kind of again like cultivate these, these community connections for my work?

1116
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:23,980
Um, I think it's helpful. Um, and I think here's another just flood on the writing and then I've talked about a little bit about strategies,

1117
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:31,960
but the benefit of, um, I think these writing groups.

1118
02:12:32,410 --> 02:12:40,120
Um. And I think was that because that secret guide won?

1119
02:12:40,150 --> 02:12:48,580
Yeah. I think that, uh, there's, like, different phases of writing, as we all know.

1120
02:12:49,150 --> 02:12:56,260
Like, people are working on papers, and this is what I think of as like slightly lower stakes writing.

1121
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:59,350
And this is like accountability for writing and sort of saying,

1122
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:05,349
how am I going to keep myself going on this paper, even if it's a virtual accountability?

1123
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:08,980
Like, Hey, we're both working on their things for 2 hours. Did you do that?

1124
02:13:09,100 --> 02:13:17,139
You know, sort of ways to check in with each other and get, you know, feedback that you're doing the writing, but then also on the writing.

1125
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:18,910
And so we'll do that a little bit in here.

1126
02:13:20,620 --> 02:13:26,799
But it's also helpful to have people who like, you know, maybe they're in your research lab or you're working on the paper together.

1127
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:32,230
And that's like an easy sharing. If you're each working on different parts of the paper, somebody is doing the method,

1128
02:13:32,230 --> 02:13:34,870
somebody is doing a lot review and you're kind of like back and forth.

1129
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:42,669
But it could also be people who you're not sharing authorship with and it's a working on totally different stuff can also lead to authorship.

1130
02:13:42,670 --> 02:13:50,770
If you feel like you've, you know, collaborated enough on the paper and then this like writing with advisor piece.

1131
02:13:50,770 --> 02:14:00,970
So I'm not sure how much people are like yet talking with advisors about papers and that kind of stuff, but maybe some variation.

1132
02:14:01,780 --> 02:14:13,420
Um, and I think that the idea of just sort of moving forward is important with paper writing.

1133
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:19,440
Um, and when we're talking about empirical articles like we've talked about that whole

1134
02:14:19,450 --> 02:14:27,759
like really formulaic way of writing that can make this easier because you're like,

1135
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,640
here's the section or the chunk I'm working on now.

1136
02:14:32,350 --> 02:14:38,409
I'm going to have a deadline to get it to my advisor, and then I'm going to make myself work on another chunk and know that it's a draft.

1137
02:14:38,410 --> 02:14:43,930
But I just got to keep kind of like moving forward and figuring out the best ways to check it up is helpful.

1138
02:14:45,190 --> 02:14:51,760
And then this idea that that the National Center for Faculty Diversity always says is right for 30 minutes every day.

1139
02:14:52,750 --> 02:14:55,170
And so I think just like we're talking about medical training,

1140
02:14:55,300 --> 02:15:04,570
building and cultural humility or you're like building a writing habit earlier in your training, I think is really helpful.

1141
02:15:05,230 --> 02:15:08,230
And whenever I have really been in this habit,

1142
02:15:09,310 --> 02:15:17,740
it's so satisfying because you just there's just less of like a motivational force needed to keep writing.

1143
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:22,150
And I think what's also great about this habit is that.

1144
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:28,990
If you don't do it every day, then you spend like 25 minutes trying to locate the file.

1145
02:15:28,990 --> 02:15:31,780
And where was I? What was I doing before? And it's like waste.

1146
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:36,610
And it's like actively wasted time when you have to, like, reengage yourself with a project,

1147
02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:40,390
even if you don't feel like dealing with that project to that day.

1148
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:48,000
Um, it is, it does kind of pay off and it does help in terms of having you can help form the habit.

1149
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:54,639
So again, sometimes it's hard with that being class and having homework and doing all this other stuff,

1150
02:15:54,640 --> 02:16:03,370
but it is good if you can to at least just like in that again, like I've floated in and out of this heavily,

1151
02:16:04,330 --> 02:16:10,149
but when I'm in it, even if I'm like, Oh my gosh, I'm like, Done, I've done reading, I'm done, you know,

1152
02:16:10,150 --> 02:16:18,940
whatever all kind of reasons that what I'm doing and like make a set of goals for the next day, just so I kind of don't lose.

1153
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:23,560
You know, engagement with whatever it is that I'm working on.

1154
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:34,090
So I don't know if people have tried other strategies on this or feel like they have a good daily writing habit or I,

1155
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:38,560
you know, if they write ideas or journal or other things.

1156
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:46,280
But I feel like it's. Kind of hard to do what is happening.

1157
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:52,850
I figured because I had set the timer.

1158
02:16:53,960 --> 02:16:58,500
But I do like that for writing. All right.

1159
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:02,520
Whatever is in my mind, I think about anything, whatever, for that time.

1160
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:08,960
And then I'll use the next six. Whatever you create it.

1161
02:17:08,970 --> 02:17:12,650
Yeah. Yeah I. Yeah. And that one it is.

1162
02:17:12,770 --> 02:17:16,669
That one's only 15 minute chunks, but it's multiple, it's like structured.

1163
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:23,030
We said, yeah, it's like, yeah, 30 minutes are 5 minutes off and for three, you need a longer break.

1164
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:26,720
And you. You quotidian like that?

1165
02:17:28,420 --> 02:17:35,170
I can focus for 15 minutes of the time or whatever and not get caught up in the this.

1166
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:42,800
Grandma might get all the time out of and then use the next round to left.

1167
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:47,150
Cut it out in a bid to get it right to do this. Yeah.

1168
02:17:48,580 --> 02:17:55,700
It's really I mean. Yeah. And I think that's great that that and has that been that sounds like it's been helpful like a good way to.

1169
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:02,350
Yeah so that and stick with a mix of that in writing groups and then with COVID the writing groups have been very supportive,

1170
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:09,450
even more helpful because it's kind of like I don't. You could write efficient check in during the break.

1171
02:18:11,730 --> 02:18:17,100
So they will go back and. That's good.

1172
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:20,730
That's great. Anybody else?

1173
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:32,560
Habits or. Tell us about a little bit that helps connect with third parties.

1174
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:44,060
I think it can be hard. For me, it's like a balance of is it better to write a each day or have.

1175
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:51,670
So I read into that. Through that, I think figuring out that balance is many.

1176
02:18:54,820 --> 02:19:01,450
Yeah. Yeah. I think it is hard with I mean, it's great to have the few hours set aside,

1177
02:19:01,450 --> 02:19:07,240
but then it's hard if you're like in the moment not finding the flow and you're like, I got my 2 hours or whatever.

1178
02:19:07,890 --> 02:19:11,710
Um, so I agree. That's a hard, like, it's hard to.

1179
02:19:13,830 --> 02:19:20,910
It's hard to kind of force oneself into flow. And then you feel like they've had these 2 hours and like all this other stuff in my life happened,

1180
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:24,420
so I just can't focus in the way I was hoping to focus.

1181
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:34,509
Um. And so I think sometimes I feel like when I've been really good about this habit as well,

1182
02:19:34,510 --> 02:19:40,809
trying to get out certain papers that I like knew they were like hanging over my head or like grant application.

1183
02:19:40,810 --> 02:19:49,639
But a grant application, I feel like, is much more like. Writing at all times during the day that I can.

1184
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:52,820
And it's so in the forefront of my brain that I'm like,

1185
02:19:53,540 --> 02:20:00,290
It's easier actually to like for me anyway to write the grant application because it's like, I've got to do this, I got to do this.

1186
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:07,459
Going to a paper is much more like it's a little bit more reflective, like what's going to be the constant attribution.

1187
02:20:07,460 --> 02:20:12,020
And so I feel like that it's less urgent feeling,

1188
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:22,249
but I think sometimes what's helped is that I've tried to do this and then like left myself the option if I can in my calendar to be like,

1189
02:20:22,250 --> 02:20:28,579
okay, if I get into flow then I can like push a meeting or you know, have more time.

1190
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:34,130
But I got to start a little bit every day and I feel like that was some sometimes,

1191
02:20:34,150 --> 02:20:37,850
but sometimes but not always helpful in that flow, because I think you're totally right.

1192
02:20:37,850 --> 02:20:41,640
It is a balance. Of that.

1193
02:20:41,820 --> 02:20:50,200
I don't know of any practices I'm guilty of, like loading it all together, and I.

1194
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:56,470
Like I try to just do the short intervals because I think it might take some pressure off.

1195
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:02,629
It's like, okay, this is the time that I fight for this, right? This is it.

1196
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:07,820
And then, like you said, like, oh, but and then the that at the end of the day, I have to do that.

1197
02:21:07,870 --> 02:21:10,880
Is that whatever meaning is on that. Yeah.

1198
02:21:11,010 --> 02:21:15,770
No, not always really. Even do you know is there a time or.

1199
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:29,950
I think the small part to it, it does feel like it does help to chunk things and like to take the pressure off any given writing stretch.

1200
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:37,659
To. I never heard that it's in the map.

1201
02:21:37,660 --> 02:21:42,340
Or is it right? It's pretty neat. I don't like to think.

1202
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:47,450
They're like this.

1203
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:50,450
They keep like it's like a tomato and it yeah.

1204
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:57,290
It's a tomato timer. Okay. And, and have to work working several times.

1205
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:03,160
15 minutes on 5 minutes. And then I want to see.

1206
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:17,510
But I did that for. Yeah.

1207
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:23,190
Like three things. Yeah, kind of.

1208
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:27,470
Yeah, it is. It's like I can do this intensive thing and then I can, like, you know.

1209
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:33,110
Yeah, it's. It is. I mean, it's kind of evolved.

1210
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:40,580
It kind of came out a little like, you know, this focus on sort of like deep work and how what you need to have that.

1211
02:22:41,180 --> 02:22:47,120
And I feel like in some ways this idea kind of undercuts that deep work idea because you're like, Oh, I'm just going to get in and do some tasks.

1212
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:49,729
And then I've done it. You know, I think it's easy to get into that.

1213
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:54,350
And that's like when I've been less successful with that part of it, because I'll just be like,

1214
02:22:54,350 --> 02:22:59,960
Oh, I'll do more organizing, like, you know, and it didn't really move things forward.

1215
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:07,310
Um, but that idea maybe of like having the half hour blocked and then some extra

1216
02:23:07,310 --> 02:23:12,290
time that you kind of like might allow yourself if you can do the deep work.

1217
02:23:14,120 --> 02:23:19,069
But then I think in that pomodoro I feel like I've read about, um, yeah,

1218
02:23:19,070 --> 02:23:25,910
just sort of that balance of like your, your, if you do these structured interval training kind of ideas,

1219
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:37,909
you'll be able to like access the what you will then do deep work on or easily because you've been able to focus and like putting your phone away,

1220
02:23:37,910 --> 02:23:44,960
which is always hard when you're an app on your phone, you know, it's like all the things about time management in general,

1221
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:53,030
but just that idea of like instilling these habits or being or trying different things to and seem like what works for you.

1222
02:23:53,420 --> 02:23:54,649
And then I think actually, Amy,

1223
02:23:54,650 --> 02:24:02,959
when you said that the of the group didn't Kate sailors say that they had done like a writing accountability group or something for healthy minds.

1224
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:06,260
Maybe there's. First.

1225
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:13,180
Further reading her writing last year. I think it's kind of started as like.

1226
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:23,340
Oh, yes. The President set up. Almost to the hour.

1227
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:28,000
Yeah. Yeah. What next? Because I think it is.

1228
02:24:28,010 --> 02:24:32,120
It's like an eternal struggle on the one hand. But it is.

1229
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:32,600
It is.

1230
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:40,390
And I feel like there are these, like, tools and awarenesses out there of, like, strategies, and there are different ways and, you know, everybody's.

1231
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:45,650
And people might do this at 11:30 p.m., which I used to do grad school.

1232
02:24:45,650 --> 02:24:53,540
Like, now that's not happening. I mean, so like when in the day works, that's where all of that stuff is kind of a tool.

1233
02:24:55,490 --> 02:25:05,330
Okay. So and location, which of course now like with COVID, we probably all have better or worse working places in our home settings.

1234
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:12,470
But um, just, you know, being mindful of like, here's where I write best and people don't bother me or whatever it is.

1235
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:18,829
Um, and I think sometimes just sort of like to collect phrases makes sense.

1236
02:25:18,830 --> 02:25:22,730
But this idea of time management and like how much?

1237
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:26,479
Because we're never going to have adequate time to devote to like make everything perfect.

1238
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:31,370
And I think that is like a number one thing to let go of in certainly in grad school,

1239
02:25:31,370 --> 02:25:36,290
but also like, you know, it's a really hard one because of course,

1240
02:25:36,290 --> 02:25:41,090
like, we're all here because we're like obsessed and want to be perfect, you know, it's like we're really, really difficult.

1241
02:25:41,570 --> 02:25:50,110
But this idea of, can I just love this phrase of like, how much effort are you going to put into this thing that, like, may or may not pay off?

1242
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:58,429
And so, like, if you think grant proposal like needs are a one, like you're going to put a lot of effort for into that, a lot of squeeze.

1243
02:25:58,430 --> 02:26:01,280
And like, if you get it, that's amazing.

1244
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:07,910
You know, if you don't, you've still like learned a lot and you have an idea, you can resubmit that and it's like there's a lot of like squeeze there,

1245
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:18,229
even if the juice is not like immediate, but it's like a big, big effort, something like, you know, a conference submission.

1246
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:21,290
And I work with a post-doc right now who has it all the time.

1247
02:26:21,290 --> 02:26:26,629
I'm like, She's doing a job application and I do not spend more than an hour on this like you were at the point.

1248
02:26:26,630 --> 02:26:35,390
I was like, spend 15 minutes on this, you know? So it's just like you could spend 2 hours, you could spend 5 hours, but like you're payoff your like,

1249
02:26:35,660 --> 02:26:40,129
you know, additional rate of return on that time investment is not worth it.

1250
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:43,340
And so that's really like it.

1251
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:46,850
It's that idea of like, is it good enough for what it needs to be?

1252
02:26:47,750 --> 02:26:52,340
And can I be like done with it now and move on to other things. So that's one thing.

1253
02:26:52,670 --> 02:27:00,920
And then this idea of like focus and again, you guys are like in this expansive stage right now and it's always good to,

1254
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:08,270
you know, be drawn to different ideas for a while and like interdisciplinary, oh, like this is a really cool concept.

1255
02:27:08,270 --> 02:27:10,130
Like maybe I could bring this in and this one too.

1256
02:27:10,140 --> 02:27:19,220
And, and I think that you can like a lot some time to this idea of like chasing these like really fun,

1257
02:27:19,670 --> 02:27:26,060
exciting ideas, but then kind of have a system for yourself to like put a,

1258
02:27:26,390 --> 02:27:34,040
you know, put it in a parking lot or put a pin in it, whatever phrase that is, and sort of decide whether you can then later integrate them.

1259
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:40,040
Because again, that idea of like research careers are hopefully long and you can come back to that.

1260
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:48,290
And it's sometimes these glitter squirrel ideas are like important because they just like sparked creativity and that alone is worth thinking about.

1261
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:54,320
But then being kind of coming back to like reality and saying like, can I really do this?

1262
02:27:54,950 --> 02:28:01,690
Like, you know, virtual reality training around cultural humility, which I think actually somebody is doing here.

1263
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:11,540
Somehow somebody has done a virtual reality project. But I just I'm I'm kind of a bit of a squirrel seeker person, but that's cool.

1264
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:12,830
That would be a cool idea.

1265
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:18,620
Like maybe you could get there and in research, but probably not for you, but like check it out, you know, see what's around there.

1266
02:28:19,370 --> 02:28:26,179
Um, and then to other kind of like specific like tool strategies and like the Pomodoro idea can be on here too,

1267
02:28:26,180 --> 02:28:32,030
but you know, create a backwards timeline which for grant writing is like critical because you're a huge,

1268
02:28:32,030 --> 02:28:35,540
huge deadline is sitting there and you're like, oh, I get the letters,

1269
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:41,870
got to get the budget like it's made for you pretty much, but that you could do with lots of projects.

1270
02:28:42,260 --> 02:28:47,090
And then that idea of blocking out calendar time to do stuff, those are all good,

1271
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:52,310
good timeline management things like in that sort of daily time management way.

1272
02:28:53,380 --> 02:29:01,630
Yes, you do. Having a life during the week.

1273
02:29:02,470 --> 02:29:03,700
I went and checked it out and she said,

1274
02:29:03,730 --> 02:29:12,430
It's not like a little post about what you can do on a daily basis or like having kind of a plan and then just checking in with it.

1275
02:29:12,430 --> 02:29:19,030
And of course it changes on the day, but I thought it was really helpful and I guess I'm a really visual person.

1276
02:29:19,030 --> 02:29:23,500
So yeah, I don't think I like it.

1277
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:30,190
Yeah, definitely. Who is whose comment was that one? He was.

1278
02:29:32,250 --> 02:29:42,450
That leukemias. Oh, that was for academic.

1279
02:29:43,290 --> 02:29:46,620
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it was fun.

1280
02:29:46,650 --> 02:29:51,610
Oh, that. Get a life. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1281
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:55,500
Exactly. Oh, good. Oh, good.

1282
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:59,850
Yeah, there's definitely there's so many different ways to approach it.

1283
02:29:59,850 --> 02:30:03,089
But yeah. And I, I'm a big fan of the calendar.

1284
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:10,410
Um, I look back at my old paper calendars, which I just sort of had them and I kept them,

1285
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:16,079
and it was very satisfying to just physically block out the time.

1286
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:22,740
And then now I do it on my phone, which is much more like, you know, things get scheduled over at all the time, but that's right.

1287
02:30:23,970 --> 02:30:28,080
And so yeah, so that is that kind of daily, weekly checking in, how am I doing?

1288
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:37,650
And then this is sort of switching to like bigger picture, like ADP style timeline and this is kind of like what?

1289
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:51,819
You know, it's that sort of process of the full kind of Ph.D. work and like thinking about it across this whole timeline,

1290
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:53,920
like, how do I stay organized and focus?

1291
02:30:53,920 --> 02:31:02,410
And I think I've mentioned like right now you guys are here, you guys are in like coursework zone and then there's like prelim,

1292
02:31:02,530 --> 02:31:08,380
which is it's kind of in between zone, which is a big, huge like backwards deadline that you can set.

1293
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:17,139
And then, you know, in the coursework phase, it's kind of like, what skills am I trying to gain here?

1294
02:31:17,140 --> 02:31:22,510
I'm like, what is my expertize that I am moving towards integrating?

1295
02:31:22,990 --> 02:31:28,059
And that's a good way to like that's a good kind of question, like both, you know, guided by ADP.

1296
02:31:28,060 --> 02:31:34,209
But then also like, okay, what is like my commute going to be what additional things do I need to think

1297
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:39,250
about in order to kind of situate my my research and then for my research?

1298
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:43,870
And I think over this period of time, like this sort of coursework,

1299
02:31:44,110 --> 02:31:51,700
there's pretty well sometimes there's a like drop off of motivation and focus and just the sense of community,

1300
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:55,000
which is why that community as a practice is so important.

1301
02:31:55,720 --> 02:32:01,840
After for you, I'm like, Oh, I'm done. And now, but now it becomes very individual and I really got to do like my prospectus.

1302
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:10,749
And so thinking about how you support yourself and your work around prospectus and this whole thing, that's important.

1303
02:32:10,750 --> 02:32:17,979
So I think what comes up here around like prospectus development phase is that idea of like, what are my ideas?

1304
02:32:17,980 --> 02:32:21,850
What am I going to do, what's new? And you know, you're thinking about this a lot of all the time.

1305
02:32:21,850 --> 02:32:26,530
That's kind of like the guiding set of questions and that phase.

1306
02:32:28,570 --> 02:32:33,969
And then I think this all of these things are talking about become really important

1307
02:32:33,970 --> 02:32:39,730
here in this like dissertation phase because it's really hard to chunk up.

1308
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:43,480
It's really hard to stay focused on this huge thing.

1309
02:32:43,480 --> 02:32:46,510
Like, I got to finish my dissertation, I'm not going to do that today.

1310
02:32:46,570 --> 02:32:51,520
Like there will be one day where that happens, but you can't think about it that way.

1311
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:58,329
And so thinking about, okay, how am I chopping up my activities in this stage?

1312
02:32:58,330 --> 02:33:04,750
And I think that this question comes up a fair bit because a dissertation is like this big project,

1313
02:33:04,750 --> 02:33:13,270
but now with like multiple manuscript formats, that can be a way to sort of think about sucking up your dissertation and saying like,

1314
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:16,149
okay, I'm going to work on a manuscript that is part of my dissertation,

1315
02:33:16,150 --> 02:33:20,080
but I'm also going to submit and I've been on a lot of committees where people say like,

1316
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:23,049
Oh, this paper was already submitted and accepted as a dissertation.

1317
02:33:23,050 --> 02:33:27,840
I'm like, okay, well, I guess I didn't get feedback from that one, you know, like,

1318
02:33:27,940 --> 02:33:33,310
so you can, you can kind of have a both and approach, I guess, to some of these things.

1319
02:33:35,410 --> 02:33:40,750
And then thinking about, you know, a big picture like where do we go from here that comes up?

1320
02:33:41,410 --> 02:33:46,630
But I think the staying organized theme kind of going through each of these phases,

1321
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:52,780
it will shift around a little bit, but the idea of having these good habits can help across all that.

1322
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:59,140
And that idea of like, how do I sit here and like have a life are all things to kind of think about.

1323
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:04,680
Okay. And then this idea of how do I stay organized?

1324
02:34:04,690 --> 02:34:12,700
We talked already about IDPs or kind of across this whole phase to do lists, calendar blocks.

1325
02:34:13,090 --> 02:34:20,980
Salvador is like all sorts of like supports. There are also like management apps that I don't know.

1326
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:31,420
Like often this comes up when people are working with a group like the PRC Prevention Research Group that are used to really use Trello all the time.

1327
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:36,190
And I've kind of fallen off those projects. I'm not sure if that's something they use.

1328
02:34:36,190 --> 02:34:46,059
Again, that is more still, but that is like when you're part of a group is using some sort of software tool to keep

1329
02:34:46,060 --> 02:34:52,630
organized that can be a really helpful organizational structure to just join in on.

1330
02:34:55,260 --> 02:35:00,239
I think if you're doing it for yourself, I feel like I've gone on and off of these.

1331
02:35:00,240 --> 02:35:08,250
I don't know whether there's people and experiences are and there's a bunch of different types of these organizational softwares.

1332
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:15,540
Um, Trello, I feel like in Michigan a lot of people use it because it developed like from a car company I want to say originally.

1333
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:21,990
So it's like the kind of, you know, whenever I just knew a lot of people who use it, I've used it on and off.

1334
02:35:23,100 --> 02:35:29,480
I don't know if there are others. There's like base camp and I think Microsoft teams has like functions built in that.

1335
02:35:29,610 --> 02:35:34,560
Um, I don't know if people have experience with other kind of software organization tools that.

1336
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:41,640
They have particular responses to positive or negative in the paper.

1337
02:35:41,690 --> 02:35:46,650
And yes, I use electron. But I hope that.

1338
02:35:50,600 --> 02:35:59,100
Yeah. Yeah. Oh I bored and I have a chocolate calendar that I have a little.

1339
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:06,390
I write down what my kids. I just have to see.

1340
02:36:06,390 --> 02:36:09,540
I don't know. It's not the same cooking is, but it's things like.

1341
02:36:10,050 --> 02:36:13,580
Uh huh. Uh huh. I agree. It's like.

1342
02:36:14,150 --> 02:36:20,720
And I think it's that difference, too, between, like, personal management and then team interfacing.

1343
02:36:20,810 --> 02:36:25,190
Right. Because I think a lot of these are certainly really helpful for teams.

1344
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:31,100
Um, but then with Trello, like I would try to do some things like just to manage.

1345
02:36:31,250 --> 02:36:36,770
Like I tried to test it out using it with um, like planning travel or you know, doing other things.

1346
02:36:37,220 --> 02:36:40,270
It was really helpful. But then I, I agree.

1347
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:45,170
Like for me, I, I wrote like paper too and lists it and that kind of thing.

1348
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:50,000
Um, but I think some of these have been really, really good for when you're collaborating with groups,

1349
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:57,229
but it often pays to sort of figure out what what your group is using and then figure out how to use that.

1350
02:36:57,230 --> 02:37:04,160
And then what becomes for again, personally, I found challenging was that like some things lived on Trello,

1351
02:37:04,700 --> 02:37:07,460
not everything to collaborate with a lot of people.

1352
02:37:08,150 --> 02:37:14,479
So then I just kind of like revert back to like here's my to do list that I might rewrite once a week or so.

1353
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:18,530
Like I'm being used to do lists of different ones going, um.

1354
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:22,139
So. Everybody's got a different thing.

1355
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:28,980
But just so that you guys are also aware and I, I think and you're nodding because you guys have systems like that.

1356
02:37:31,110 --> 02:37:38,920
Like started with trial and click experiments on Monday dot com over the last six months or so and

1357
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:44,110
I know I've heard of that a little bit more because you assign that ownership to different types.

1358
02:37:44,110 --> 02:37:48,450
So when you're collaborating, it helps other people to see that also.

1359
02:37:49,410 --> 02:37:57,460
Let me set it up. So I created the chart and. Data visualization.

1360
02:37:57,580 --> 02:38:01,120
Uh huh. So that's one thing. And as a student.

1361
02:38:05,460 --> 02:38:08,650
Oh, that's good to know. And it has a Guinness World.

1362
02:38:11,850 --> 02:38:17,280
I like that. So. Yeah.

1363
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:22,410
Yeah, that's good. That's good to know. I've heard of that, but I haven't worked with that one.

1364
02:38:22,620 --> 02:38:29,580
That's really great. So yeah, I mean, that makes a difference if it's like if it's the things that he's telling you stuff to do, like.

1365
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:34,290
Yeah. It might as well be pleasant. Yeah, that totally makes sense.

1366
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:44,909
And I do. I think this comes up a lot actually, because and like Slack people love your slack, but some people love it.

1367
02:38:44,910 --> 02:38:48,780
Some people hate it. You know, it's just people try it and they don't use it.

1368
02:38:48,780 --> 02:38:54,660
And it's like this is like reorganizing and reorienting yourself to like different workflows.

1369
02:38:57,540 --> 02:39:02,370
You know, it's something that I think people get a lot of experience with in the crisis this time.

1370
02:39:03,960 --> 02:39:08,460
But figuring out at least for yourself, you know, as you're in this process,

1371
02:39:08,610 --> 02:39:16,350
how do you get from okay coursework to sort of dictating what I'm supposed to do and then my freedom is dictating what I'm supposed to do.

1372
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:19,860
The prospectus is still pretty, you know, set.

1373
02:39:21,490 --> 02:39:26,139
Strange. Not straightforward, but like. You have this task that you're accomplishing by this time.

1374
02:39:26,140 --> 02:39:34,270
And then it's like there's this phase which can sort of be overwhelming and big, helps to provide some structure for yourself.

1375
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:42,159
Okay, another thing I like to oh, and then I'm meeting agendas, which we talked about a little bit,

1376
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:48,640
but this is just an example of a former post-doc who's now actually she's faculty in social work,

1377
02:39:49,480 --> 02:39:53,740
but she was like a master at making the chapters in that.

1378
02:39:53,740 --> 02:39:59,200
Like she would just be very clear about which items she would send,

1379
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:07,270
like supporting documents to the attach to like the zoom invite for the meeting so that, you know, and she'd always open each meeting to say,

1380
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:09,639
I'm sure you haven't read those documents,

1381
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:17,170
but I just provided them her discussions sort of like alleviate guilt because I hadn't read the documents and then like some nice follow up plans.

1382
02:40:17,170 --> 02:40:22,750
So this is an example. And these were like standing items that we would check in on.

1383
02:40:23,170 --> 02:40:28,780
And then, you know, she would just sort of report progress. And I think that's a really detailed agenda.

1384
02:40:29,260 --> 02:40:33,700
And that level of detail might not be necessary for every meeting with an advisor,

1385
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:39,250
but like having that agenda and plan and then steps moving forward, I think is.

1386
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:46,850
So helpful for, you know, everybody who would be meeting with but and people who are like, you know,

1387
02:40:46,940 --> 02:40:53,030
super busy and I can remember from one meeting to another, even if they intend to, what's going on can be helpful.

1388
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:58,250
And in this is around the paper writing stuff so like.

1389
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:07,330
If you guys have tried to work with different research teams or different papers going on, how do you track those papers?

1390
02:41:07,350 --> 02:41:13,290
So there's just a few examples of.

1391
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:25,240
Paper writing trackers. And again, this is not particularly pretty and I'm sure there's much better.

1392
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:31,090
I mean, some of it I've seen that are like beautiful. And I'm like, I would like mine to look like that too.

1393
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:38,800
But just the general idea behind these paper trackers is like, here's this paper, here's the people who are involved in it.

1394
02:41:38,820 --> 02:41:41,790
Here's the general content of the paper.

1395
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:49,140
And then this is so critical and it relates back to conceptual models, too, because you're like, Here's the general name.

1396
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:56,340
But really what I mean is that working with these variables in this, and it helps when you're working with teams because you're also like,

1397
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:05,790
these are the variables that I'm kind of planning for my interest in my paper, and I'm being accountable to that by stating like kind of my variables.

1398
02:42:05,790 --> 02:42:12,050
My research question probably should be up here. And then which journal went out and submitted the status of it and notes.

1399
02:42:12,100 --> 02:42:17,690
So. This is not by any means, again, like a perfect example of how to do this.

1400
02:42:17,690 --> 02:42:21,380
There's just another few examples. Whoops.

1401
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:31,540
What's the regulatory gap up here? Let's see now.

1402
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:33,640
It's really not wanting me to. Oh, okay.

1403
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:42,729
Well, I'm not to do that, but an example of paper trackers and and there's a lot sort of floating around on this online and different examples.

1404
02:42:42,730 --> 02:42:49,780
And, you know, I'm sure there are lots of you know, I know there are many different ways to do this.

1405
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:55,750
But as you guys get further in and like right now, you might have like one paper,

1406
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:59,710
maybe even a hanging over of other papers that you have previously working on.

1407
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:09,639
It can be helpful to just have like your own personal Google sheet of a tracker that's like Lara's papers that she's working on.

1408
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:14,290
And then you can share that information, like with research groups as you need to.

1409
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:18,729
But if you work with multiple people, I think it can be really,

1410
02:43:18,730 --> 02:43:27,100
really helpful just as you get more and more stuff to do and keeping keeping in mind that like paper productivity is an important goal.

1411
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:33,110
And this just helps you sort of stay organized and check in on that.

1412
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:39,530
So I think that paper tracker, whatever format people like to use is really helpful and probably teams.

1413
02:43:40,430 --> 02:43:47,540
And often I'm not going to say probably how often teams have some form of paper tracker thing that they do.

1414
02:43:49,820 --> 02:44:01,250
Okay. So this is again, kind of diving a little bit into each of these phases of the process.

1415
02:44:01,250 --> 02:44:06,110
This like again, big picture time with this question about what skills do I need to gain?

1416
02:44:06,110 --> 02:44:11,590
And this is really like around course selection, cognitive selection, IDP planning.

1417
02:44:12,320 --> 02:44:17,719
So you guys have done some of this, but then as you get sort of more refined and thinking about,

1418
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:23,980
okay, what my dissertation like three papers are going to be like, you don't know that yet,

1419
02:44:25,130 --> 02:44:29,270
but like as you kind of take classes and if like you do, do you know,

1420
02:44:29,270 --> 02:44:33,469
you've had a qualitative experience, you're like, well, no, I really want to do that for my dissertation.

1421
02:44:33,470 --> 02:44:37,040
Do I need anything else in prep to complete this work?

1422
02:44:38,780 --> 02:44:42,650
Other advanced quantitative methods. And again is that her own someone which is awesome,

1423
02:44:43,070 --> 02:44:45,740
you know do you want to do work on implementation science are going to take a

1424
02:44:45,830 --> 02:44:49,850
content course in that like where do you how do you want to like build your,

1425
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:59,450
you know, your professional research like identity and skillset in terms of course selection because after you guys get through prelim,

1426
02:45:00,230 --> 02:45:06,690
you have much less coursework. And so right now it's like most, most of what you're doing,

1427
02:45:06,690 --> 02:45:12,919
but then afterwards it's going to become more selective and start thinking about what to do there.

1428
02:45:12,920 --> 02:45:16,340
I've already mentioned I see PSR for the methods pieces.

1429
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:20,690
Seattle Tea has some courses around like teaching and pedagogy.

1430
02:45:21,770 --> 02:45:29,420
And then this is the other piece of skills which we think a little bit less about at the beginning, but certainly are important for later on.

1431
02:45:30,140 --> 02:45:34,010
What practical skills might I want for whatever job market I'm going into?

1432
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:35,959
And so that's why Alexia is up there.

1433
02:45:35,960 --> 02:45:45,050
It's like if people say, I really want to go into a teaching position and whatever I'm doing, I want to show that I really care about pedagogy.

1434
02:45:45,050 --> 02:45:49,310
I'm going to take these additional seminars that show like, Oh, this person really cares.

1435
02:45:49,310 --> 02:45:58,280
They need extra training in this teaching, writing, community engagement seminars like all these kind of more specialized,

1436
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:03,110
I think I mentioned before, like workshops, mixed methods, workshops, that kind of thing.

1437
02:46:03,110 --> 02:46:13,430
So this is both formal coursework and also skills that we want to highlight again, which many of you guys already have from your resume that I know.

1438
02:46:14,660 --> 02:46:17,150
And of course these will be ongoing.

1439
02:46:19,910 --> 02:46:29,180
So the idea of what's my research niche, this is I think I've said this before, but this idea of using course assignments strategically.

1440
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:36,379
So like if you're doing again like in 700, I know you guys are writing papers in lots of different courses.

1441
02:46:36,380 --> 02:46:41,420
And so any opportunity that you can have to either use that paper to like

1442
02:46:41,420 --> 02:46:45,920
explore your particular interests or a different method or something like that.

1443
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:53,719
Like what do you want to gain from each paper? Because at this point, anything you write in a class that could maybe be part of a publishing on paper,

1444
02:46:53,720 --> 02:47:00,260
and I would argue like you should try to make that to some degree at least a goal to sort of have it

1445
02:47:00,260 --> 02:47:07,160
be a a starting point for a portion of a publishable paper because that will only help you move fast.

1446
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:15,229
You know, writing for an open OC, attending lectures, job talks widely.

1447
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:23,030
I think actually Stephanie Cook is going to give a job talk like it's like October 10th or 11th, 12th, somewhere in that week.

1448
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:33,230
And so I would advise like you guys should go to as many job talks as you can even if you're, you know, not it's not your topic or whatever.

1449
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:37,280
Both just sort of like, oh, wow, if this person comes as a faculty member,

1450
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:42,229
like maybe I work with them, but then also like what a job types look like, what do people cover?

1451
02:47:42,230 --> 02:47:47,600
What is a good job talk? What is like a job type that you're like, Oh gosh, that doesn't seem to go well.

1452
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:52,299
And like, those are fascinating and they're a little stressful sometimes.

1453
02:47:52,300 --> 02:47:56,810
So because you know that the person giving the job talk is probably a little anxious and all that,

1454
02:47:56,810 --> 02:48:01,370
but it's such a great opportunity to just see like how people present themselves,

1455
02:48:01,370 --> 02:48:07,970
what skills they highlight, where they, how they like, position their research, you know, journey.

1456
02:48:10,160 --> 02:48:15,890
So if things come across your way that that you could like attend even virtually.

1457
02:48:17,030 --> 02:48:19,520
I would advise finding those and doing those.

1458
02:48:20,630 --> 02:48:26,510
Also with Stephanie specifically, I think there's like a lunch or dinner or some opportunities to meet with grad students.

1459
02:48:26,510 --> 02:48:29,690
And so I think that if you guys can, that would be great.

1460
02:48:31,820 --> 02:48:36,110
Okay. We've talked about being labs, being in labs.

1461
02:48:37,670 --> 02:48:41,090
I think prelim, especially as it is now,

1462
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:48,679
which is basically like you guys choose kind of a committee question and you consult with the people that basically feeds into your prospectus.

1463
02:48:48,680 --> 02:48:53,360
Like it's a very is like greases the wheels for you, for your prospectus.

1464
02:48:53,360 --> 02:48:58,880
And I think that's how you should think about it since that's our prelim structure in this department.

1465
02:48:58,940 --> 02:49:07,850
It's very much setting up for, you know, gain this expertize, get input, input from your committee.

1466
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:14,180
And like I guess I would say like right now as the prelim process is structured,

1467
02:49:14,390 --> 02:49:21,380
hasn't always been like this, but right now I think if it doesn't become your prospectus.

1468
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:29,650
It's you could totally do perspective on something else, but I think then you'd have to go through a lot of process to like switch gears

1469
02:49:29,650 --> 02:49:35,380
massively if your prelim ideas are kind of leading to your first practice.

1470
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:42,400
So but that's something to talk to the other grad students about. And just so that you guys know and also for the panel when they come.

1471
02:49:44,470 --> 02:49:51,010
Not everybody in the panel. Well, not everybody currently in a Ph.D. program has had the same prelim process that used

1472
02:49:51,010 --> 02:49:57,580
to be more like you kind of hand it off to like graders who are on the faculty,

1473
02:49:58,060 --> 02:50:02,020
but not necessarily like in your research program.

1474
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:05,620
And so it's a little more evaluative, I would say. This is.

1475
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:13,610
This is you need to do a good job. But it's very I would say don't stress about the prelim.

1476
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:18,270
So and Chris, you'll come and talk about three one too, but that's we'll talk more about that.

1477
02:50:18,360 --> 02:50:24,510
Um, let's see, I think we've mostly gone through, I just click through these things.

1478
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:29,130
This is this idea again, like you have any good ideas, like how do I fit in?

1479
02:50:29,820 --> 02:50:35,190
This is the whole imposter syndrome thing, which is, you know, something that people talk a lot about.

1480
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:39,959
And we have like a video about that. But I think this is important to keep in mind.

1481
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:44,340
And again, back to that idea, like practice based evidence, you guys have all had so much experience,

1482
02:50:44,340 --> 02:50:50,010
like you're drawing from everything that you've done so far and like when you talk to this person,

1483
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:55,500
it's going to seem like, you know, you don't know anything, but in fact, you feel all of that, right?

1484
02:50:56,340 --> 02:51:03,660
And so that's just an important like thing to think about because that person might seem like they know, you know, this.

1485
02:51:05,790 --> 02:51:17,759
But really they only know part of what you know. Also, we talked about this a bit already, regular meetings with mentors, writing groups.

1486
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:27,900
If we can call on communities of practice, they built these good habits to provide structure and accountability and then revisiting the IDP.

1487
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:35,609
And again in the dissertation phase. It's like imposing structure on yourself is important because it will otherwise

1488
02:51:35,610 --> 02:51:41,850
just extend other forms of imposing structure included like external funding.

1489
02:51:42,630 --> 02:51:51,810
So you can apply for funding. That's like the last semester of just rotating and that is a pretty hard deadline and other things,

1490
02:51:51,810 --> 02:51:54,690
but otherwise there's like not a ton of structure in that phase.

1491
02:51:54,690 --> 02:52:02,550
So really that's like setting up these accountability communities, the practice systems for like your futures dissertation selves.

1492
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:17,249
Okay. And yeah, this is sort of along the lines of those paper trackers and things and I know just about that time, know just about finished.

1493
02:52:17,250 --> 02:52:28,350
But this idea of, you know, trying to, I think like every paper has a home somewhere I think is really important to hang on to.

1494
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:37,560
And I think we've all published things and, you know, with varying degrees of challenge and like number of submissions,

1495
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:43,860
but just grants, papers, everything is like it's going to be rejected.

1496
02:52:43,860 --> 02:52:50,670
And then I'm just got to remember that everything is rejected at some point and like the persistence is ultimately what wins the day.

1497
02:52:51,390 --> 02:52:56,100
And there are data on this and like and I hate graphs like people who submit five times

1498
02:52:56,100 --> 02:52:59,399
are more likely to get funded and people like who don't submit are not getting funded,

1499
02:52:59,400 --> 02:53:02,730
which is sort of clear. But it's very there's a lot of data on this.

1500
02:53:05,010 --> 02:53:10,499
And then we will talk some more about this. But these are just keeping in mind,

1501
02:53:10,500 --> 02:53:18,479
like here you are now and some of you guys came from these places and then you're here and then you'll go back out to these places.

1502
02:53:18,480 --> 02:53:22,379
And so keeping that, you know, familiarity, I think,

1503
02:53:22,380 --> 02:53:27,810
with with places that are doing that's like also those like external practical skills that are helpful

1504
02:53:27,810 --> 02:53:34,170
for job and career life keeping an eye on like what are the agencies that are doing work in this area?

1505
02:53:34,170 --> 02:53:40,650
Like where might I want to get a position? I live my, you know, at least part of my future, like work life.

1506
02:53:41,420 --> 02:53:49,020
There are so many and just sort of it relates to conferencing and the people that you meet and the communities of practice that you connect with.

1507
02:53:49,020 --> 02:53:56,579
But there are so many different places where people with this Ph.D. training can and do.

1508
02:53:56,580 --> 02:54:00,570
And so that's all. All good.

1509
02:54:01,050 --> 02:54:04,320
And there we go. I think that's my last one.

1510
02:54:04,320 --> 02:54:15,180
But just how do I stay? Human idea of our favorite concepts, constructs right there, social support and self efficacy.

1511
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:22,500
So like what am I feeling good and accomplished about doing and self-efficacy and who are my social supports to help me through that?

1512
02:54:22,770 --> 02:54:29,370
And this is some of that that data are like the number of time one applies for grants, predicts grant success,

1513
02:54:29,490 --> 02:54:36,210
which again seems like, okay, you know, but like it's actually really a limited truth.

1514
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:45,120
Okay. And it's just sort of a rush there, but.

1515
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:54,510
Next week, we're going to hear from Amy and we'll talk about research misconduct stuff.

1516
02:54:55,410 --> 02:54:59,020
And then the following week we'll hear from Clara and then the panel, too.

1517
02:54:59,050 --> 02:55:09,750
So let's begin. So I can start I'm sorry to go a little bit over, but let me know if I mentioned this.

1518
02:55:12,290 --> 02:55:16,999
Yeah. Let me know if anything comes up or if you have questions.

1519
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:22,010
And, um. Yeah. I guess we can talk about this at another for sure.

1520
02:55:22,580 --> 02:55:28,030
Okay. I was wondering your thoughts on like. Oh, yeah.

1521
02:55:28,650 --> 02:55:32,580
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think I actually do have. What. What do they call it?

1522
02:55:33,210 --> 02:55:38,340
Uh, marketing your research. Marketing your research.

1523
02:55:38,340 --> 02:55:38,760
Because.

1524
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:51,300
Yeah, like, if it's a very real context for all of us in academia, academic, academic, Twitter, research, Twitter, like all sort of subsets of that.

1525
02:55:52,740 --> 02:55:57,990
So, yeah, how to kind of manage that. Yeah, I think.

1526
02:56:00,940 --> 02:56:04,690
I don't think I've ever had a Twitter account, and that's what it was.

1527
02:56:04,690 --> 02:56:12,760
I think it was the first time that you started that I a major sense but I do see that there's a lot of you can.

1528
02:56:13,890 --> 02:56:17,720
It's about how. Researchers at.

1529
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:26,860
Yeah. Yeah, but it also. Yeah.

1530
02:56:27,480 --> 02:56:31,020
Yeah. Things happened so fast. Yeah. Yeah.

1531
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:35,710
And I, I. Yes. I think there's a lot to consider, and I think.

1532
02:56:37,720 --> 02:56:41,260
Yeah. Well, first we'll talk about that and then.

1533
02:56:41,270 --> 02:56:47,980
Yeah. And I think, like, caution is a good guideline, probably as with all things social media.

1534
02:56:49,870 --> 02:57:03,520
But yeah, Twitter seems to have a lot of drama sometimes, you know, but I actually, I, I kind of love going to Twitter and like finding info and um,

1535
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:12,940
I have found a lot of, like I, I do tend to go on it and like news and read what people are saying and the different resources.

1536
02:57:15,170 --> 02:57:18,770
But he has a lot to offer. But I think I just.

1537
02:57:30,220 --> 02:57:45,790
I wanted to ask the question to answer first. I want to try and get them.

1538
02:57:46,120 --> 02:57:50,260
Got to give it back to the witnesses. But I'm.

1539
02:57:56,610 --> 02:58:08,480
Then I have a. Okay.

1540
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:23,290
Okay. Yeah. Right.

1541
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:32,310
I mean, I. Sir. Yeah, I know.

1542
02:58:33,370 --> 02:58:36,890
Cool. All right, I will run up. I'll post slides.

1543
02:58:55,420 --> 02:59:34,640
I. There's quite a few other little.

1544
02:59:38,790 --> 02:59:50,550
My friend Watson is. Security is a lot cheaper and more experiences are in Center City in the Upper Peninsula.

1545
02:59:51,240 --> 02:59:56,430
Okay, that's my thought. But then when you talk about, like you said, the.
