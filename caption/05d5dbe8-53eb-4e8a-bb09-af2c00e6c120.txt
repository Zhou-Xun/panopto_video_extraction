1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,320
Welcome back. Just a couple announcements before I dove into the lecture.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,600
We're not going to have class in the next class session because it'll be full break.

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:25,560
So enjoy that time off. The other thing, too, that I wanted to mention was I don't know if you've seen in the assignments for the class,

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:38,910
the description and the of the kind of pretty small assignment of you guys submitting your paper topic submissions to to us is open now,

5
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,770
so I can just go through the assignment.

6
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,259
I don't know if you've had a chance to read it, but like read it on your own. It's not too complicated.

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,600
It's just essentially we'd like you to write a short paper about eight pages, double spaced,

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:06,060
on a topic of your choice with a little bit of, um, there's a little bit of a constraint for industrial hygiene students.

9
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,399
So let's see, so things you get to talk about in this review,

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,220
so it's like a review paper you're going to talk about pick a toxicant and a health end point.

11
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,940
We'd like to talk about how people are exposed to the toxin or toxicant,

12
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,300
how the toxicant is metabolized or distributed through the body and excreted the hypothesized mechanism,

13
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,850
mechanism of action that links the exposure of that chemical to the disease outcome.

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,339
And then we'd like you to talk about are there individuals in the population that are at increased risk of disease relative to

15
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,900
this chemical exposure and any recommendations you can come up with to prevent adverse outcomes relative to that exposure?

16
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,639
So kind of open ended to some degree.

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:04,200
Um, here are some examples of topics you might cover acetaminophen, liver toxicity, cadmium and kidney toxicity um, DDT and hyperspace ideas.

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,570
And you see a few different, a few other different examples down here.

19
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,860
So you can see the formatting requirements here.

20
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,010
The figures are okay, but if you didn't make it, please make sure that you cite the source.

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,139
No plagiarism, of course. Don't collaborate with other students or faculty.

22
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,500
Just make it your own work. If you are an industrial hygiene student, you must do your paper on occupational exposures.

23
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,499
So that's, I think, all I have to talk about regarding that.

24
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,989
We can talk more either in office hours or we can talk about it during a class period too,

25
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,590
if there's multiple individuals that have questions at the same time.

26
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:55,260
But I think it should be pretty straightforward. I'd like you to send me your topic by what did I have the set up?

27
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,870
Um, November 9th. So if you could send me by November 9th what topic you're doing your paper on, that would be great.

28
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,829
And you can just let me go to good.

29
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:16,710
If I went to Student View here to just show that you just put your topic down here in that way.

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:29,000
Any questions on that? Hopefully will be kind of a fun exercise to some degree.

31
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:36,049
You know, we've been talking about these different toxicants. I'll give you a chance to kind of dove into a particular chemical and utilize some of

32
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,150
the stuff you've learned in the class so far and apply it to a specific situation,

33
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,070
a specific chemical and a specific disease outcome. So if there is something that you're particularly interested in,

34
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,330
this might be a chance for you to kind of dove deeper into that topic because as you can tell,

35
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,549
a lot of the topics to cover in the class can be turned into a full course, you know,

36
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,120
just that there'll be times that we only cover in one lecture because there's so much to cover.

37
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,050
So hopefully this is your chance to dove deep if you want to on on something.

38
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:13,980
Okay. That's all I have. Um, yeah, I will just dove into today's lecture.

39
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:27,500
So today we're going to talk about a field closer to what I do in my research in my lab, which is reproductive and advocate systems toxicology.

40
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:39,080
And you'll see, as I do over these next two lectures, how sort of connected reproductive development is to endocrine signaling within the body.

41
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,280
So now we kind of cover these both in the same lectures.

42
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,309
So a little bit of background. You may have heard of Rachel Carson in San Francisco.

43
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:58,850
Carson was a biologist and writer who wrote about environmental contamination.

44
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:07,790
She wrote about about in the early sixties, about the contamination in the environment with things like pesticides,

45
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,510
like DDT that were like very kind of in wide use at the time.

46
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,950
And this book, Silent Spring, has been credited to some degree with kind of sparking what we consider like the

47
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,820
modern environmental movement that really caught people's imaginations in terms of,

48
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,420
oh, these chemicals that are being put out into the environment may not all have upsides to them.

49
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,600
They may have a lot of downsides in terms of health effects on humans and health effects on wildlife or, you know, impacts on wildlife.

50
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:43,430
The reason I bring this up is, one, she's just an important person to know if you're interested in this history of the field.

51
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,409
And it's a really kind of important book that, you know, had a lot of impact on,

52
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,850
like things like public policy and how we view environmental regulations.

53
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,470
In addition,

54
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:04,700
I bring this book up by Rachel Carson because one of the outcomes that she looked at and that she observed and wrote about was in wildlife.

55
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:13,160
And it was during this time it was noted that some, like wildlife bird species in areas that were contaminated with the pesticide DDT,

56
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,700
had thinner eggshells, which is leading to some of the eggs breaking before the birds had a chance to be born.

57
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:27,470
And so this is a pretty direct impact on the reproductive process in this organism.

58
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,480
Right. And so I just wanted to kind of highlight that book as a way to kind of jump in,

59
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:39,080
to kind of give you a sense of like how long we've been thinking about this, the impacts of chemicals in the environment.

60
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:45,020
DDT is an industry disruptor, metabolites, DDT are pretty potent and the disruptors and we'll talk about that.

61
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,460
So yeah. So I just want to kind of, you know, jumpstart you with that.

62
00:06:50,780 --> 00:07:00,380
And in addition, you know, I'm sure probably a good number of you have, you know, heard about BPA, bisphenol A that's contained in various products.

63
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,040
It was in a lot of like plastic products. It's also in like those carbon copy.

64
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,830
When you when you pay with a credit card and you're signing that carbon copy stuff and one copy goes to the one person,

65
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,969
goes to the other person to the cashier.

66
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:22,640
And when you take one with you that has BPA in it as well, so it can be exposed to BPA by touching that.

67
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,819
So that became for a number of years,

68
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:34,400
it is still kind of an issue that we think about in terms of this being all the exposure to humans via these multiple routes that we kind of,

69
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,050
you know, are in contact with in our day to day lives.

70
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,320
Right. And so that's just I just wanted to highlight that to, you know,

71
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,500
just talk about how it's still an ongoing issue that we're thinking about these effects of and the endocrine disruptors just,

72
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:57,110
you know, a, as we've talked about a little bit, is an endocrine disruptors and has a little bit of estrogenic activity.

73
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:08,960
So I also wanted to start out talking about why and the credit disruption and reproductive toxicology kind of generate a lot of concern.

74
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:19,080
We see, you know, health effects related to endocrine disruptors and effects on reproductive development,

75
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,840
like sort of I think oftentimes what captured people's imaginations more so than like other end points that we might study.

76
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,749
And I think part of that is related to the fact that in the field of endocrine disruption,

77
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:44,400
we've seen that exposures can be observed during the period of gestation when the reproductive organs are undergoing development.

78
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,399
For example, the eggs or the eggs and females are the testes and males can be impacted.

79
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,710
And we see this in animal models with endocrine disrupting exposures in utero.

80
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,659
And so I think that really strikes at the heart of kind of our ideas of, you know,

81
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,060
fairness and justice that show people that individuals can be exposed, you know,

82
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,990
through kind of no choice of their own to chemicals while they're developing in utero,

83
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:18,420
and particularly like vulnerable population of individuals in utero as they're developing.

84
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:27,240
So that may be one reason that's just my sort of guess is like as to why this kind of captures people, captures people's imaginations.

85
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:37,680
There's a spiritual sequel to some degree, a follow up to Silent Spring, which is called Our Stolen Future, which is written by Phil Colburn,

86
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:48,690
which kind of talks about these impacts of environmental chemicals during these sensitive life stages while during development in utero.

87
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,360
I mean, kind of just looked at things that from a little bit more of a human centric standpoint of like,

88
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,730
oh gosh, this undercurrent disruptors may be impacting human health as well as impacts on wildlife.

89
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,340
So that's another book. Interesting that kind of follows up in that same vein as Silent Spring.

90
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,170
Another thing is, as I mentioned, I think something that catches people's imaginations is that indicative structures are,

91
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,720
you know, found in everyday household products. Like we find them in couches, materials that are used to make couches.

92
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,120
We find that in plastic water bottles. And I think this gets people concerned to some degree.

93
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:32,339
So that's just one of the kind of set the stakes for why this is a public health issue and why we kind of hear about it.

94
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,499
I feel like sometimes maybe it's my bias,

95
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,080
but I feel like sometimes you hear about these types of chemicals more often in the general media than other types of chemicals.

96
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,590
But again, I'm in this field, so that could just totally be my bias.

97
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,200
Does anyone have any thoughts of other reasons why you may have heard of endocrine disruptors?

98
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,589
It's something you hear about every now and then. Does anyone have any thoughts on additional reasons besides what I've just mentioned here,

99
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,870
why we might be particularly concerned about endocrine disrupting chemicals?

100
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:11,250
Any thoughts? And it's one that just came to my mind as I was talking.

101
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,620
So another thing to think about is that hormones act at very small concentrations in

102
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,790
the body and these endocrine disruptors can have effects at very small concentrations.

103
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,710
And so it doesn't take like a whopping dose of a chemical to see some kind of response.

104
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,190
So I think that's another thing that concerns us as public health scientists,

105
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,770
is that some of these are some of these processes we're talking about are like modulated at like

106
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:45,280
nanomoles or peak of molar concentrations that we see like really low dose response effects with these.

107
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,810
So that's another one. There's probably others that I'm not considering at the moment.

108
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,210
Okay. So hormones, depending on how familiar you are with hormonal, you may be pretty familiar with how hormones act.

109
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,090
We've talked about it a little bit in the class, but it probably bears going through it just one more time.

110
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,530
Hormones are endogenous chemicals in the body that elicit some kind of response in a cell.

111
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:20,620
And it's at its most basic level. We can think about the way hormones act as sort of a key fitting into a lock,

112
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,930
right, with the key being the hormone and the lock being the hormone receptor.

113
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,730
So most of these hormones act via this type of mechanism where the hormone

114
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,260
basically ducks into a receptor and triggers some kind of change within the cell.

115
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,550
And these things regulate many different things in the body.

116
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:46,450
We're going to focus on reproduction in these lectures, but they regulate things like blood pressure metabolism,

117
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,430
glucose metabolism, bone growth, homeostasis of minerals like calcium.

118
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,220
They regulate production of other hormones.

119
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,450
There's this like crosstalk between hormones, self-regulation that occurs, which we'll talk about and other things as well.

120
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:10,870
So these are like a super important part of the way the body sort of regulates itself and develops over the course of a lifetime.

121
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,420
So we talk about we can think about steroid hormones.

122
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:23,330
So there's different types of hormones. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol.

123
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,160
Right. So we see a cholesterol molecule here and we can see this kind of four ring structure here.

124
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:39,860
And various enzymes in the body convert cholesterol to things like the main estrogen, which is estradiol testosterone,

125
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:46,310
which is were made in the testes that drives a lot of male reproductive developmental processes.

126
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,379
Cortisol is like a stress hormone and you see this forming structure appearing.

127
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,730
So these are all steroid hormones that are initially derived from cholesterol.

128
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,750
So these include, again, things like estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, etc.

129
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,080
These steroid hormones. An important aspect of these is that they're lipid soluble so they can move through these men.

130
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:15,799
Remember, we talked about how lipid soluble chemicals can move through the membranes so these guys can move through the membranes to get to

131
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,460
the nucleus where they bind to a receptor and trigger DNA changes because the DNA is in the nucleus and so they act in that way.

132
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,330
So that's a pretty powerful mechanism for signaling within the body.

133
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,280
There's another type of hormone which are made from peptides are proteins and these are just synthesized the way other proteins are in the body.

134
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,770
These tend to be water soluble.

135
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:45,170
So they're not going to is easily diffuse into the nucleus and often will be acting on the receptors on the cell surface.

136
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,970
So as opposed to all the way in the nucleus, it'll be on the cell surface and it will bind there.

137
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,719
Right. Okay. So you have an example.

138
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,280
This is just like some cartoons that illustrate the so the meant the chemicals are the hormones that act on the on the surface include things like,

139
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,840
say, insulin. And so you'd see the insulin receptor on the surface of the cell membrane.

140
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,420
Insulin would bind to this insulin receptor and a bunch of downstream molecular changes

141
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:24,990
that lead to changes in gene expression or other like signal signal transduction pathways.

142
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,760
And then in the case of the steroid hormones, these are going to more often be nuclear based receptors.

143
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,959
And so the steroid hormone will diffuse into the cytoplasm of the cell.

144
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,960
So across the cell membrane, all the way into the nucleus and bind to the receptor,

145
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:47,360
triggering some conformational changes will often kick off these proteins that are called molecular chaperons.

146
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,250
So that's usually bound to the receptor to kind of kick them off.

147
00:15:51,260 --> 00:16:00,620
And then you have this new hormone receptor complex that sits on the DNA and triggers a bunch of gene expression changes, as you can see here.

148
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,500
Any questions so far that we've covered this more or less in various parts of the course?

149
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:24,099
Okay. So we have multiple and different audiences in the body or organs that play a role in either the production or the distribution of hormones,

150
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,930
for example. So we have things like the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the thyroid.

151
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,969
Um, and then what the focus of these next two lectures will be on the male and female reproductive system.

152
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:45,250
So, you know, with the testes, you know, the testes produce testosterone and are critical for male productive development.

153
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,470
And then in the female we have the ovary and uterus as sites of endocrine

154
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,110
action production and and the hormones also act within those tissues as well.

155
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,540
So hormones have this feedback mechanism that occurs.

156
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:11,319
So often what we'll see is we'll see hormone signaling starting in the hypothalamus, either in the brain.

157
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:18,729
So the chemical will be released. A hormone or a precursor to a hormone will be released from the hypothalamus that often acts on the

158
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:27,790
pituitary and tells the pituitary to release either hormones that it's already built up or it will.

159
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,020
Well, we'll talk about kind of the how the hypothalamus, the pituitary working a little bit, but.

160
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,390
The pituitary will release a hormone to a peripheral endocrine organ like the testes or the ovaries.

161
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:50,020
And actually that peripheral undercurrent organ like the testes will start to produce its own hormone, in this case testosterone.

162
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,430
And then after that target cell within the body.

163
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:00,640
And what happens is we have feedback regulation where this hormone will feed back into the hypothalamus, the pituitary,

164
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,940
and basically turn down the process and slow the process down because we don't want these pathways to be activated.

165
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,719
In perpetuity. We need to be able to regulate. We don't want like in the case of, say, of cells proliferating in the testes.

166
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,840
We don't want them to just keep proliferating in perpetuity.

167
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,780
That could lead to things like, say, testicular cancer. Right.

168
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:29,300
We want to modify these processes in some way so we can have either negative feedback inhibition, feedback inhibition, or in some cases,

169
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:36,880
there's like a feedforward mechanism where it starts and then this hormone will help things to ramp up before shutting down again.

170
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,020
So there's this ways that these horrible pathways can modify themselves and feedback on themselves.

171
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,270
And so here's where the hypothalamus pituitary situation comes in.

172
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:57,629
So for some hormones, the hypothalamus will basically produce a hormone like, for instance,

173
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:05,370
oxytocin or antidiabetic hormone that acts in the kidneys and release it to the posterior pituitary.

174
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,809
And upon a certain, like developmental stage are given a certain signal.

175
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,330
The posterior pituitary will then release these hormones into the broader circulation in the body.

176
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:25,770
And so you have things like oxytocin that acts on uterine muscles and mammary glands and then this anti diuretic hormone that works on the kidney.

177
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,829
There's other types of hormones where whereby the hypothalamus will release some type of

178
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:39,870
signaling molecule to tell the anterior pituitary to start producing a different hormone.

179
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:47,040
So it'll release a signaling molecules shown in red here and tell essentially tell the interior pituitary to

180
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,439
start manufacturing things like thyroid stimulating hormone follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing,

181
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,459
hormone growth hormone prolactin, etc.,

182
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,490
these these hormones that in turn all act on other endocrine active tissues in the body,

183
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,139
for example, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone and in the testes,

184
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,590
in the ovaries and basically in the male reproductive case will tell the testes to start making testosterone.

185
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,730
So again, this goes into how hormones are basically telling different parts of the body, hey, start making this particular hormone.

186
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:36,680
Does that make sense? Any questions so far? So endocrine disruption is a disruption of these types of signaling pathways in the body.

187
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:47,540
And this can happen in a variety of ways. One of the main ones is when a chemical mimics the actions of the endogenous hormones.

188
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:54,500
So, for example, of bisphenol A, bisphenol A can to some degree mimic estrogen within the body.

189
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:03,379
It's it doesn't activate the estrogen receptor as efficiently as the estrogens themselves, but it does have some of that activity.

190
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:09,260
So you're turning on this estrogen signal, kind of apparently like when it wouldn't normally be turned off.

191
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,620
And we call that antagonist, which I think we may have mentioned that before.

192
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,620
And one of the other lectures. But yeah, so that's that's called an agonist where you're activating a receptor.

193
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:29,760
So this is usually this simply happens by the chemical binding to an activating the particular receptor of the body.

194
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:38,610
One of the most well-studied phenomena that kind of, you know, in this category are is it estrogen signaling?

195
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,240
So we talked about I think we had a slide that compared the estrogen necessity of various chemicals.

196
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:53,879
And so this is this describes the affinity of a chemical to bind to the estrogen receptor relative to the binding affinity of estradiol,

197
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,560
which is the main estrogen.

198
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:06,810
So again, we can talk about something as being two times more estrogenic than estradiol or say something is 40 times, 40 times less estrogenic less.

199
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:13,230
Does that suggest as a title it could still have activity but have much less compared to estradiol

200
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,930
itself or in some cases have more activity towards that estrogen receptor that estradiol itself.

201
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:28,080
This. This binding to the receptor, though, that's only one event in the cell signaling pathway.

202
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,200
So that doesn't necessarily tell you whether that receptor is activated or how much that receptor is activated.

203
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,450
You need to look downstream of the signaling pathways to see if particular downstream,

204
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,910
say, proteins or genes are being upregulated after that receptor is found.

205
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:52,860
So that's just an important thing I wanted to note is that receptor activity in and of itself isn't going to tell the receptor binding is of itself,

206
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,620
isn't going to tell you whether that receptor is turned on.

207
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,510
In some cases, we have chemicals that will bind to a receptor and turn it off essentially or block it.

208
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:07,419
So and this presents a bit of a, you know, a challenge for people like, say, EPA.

209
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:16,080
And I want to know whether, like new chemicals coming on the market are binding, having some kind of type of endocrine disrupting activity.

210
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,910
It'd be great if they could just screen them all for binding to a receptor and say yes or no.

211
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,810
This is going to have such and such effects in wildlife or humans.

212
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,050
But you really don't understand the full picture. Just by doing one binding assay, you want to really understand the full.

213
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,700
So you have to make more kind of involved models to really characterize what's happening there.

214
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,540
So here's some examples of we talked about agonists, but there's also antagonists,

215
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,440
which is that example where a chemical will bind to a receptor and block it.

216
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,040
So under conditions of no exposure to a chemical,

217
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,600
we would have our natural endogenous hormone in the body and that's going to bind to the

218
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,390
receptor site and cause some kind of change in cellular activity with an agonist around,

219
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,530
you have both your endogenous hormone and this agonist and that's going to

220
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,940
bind to the receptor site and essentially trigger enhanced cellular activity.

221
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:20,530
With an antagonist, we can have chemicals that bind to the receptor site and essentially block that it doesn't activate the receptor.

222
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,130
And so the endogenous chemical is not able to that bind there because it's already that space is taken up, basically.

223
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,260
And so you get set, you get this decreased cellular activity related to this receptor.

224
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:43,790
So we can have both agonism and antagonism. So endocrine disruptors are a different toxicants.

225
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:53,160
So we've got to talk through how some of the signaling starts in the brain and kind of branches out to other peripheral endocrine active organs.

226
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,590
Ultimately, you get a hormone that acts on a target cell somewhere in the body of.

227
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,530
We've seen that chemicals can impact basically anything along this pathway.

228
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,580
Like we have examples of chemicals having some kind of impact along this entire yeah.

229
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,999
Along this entire sequence of events. So it's a pretty, uh, involved area of toxicology.

230
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,590
So this could include, you know, impacts on the organs themselves, impacts in the brain,

231
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,490
the ability of the body to distribute the hormone and excrete it.

232
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:34,280
And then, you know, we have the more molecular cellular level of chemicals binding to receptors causing changes in gene expression.

233
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:43,460
And so really kind of whatever level you're looking at, we see we have examples of chemicals impacting one or more of these physiological processes.

234
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:54,640
So some examples. Again, we talked about how Esther Dial is the most potent of the endogenous mammalian estrogens.

235
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,489
So it's like kind of the main estrogen back in like roughly the fifties.

236
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,840
The seventies, there was a synthetic estrogen that was given to pregnant women.

237
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:14,910
Um, that was meant to help with certain like, um, uh, adverse like health outcomes related to pregnancy.

238
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,710
I think it was used to help with like morning sickness. And I think women that had recurrent miscarriages that was supposed to help with that.

239
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,870
Um, it's estimated that as many as, like, 4 million women may have taken this.

240
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,270
Yeah, exactly. Used to prevent miscarriage and premature labor.

241
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:38,709
It was later found to be ineffective and its mechanism of action was binding to this particular estrogen receptor.

242
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,390
Estrogen receptor one with a 20 to 40 fourfold, greater affinity than estradiol.

243
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,580
So it was even more potent than the endogenous estradiol. And sadly,

244
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,530
this is like a really tragic case where it was revealed years later that the mothers

245
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,900
that were taking it were later shown to have an increased risk of breast cancer.

246
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:09,459
But kind of maybe even more disturbingly, the daughters that were exposed to do yes in utero when they grew up had increased risk of premature birth,

247
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,790
miscarriage and breast cancer and other things as well.

248
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:20,590
And so whatever was happening was impacting them in utero when some of these organs were organ systems were developing.

249
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:30,430
Um, and so it's a really tragic case with, you know, estimated millions of people exposed to this chemical that had these adverse outcomes.

250
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:43,149
We see, you know, kind of on the same in the same theme of estrogens and exposure,

251
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:48,940
we see situations where endocrine disrupting chemicals or endocrine active chemicals

252
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,839
can wind up in the environment through ways we maybe wouldn't normally think about.

253
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:00,040
So in the case of women taking a synthetic estrogen in birth control pills,

254
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,830
we can see some of these chemicals found in like sewage that's are excreted through the urine.

255
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,909
And we found like in our chemical like our water treatment facilities,

256
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:17,230
there's not a very consistent level of treatment that takes these types of chemicals out of the water supply.

257
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,850
And so there is this you know, this is not the only this is just an example.

258
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,899
But there's this sort of worry that some of these chemicals being released into the

259
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,620
environment may be leading to like wildlife being exposed to estrogen active chemicals,

260
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,770
bisphenol A being one, but the synthetic estrogen being another.

261
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:44,560
You know, these will impact wildlife like we've seen, like birds and aquatic organisms do respond to these types of chemicals.

262
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:51,879
So it's a very active and interesting area of environmental health research, in my opinion.

263
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:59,390
So I just wanted to kind of touch base on a couple of those. There's other pesticides that are also estrogen agonists.

264
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,229
So here's some examples. Keep on misogyny.

265
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,050
Klaw metabolite of DDT called DDT.

266
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:17,510
And you see, one thing I wanted to point out is that these have different degrees of estrogen density or affinity for the estradiol receptor.

267
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:29,480
So 121 400th as estrogenic as estradiol to like this metabolite of DDT is like pretty weakly estrogenic but one 10,000.

268
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:35,450
So you see a range, you know, but one thing you know may seem like very small to be,

269
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,020
you know, like one 10,000 something, a very weak estrogenic compound.

270
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,689
But you may have to think about exposures to multiple estrogenic chemicals.

271
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:51,590
What is the some activity of exposure to a DDT metabolite and BPA, for example?

272
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,000
So the question, yeah,

273
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:08,630
does that really mean that it'll find like one in 200 times or does it mean to have like one like 1/200 of those that are right.

274
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,320
Yeah. So I, it's the first thing is.

275
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,280
Yeah. So it's, it's going to bind with 1/200 the affinity.

276
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,180
So if you, if you do like a biochemical experiment, you mix them together,

277
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:31,760
you're going to get kind of different rates of binding and different like amounts of estrogen receptors that have been bound by that chemical.

278
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:39,649
So it's from that. Yeah, it's, it's the actual binding activity in the case of like insecticide or any other

279
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:46,040
pests or vermin control is the fact that it like is an endocrine disruptor,

280
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:54,920
a feature of like the creation of the chemical. Like is it on purpose to sort of disrupt the reproductive cycles of those insects?

281
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:02,600
Or is that sort of like a byproduct? Because it seems kind of interesting that they would choose a DDT isomer to be an insecticide?

282
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,290
I think that's a really good question. I actually I haven't dug into all of these pesticides to look at their made mechanism of action.

283
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:16,910
I think it's going to vary by chemical. I think in some cases you're going to be wanting that's going to be part of the proposed mechanism of action.

284
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:22,610
But I think in a lot of cases, true, you're going to it's going to be like a side product because these chemicals

285
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,060
don't know that they're supposed to be only acting on one biological pathway.

286
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:32,480
Right. So you're going to see like these these various like side effects, if you will.

287
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:41,120
So, yeah, that's a good question. But I think there are some that are targeting particular like hormone regulated pathways,

288
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,150
but it would be dependent on the particular pesticide we're talking about.

289
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,500
Any other questions? Okay.

290
00:31:53,710 --> 00:32:02,050
So some more examples of estrogen agonists. We have bisphenol A again, we talked about that at the top of the lecture.

291
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,620
So this is pretty weekly. It's like 1/300 the affinity for Aspendale.

292
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:11,109
So it's actually some toxicologists have looked at alternate toxicology pathways

293
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:17,110
for BPA that they think actually BPA might be acting through alternate pathways.

294
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:25,480
Besides this estrogenic pathway to do some of the toxicity for adverse health outcomes we think might be exposure associated with exposure.

295
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:33,670
So but the AstraZeneca activity is still something to, you know, sort of bear in mind when we think about BPA.

296
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,440
Another classic chemicals we touched out a little bit are polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs.

297
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,040
So you have a general PCB molecule here. And so this is a class of different chemicals.

298
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,340
They're characterized by this two ring structure.

299
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:57,790
And then what you have are different numbers of different patterns of chlorine atoms attached to the rings.

300
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,150
And so they'll be given different names like PCB 209 and says just designates something about

301
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:11,260
the pattern of the specific number of chlorine on one or both of these these ring structures.

302
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:18,110
So they're used in like electrical equipment and machinery manufacture.

303
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:25,030
It's since been banned, but we still have them around, like because they kind of accumulate in the environment.

304
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:32,229
Don't go away very easily. So one thing that's interesting about PCBs is, like I said,

305
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:42,260
there's different like sort of flavors of PCB and depending on the structure, you'll see a variation in the estrogen city of the PCB.

306
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,340
So that can range from 1/40 to 1/10000.

307
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,880
The estrogen, the city of Esther Dial. In some cases we have.

308
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:57,720
So these different flavors of these different types of PCBs are called congeners, different considers.

309
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,280
Right. And so some of these containers are actually estrogen antagonists.

310
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,110
So they'll bind the estrogen receptor and block its activity.

311
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,470
Yeah. So there's like 209 congeners. Okay.

312
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:19,080
So that just presents another challenge in like assessing the overall impact of these chemicals, given that there's, like, these subgroups of this.

313
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:29,730
Of these polychlorinated biphenyls. So estrogen isn't the only type of endocrine disruption we see.

314
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,940
We also have to consider androgens and androgenic actions, which we are kind of play a bigger role in male reproductive development.

315
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:46,190
So if we talk about androgens, we're talking about like testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and androstenedione.

316
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:56,600
So again, these are associated with male reproductive development and this is the structure of testosterone and the dihydrotestosterone here,

317
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:04,660
pretty similar structures. So androgens regulate things like spermatogenesis, the development of sperm.

318
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:13,150
They support skeletal muscle development. So the development of muscles, the growth of the testes in the penis like these sex accessory glands,

319
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,040
and then they play a role in metabolism and libido.

320
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,440
So these androgens regulate a lot of things.

321
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:30,540
So the primary place where testosterone is produced is within a cell called the latest cell in the testes.

322
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:37,020
We do see small amounts produced in other parts of the body, but the testes are really the main source.

323
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:44,760
There is a more potent version of testosterone called and that's what Dihydrotestosterone is, or DHT.

324
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:53,670
So we convert testosterone to DHT by an enzyme called five Alpha reductase, and we see this active in the tissues of the male reproductive tract.

325
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,780
So again, DHT binds the androgen receptor with a similar affinity, but once it's found,

326
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:08,760
it activates the like downstream of activity of this receptor, like in a tenfold more potent way than testosterone itself.

327
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,170
And just a side note that estrogen signaling does play a role in male development.

328
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:23,740
So some of the testosterone gets converted into estrogen in tissues like the testes, brain and fat.

329
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:32,140
And these have these read this estrogen signaling regulates things in adulthood, such as like sperm maturation.

330
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,800
So it's not you know, biology is rarely one thing or the other, 100%.

331
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,770
There's a little bit of sort of gray area there, I guess.

332
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,410
Any questions so far at this point?

333
00:36:52,730 --> 00:37:00,350
Okay. Um, so as I mentioned, testosterone is produced in the leading cells and so the.

334
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:08,030
Testes if you take a cross-section would look like this and the one of the basically the main structure

335
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:13,190
was in the testes are helped 17 for its tubules and they're all coiled up within the testes.

336
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,770
If we take a cross-section of like a section of some infant's tubules, you'll see that the tubules sort of like on end here.

337
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:30,320
And what you have are a bunch of germ cells, spermicide, which we'll talk about later in the lecture if we get to it today.

338
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,730
Developing into sperm heads within the tubules.

339
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,739
The latest cells of the cells that sit outside of the center for its tubules are kind of like on the periphery,

340
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,250
and they secrete testosterone as during spermatogenesis.

341
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,910
So this is what it looks like. Histology slide.

342
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,270
So anything else? I want to go over here. So yeah, those are the latest cells.

343
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:03,140
So this is a good example of that feedback mechanism I was talking about before.

344
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:12,020
So we can kind of just march through how this signaling, this hormonal signaling that takes place in the testes works.

345
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:21,889
So the hypothalamus release releases a chemical called Gonadotropin, releasing a hormone which acts on the anterior pituitary basically,

346
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:27,600
and tells the anterior pituitary to release a chemical called luteinizing hormone or LH.

347
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:36,180
That chemical is circulated in the body and acts on the living cells and tells the leading cells to start producing testosterone.

348
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:44,510
Testosterone, thereby can act on various target tissues and play a role in helping the spermatozoa as they develop into the sperm.

349
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:54,200
It's in the testes. And what you also get once this starts is you get a feedback inhibition or testosterone, and once it gets to a certain level,

350
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:01,220
it's going to start to essentially signal for the hypothalamus and the pituitary to stop producing these hormones.

351
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,709
There's another kind of related sort of related hormone, follicle stimulating hormone,

352
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:17,340
which acts on a different cell type within the testes called the fertility cells and those again so follicle stimulating hormone will act on they're

353
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:25,400
totally cells and basically signal for them to start sending out signals related to the initiation of spermatogenesis and maturation of the sperm.

354
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:32,650
Certainly cells will also have their own like feedback pathway via a chemical called inhibitors.

355
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:42,080
So this is like a specific example of this feedback mechanism where the hormonal processes can regulate themselves in the body.

356
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:51,740
So as far as androgens go, there's a metabolite of DDT called PPD.

357
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,130
That's a pretty potent androgen receptor antagonist.

358
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:05,810
So binding the receptor and blocking the activity of we often see that estrogen agonists have some weak level of anti-androgen activity.

359
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,170
So for example, diagnostic tests are all still best, are all she talks about.

360
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:17,810
One of the previous slides has some degree of anti-androgen activity in addition to its really strong estrogen activity.

361
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:30,680
So so far we've talked about how these toxicants are endocrine disrupting chemicals

362
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,000
can bind to receptors and alter these receptor based signaling pathways.

363
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,730
But there's other ways that chemicals can alter endocrine processes,

364
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:46,430
and one of them is by inhibiting enzymes that are involved in steroid hormone synthesis.

365
00:40:47,150 --> 00:41:00,440
So what we have here is a map basically of the how the body synthesizes things like testosterone and estrogens like ester diol from cholesterol.

366
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,800
And so the enzymes that catalyze these reactions are shown in the black boxes here.

367
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:16,650
So, again, steroid biosynthesis, right. So cholesterol is imported into the mitochondria is a site of steroid synthesis.

368
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,500
One of the main sites of steroids synthesis. So that's another reason why you don't want to damage the mitochondria.

369
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:30,860
So the cholesterol is imported into the mitochondria by a chemical or by the enzyme called a protein called stir antigenic acute regulatory protein.

370
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:36,709
And once it's brought into the mitochondria, there are our old friends that we've talked about a couple of times here.

371
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:43,460
Cytochrome p450 those like CYP 11 will convert cholesterol into a hormone called pregnant alone.

372
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,670
And then there are also additional enzymes like three beta hydroxy steroid

373
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,550
giving the last word but that that catalyzed pregnant alone into progesterone.

374
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,170
And so you can just walk down this pathway some 17.

375
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:07,390
There's another cytochrome p450. And ultimately what you're getting at the end of this are testosterone, for example, and estradiol.

376
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:13,790
And there are other, you know, enzyme hormones that play important roles in their own right, like astral.

377
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,070
And so this is the sort of steroid biosynthesis pathway.

378
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:26,659
What's also shown out here is the steroid breakdown pathway. So, again, our bodies don't want this stuff just hanging around in perpetuity.

379
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:32,450
We metabolize it the way we metabolize, like exogenous chemicals or like vitamins or nutrients.

380
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,000
We eventually, like, metabolize these things and excrete them.

381
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,040
And so the enzymes that are involved in the steroid breakdown pathway are shown in the white boxes here.

382
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,760
And so, for example,

383
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:54,680
you have sulfur transfer cases which convert this androstenedione into a chemical called the HGH and then ultimately sulfates it for excretion.

384
00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:00,510
The way we talked about in one of the last lectures. Any questions about that?

385
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:14,900
Okay. So a chemical that impacts this well coordinated pathway that we want to be active in our bodies,

386
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,010
a class of chemicals that does this is are called phthalates.

387
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,760
You may have heard of phthalates before. They're used in a lot of products.

388
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,480
Anything related to plastic is a good chance, has some phthalates and it's so it's a plasticizer,

389
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:38,090
a one of the main phthalates that's kind of been falling out of favor and usage actually lately is DHP or Di Ethyl Axl Phthalate,

390
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:44,870
which is an it's been shown to have a lot of like endocrine disrupting effects and so it's

391
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,870
kind of fallen out of favor and starting to kind of take it out of certain products.

392
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,770
But what it does, what these things do is impart flexibility.

393
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,980
So if you have like flexible tubing, like in hospital tubing,

394
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:59,120
some of that's coming from the fact that you have a family that's part of the make up of that

395
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,699
product that's using things like PVC products or like any kind of like plastic stuff that,

396
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:13,560
you know, again, with that flexibility. So we see that these chemicals can inhibit sit 19, which is also called aromatase expression.

397
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:21,030
If we go back to the pathway to sit 19 or aromatase is the chemical that converts or the enzyme sorry,

398
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:29,740
the enzyme that converts testosterone into estradiol. And so what we see is like in animal models, for example, when we feed animals.

399
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:38,200
DHP We'll see decreases that estrogen synthesis in the ovary and this ends up blocking ovulation in female rats.

400
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,230
So you're impacting the reproductive process in that way.

401
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:52,510
It's also been shown to inhibit star expression as well as other enzymes within this pathway that are active in the testes that produce testosterone.

402
00:44:52,510 --> 00:45:01,989
Right. So inhibit this protein or inhibit simple love in you're going to end up with lower levels of testosterone in the testes because this pathway

403
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:09,490
that synthesizes testosterone is just not working with these enzymes to be expressed in order for this pathway to be active and working.

404
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:24,900
So let's see here. Yeah. So here is just kind of graphically what we have the HP inhibiting this reaction.

405
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,380
And that in males it would be inhibiting this. And I also know because I've.

406
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:40,490
Read a lot of papers related to this. It will also inhibit some of these other enzymes as well in the in the testes.

407
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:53,720
We've also seen that chemicals can inhibit the enzymes that are responsible for hormone breakdown in the body.

408
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:01,820
So, for example, PCBs and a group of chemicals called PBDEs, they're inhibitors of these sulfur transferase enzymes.

409
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:08,810
So if you remember, the soulful transfer days are part of this break down pathway.

410
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,880
It's inhibiting these guys here.

411
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:22,040
So they're important in estrogens and also related to like thyroid metabolism, estrogen, phase two, metabolism and excretion.

412
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:30,860
We talk about social transfers. They transfer these sulfur sulfate groups out of these chemicals to facilitate their excretion.

413
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:38,900
And the net effect when you inhibit this sulfur transferase is you can get a net increase in circulating hormone levels

414
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:44,900
because you're not getting rid of the hormone at the same rate that you would be if everything was functioning normally.

415
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,370
Does that make sense? So you're not inhibiting the synthesis of the chemical.

416
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:52,220
You're inhibiting the breakdown of the of the hormone.

417
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:01,560
So the end result is that you have an overall estrogenic effect or in the case of PBS hypothyroidism,

418
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,900
so you're not breaking down these hormones like you would normally.

419
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:12,330
So as opposed to having estrogenic activity itself, it's just disrupting the metabolism of these hormones.

420
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,890
Make it sound so far? Yes.

421
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,420
Is this specifically inhibiting the cell flow transferase.

422
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,440
Of estrogen, or could this also impact excretion of other toxicants or other compounds?

423
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:38,070
That's a great question. Probably it's inhibiting like multiple types of sulfur transferase since and I'm this is from my knowledge of.

424
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,420
I'm getting this from my knowledge of phthalates,

425
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:50,000
where I know that phthalates will decrease the expression of multiple cytochrome p450 that are involved in testosterone synthesis.

426
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:58,820
And not just not just like a specific one, but, you know, it will depend on the particular molecular mechanism of that toxicants.

427
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:07,280
So there may be ones that could be the case where there is a toxicant that only for whatever reason targets that one sulfur transferase.

428
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:12,709
But a lot of times just seeing sort of like kind of spillover effects or, you know,

429
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:17,750
it's inhibiting broadly like a certain class or a certain set of sulfur transfer cases.

430
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,370
And maybe due to the kinetics of the chemical where it ends up in the body,

431
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:26,810
it may just be having a greater impact on the tissues that are involved in estrogenic signaling.

432
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,060
So all of this kind of plays together, you know, in terms of what the overall effect is going to be.

433
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,510
If the chemical never makes it to the ovaries, for example, it's not going to be able to inhibit estrogen synthesis in the ovary.

434
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:43,430
So you have to bear in mind, like where it's going and also like what it's doing once it gets there.

435
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:50,660
So but I would say in general, when we're talking about this type of inhibition, it's probably not just one enzyme, it's probably a few.

436
00:48:51,740 --> 00:49:00,120
But again, there's always, you know, exceptions. Let's see here.

437
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:05,460
Yeah. So again, we're inhibiting these guys that are involved in the breakdown of the hormones.

438
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,270
So then we can have chemicals. Now, this is kind of an interesting case.

439
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:21,910
So this chemical called Linden is insecticide is used in some pharmaceutical production.

440
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:28,150
This can act directly on the pituitary to release inhibit the release of luteinizing hormone.

441
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,820
And we see this in female rat models. And what this ends up doing is preventing ovulation in rats.

442
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:40,280
So the tissue or the organ being targeted isn't the one that is really [INAUDIBLE],

443
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,380
like the one that is where we're seeing the health effect, if you will.

444
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:51,610
You know, we're seeing this in like the ovaries of, you know, you're not the the the animals are not undergoing ovulation,

445
00:49:52,030 --> 00:50:03,210
but the actual target of action is within the pituitary, which is, you know, the basis of like organs is not very close to like where the ovaries are.

446
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:09,150
So we have to kind of think kind of holistically. Sometimes when we are understanding these pathways,

447
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:14,810
they're like active kind of throughout the body or different like very kind of disparate parts of the body could be playing a role.

448
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:21,820
So if we're only examining the ovaries, we're not going to understand the mechanism of action of Linden, for example.

449
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,140
So and that brings me to the gonads as a target of toxicants.

450
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,760
So the gonads being the testes in the male, in the ovaries in the female.

451
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:45,140
And so the main functions of the gonads are in gamete production and the production of sex steroids.

452
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:52,040
So again, it is a haploid cell that fuzes with another haploid cell during fertilization.

453
00:50:52,040 --> 00:51:00,619
So you're thinking egg fuzing with the sperm leading to reproduction of the organism and then the sex steroid hormone production.

454
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:06,440
So particularly in testes where mostly figure out testosterone is dihydrate DHT production.

455
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:12,650
And then the ovaries where typically most often think about like estrogen synthesis in that case.

456
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:20,120
So any toxicity to these chemicals can disrupt either dairy production or this hormone production.

457
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,620
So you can understand, especially in the case of reproduction, why this is really important.

458
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,139
But also you can have other health effects as well.

459
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:32,930
So like low testosterone can lead to other health impacts that aren't necessarily directly related to reproduction per say.

460
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,760
So the process of completing Genesis or the formation of gametes.

461
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,350
That involves a lot of like cell cycle and cell divisions.

462
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,630
Right. So you're doing a lot of like copying DNA. There's a lot of chromosomes moving around, which we'll talk about in a little bit.

463
00:51:53,340 --> 00:52:02,190
And so this makes the gonads like in the gametes themselves as sort of like prime targets for a chemical that might disrupt their DNA.

464
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:09,660
Because if the DNA damage occurs when the cell is trying to divide and ends up like replicating the damaged DNA,

465
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:16,739
that's going to be like basically imprinted into the cell, sort of as if the cells continue to dividing.

466
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:25,190
So this can lead to some pretty severe impacts down the road in terms of when these gametes fuze with the eggs and produce like a zygote, etc.

467
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:32,640
So these these candidates are like, you know, again, sort of like prime targets for DNA damage.

468
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,350
Spermatogenesis in particular has like continuous rapid cell division.

469
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,480
Like once you hit puberty, there's like continuous production of sperm. So there's a lot of cell division going on.

470
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,969
So a lot of chances for some chemical to, like,

471
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:52,740
damage some of that DNA and for that to sort of be encoded and leading to impacts down the road during development.

472
00:52:53,700 --> 00:53:01,800
Oh, Genesis. And we'll talk about this in more detail. So the formation of the egg for the oversight is kind of more of a start and stop process.

473
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:08,550
It's not as just turned on and keeps going throughout adulthood. There's certain specific stages related to all Genesis.

474
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:18,809
And so that means that in terms of impacts on those gametes, there are certain like life stages that are kind of represent more vulnerable stages,

475
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:24,210
such as just prior to the first ovulation or immediately following fertilization, for example.

476
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,810
And as you might guess, DNA damage of the gametes could impair fertility.

477
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:39,660
You know, if you're damaging the sperm or damaging the oocytes, the eggs, that could impair the ability for the organism to reproduce.

478
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:51,939
So in the formation of gametes, we have a lot of chromosomes,

479
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:59,940
segregation going on and I have not found one graphic that captures all the aspects of meiosis.

480
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:09,010
So this formation of gametes arises from this process of meiosis which you may have learned about in your biology courses at some point.

481
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,620
So I have a couple of different views of this process of.

482
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,420
So hopefully between these two you'll get a good example of the main highlights here.

483
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:33,950
So. Miles. This is how we go from one cell with 46 chromosomes to a cell with 23, which we call haploid.

484
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:37,820
So diploid is 46 chromosomes. Haploid is 23.

485
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:43,950
And so basically what you get here, you can imagine that these are the chromosomes.

486
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:50,670
The first step is essentially you get a duplication of the DNA to form what are called sister chromatids.

487
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,110
So this one, you can see now has formed two sister chromatids, right.

488
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:01,580
And then another important step that occurs is you get crossing over.

489
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:11,899
Um, well, I'll take a step back. So the, you get this duplication of the genetic material and then the homologous chromosomes pair up.

490
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:17,420
So you have different chromosomes that you inherited from mom and dad that end up pairing up together.

491
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:26,510
And once those pair up, you get this crossing over of DNA material from one chromosome to the other.

492
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,690
And so what you get. What you get is let me see.

493
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:38,210
So, for example, you have these two chromosomes that paired up and then exchanged,

494
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:47,600
had a crossing over that the cell divided and you now get this section of DNA on this committed and.

495
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,080
The reverse. Yeah. And then similarly, what these two chromosomes are paired up.

496
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:59,120
You have this section of DNA ended up on this chromatin, right?

497
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:05,130
So then you have these two. You have these sister chromatids.

498
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:15,930
After the first division, the hold, the homologous chromosomes divided and went into two to the cell, split into two cells.

499
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:22,830
Right. And then after this crossing over event, you get these chromatids that split up.

500
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,940
And so you see one half of this one chromatin went to the cell.

501
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,380
The other one went to the cell, one chromatin went to the cell and the other went to that cell.

502
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:37,950
More or less make sense. The crossing over is important because it it's the reason you don't get this

503
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:43,830
basically the same exact outcome with every child from like the same parents.

504
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:49,110
So that allows her to be variability in the outcome of each like fertilization event.

505
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,130
Any questions, sir? So.

506
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:04,690
So that is what occurred. That is that is exactly what occurs in the case of the formation of the super.

507
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,170
So this is another view here.

508
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:17,979
So you have your first event where the homologous chromosomes pair up and then end up into the cell divides into these chromosomes,

509
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:25,630
end up into new cells, and then those are then the contents of and split up into four cells here.

510
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,680
So you go from one cell to four cells. This cell has 46 chromosomes.

511
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:37,780
These all have 23. It's a little bit different. In the case of the whole site, the oocyte undergoes the cell division,

512
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:46,510
but instead of making two essentially equivalent cells, one of the products of that is what's called a polar body.

513
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:52,150
Right. And so you have one cell and one polar body, and then you have the second round of cell division.

514
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:58,210
And once the sister chromatids are split apart, that also gives gives rise to polar bodies.

515
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:02,819
And so as far as we know, poor bodies don't really do much.

516
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:11,040
They kind of just generate. So you go from with the case in the case of all site, one cell with 46 to 1 cell with 23 chromosomes,

517
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:15,930
it's a little bit different in the oldest case compared to the the sperm development case.

518
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:24,780
So all this moving around the chromosomes means that you can get things can go wrong.

519
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:29,670
Right. You can have had triploid, which is the error of the in the chromosome number.

520
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:38,490
You can have the gain or loss within the daughter cell. So the parent cell divides into two daughter cells, right?

521
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,590
You can get the gain or loss of a single chromosome within the cell.

522
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:51,060
So we can and we can get something like Trisomy, where three of three of the chromosomes end up in one cell and only one ends up in the other.

523
00:58:52,740 --> 00:59:02,280
And what can cause errors in this process of meiosis are things like microtubule disrupters and by microtubule disruptors.

524
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:08,000
I'm talking about chemicals that disrupt the chromosomes moving on these structures called microtubules.

525
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:19,920
So they move along as protein structures that are specially specially made to move these chromosomes around during these processes of cell division.

526
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:30,219
So another thing that could happen is the chromosome cannot just may not disengage from the microtubules.

527
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:34,180
So that can lead to problems as well. So we have cases where cancer,

528
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:46,520
chemotherapeutic chemotherapy drugs are actually designed to disrupt microtubule biology like function as a way of stopping the spread of the cancer.

529
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:50,710
You don't want the cells to stop dividing. And so there's multiple chemicals that do this.

530
00:59:51,100 --> 01:00:00,280
But we've seen in multiple chemotherapeutic compounds sort of like side effects on reproductive endpoints because,

531
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:04,600
you know, like particularly in say the sperm out of sites in the testes because the.

532
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:12,480
These cells are undergoing a lot of cell division and a lot of meiosis is occurring, a lot of movement of the chromosomes is happening.

533
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,240
So they're going to be a prime target for microtubule disrupter.

534
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:25,140
And so impacting the ability for this to happen in the normal way could lead to impacts on, for instance, male fertility.

535
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:34,540
They have an example here with bisphenol A right, not a chemotherapeutic, but we see in a mouse models.

536
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:43,160
So what you need to see. So basically the chromosomes within the cell as they're undergoing these two rounds of cell division,

537
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:53,010
they they do this kind of coordinated movement to like line up in the middle of the cell, essentially, and then the cells divide into two.

538
01:00:53,010 --> 01:01:00,450
And there's this kind of nice, orchestrated set of movements that happens. So you can see here the DNA of the chromosomes is standard red here.

539
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:08,100
And you have this nice metaphase plate where all the chromosomes are lined up in the tubules as they integrate.

540
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,850
And so this is the control animal. These are the oocytes.

541
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,850
What are the animals that are exposed to BPA?

542
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:21,790
You see that the chromosomes along the microtubule are kind of disorganized in terms of where they're found.

543
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:27,490
Right. So you see, like instead of this nice organized plate, they're kind of found all over the place.

544
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:37,340
Yeah. Let's see, just kind of various forms of how that looks with this these BPA exposed mice.

545
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:43,490
So that's obviously going to potentially have some pretty big impacts on the ability of these mice to reproduce.

546
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:51,500
So that is. Yeah. So that's chromosome segregation.

547
01:01:53,420 --> 01:02:00,800
I think I hit all the important points there. So back to the testes.

548
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:10,220
So there's a couple testes testes cell types that it's important to talk about in addition to the lady cells often talked about before.

549
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:14,060
So we take a cross-section of the seven efforts.

550
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:19,790
Tubule. You'll see again these living cells on the periphery.

551
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,740
These are the guys that produce testosterone.

552
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:30,030
Another important cell type are the stately cells, which are sometimes called the nerve cells of the testes.

553
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:34,860
And they support these primitive sites as they undergo this process of.

554
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:42,700
Essentially transforming from a sperm stem cell or a germ cell into a fully functioning sperm.

555
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:47,710
They provide things like growth factors and, you know,

556
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:56,560
sort of just a signaling stimuli that helps them survive and undergo this process of differentiation into these fermented.

557
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:04,040
So the cell toy cells are important and there is like a direct link between like proper function

558
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:11,500
and the right number of sexually cells found within the testes to basically the health and the,

559
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:15,250
you know, the, the sperm count of an individual.

560
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,530
Right. So if you don't have as many certainly cells, there's a good chance you're going to have a lower sperm count kind of thing.

561
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:26,080
So those are very, very important to this process. And then finally, the sperm Patagonian cells.

562
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:33,610
So these are shown here on this cartoon as they're differentiating into the the spermatozoa.

563
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:42,610
And they move from the periphery to kind of differentiate as they go and move towards the center of the center for its tubule.

564
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,310
And eventually, you know,

565
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:51,540
giving rise to this morphological shape that we're probably familiar with in terms of the sperm with the head and the tail, etc.

566
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:57,210
So toxicants can target one or more of these cell types.

567
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,480
A toxic toxicant could impact a leading cell.

568
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:07,620
And basically, you know, like we talked about the phthalates, it can inhibit the ability of the leading cell to produce testosterone.

569
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:14,249
Uh, toxicants can also target sporadic glial cells and cause them to apoptosis,

570
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:19,950
basically just killing sperm cells before they get a chance to develop into fully functioning sperm.

571
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,220
And they can. Also targets are totally cells.

572
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:29,940
And like I said, if you end up damaging for totally cells that can have a direct impact on sperm count and fertility in males.

573
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:38,689
So there's this whole field of spore matter toxicity where we're trying to

574
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:43,760
understand how various chemical exposures can lead to toxic effects in the sperm.

575
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:50,600
And these there's a number of like sort of like fancy terms that go along

576
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,860
within this field with these different types of spread of toxicity that we see.

577
01:04:55,490 --> 01:05:03,050
So we have like decreased sperm count or oligo sperm. So we have just less sperm than you would expect.

578
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:10,670
You can have impacts on sperm production. So you're you're impacting the body's ability or the testes ability to make more sperm.

579
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,129
We can have impacts of the sperm need to be able to swim basically.

580
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:22,380
Right. And so you could have decreased sperm motility or impacts on the ability of the sperm to move.

581
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,840
It impacts on the morphology.

582
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:35,840
So we have this sort of classical sperm morphology, which includes the head and the tail, and we see that chemicals can impact the sperm morphology.

583
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:37,850
And if you impact the sperm morphology,

584
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:43,909
there's a good chance it's not going to be functioning in the same way because we need the you know, the morphology is there for a reason.

585
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:50,540
Right. It's very tied to the ability of the sperm to do its job, which is to fuzed with the egg in reproduction.

586
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:58,190
And so we have an example here with mice exposed to acrylamide.

587
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,910
So in mice they have a slightly different morphology to their sperm.

588
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:06,470
Actually, they have this like hook shape on the sperm head.

589
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:19,390
So this is a control animal. And then we have mice that were exposed to acrylamide 1.2 million molar in their drinking water for four weeks.

590
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,889
And so we see these various impacts on the morphology.

591
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:26,500
When we look at these sperm under a microscope, they look different.

592
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:33,560
So you'll see this like blunted shape to the head as opposed to the hook shape you'll see in a sort of amorphous shape.

593
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:38,710
It's all this kind of bent backwards head and this kind of what they call a banana like head.

594
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,920
So different morphology for these animals that are exposed to acrylamide.

595
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:51,310
So something's happening there during the formation of the sperm that's, you know, could have a direct impact on the fertility.

596
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:58,100
You know, you can imagine these sperm may not contribute to the reproductive process as efficiently as you would see once a control animal.

597
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,730
Take a quick pause and just see if anyone has any questions or comments.

598
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:09,950
I never ask for comments. I always ask for questions. Does anyone have any thoughts?

599
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:22,800
Any comments on anything? And for example, in that and what happened with it.

600
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:32,220
Why wouldn't that despair that it has those are normally days goes to that all the older mice.

601
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,990
What happens. What what's the mechanism. Yes.

602
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,240
What happens is it is like an abortion or it doesn't happen anything with the reproduction.

603
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:47,910
What happens there? Are you saying what happens to cause the shape or what happens because of that?

604
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,610
Because of that? Yes. Yeah. See, I don't.

605
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:58,920
You'd have to do the test to see, I suppose to say for sure if these mice go on to reproduce, if they're able to.

606
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:06,389
I'm going to guess that, you know, if you were to set up like like decided like a reproductive study to like, I don't know,

607
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:14,100
studying things like how often the control mice were able to get female mice pregnant versus the treated that

608
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:19,500
you'd have less overall pregnancies in the control group in the treated group compared to the control group.

609
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:28,470
So but, you know, I think it's you know, you're going to see I think there's a number of different sort of outcomes.

610
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:34,740
They may I'm going to my first guess is that these guys aren't going to move as well in the treated situation.

611
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:43,049
You know, you need to have the swimming the. There's a lot of like, um, energy put into the tail doing like a swimming motion to get to the egg.

612
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:48,690
Right. I'm going to guess that these guys are not as effective swimmers as the control animal.

613
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:53,100
They're going to be like the like one of the big like first outcomes you can see.

614
01:08:53,100 --> 01:09:03,210
But there may be impacts in terms of like the ability of the head to like deliver the genetic, you know, the DNA into infused with the egg.

615
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:07,410
There might be something going on there. There's you know, there's a lot of things that could be happening.

616
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:17,120
I'd have to you know, I don't know if they followed up and looked at like, you know, certain aspects of how acrylamide was impacting things on a more,

617
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:25,430
uh, cellular or molecular level in the as far beyond this morphology impacts that sort of answer your question.

618
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,080
Mm hmm. Yeah. Thank you.

619
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:34,730
There have been, like, in kind of recent past, some pretty high profile books about, like, decline of sperm count and population level.

620
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:43,370
And I've also seen some like, like professors kind of maybe not be worried about that or kind of just think that maybe the books are kind of inflated.

621
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:51,320
This here's what your stance on that is, or if that's something that you know much about or yeah, we're going to talk about that in the next lecture.

622
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:56,660
That's Dr. Swann has that book, uh, Countdown.

623
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,790
I think that talks a lot about the declining sperm count.

624
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:08,150
That's my, my personal take is that I've seen a lot of publications about declining sperm counts.

625
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:16,160
Uh, and it seems the better, but she's kind of one of the main ones that sort of polishing out that.

626
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,270
I know that there's have been a few studies that have come out that I've kind of pushed back because,

627
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:26,629
you know, this is like all about study design, you know, because they're looking at this.

628
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:28,350
Is it like a controlled experiment, right?

629
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:35,809
Like like that we do in our toxicology lab, they're observing populations of humans and noting, you know, there's sperm counts over time.

630
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,330
So it's kind of like it's like it's like an epidemiology study.

631
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:45,080
So there's a lot of factors that, you know, one has to consider to control for like diet and things like that.

632
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:51,050
Dr. Simmons certainly makes a pretty good case for some of the factors that they've control for, and I'll talk about that in the next.

633
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:55,130
I just it's kind of just a bullet point, but I forget which specific thing.

634
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:01,870
But it looks like the decline in sperm count cannot be accounted for by X because we controlled for this in the study.

635
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:09,680
Right. So I definitely want to dig more into what the sort of pushback, if you will,

636
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,760
towards her observations is, because I honestly haven't looked into those as much,

637
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:20,510
but it's definitely like an active area of research and I am very compelled by the stuff that she's put out.

638
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:28,399
Uh, but I do want to, you know, it bears looking into if there are any criticisms to the study design or what

639
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,150
have you that I have seen a couple of publications that talk about that as well.

640
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:39,290
But my overall impression at this point is that there have been some kind of alarming trends in sperm count.

641
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:42,560
But yeah, it is an active area of research for sure.

642
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:47,580
So that's. That's my perspective.

643
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:57,059
Anything else? I wanted to ask if we're going to talk about in class,

644
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:02,340
because I just saw that there's a new study saying that they found microplastics in breast milk.

645
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:08,280
If we're going to talk about how microplastics potentially going to affect our generation.

646
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:18,390
Yeah, I don't have that in these two in these two lectures that I have planned for repurposes microplastics here.

647
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:23,729
Yeah, we just have the other speaker here. I guess it was last this year.

648
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:30,440
I can't remember. But that says a lot. That's and that is a very interesting area of research that, you know,

649
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:35,610
you're looking at like how the plastics break down the different sizes of the plastic particles and all of that.

650
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:40,200
It's pretty interesting. And I know they found it in like placenta now.

651
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,200
So I don't have a specific anything specific in there, but at this point.

652
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:52,920
But I could, you know, maybe bring it into a lecture later on, depending if I know that there's interest in something, I'll do my best to bring it in.

653
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:57,210
But that could also be something you may want to look at for your topic for the paper.

654
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,400
So yeah, maybe something to think about. But yeah, these microplastics.

655
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,300
So if you're not familiar with microplastics, we're seeing that like as we're,

656
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:12,090
we've been able to like analyze samples that like better levels of detection we're seeing

657
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:17,399
like that certain plastic materials are breaking down into these like small particles,

658
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:23,010
smaller and smaller particles of plastics that are being uptake into the various tissues in the body.

659
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:29,579
They found them in the placenta, found them in breast milk. And things and plastics contain things like these phthalates.

660
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:32,880
And so, you know, the overall health impacts of these microplastics.

661
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:38,280
And they've just been found all over the place are still kind of being investigated.

662
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:47,640
So very interesting and a little bit alarming to some degree, but we're getting pretty close here.

663
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:53,220
So let's see how far we can make it. We might not make it through the entire set of science, but.

664
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,710
Okay, well, this. But it's good to have discussion. Is there anything else? Any thoughts on microplastics, please?

665
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:11,910
Yeah, we're I suppose that that is study, for example, with acrylamide is to know defects and all are set in the rats.

666
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:19,620
But then in the in the humans, the acrylamide where, where is found where we are exposed to that.

667
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,830
For example, potato chips is one place.

668
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:31,799
So it forms from when you heat potatoes if like really high levels or like like levels where you fry things,

669
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,980
there's a little bit of acrylamide that gets formed on the other.

670
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:39,930
I believe it's used in some industrial processes to make certain products.

671
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:45,400
I'm more familiar with the that the potato chip french fry like this,

672
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:53,100
but that would be kind of the most day to day exposure situation that I come up with.

673
01:14:53,100 --> 01:15:05,440
There is no point to like. Now the level that you're exposed to is important to consider compared to these animals that would have 1.2 million

674
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:12,280
molar in their water that they're drinking every day for all of their water that they're consuming for four weeks.

675
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:17,020
So not to you know, this dose response is very important to consider.

676
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:25,480
So eating one bag of chips versus drinking your water supply, having 1.2 million molar of acrylamide is going to be very different.

677
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,240
Any other. This is fun. I like getting you getting into the discussion.

678
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:43,530
Does anyone have any comments or thoughts? Questions? I was just thinking about my trip over the summer.

679
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:54,030
We were looking at TV y metabolites for commercials and they have yet to come up with a like an acceptable daily

680
01:15:54,030 --> 01:16:02,040
intake level of what was this again with TCP why the clear purpose metabolite o clear pure POS metabolite.

681
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:11,160
Okay. Yeah, because so they hadn't determined yet below what level is it?

682
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:13,290
Are you not going to experience any effects?

683
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:20,910
But I was just wondering what the process of determining something like that is from a research standpoint.

684
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:30,500
Oh like so determining what the, like the acceptable daily intake of a chemical is, is that.

685
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:41,900
Yeah, um, I guess in taking, in and taking into consideration all of the other things that impact on the fertility.

686
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:54,490
Um. If you still have fertility negative fertility outcomes, but you're being exposed to whatever chemical at such a low level.

687
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,490
Yeah. How would you determine. Yeah.

688
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:07,480
I mean, it's not you know, we do these kind of I think where things are right now is at sort of a.

689
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:20,959
A more sort of like gross effects level. Like, are you impacting like the litter size of a of an animal exposed to this chemical?

690
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:25,160
Or are you impacting like is the next generation or are you seeing developmental impacts?

691
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,290
There are cases where they go in.

692
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:35,569
There are a lot of a lot of times they'll go in and try to understand some of the like molecular like receptor binding issues,

693
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:40,340
you know, things that might be happening. But in terms of like.

694
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:48,290
Yeah. So that would be one thing they would look at. And yeah, I mean, it's not easy understanding, like,

695
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:55,140
what the [INAUDIBLE] are you talking about specifically for like reproductive health outcomes or more just kind of any kind of health outcome,

696
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:59,219
like an exposure to like something on a low level. Right. I think so.

697
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:03,330
What we had talked about was something like very practical.

698
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,489
Somebody would ask you, I know that I should wear sunscreen every day,

699
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:16,830
but if I didn't wear sunscreen for three weeks and I took this vacation, and what are my chances of developing like skin cancer?

700
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:24,690
And so I just wonder on a, like a very particular level like that, um, how you start to determine,

701
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:32,400
especially with things like this because hormones function at such low levels and then things like phthalates,

702
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,760
we're being exposed to constantly, but they have like a short half life.

703
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:43,920
Um. And I guess I'm asking kind of mathematically how you would determine.

704
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:48,120
Right, the probability of an adverse health outcome.

705
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:52,500
Yeah. So typically what you're doing is like trying to nail down and this is yeah,

706
01:18:52,500 --> 01:19:02,549
this gets to be very hard to do a challenging but like sort of ideally is like you would say identify that say

707
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:13,110
inhibition of CYP P11 p450 1181 that basically is really important for the induction or the synthesis of testosterone.

708
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:19,830
And you decide based on like, like EPA or whoever would decide based on looking at all the evidence, you know,

709
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:23,920
all the studies that have been put out that that's the most relevant and the point that that

710
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:28,950
that is really the thing that underlies the health effects with exposure to that chemical.

711
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:35,279
And then what you try to do is look at the dose response data from and they'll look across multiple studies and

712
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,919
say these studies are all really well designed and we really have a lot of confidence in like this set of,

713
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,870
say, just pulling a number out of thin air.

714
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:52,650
This set of ten studies, of these 15 studies were all there's some methodological flaw with them and we're not going to use them.

715
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:55,200
And they make all this like public. They put into a big document.

716
01:19:55,890 --> 01:20:01,030
And if we're talking about inhibition of an enzyme, then they'll they'll and they've you know,

717
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:03,870
all these ten studies have done some kind of dose response curve.

718
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:08,609
And they'll probably they'll do some kind of, you know, pretty intense like modeling of the data,

719
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:15,149
maybe taking in all of the data across the ten papers and model their own sort of dose response curve, maybe.

720
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:19,979
Or maybe just look at what dose response curve that came out of one study that was done by

721
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,270
a group and say that one is like they accounted for every freaking thing under the sun.

722
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,549
It's like the most well-designed study.

723
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:32,970
We have so much confidence in it and will say we're going to we're going to base and then go model that and say like

724
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:39,270
use benchmark dose modeling approach and say 10% inhibition of testosterone we think is relevant for a health outcome.

725
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:42,660
Then they'll just model it the way you would, the way I kind of showed you.

726
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,800
That's kind of the general approach. There's always a lot of other factors to account for,

727
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:52,110
but that would be kind of where you you try to sort of the idea and that's what makes it hard

728
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:58,950
is that you're trying to find that one outcome that allows you to make that risk assessment.

729
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:05,700
Like, what do you do if a chemical damages DNA but also inhibits testosterone synthesis, which of those is more important?

730
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:10,110
And they'll have to kind of go through that process as well. That sort of.

731
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:15,220
Yeah, yeah. And it's it's a lot of work you'll see like these documents are like,

732
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:21,479
like years and years are put into sort of making these evaluations really lively conversation.

733
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:31,710
I think we're a little bit over time, but thanks a lot for the engagement and I will see you not Monday, but next Wednesday.

734
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:37,560
I'll still be in office. I think I had a if you did see I had to cancel office hours for Thursday.

735
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:41,700
But other than that, that's a lot of our time.

736
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:50,520
So if you have any questions about the paper or this material or anything else about office hours or email.

737
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:56,220
Hey, thanks, everyone. Thank you very.

738
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:02,750
Okay.
