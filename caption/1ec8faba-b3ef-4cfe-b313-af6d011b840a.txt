1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,755
Welcome back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:15,175
In this unit, we're
going to examine

3
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:18,010
epigenetic mechanisms
and phenomenon.

4
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,355
Have you ever wondered why
twins can look so different,

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,255
especially as they get older?

6
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:25,560
They have the same exact DNA.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,330
So what is causing it?

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,990
Well, it turns out there's

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,260
a whole molecular universe
down at the DNA level that is

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,330
modifying its chemical structure

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,135
or how our genetic
material is packaged.

12
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,250
These chemical and
structural changes are

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,145
called the epigenome
and in this course,

14
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:44,620
we're going to explore
the influences of

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,485
the epigenome and how it
affects human health.

16
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:51,010
In the second part of
our DOE head-course,

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,405
we will learn how
early life experiences

18
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:54,875
affect our epigenome.

19
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,245
This is the collection
of molecular markers

20
00:00:57,245 --> 00:00:59,800
that control our
genes expression.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,360
You'll be exposed to research
involving animals and

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,785
cell models as well as
human birth cohort studies.

23
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:07,910
This work has already revealed

24
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,460
key developmental periods
that are important for

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,800
epigenetic programming
and vulnerable

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,275
to environmental and
nutritional insults.

27
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,180
In this unit, we will examine

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,710
the principles and applications

29
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,009
of epigenetics as they
relate to human nutrition,

30
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,380
toxicology, health behavior,
and disease etiology.

31
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,600
Throughout this course, we
will use examples drawn from

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,085
the primary literature to
reinforce the concepts.

33
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:36,170
You'll be introduced to
current laboratory methods and

34
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,120
emerging technologies
for examining

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,545
child growth and the
effects of the epigenome.

36
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:43,995
Are they're any
twins in the class?

37
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,400
Well, it turns out that
twins raised apart

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,165
have the greatest
epigenetic differences.

39
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:51,840
What about calico cat owners?

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,770
The different color patches
in these cats are due to

41
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,285
the epigenetic phenomenon
called X-inactivation.

42
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,860
Gardening enthusiasts, well,

43
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,660
it turns out the
timing and the color

44
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,490
of azalea plants are due

45
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,240
to different
epigenetic mechanisms.

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,650
Finally, what about Michigan
maize and blue fans?

47
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,410
Well, the maize corn has a
large and complex genome,

48
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,350
which includes abundant
repetitive sequences

49
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,295
that needs to be silenced
through epigenetic mechanisms.

50
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:24,895
Before we begin to
understand the epigenome,

51
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,500
when identical twins develop

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,850
differently, we thought, well,

53
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,880
it must be due to
different environments or

54
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,740
different behaviors such as diet

55
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,915
or smoking, or even exercise.

56
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:38,020
But the evaluation of
the epigenome showed us

57
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,125
that a third factor besides
nature and nurture,

58
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,690
the epigenome plays
a huge role too.

59
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,010
What's so powerful about

60
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,620
the epigenome is
although it's stable,

61
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,720
it can be improved, for example,

62
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,250
to make us less vulnerable to

63
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,699
the harmful things
in our environment.

64
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,330
In this slide, I want to begin to

65
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,540
introduce why modern-day
public health practitioners

66
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,895
apply the relatively
short history

67
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,889
of what we know
about the epigenome

68
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,290
in order to improve
human health and

69
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,200
reduce the developmental
origins of disease.

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,180
Through the work of
David Barker and

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,950
colleagues, it's now widely,

72
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,245
if not universally accepted that

73
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,275
early conditions can affect
later in life disease

74
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:21,020
and that this is a source
of grave concern for

75
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,020
societies that are undergoing
a transition from,

76
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,800
say, sparse to better nutrition.

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,605
Through both epidemiology
and animal model studies,

78
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,990
we can now understand that

79
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,510
a well-characterized
initiating event

80
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,870
such as an exposure to an
endocrine disrupting chemical,

81
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,745
can have a well-characterized
health outcome.

82
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,350
But what is relatively unknown is

83
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,630
the process that
gets from point A to

84
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,360
point B and this miracle
that we'll focus

85
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,005
on in this unit is
epigenetic programming.

86
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,960
I'd like to spend a
few minutes why we as

87
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,940
public health practitioners
might want to

88
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,075
care about epigenetic
phenomena in health,

89
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,475
and the first example
I'll talk about

90
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:07,330
is that our epigenome
changes over time.

91
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,190
We do not want the same sets
of genes express when we're

92
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,720
four years old as when we're

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,770
40-year-old or even 85-year-old.

94
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,745
Even more importantly,

95
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:18,470
the things that we
influence early in

96
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,830
life can deflect these
age-related changes.

97
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,110
In fact, in the field

98
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,805
of developmental
origins of disease,

99
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:28,000
we need to do three
things really well.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,675
First, we have to have

101
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,530
a really well-characterized
early environment.

102
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,135
Then we need to
follow individuals,

103
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:36,440
and these can be humans in

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,140
cohorts or animals
in animal studies,

105
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,090
you need to follow
individuals over

106
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,330
time and measure
different outcomes.

107
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,405
Then finally, down at
the molecular level,

108
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,880
we need to measure
epigenetics at baseline and

109
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,445
over time to understand how

110
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:54,500
early environmental
exposures affect

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,420
epigenetic mechanisms and in

112
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,355
turn put people at risk
for different diseases.

113
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:01,640
You can see an example here

114
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,425
in the individual who
has a bow and arrow.

115
00:05:05,425 --> 00:05:08,270
When you're beginning to
pull back that arrow,

116
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,760
if a certain phenomena such as

117
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,120
change in wind or someone
taps you on the shoulder,

118
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,670
this can deflect
the arrow away from

119
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,500
its target and the same
thing can happen when

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,695
an early environmental influences

121
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,965
change the epigenetic
programming of an individual,

122
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,125
you may end up at a
very different place

123
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,125
across a 70-year lifespan.

124
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,770
At the top of this figure,

125
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,510
you're seeing this example at

126
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,430
the individual level and at

127
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,010
the bottom you're seeing this
at the population level,

128
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,080
where an environment, diet,

129
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,880
or toxicated mediated shift

130
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,220
away from the baseline rate of

131
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,400
the epigenetic change can occur

132
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,515
and affect individuals
health risk across life.

133
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:55,145
In this unit, we have the
two broad competencies.

134
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,830
The first is to assess
health implications of

135
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,765
epigenetic gene regulation
across life and generations.

136
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:04,895
We will define key
epigenetic mechanisms

137
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:06,755
and biological phenomena.

138
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:08,420
We will examine how

139
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,940
dietary and environmental
factors influence

140
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,860
epigenetic mechanisms to affect

141
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,170
health status and finally,

142
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,445
we will critically assess

143
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:19,690
epigenetic research in
the primary literature.

144
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,029
The second competency
will be to evaluate

145
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,860
population health implications of

146
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,440
environmental and
nutritional epigenetics.

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,170
We will begin by explaining
the complexity of

148
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,280
incorporating epigenetics
into population health.

149
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,360
We will continue by articulating

150
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,220
potential ethical policy in

151
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,960
risk assessment ramifications of

152
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,210
epigenetics, and finally,

153
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,220
we will conceptualize
a hypothesis

154
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,990
and design an experiment to

155
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,090
evaluate epigenetic mechanisms of

156
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,011
the developmental origins
of health and disease.
