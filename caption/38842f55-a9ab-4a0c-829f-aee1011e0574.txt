1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,200
In this video, we will

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,000
consider some of the
approaches that have been

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,710
proposed to reform the financing

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,855
of health care in
the United States.

5
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:17,640
These will include building upon

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,770
the foundation of the
Affordable Care Act,

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,750
moving to a single-payer system

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,790
under the heading of
Medicare for all,

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,380
and a proposal that embodies

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,110
more conservative policy ideas.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,220
Today's learning objectives are,

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,405
to assess the relative
merits of private,

13
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:35,390
market-oriented and
public legislative and

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,700
regulatory approaches
to improving

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,895
the performance of the
health care system.

16
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:41,930
To compare public
and private roles

17
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,250
in the financing and delivery of

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,990
health care in the US relative

19
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,430
to other high-income nations.

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,420
Imagine that the US
didn't already have

21
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,880
a healthcare financing
system and you could

22
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,120
design one from scratch on
a clean sheet of paper.

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,130
How would you cover the cost of

24
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,290
care delivered to Americans?

25
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,650
Please pause the video and
sketch out a few ideas.

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,300
There are a number of design
choices you had to make,

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,895
not limited to the
questions on this slide.

28
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:16,880
First, let's consider a
big picture question.

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,500
Does your clean sheet design

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,025
closely resemble
what we have now?

31
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:22,980
I'm guessing that
for most of you it

32
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,305
didn't yet here we are.

33
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:28,895
Second, let's home in
on one specific issue.

34
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,070
Did you envision an ideal system

35
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,370
tying most people's
insurance to their jobs?

36
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,725
As we consider various
policy proposals,

37
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:39,620
keep in mind both
the goals you are

38
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,315
trying to achieve on your clean,

39
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:43,540
that is history free sheet

40
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,980
and the reality that
we are starting from

41
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,520
a particular place that evolved
for historical reasons or

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
accidents and has created a
set of powerful interests.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Given that bringing the
remaining uninsured into

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,690
the system is an objective of

45
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,535
many health reform proposals,

46
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,355
it'll be helpful to
understand who they are.

47
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,830
Two-thirds of the
uninsured are currently

48
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,605
eligible for some form
of subsidized coverage,

49
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:12,290
so their presence in the ranks
of the uninsured suggests

50
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,575
either lack of awareness of
the subsidies or more likely,

51
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:17,629
low demand for insurance.

52
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,730
Their willingness to
pay is apparently

53
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,665
less than the
subsidized premium,

54
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:24,020
requiring even
larger subsidies to

55
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,860
entice them to purchase
coverage voluntarily.

56
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,860
Another group worth noting is

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,130
the 11 percent of the
uninsured who are

58
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,050
below the federal
poverty line in

59
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,570
States that did not
expand Medicaid.

60
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,460
The ACA presume that

61
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,290
all such persons
have become Medicaid

62
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,270
eligible and therefore made them

63
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,705
ineligible for premium
subsidies on the exchanges.

64
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:46,910
When the Supreme Court
ruled that States

65
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,874
did not have to expand Medicaid,

66
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:51,875
these individuals fell
through the cracks.

67
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,020
To summarize why people lack

68
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,570
coverage, several
factors contribute.

69
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,715
High premium cost is one.

70
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,070
One third of uninsured
single adults would

71
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,160
face premiums greater than
10 percent of income.

72
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,400
As we've inferred from the
data on the previous slide,

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,055
low-demand is another
important factor.

74
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,055
People might view insurance
is not worth the cost,

75
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:16,595
especially if available plans
require high deductibles.

76
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:18,530
Some people might be unaware of

77
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,115
eligibility or find
signing up to complex.

78
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:24,650
Finally, recent
immigrants may be

79
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,110
ineligible or even if eligible,

80
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,220
fear that enrollment could

81
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,530
jeopardize their path
to permanent residency.

82
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,310
A Congressional
Budget Office laid

83
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,050
out two key elements
of achieving

84
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,360
near universal
coverage as making

85
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,750
the cost affordable and
participation compulsory.

86
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,970
Premium subsidies
are required for

87
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,770
low and moderate
income households

88
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,380
as the full cost is
prohibitive to many.

89
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,300
A compulsory element could be

90
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,160
introduced through a
coverage mandate with

91
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,740
large penalties or default plan

92
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,390
automatically covering those not

93
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,145
enrolling in another plan.

94
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,380
The former approach
proved extremely

95
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,170
unpopular even with
relatively small penalties.

96
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Countries that have
achieved universal coverage

97
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,950
have generally taken
one of two approaches.

98
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,475
The first approach is building
a single-payer system.

99
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:16,400
Examples include Canada, the UK,

100
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,955
Denmark, Australia,
Sweden, and Taiwan.

101
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,770
Other countries have employed

102
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,485
highly regulated
multi-payer systems.

103
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:28,890
These include Germany,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

104
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,890
The CBO has laid out

105
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,895
four potential payouts to
near universal coverage,

106
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,590
ranging from options that build

107
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,035
directly on our existing
coverage sources,

108
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:40,700
to those that move more people

109
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,725
into new sources of coverage.

110
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:45,440
The least disruptive
to the status quo

111
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,900
is to retain existing
sources of coverage,

112
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,180
expands subsidies, and provide

113
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,100
default coverage
through a private plan

114
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,055
or a public option.

115
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:57,575
A larger change would be to
retain employer coverage,

116
00:04:57,575 --> 00:05:00,710
but to replace the non-group
market and Medicaid with

117
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,855
a choice of subsidized
private plans

118
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,595
or default public plan.

119
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,620
More disruptive
paths would sever

120
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,915
the link between
jobs and insurance.

121
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:11,150
Those would be a
multi-payer system with

122
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,300
full subsidies for all to
purchase private plans plus

123
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,870
a default plan for those
who do not enroll or

124
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,375
a single-payer system as
default plan for all.

125
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,900
Even the design of a single
health reform components,

126
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,505
like a public option plan

127
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,575
as an alternative
to private plans,

128
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:30,380
involves multiple
decision points and

129
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,560
each decision has multiple
options or sub decisions.

130
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,020
Similarly, building a
single-payer system

131
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,314
requires many design choices.

132
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:44,570
Each one would likely become
quite politically charged,

133
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,250
such as what services would be

134
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,830
covered and how much
providers will be paid?
