1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,100
You already know that
water is essential to

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,710
life and one of our most
precious resources,

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,940
but it also represents

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,590
a potential exposure pathway

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,330
for lots of different hazards.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,860
In this module, we're
going to cover some

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,390
of the key water
pollutants that we

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,650
worry about and what

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,470
their potential health
effects might be.

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,470
We can think of water
contaminants or

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,850
hazards in the same way that we

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,380
think of contaminants generally.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,605
There's chemical, physical,
and biological hazards.

14
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:36,090
So I'll give you
an example here of

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,740
a chemical hazard and
of course that's a

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,510
natural or an anthropogenic

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,445
or synthetic chemical compound.

18
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:44,090
So one you may already be
familiar with is arsenic which

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,585
is commonly found in
groundwater in Bangladesh.

20
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:50,040
We can also have
biological hazards.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,220
So these are microbes or
even larger organisms

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,600
or animals living in water.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,430
So two examples here that may be

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,275
recognizable are typhoid
and cholera bacteria.

25
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:01,520
Then finally we have
physical hazards.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,690
So these can be things like

27
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,270
radioisotopes or
radiological hazards,

28
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,980
or also physical objects like

29
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,065
sediments that might be
present in the water.

30
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:12,170
The example I'll give you
here is radon in groundwater.

31
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,825
So you can see illustrated
here a map of North Carolina,

32
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,600
and it's marked with
different zones

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,535
based on their
susceptibility to having

34
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:21,530
elevated levels of radon in

35
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,630
groundwater which you can see
vary quite a bit by region.

36
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,130
Let's come back to
chemicals in water.

37
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,960
I'll give you a
historical example here

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,000
based on arsenic which
I already mentioned.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,320
So it's estimated that

40
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,960
about 75 million people
in the country of

41
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,180
Bangladesh alone are exposed

42
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,490
to potentially harmful
levels of arsenic.

43
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,260
So you can see in
the map where we're

44
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,270
talking about here in South Asia,

45
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,760
and if you look at the
close-up map of Bangladesh,

46
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,960
you'll see that large parts of

47
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,940
the country have
concentrations of

48
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,385
arsenic that are the
very highest level

49
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,170
of the scale shown here.

50
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,810
These concentrations are
highest at the coastline.

51
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,475
This is a feature basically of

52
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:00,680
geological aspects
of the country,

53
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,750
and unfortunately this
is a natural source

54
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,670
over which the people
of Bangladesh have

55
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,560
no influence but must struggle to

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
find safe clean sources
of drinking water.

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,900
We could also think
about things like iron.

58
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,340
Here in the city of Ann Arbor,

59
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,290
the city routinely rinses out

60
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,570
their fire hydrants and when
they open those hydrants,

61
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,460
they often disrupt rust

62
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,815
and iron which can then
show up in your tap water.

63
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,030
In this case, it's largely

64
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,235
harmless though it does look bad.

65
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,380
Lead in drinking water may be

66
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,465
an issue that you're
already familiar with.

67
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,130
We've known for
thousands of years

68
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,020
that lead is a potential toxin.

69
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,790
In fact, there's some
scholars that think

70
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,950
that lead in the
pipes that supplied

71
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,230
drinking water to
Rome actually led to

72
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,975
the downfall of the
ancient Roman Empire.

73
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:43,430
Although we've known this is bad

74
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,570
for us for thousands of years,

75
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,870
it wasn't until 1859
that the United States

76
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,700
first identified lead pipes as

77
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,690
a potential source
of lead poisoning.

78
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,145
We can think of other both

79
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:57,110
natural and
anthropogenic chemicals.

80
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,140
Manganese is one that's quite
common in drinking water.

81
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,270
There's also emerging threats.

82
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,790
So things like brominated
flame retardants which

83
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,750
don't break down very easily
once they get into water.

84
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,960
Things like disinfection
by-products.

85
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,660
So when you add chlorine to water

86
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,550
to kill off parasites
and microbes,

87
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,290
that chlorine can combine with

88
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,030
remaining organic material and

89
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,440
ultimately form new chemicals,

90
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,735
some of which are carcinogenic.

91
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,450
We also think about
illicit drugs,

92
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,550
we have more and more
just drugs in general,

93
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,310
pharmaceuticals included
that are making it into

94
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,500
our water supply systems
both at discharge

95
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,295
but potentially in our
drinking water as well.

96
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,910
There's also concerns
about microplastics,

97
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,810
these tiny little plastic
beads that are used for

98
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,100
exfoliation purposes in a
variety of cosmetic products.

99
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,680
Nanomaterials are
increasingly being

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,030
used in building materials,

101
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,635
in clothing, and in some cases
cosmetic products as well.

102
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,415
Finally, we have issues around

103
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:53,930
urban runoff from roadways.

104
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,000
So when it rains, a
lot of the oils and

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
other materials on the roadways

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,310
are swept into our waterways,

107
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,220
now we have this
very complex mix of

108
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,525
chemicals which can be
potentially harmful to us.

109
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,660
Let me walk you through

110
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,230
now quite famous chemical water

111
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,540
contamination incident
that involved mercury.

112
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,790
So in May 1956,

113
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,470
there were four
patients in Minamata,

114
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,360
Japan who were admitted
to the hospital.

115
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,160
They all had the same symptoms;

116
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,080
very high fever, convulsions,

117
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,240
psychosis, loss of consciousness

118
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,840
leading to coma, and
subsequently death.

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,070
Shortly afterwards, there
were 13 more deaths and

120
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,099
that was followed by
many more illnesses

121
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:32,230
and deaths as well.

122
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,010
The situation became so dire

123
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,125
that actually local
fishermen rioted

124
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,090
in 1959 that finally

125
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,470
got the government to
investigate the situation,

126
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,410
but it wasn't until 1968,

127
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,050
12 years later that
officials actually announced

128
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,380
the cause that had been
determined for this event.

129
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,510
What was the cause? Well,
it turns out there was

130
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,490
a massive amount
of methyl-mercury

131
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,650
contaminated waste that
had been dumped into

132
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,860
Minamata Bay by a company
called the Chisso Corporation.

133
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,900
So this methyl-mercury
contaminated

134
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,835
the fish in Minamata Bay and

135
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,650
the fishermen then
caught those fish

136
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,720
and the community consumed them,

137
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,755
and ended up having

138
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:09,200
extraordinarily high
exposures to methyl-mercury,

139
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,335
which is a very
potent neurotoxin.

140
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:13,580
So it turns out the
concentrations in

141
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,770
the sediments of the Bay
were high enough that

142
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,170
it would actually be
financially viable to go in and

143
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,410
mine methylmercury out
of those materials.

144
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,010
So incredibly large amount
of this stuff in the Bay.

145
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,150
There were also impacts on

146
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,420
domesticated animals and
wildlife, not surprisingly.

147
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,180
At the end of this incident,

148
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,460
there were a total of
900 deaths and over

149
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,400
2,200 people who were
ill as a result.

150
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,590
Now, there was a cleanup
that was ordered but that

151
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,110
didn't happen until 2004.

152
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,065
This is for an incident
that started in 1956.

153
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:48,080
So here's an example
of a long-term and

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,755
very tragic chemical water
contamination issue.

155
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,530
I'll give you some
examples now of

156
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,090
biological hazards in water.

157
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,665
So you may have heard
of Guinea worm.

158
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,570
There were actually 3.5 million

159
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,460
cases in 20 countries
around the world

160
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,320
just in the mid 1980s of people

161
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,765
afflicted by Guinea worm
from drinking water.

162
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,420
There were also
cryptosporidium issues.

163
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,620
So if you live in the Mid-West,

164
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,190
you may recall back in 1993
in the City of Milwaukee,

165
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,380
there were 403,000 people

166
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,000
sickened out of an estimated

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,160
1.6 million total population,

168
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,140
and they were sickened
by cryptosporidium that

169
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,680
made its way into the
drinking water system.

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,550
In 1976, at

171
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,380
the Philadelphia
Legionnaire's Convention

172
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,950
that year there were

173
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,540
29 people who died and a

174
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,480
182 who were sickened
by Legionella.

175
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,460
This was our first
real introduction

176
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,515
to that biological hazard.

177
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:39,840
In Haiti, there were 1,000
people killed and almost

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,995
17,000 people sickened
by a cholera outbreak.

179
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:44,250
There wasn't endemic to Haiti,

180
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,470
it was actually introduced by

181
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,135
United Nations peacekeepers from

182
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:49,010
other countries who came to Haiti

183
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,520
and contaminated the
drinking water supply.

184
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,500
We can also think of larger
organisms like fish.

185
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,570
So a piranha would be a
biological hazard in water

186
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,120
if you're swimming
in water where there

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,705
are piranhas though I
don't recommend that.

188
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,775
We can also think
about algal blooms.

189
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:08,360
So these algal blooms create
issues when cyanobacteria,

190
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,220
so these are blue-green algae,

191
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,325
break down and release
this potent toxin.

192
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,560
We actually get harmful
algal blooms in

193
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,850
late summer and early fall

194
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,500
right here around the
State of Michigan.

195
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,900
You can see the satellite
image here of Lake Erie,

196
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,850
all that green is algal blooms,

197
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,470
and these are made worse by

198
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,150
excess nutrients from runoff
from farming operations.

199
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,930
Health issues here
a pretty serious.

200
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,700
There's liver and
kidney toxicity,

201
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,280
there's irritation to
your mucus membranes,

202
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,460
rashes, gastroenteritis,
nausea, vomiting,

203
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,020
and also respiratory
issues if you

204
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,230
happen to breathe in these algae.

205
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,220
Of course ingestion is
the most common route

206
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,870
of exposure that we're
concerned about here.

207
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,210
We're drinking this water,
and you may think, well,

208
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,250
it's one thing for the lake
to be contaminated but

209
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,410
there are absolutely public
health impacts here.

210
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,070
So there was a bloom
in Lake Erie in 2014,

211
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,570
you can see images from

212
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,490
that bloom here that
actually caused

213
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,930
the Toledo water system to

214
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,940
completely shut down
for three days.

215
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,320
So this left 0.5 million

216
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,720
people without a source
of drinking water or

217
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,625
sanitation for three days because

218
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,830
there was simply so much
contamination in the water,

219
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,265
it could not be
cleaned effectively.

220
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:15,380
Finally, we can think of
physical hazards in water.

221
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,450
So I mentioned earlier we
might be concerned about

222
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,105
suspended sediments
or organic material.

223
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:21,980
Those things are
primarily going to affect

224
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,080
the appearance and the physical
properties of the water,

225
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,970
they're not necessarily
harmful for us.

226
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,025
So I already mentioned
rust particles and

227
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:31,475
iron and tap water after
fire hydrant cleaning.

228
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,380
There's also issues
with temperature

229
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,790
though, particularly
high temperature.

230
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,120
So industry and energy
creation processes will

231
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,040
often emit high
temperature water that

232
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,580
can be quite harmful
to the environment.

233
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,260
Finally, we can think
of radiological agents.

234
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,910
So it's possible that near for

235
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,145
example areas where
we're mining uranium

236
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,140
or radium that there
might be contamination

237
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,385
of water from those
mining activities,

238
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,140
and of course medical waste often

239
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,270
contains radionuclides
as well and

240
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,150
so contamination from
medical waste can

241
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,125
be a water concern also.

242
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,180
Let's wrap up by talking
about the agencies that are

243
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,760
responsible for regulating
water contaminants.

244
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,870
Here in the United States,

245
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,580
the Public Health
Service established

246
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,230
the very first
drinking-water standard all

247
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,285
the way back in 1914.

248
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:18,235
If we fast-forward to
1974, 60 years later,

249
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:21,110
the EPA was given the
authority to bring basically

250
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,670
all drinking-water
standards under

251
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,260
their jurisdiction as part

252
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,155
of the Safe Drinking Water Act.

253
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:28,970
This act basically made
the EPA responsible for

254
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,850
identifying and regulating
contaminants in the water.

255
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,470
They set two limits.

256
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,290
They have one called a maximum
contaminant level goal,

257
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,275
and the second called a
maximum contaminant level.

258
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:40,790
The difference
between these two is

259
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,010
the maximum contaminant
level goal is

260
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,020
basically the level that
the EPA thinks will

261
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,285
cause no health
effects in anybody.

262
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:48,920
The maximum contaminant level is

263
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,910
actually the limit
that's enforced and

264
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,225
that's set as close as feasibly
possible to that goal.

265
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:58,530
Around the world, we have the
World Health Organization.

266
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,620
So they published the first
international standards

267
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,870
for drinking water back in 1958.

268
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,730
They continue to
publish guidelines for

269
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,065
drinking water quality and

270
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:07,820
these address things
like health targets,

271
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,855
what we should aim for,

272
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,700
how you assess a
drinking water system,

273
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,545
how you would monitor
its operation

274
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,435
and other key characteristics,

275
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:16,310
and they recommend
guideline values

276
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,135
for specific types
of contaminants.

277
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,770
Finally, I'll end by showing you

278
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,660
an abbreviated list
here of some of

279
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,650
the chemicals that are
regulated in water.

280
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,470
I don't want to get into
the individual ones

281
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,730
though if you scan
that list you'll

282
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,380
probably recognize
at least some of

283
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,300
the titles or names
of those chemicals.

284
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,550
I do want to highlight
that at least 25 of

285
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,030
the chemical hazards on
this list are carcinogenic.

286
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,340
So again, water is key to life.

287
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,350
We have to ingest
it to stay alive,

288
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,850
but we certainly want
to make sure that

289
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,980
the water we're drinking
is clean and does

290
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,870
not have excessive concentrations

291
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,200
of potentially harmful hazards.
