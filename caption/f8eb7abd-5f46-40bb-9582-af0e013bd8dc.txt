00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello and welcome to the Epidemiology Department, my module series.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:12,120
My name is Matt Buxton and I am a faculty member in the Epidemiology Department.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:20,650
In this unit, we will walk through the steps of calculating the Spearman's rank correlation.

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,700
Outdoor correlation measures are generally calculated using our statistical program.

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:37,480
Completing an example will allow you to understand and appreciate the format of the data and the steps involved.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,790
By the end of this unit, you will be able to list the steps needed to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation.

7
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,450
And you will also know how to calculate disbursements rent correlation using actual data.

8
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,120
As a recap about the different types of correlation measures,

9
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:13,440
the Pearson correlation allows us to evaluate linear relationships between two continuous variables.

10
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:26,240
The Pearson correlation is an ideal choice when you have continuous data for power variables and the relationship follows a straight line.

11
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,950
On the other hand, the Spearman rank correlation.

12
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,510
It's a non parametric eternity to the Pearson correlation.

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,660
The calculation is based on the ranked values of each variable rather than the raw data.

14
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,400
And this you have an opportunity to see as we walked through the example.

15
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,329
So you might be wondering which situations would it be appropriate to use?

16
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,810
Experience correlation. Let's go over a few instances.

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:19,560
You should use the Spearman's rank correlation if you have continuous data and the relationship between the data that the data,

18
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,100
if they don't do not follow a straight line or where the relationship between the variables is not linear.

19
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:35,690
You can also use the Spearman's rank correlation for data that are not normally distributed.

20
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:46,310
Additionally, you can use the Spearman's rank correlation for data to have a monotonic relationship.

21
00:02:48,290 --> 00:03:00,020
In monotonic relationships as one variable increases, the other verb tends to either increase or decrease, but not necessarily in a straight line.

22
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,740
Spearman's Correlation allows you to say to fit curvilinear relationships.

23
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,030
However, there must be a tendency to change in a particular direction.

24
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,290
So if you have a monotonic relationship or a situation where as X gets larger,

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:30,460
Y gets larger and then gets smaller or something that's more complicated, you should not use a Spearman's rank correlation.

26
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,600
You can also use experiments rank correlation for ordinal data.

27
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:51,680
Ordinal data are categorical data that have natural order categories, but the distances between the categories, they are not established.

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:04,390
One example could be when you have socioeconomic status classified as low, medium or high.

29
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,300
So you have three categories. There's some sort of ordering, but it's not so clear.

30
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,480
Well, what's the difference between low and medium?

31
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,060
Or what's the difference between low and high?

32
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:37,600
So now we will review the steps needed to calculate disparities in correlation and then follow that by going through an example.

33
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:48,790
So the first step, you want to generate a table that includes the observations for the variables that you would like to evaluate.

34
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,990
The second step is then you will assign a rank to each observation for each variable.

35
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:03,130
After that, you will calculate the difference in rank for each pair of observations.

36
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,919
Then you'll calculate D Square by squaring the value of each difference.

37
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,430
And in this case it's going to be the value of D that you're going to square.

38
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:26,750
Then you calculate the sum of the square, and then the final step will be you will use the different variables that you've calculated,

39
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:38,180
using the steps to calculate Spearman's rank correlation to then plug those values into the experiments rank correlation coefficient formula.

40
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,080
So the formula for Spearman's rank correlation is real.

41
00:05:47,110 --> 00:06:01,960
That strange looking P is what is called rule so as equals to one minus six and the summation of D squared divided by end times and square minus one.

42
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:12,589
So Raul, as I said, is the how Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is represented and then and is the number

43
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:19,190
of data pairs and D square is the square of the difference in ranks for each data pair.

44
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,589
So let's see and ticket look at an example and then hopefully these definitions will,

45
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,290
will, will make will become clearer as we go through the example.

46
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,300
So we have a question here. For example,

47
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:54,150
a cohort study was conducted to understand cytokine patterns over time among people who previously had COVID 19 or severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.

48
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:04,710
The table below contains the value of cytokines interleukin one A and interleukin one B from ten monthly visits.

49
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:15,660
Interleukin one A Interleukin one B are pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are key factors in immune response.

50
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,620
So we need to find a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the two cytokines.

51
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:35,220
In other words, the question is asking if the values from Sarah visits for I'll want a are correlated with the cytokine values for won't be.

52
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:44,760
So we have our table. The table has decided, guys, and then the value for each visit and you see we have up to ten visits.

53
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,769
So on this slide, we have our table just to remind us of the values,

54
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:59,999
and we have a visual that we can track and then followed by that we have the

55
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,409
different variables that we need to calculate in order to calculate experiments.

56
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:18,860
Rank correlation. So firstly you will see in the red text box we have aisle one in in order of rank.

57
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:26,630
So we are ranking the values based on our smallest or largest.

58
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,560
So if you look, you will see that visit one file, one has been assigned a rank of one.

59
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:42,860
And this is because the value for visit one is the lowest among the ten cytokine visits for aisle one eight.

60
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,590
If you notice, you will also see that the value for visit two has been assigned a rank of two.

61
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:59,870
And this is because 39.87 is the second lowest value file one e.

62
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:12,260
And then if you look all the way to the extreme for visit ten, visit ten is the highest value file one A and that has been assigned of a rank of ten.

63
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,389
So don't confuse visit ten. And having this being ten, it just happens that this ten has the highest value.

64
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:33,680
So it has been assigned a rank of ten. Next, we will do likewise for our one B, where it will audit the values according to the rank.

65
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,550
So it would be the lowest to the highest.

66
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:47,269
So in this case, visit eight, file one B happens to be the lowest value file won't be.

67
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,210
So it has been assigned a rank of one.

68
00:09:51,190 --> 00:10:02,259
And then on the extreme end, we have a visit, one that has been assigned a value of ten, because if you look across this table,

69
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:13,390
four out one B, you'll see this it one has a value of 102.43, which is the highest value for I'll one B.

70
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:18,500
Now followed by that we have the difference in rank.

71
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:26,270
The difference in rank here is you subtract the difference in rank between I want A and I'll one B.

72
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:37,040
So for example, visit one, we have one minus ten and that gives us a value of minus nine for visit five,

73
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:45,110
we have a value of three file one eight as the rank and then a value of seven for the rank file won't be.

74
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:54,020
So for that the difference in rank would be minus four and similarly apply to the other pairs of values.

75
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:01,880
And then finally we have a square for each of the difference in rank.

76
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,140
So for visit one we had minus nine.

77
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:13,399
If you squared that, you get 81 for visit three, you have a difference in rank of five.

78
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
If you square that, you get zero.

79
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:26,990
And then the last step before we get to actually calculating the disappearance rank correlation is that we calculate the sum of De Square.

80
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:36,950
And so if you add up these numbers in the square row, you will see that the value will be 272.

81
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:45,020
So from there we can go ahead and use the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient

82
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:52,700
formula and as a reminder is row and that is equals to one minus six times

83
00:11:52,700 --> 00:12:00,160
the square of D square in this case revised to 72 divided by in which is the the

84
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:08,690
most there's times in square minus one so we plug the values in the formula.

85
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:17,060
We have one minus six times 272 divided by ten times ten square minus one.

86
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:26,090
So with that, if you calculate that, you get one -1632 divided by 990,

87
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:43,280
and then you'll find this step would be one -1.6485 giving you all Spearman's rank correlation coefficient value of -0.685.

88
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,140
So now, now we've gone through the steps of arranging the data and calculating the Spearman's correlation.

89
00:12:53,890 --> 00:13:00,490
Let's take it to another step to interpret this Spearman's correlation.

90
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:13,780
So to interpret the calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or row of -0.6485.

91
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,840
We know that the negative side.

92
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:31,040
Indicates that the cytokines inversely correlated in a magnitude of 0.65 means a moderate correlation between the two cytokines.

93
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:39,410
So in other words, when one cytokine value goes up, the other cytokine value goes down.

94
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:53,780
So in this unit we have covered an example of how to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation using epidemiologic data.

95
00:13:54,650 --> 00:14:03,260
The steps covered here allow for fuller appreciation of how data are used to calculate

96
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:10,459
the Spearman's rank correlation and a better understanding of how to interpret the data.

97
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:19,100
Because now you understand that what we actually are looking at, we are using ranks to assign to the values for each cytokine.

98
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,080
