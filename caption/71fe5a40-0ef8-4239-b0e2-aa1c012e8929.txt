1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:22,000
how you can

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,500
catch you.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,960
thank you.

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,340
okay. hi everyone. we're gonna send the time

5
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,560
we have left. take a look summer.

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,420
hey Dave I wanna come up and lecture.

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,440
I I was enjoying this

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,639
alright I I'm gonna try make it not too painful. look moving

9
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:06,639
along. alright. so I believe we

10
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:22,099
had just done weekly work study with that

11
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:27,819
right we've done the study and we had decided

12
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:33,399
that when you had a ordinal independent variable different levels

13
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,999
of exposure but not not done it's continuous

14
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:45,039
done is four different groups that you could do something like man tell extension test

15
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:50,739
and get it squared her back out extension test to see whether or not there was

16
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:55,759
evidence of the trend across the different levels alright.

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,773
this is another example same idea

18
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:05,773
although there is one difference. this says is risk of my cardio and faction associate with

19
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:12,193
intensity of nitroglycerin exposure. nine low medium height in case people are interested

20
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:31,033
workers that are involved with making explosives and have

21
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:37,993
time alright

22
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:50,853
sure what happened.

23
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:55,993
okay. as I was saying workers that are involved with making explosives may get

24
00:02:55,993 --> 00:03:01,351
significant exposure to nitroglycerin which you may do you where is something that people can use

25
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:06,431
to when they have angina when I have a heart disease

26
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:11,591
related chest pain but there is an issue with if you have ongoing exposure

27
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:17,491
to it then you can actually have a problem

28
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:22,591
moved from the exposure. so in fact these workers can't be at increased risk for cardiac disease

29
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:27,711
just case you're interested and so the define

30
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:33,591
variable course of is

31
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:38,631
is dichotomy Cardenas binary. the independent variable is

32
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:43,971
that intensity not done as numbers but is non- low medium or high.

33
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:51,431
so that again is an example

34
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:59,281
of hard no variable and again in this case there's no potential compound

35
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:04,381
so the only difference here is we have no numbers whatsoever data test

36
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:09,421
non- load medium or high might be like a judgment that was made by say industrial hygienist

37
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:15,461
going through the facility or something we don't know if it's based on numbers and

38
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:21,341
statistical method by before with test returned

39
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:26,581
and high sperm and filters for Tran and there

40
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:32,401
is no actual measure of association. basically answer the question is there statistically

41
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:38,021
significant evidence for Trent or is there not. you don't really get

42
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:43,141
something like that. now wanna show you something I was trying to talk

43
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:48,281
about last time but I've

44
00:04:48,281 --> 00:05:01,629
got a clear way showing it here

45
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:06,849
okay. so if you look at this here. um

46
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:12,089
we got four different cases for different theoretical cases where you got low moderate

47
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:17,529
high and extreme exposure to asbestos so you know which

48
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:22,789
here in in order you know which one tired and the next one. but you don't have any numbers to go with it.

49
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:28,229
and here's an example where if you look at the fraction of

50
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:33,729
people that end up dying from this message related disease based on whether their job is classified

51
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:40,649
as having low versus moderate versus high versus extreme exposure to asbestos.

52
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:45,769
you see that in the lowest group. seventeen percent. died from asbestos related

53
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:51,029
diseases. the next moderate group twelve percent and then it jumps up to forty percent

54
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:56,629
for high and various trends for extreme very high seventy six percent

55
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:01,809
so this is done on purpose because you don't always get a perfect mono tonic relationship

56
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:06,809
or it always steps up. so he might say well the seventeen and twelve are not consistent with each other

57
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:11,909
but he sort of take a step back and look at the big picture here would tell me

58
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:17,249
when most of you agreed. this seems to indicate a trend where the higher exposure

59
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:22,489
on average the highest your exposure to asbestos is more likely you are die to from what known

60
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:27,749
this message is related diseases there everyone comfortable with thing that.

61
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:33,709
okay. so if you do test trend it'll be

62
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:38,995
quite significant. if you did a if you treated this like

63
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:44,035
it was that this was four by two table these numbers and

64
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:49,215
so just deduct type square with three degrees of freedom with this much variation

65
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:55,055
you will probably still say it's significant but it's not necessarily a sensitive test

66
00:06:55,055 --> 00:07:00,255
for what you're interested in which is whether there's a trend of increasing.

67
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:05,295
so I'm saying probably the other kind of square and you know because you got for example seventy six percent

68
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:10,455
versus twelve percent is probably gonna you know it will be significant because that's they're quite

69
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:16,715
different ratios. so let's look at two other examples here.

70
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:22,035
so in this example case to the main dwelling.

71
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:27,095
can you first [INAUDIBLE] you read the number from back there. I hope everyone's

72
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:32,115
drifted the back over time. I've noticed this. okay.

73
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:37,455
so if you look at this one. I'm at

74
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:42,694
I mean how many people in the room look at those numbers for low moderate high and extreme which

75
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:47,874
say hey this looks like there's an expected trend

76
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:53,614
higher reported group with the higher exposures

77
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:59,474
they go fire tend to have a greater risk of death from asbestos related diseases.

78
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:08,534
any anyone agree with that statement. anyone disagree with that statement.

79
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:13,574
okay. so I'm hoping you would look at that and say the lowest

80
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:18,594
exposure. thirty eight percent direct extreme exposure only forty percent diet it's

81
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:23,674
only two percent different and even though I and the moderate is quite

82
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:29,114
a bit lower than the low. and yeah the highest the highest number there

83
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:34,118
but it doesn't really look like a very good pattern tracks right now

84
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:39,258
in this situation if you do test a for Tran. probably reject it. os eight now. it's not

85
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:44,738
significant there's not a significant track. but if you did if you ignored that it was ordinal

86
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:49,918
and you did a regular four by two table Chi square with three degrees of freedom.

87
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:55,018
that's seventy three percent is quite different than twenty percent et cetera.

88
00:08:55,018 --> 00:09:00,558
probably say yeah this is statistically significant so this is a case where by ignoring the trend.

89
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:05,718
you go from and handle see a real trends is just getting a result like well yeah

90
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:11,638
they're different from each other. alright. versus case three here

91
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:16,938
where what you noticed is that there all these are pretty close

92
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:21,998
to each other. the variation is only from twenty percent I know the stresses related diseases to thirty one

93
00:09:21,998 --> 00:09:27,178
percent. but there's a perfect trend in terms of its steps

94
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:32,338
up with each category. right now for in that situation if you do a mental hassle

95
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:37,380
test for Tran with as many people as there are in the study if these kinds

96
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,440
of numbers it would probably date. yes this is a significant trend even

97
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,720
though it's not a very steep one whereas if you do you ignore to

98
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,840
ignore the fact that these are not up and just say hey. I'm doing a regular

99
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,180
password to see if any of these groups are different from each other. it's likely that back I swear is gonna reject

100
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,220
it and say now because are still close to each other probably.. it's not statistically significant. so

101
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,340
the idea between case too in case tree was to try to convince you that it makes sense have to you

102
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,760
do a different analysis. if you have a ordinal variable as your exposure measured

103
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,900
to decide whether or not you're seeing it affect you expect from are no variable if it's a real

104
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:31,220
attack. okay. alright.

105
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,720
Charlotte study nine eight which says the risk of heart disease associate with years of arsenic

106
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,218
exposure the continuous variable so course risk of heart disease if you have it if you don't

107
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:48,838
talk to mask and years of arsenic exposure is continuous

108
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:53,998
interval right being treated as such and course

109
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:59,278
there are not founders match now you know up to the ninth

110
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,498
kind of study. alright.

111
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:09,978
we haven't seen this pattern before. although a couple of you have remarked on

112
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:14,998
a pattern like this and what you might want to use it for analysis. so is

113
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:20,438
there anyone is be willing to tell me what they think would be an appropriate statistical method.

114
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:25,598
when I say we haven't seen a pattern like this we haven't had a binary [INAUDIBLE] on with outcome for the independent

115
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:30,698
variable of interest was in vote was actually continuous all those. so the first time

116
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:35,778
we've done like in this going through these pages of this alright.

117
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:41,666
so invite anybody tell me what they think with you know appropriate

118
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:46,846
method to analyze this for example how many people

119
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:51,866
think that linear regression model would be would work okay and would

120
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:58,966
be adequate. you're going to grass the

121
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:04,386
years of arsenic exposure against the probability of developing heart disease.

122
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:09,906
would it be a probability right. you think that would be a good thing to put in a linear regression model.

123
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:15,006
any series on that. okay. see people shaking their head

124
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:30,626
which I agree with them willing I'm to say why they think it's a bad idea.

125
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:37,626
okay. yeah I'm gonna go a little bit more her answer. that's okay

126
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:43,546
seven twenty eight per train Roxanna Marino and all down. alright. so right

127
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:49,146
so it's probably not gonna be a linear relationship when you're looking at a probability

128
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:54,306
of a binary I'll come back out and about com and as a matter of fact there's a potential big problem

129
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:59,926
with that because in recent. you know you you you know when you're model

130
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:04,926
eight. the results could take on any value but here that

131
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:09,926
you're trying to see. look at probability only want results are between zero and one.

132
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:15,050
right zero it no chance wanted hundred percent chance and things like

133
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,290
point five fifty percent probability. so linear model is not

134
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,490
gonna work well for you. so they wanna know a different kind of model that might work for you.

135
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,730
I'm sure I know some units knows no one wants to speak. alright. I

136
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,830
just give out. so this is

137
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,370
this is actually welcome hard to know in general but it's important. if you have an interest in environmental

138
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,610
and occupational health and the studies people do in interpreting those epidemiologic study. because

139
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,810
this is quite frequent actually that someone studying eight .com .com Deedee

140
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,050
you got the disease you didn't you died from the disease or you didn't and they're looking

141
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,170
and the main exposure they're worried about. it's measured can add on an interval

142
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,310
continuously. so that's a very common situation that comes out in these

143
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,370
kinds of studies and so what people usually do is

144
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,403
what's called in unconditional logistic regression it's

145
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:23,923
Alex playing. I'll come back to the unconditional partner and I mean if I forget what it's logistic

146
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:29,703
regression. also oh and I wanna show you got this very interesting

147
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:46,163
different. thank you for enough.

148
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:51,263
well that can work for some reason I could fix that for you but we're gonna look at something and then anyway. so

149
00:14:51,263 --> 00:15:07,783
anyway there's something called maximum likelihood estimate and for measure of association.

150
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:13,063
typical thing you again would be an odds ratio. okay. if you have a standard

151
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:18,213
logistic regression model. you usually can't directly estimate the risk

152
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:23,253
ratio that you get now ratio which is what you'd expect something for had

153
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:29,993
talked to myself com right. ratio. okay. so

154
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:35,033
here's a here's another example is the risk

155
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:40,273
of heart disease so that's the DICOM .com associate with years of arsenic exposure

156
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:45,393
is a continuous variable while controlling both your gender and blood pressure because

157
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:50,653
you know other things when you call nine at harvest risk and women for heart disease and

158
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:56,653
clearly people hypertension are at higher risk and people have that are normal ten don't have high blood pressure.

159
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:01,793
alright so in that case you got the die hard

160
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:06,893
without and you have interval independent variable that you also have some

161
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:12,193
potential confound is one of which is dark on this release for trains that gender and the others

162
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:17,237
interval but pressure to take on any various guidance right and

163
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:23,017
so the method

164
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:29,897
is still the same unconditional logistic regression I'll tell you I gonna say this in case I forget later.

165
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:35,097
when you do a study that where you tried to control for confounding

166
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:40,377
in the study design by doing what's called matching. so say in the study

167
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:45,437
I'm worried about whether people having diabetes or not having diabetes is

168
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:50,697
a risk factor that's gonna confound the relationship on trying to look at. so what I'm gonna do

169
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:56,497
is every time I have a person who has um

170
00:16:56,497 --> 00:17:02,057
hi well whoever has the heart disease. if that person 's diabetic.

171
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:07,457
I'm gonna take comparison person she doesn't have heart disease but is also diabetic

172
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:12,617
and a person with heart disease non- diabetic kind of like a non- diabetic person

173
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:17,857
so that that. so you're matching on some extra variable and how

174
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:23,229
you choose people and when you do matching like that. you have to do is call conditional

175
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:32,529
logistic regression. so we won't go into it too much more. alright. that's eight

176
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:37,869
yeah so this is what you're supposed to say the maximum likelihood estimator is minus two times the natural

177
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:43,909
logarithm of al one divided by else to explain what that means in just a second.

178
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:49,149
and again it's an odds ratio and got to do conference

179
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:54,269
before says you could this could also be used exposures

180
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:59,369
dichotomies and confound is either ordinal interval. so you could

181
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:04,389
do it because you for example a of interval compound you probably

182
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:09,629
still wanna do just a progression model. even sometimes with the exposure

183
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:15,289
of interest with dichotomies is binary. alright so

184
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:22,553
go dear

185
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:27,913
so tell me how people are taking have taken epidemiology

186
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:36,453
cars it's covered linear logistic regression model.

187
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:41,913
just okay. where in you only Wayne come up and do.

188
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:46,933
alright. so whenever you basically typically use them

189
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:52,113
when we have a dichotomy without binary com and a variable which is interval

190
00:18:52,113 --> 00:18:57,433
and any type of confounded now. see you see this part here

191
00:18:57,433 --> 00:19:02,713
in parentheses. that's what usually on the right side. if you have a linear model. you got

192
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:08,353
Y equals. I also would be like the wide intercept

193
00:19:08,353 --> 00:19:14,133
but they do one next one might be the exposure of interesting. you have all these other

194
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:19,193
factors that you put in the same model that might be potential confound if you're trying to adjust for. so

195
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:24,307
that a linear model. you would just have why I'm outside and just

196
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:29,387
what's inside the premises on the other side. okay. bye.

197
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:34,487
we've got a different model here we've got a probability of why which still probabilities or by

198
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:39,687
definition pounded by zero one one right. you can't have a negative probability or something

199
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:45,107
you can have a probability greater than one greater than a hundred percent. alright.

200
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:50,167
and um when you take. so this says one divided by one

201
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:55,401
client i.e. which is the natural logarithms around two. seven three I'm not going

202
00:19:55,401 --> 00:20:01,301
to make something quite natural as compared all the other logarithms but

203
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:06,381
eat it and it's got nine not it's. alright let's think about this

204
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:11,441
is that um if you if you grade

205
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:16,481
any two. I really big number inside and minus

206
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:21,921
nine. basically it's it's gonna approach zero. you know there's you know

207
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:27,001
he does a minus one thousand one overeating without thousand that's very very

208
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:32,481
close to zero in terms of its value which makes so.

209
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:37,941
so if you had a very big number in here you'd have one

210
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:43,321
over one plus zero. a big number inside

211
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:48,661
the premises okay. of one five zero. so you'd have one over once so basically

212
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:53,781
it's saying it's the probabilities almost a hundred percent the

213
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:58,840
value of all these things together is very large not on the other hand I'm

214
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,061
suppose that you have a negative number here course with that negative

215
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:09,220
sign in front of it next deposit and tell you. so if you've any had negative twenty

216
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,561
thousand was that for particular person with the actual value. if you all the

217
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:19,580
factors in here added together then you have one over one flat each of the one

218
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,041
thousand two point seven three two times two point seven three thousand times

219
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:30,240
which is vanishing the close to zero. right because you got one divided by one

220
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,620
plus a huge number. so it's very close to zero. so it's impossible

221
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,000
to get a result goes below zero. it's impossible to get a result the goes above one

222
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,980
and I actually don't have it so you know the curve basically looks like that.

223
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,604
alright I'm trying to you. I was doing Mary mentioned for you. so it comes along and then it

224
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:57,784
does that and levels off again so basically there's an area in here where as

225
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:02,984
you increase the parameter changes the probability and it's bounded by

226
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:08,524
one and zero. okay. so

227
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:13,684
Janice this is like this because this model probability and

228
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:18,684
the values are restricted between zero and one with this equation. it's also turns

229
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:24,304
out that the

230
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:29,484
that the bay died. you know the words the coefficients in front of anything.

231
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:34,704
have a very simple interpretation and the natural logarithm which is

232
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:39,724
al and odds ratio equals that paid by and not. I

233
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:44,744
think I have is just a little bit below another way of saying that out

234
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:49,804
now I have it on something later. okay. and it's also it lends itself to doing

235
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:55,290
things like looking for interactions fact the modification as well just so

236
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,830
you don't need to know this but just in case you run into it. so here tomorrow I have

237
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:06,070
sometimes people write the model this way they'll say okay I'm taking everything it's under

238
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:11,330
here and I'm raising it to the minus Monterey seventy minus twenty changes to one over whatever that is.

239
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,330
so that's the same and then other thing. logistic regression some people talk about the

240
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,090
low check. so it's many with respect to the low check of the probabilities.

241
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,190
what is low which by definition it's the law that's a lot of written

242
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:33,110
on the value of the probability of the divided by the probability of ninety

243
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,750
which is scores one minus probably a disease because maybe you had you don't. so that equals

244
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,630
what you usually see on the side of the linear regression. that's why you say eight

245
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,010
logistic regression model is linear with respect to the lower check

246
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:55,090
of the probability disease you know it's just I'm hi this case if you if you run

247
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,391
across it people describe it in a different way and I just want you know the same model. just different

248
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:06,370
ways of naming it. okay. and they're not gonna go through the approval.

249
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:12,990
probably nobody like out there for that much but you can prove that

250
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,191
they're equivalent and you can also approve. okay. remember I said

251
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:23,191
here I'm gonna go back up here. the parameters

252
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:28,651
in this model have an easy interpretation of the log odds ratio for whatever that is

253
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:33,911
and that equivalent to saying that odds ratio is

254
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:39,411
either natural logarithm and Rick raised to whatever that parameter is that the same statement.

255
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:44,891
they're mathematically equivalent statement. okay. and here

256
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:50,951
I prove that that's true. where you start with what

257
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:56,100
bottle and you prove it that I was racially but either paid. we're not go gonna

258
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,140
through that either. okay. so the other part of this is interested in. again the reason

259
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,240
I put any emphasis on this is two things one it's a little bit complicated and

260
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,360
it's good to get introductions babies understand what it's about and the other is that

261
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,600
if you actually start looking at the literature you gonna very frequently see people doing logistic models because very

262
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,640
often people are using as an outcome. did you get diseases ask or did

263
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,280
you not or did you die from disease why did you not. and and meg in the neck and a half

264
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,360
fancy measures and continuous variables to protect it and soon as you have that you

265
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,200
can probably wanna do something like logistic regression. I mean there's other things to do but the most common logistics.

266
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,320
okay. so um

267
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,440
so how do we get estimate it's sort of it's sort of a weird idea if you've never heard

268
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,702
before. so what so you got the big data

269
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:59,362
that with all the values in it and for each individual and you're trying to see what's predicting

270
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:04,962
whatever the outcome status is of individual. so if you

271
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:10,082
if you had that you can you can

272
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:15,522
pick the likelihood. you can say

273
00:26:15,522 --> 00:26:20,542
okay here's what the data shows what number it should I put in

274
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:25,922
for all those different they got a bunch of different things in here and worried about several contact founders that

275
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:31,272
will maximize the likelihood that I would see exactly the date that I have

276
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:36,412
it's it sounds like you're turning things on its head basically saying okay here's what the date

277
00:26:36,412 --> 00:26:41,452
and here's what my model is what should be the value of all the betas in the model to make it

278
00:26:41,452 --> 00:26:46,592
as likely as possible that it matches with my date it now when I say likely you might say

279
00:26:46,592 --> 00:26:51,592
well it's very unlikely but it's more likely then you and the other one. so that's what it's

280
00:26:51,592 --> 00:26:57,312
doing and so the way you determine whether something

281
00:26:57,312 --> 00:27:02,372
sufficient let me show you so you got to model. so I'm writing the probably

282
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:07,652
disease because then I don't have to write all the line and then everything else. so that so that

283
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:12,892
when you're in the logistic regression model. you got two models one and alpha

284
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:17,892
beta one next one is probably your exposure of interest. they did to ask

285
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:23,092
to is a possible compound that you're adjusting for when you have one that's just

286
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:28,152
the same but there's a second compound you're adjusting for eighty three. and so if you're trying to answer

287
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:33,186
the question is it's not debated the beta tree X three. need

288
00:27:33,186 --> 00:27:38,325
to be in the model is it affecting things technical like site. you

289
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:45,166
you can do that by seeing what happens. if you remove

290
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:50,786
beta three X three. and so basically this is comparing model one

291
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:56,385
divided by model two. you know diverse and the math. when I watch it understand

292
00:27:56,385 --> 00:28:01,705
that when you do a maximum likelihood. if you wanted to decide whether

293
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:07,406
a particular variable it's actually needs to be adjusted for cost them to sounding.

294
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:12,605
you can you can do this this task to decide whether it needs be to involved or not

295
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:18,306
whether it's significant. alright. so

296
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:25,865
definitely that time.

297
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:30,936
probably. so the next time I'm gonna get up there and say anything is a week from today

298
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:36,456
and I'm gonna want to check up on that I gonna finish I'm done with logistic regression

299
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:42,096
I want I want you to know what a survival analysis model looks like and I watch you know

300
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:47,536
what cox proportional has not look like. just because you'll run into them when you read the literature

301
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:53,056
to have some sense. so we'll spend a couple minutes doing that. as not much details logistic regression

302
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:58,216
and then there was a request from one of you to get a better handle on

303
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:03,476
how one goes about making judgments about this is a well done study or poorly done study.

304
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:08,576
this is a reasonable way to analyze the data they had heard that actually there's much

305
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:13,755
better ways to analyze it. so I'm gonna probably try to come up. I'll send it to you have a time

306
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:19,396
and try to come up with probably maybe two situations. just comparing

307
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:24,755
two different studies. one of which is supposed be well done the other knots of all time we can talk about

308
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:30,261
what's wrong with the one that wasn't so well done because I was requested. hi

309
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:35,261
I look forward to hearing from the other six groups on Thursday. thank

310
00:29:35,261 --> 00:29:42,621
you
