1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,820
Okay. Let's get started. If you're looking for the handouts, they're over there.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,360
They're on that corner table if you don't have one yet. Yeah.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,610
Okay. So I have a couple of beers.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,350
Is your assignment. Okay.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,730
I'm sure I'll be back. Okay. So I have a couple of sort of quick logistical updates for today.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,510
So one is this was incorrect on the Colin slides from last class.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,740
So that said premenopausal women. But it should have said the high risk group is postmenopausal women.

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,130
That's because of the lack of estrogen and post menopause.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,200
So that it's been fixed on the slides on canvas, but not on your not on your handouts.

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,840
Okay. So the other thing is, as I've been learning,

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,230
quiz settings are totally changed over the Christmas break for reasons that I'm sure were meant intentionally to drive me nuts.

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,350
So there's a couple of things about the quizzes.

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,720
So the first thing is previously you got the correct answers automatically, but we have to manually release the correct answers.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,430
So like, for example, Andrew just released the correct answers for the full quiz now,

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,760
so you couldn't see them a few minutes ago, but if you log on now, you should see them. So we'll unlock them manually around when class starts.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,169
But it's not automatic like last time. The other thing is this question here.

17
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:30,120
If you got this question on the quiz, the wrong answer was marked as right and so it's been fixed.

18
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,840
So did anybody get like an email or tell you that their quiz score was updated?

19
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,190
Okay, cause not all of you got that.

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,510
Okay, so the I presume that now your scores are correct, but if you look and you see that this is the correct answer here.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,870
So if you got that but didn't get the points for it, then let general or or I know and we'll update your score.

22
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,690
But I think I figured out how to automatically updated in the fact that some of you got messages suggests that is the case.

23
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay. All right. So I think that's all we have for for logistics.

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:09,090
Okay. So we'll move on to. Oh, sorry. The third thing today is Food of the Day by Kenneth is recorded, so it's on canvas.

25
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,610
Part of his grade is questions and answers, which we're going to do on yellow cake.

26
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,960
So he would, I'm sure, appreciate the opportunity to answer your questions.

27
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,390
And if you have questions, of course, it's on yellow cakes. You'll get points for that. So look for that.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,390
It's posted the video is posted both on yellow cake and on gas.

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,800
So you can watch that whenever you like. And if you want to do peer review, you can.

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,830
That is due a week from today. There's no class on Monday because it's Martin Luther King Day.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,180
So we don't have class Monday or next, possibly Wednesday after today.

32
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,770
I think that's it for for logistical stuff. Okay.

33
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,370
So so full, full. It turns out, like many of the nutrients we're going to talk about, folate is not like one thing,

34
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,390
for it is a constellation of many things that are like vaguely named in ways that drive the analytical chemist to be somewhat nuts.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,620
So we'll start with the sort of major foods sources of bullets.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,980
So as I said last time, for almost all the nutrients going to talk about the highest, one is always going to be some form of like mammalian liver.

37
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,800
Right. That's the storage location for the vast majority of our of our nutrients.

38
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,600
So you can see there's a huge amount that's about half of the daily value is in beef.

39
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,560
But if you skip past beef liver, you can see almost all of the rest of these are either beans or green leafy vegetables.

40
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,180
Right. You have to go quite far down this list.

41
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,720
Think all the way down to here until you get to crab, which is sort of the next meat based product, unless I missed one in the middle here.

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:44,720
Right. So this nutrient compared to choline is much more likely to be deficient in if you're not eating a diet that is high in leafy green vegetables.

43
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:58,339
Yeah. And it's a lot easier to attain the the 44 or the drive for folate both curve supplementation reasons and for the fact that compared to choline,

44
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,200
a lot of these are like 30, 40%. One serving will be 30 or 40% of your of your daily value.

45
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay. So what is a folate? What is folate brief?

46
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,510
So I think about the notes. I realize those notes are like not as awesome as my notes from last year.

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,240
They're not as funny or clever or diagram heavy.

48
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,940
I apologize, but I did not have time to write 27 sets of notes over the ten days between Christmas break.

49
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:30,470
So what I'm going to use the lectures for is a lot of things where I'm like, Man, I really didn't I did not understand this unless I had a picture.

50
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,930
So that's what the picture is, right? So I know some of you are very good about putting pictures in the perusal notes.

51
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,670
Those are like super helpful. So just like, keep on keeping on with that.

52
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,650
There's going to be some stuff in the notes that is going to be way more detailed than I think is important.

53
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,880
There's going to be some stuff in the notes that are like not even covered because they're not as in sync with.

54
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,970
It's kind of exactly what I'm asking for. So just a second.

55
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,020
So, for example, there's this long, very confusing section about purine synthesis that I didn't even understand and I had to like Google.

56
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,520
And you'll see when I talk about hearing synthesis, I'm going to like yada, yada, yada, that whole paragraph.

57
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,470
On the other hand, there's like one line about folate supplementation, which I think is actually pretty important.

58
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:17,100
And so I'm going to spend more time on that, right? So they're not going to be as well aligned with sort of the things I think as important as in 630.

59
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,880
If you're wondering what the Venn diagram of like what's on the test, which is,

60
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,720
as you may know, my least favorite question in the world, think about the learning objectives.

61
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,400
Right? And I think one strategy that you could consider is if you're going to do the study guide things,

62
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,610
look at study guide, learning, objective intersections.

63
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,790
Right. That seems like a good study tool. Right? So if there's something on the learning objective about what are the primary dietary sources,

64
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,790
I'm pretty sure there's a study guide question that says almost the exact same thing.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,050
That would be a good way to do it.

66
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,300
The exam questions are going to be me looking at the learning objectives and thinking of how many different ways I can write the exam.

67
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,570
Okay. That was a bit of a sigh. Yeah, that was like.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,479
All right, all right. It's good. I'm glad that unlike reading your mind, I don't know what it said.

69
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,980
That was your answer. But anyways, so here is what I think. If I had the notes I would put in of like how to define what a Foley looks like.

70
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,719
So generally this is what the Foley looks like. There is this charity and group here.

71
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,270
There's amino basilicas and you know, really any of these words, there's a indeterminate number of glutamates.

72
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,469
So if you just look at this, you could figure out that that's the structure of the amino acid glutamate.

73
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,049
This part can be repeated much more times.

74
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,090
So as with most of the nutrients we're going to talk about, there's a lot of structural variation in folate.

75
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,190
Folate is not one thing quite as many different things.

76
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:39,880
And the key points of variation are going to be here whether or not there's a hydrogen group on the number five and number eight nitrogen,

77
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,440
whether or not there is a metal group on the number five or number ten nitrogen as well.

78
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,700
Right. So that's when we talk about five methyl tetrad, folate, that's what is right here.

79
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,630
And then, of course, whether or not there is a how many of the glutamate residues are.

80
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,800
All right. So if you imagine taking a bio sample and you're trying to figure out how much folate is there,

81
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,540
actually what you would be getting is a quantification of a whole variety of different combinations of these things.

82
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,780
Right. And so it's not again, not one thing, it is many things.

83
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,110
This, for example, leans forward acid. Yeah.

84
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,879
So those are the points of variation. Okay. So I'm going to go through all of these,

85
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,250
all these different points variation that's we're going to spend the first 20 minutes

86
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,879
or so of class one is what are the different variants and how they were converted?

87
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,690
What are they? What do they matter? Okay. So we'll start with folic acid versus food, folate or reduced folate.

88
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,340
I was astonished to learn like over the Christmas break that folic acid is not the sort of folate or is or is not the

89
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,620
acidifying homophobic as like with every other organic molecule glutamic acid and glutamate pork are lactate lactic acid.

90
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,709
What it is, is the oxidized versus reduced form of folic acid.

91
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,350
So if you look here, you can see there's no hydrogens on the end five and eight position.

92
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,630
So this is folic acid. So this is generally what's referred to as folic acid.

93
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,800
This is the thing that is in the supplement. So we'll be fortified foods. We're fortified with this.

94
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,460
This is the most available form and this is the most stable form.

95
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:11,180
This is also biologically inactive. Right? So this form here is what we put in food, but it is not the active form.

96
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:19,879
The first two steps of the metabolism, folic acid involve redox reactions when you're adding a hydrogen group here and adding a hydrogen group here.

97
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:27,230
So dihydrate folic acid tetrahedra folic acid, those two here are what make now what are called reduced voids.

98
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,030
Okay? And everything else that is bioactive is going to come from these reduced voids.

99
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,070
Okay? So it's very important that we can take folic acid and we can convert it back into the reduced folate.

100
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,730
Now, if you eat a food, imagine eating a beef liver, for example.

101
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,000
It's going to have all of the different combinations of these different things, right?

102
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,689
Depending on what you do with the beef liver, you're going to change the structure of some of these.

103
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,770
So some of these structures are quite labor, which means they can be broken down quite easily, for example, by cooking or by freezing and thawing.

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,890
Right. Whole Foods or steaming has minimal loss.

105
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,340
But in general, if you take a beef liver and you say sauteed it or something like that,

106
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,370
that would break down a lot of the reduced folate, whereas the folic acid, the oxidized folate would be more stable.

107
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,659
And that is one of the reasons among many why we supplement with this as opposed to,

108
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,880
say, directly supplementing with, say, five methyl, which is a reduced folate.

109
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:23,620
Okay. And so again, the difference here is you're adding the hydroxy group and as you're adding the hydrogen, you're getting rid of the double bonds.

110
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,820
Right. So it's a chemical reaction here. It's not just a change like with lactic acid, what it is.

111
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,930
And so that's what folic acid is versus everything that is not.

112
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,710
Folic acid is broadly referred to as a food folate.

113
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,060
Right. Which again also drives me nuts. Like why not be a little more specific here?

114
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,250
Okay. Is there any questions about the first part? Okay.

115
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,410
And as you might not be that surprised to learn,

116
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,920
there are people who have different activities of hour and that affects their sensitivity to various absorption thoughts.

117
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,960
Okay. No, because there's different forms of folic acid that are have different levels of bioavailability.

118
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,880
When we refer to how much folate a food has, we use dietary folate equivalent.

119
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,440
So if I go back to here, you'll notice this was not milligrams or micrograms of folate.

120
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,380
It was micrograms of dietary folate equivalents.

121
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:22,390
So what that means is because we know there's different bioavailability of different types of folate, we they have higher folic acid equivalents.

122
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:31,240
So folic acid, for example, is much more bioavailable because it's much more stable than food, folate, as in everything else.

123
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,920
So one microgram of folic acid is 1.7 microgram DfE.

124
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:42,790
So they should have been over here. So 1.7 micrograms dps of folate, whereas one microgram of food folate is one microgram.

125
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,419
If it comes with food, actually digesting with food reduces the bioavailability of the folic acid.

126
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:59,620
So if it's consumed with food and in most, most obviously fortified foods as we consume the food, then you get a little more folic acid here.

127
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:06,460
Right. So if it's with food compared to if it's in a a multivitamin or something like that, now it's two micrograms of these.

128
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,650
Yeah. Is that because of, like, other vitamins being involved like these or.

129
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,950
No, it's because it's more stable. Oh, yeah.

130
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:23,220
It's more stable and it's I tried really hard to find data on actual absorption kinetics, which I could not find.

131
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,170
So my understanding is that it's not necessarily due to the specificity of the receptor, which we'll talk about in 5 minutes.

132
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,000
It's mostly about the stability of it as it goes through the digestive processes and or cooking.

133
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,590
So this morning I had a delicious bagel for breakfast.

134
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:45,239
And if I look up bagel salt quite often when you look on yonder USDA food database, you might see full plates broken down in a way like this, right?

135
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:56,790
So food, folate. So this 29 micrograms of food, folate is how much folate was in the actual whatever bagel bagel thing.

136
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,060
Now it's fortified with folic acid because wheat is fortified with forecast.

137
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,280
Right. And so the folic acid is more of our available times 1.7 whereas the food folate two times one.

138
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:12,420
So you add the two of them up, you get 176, which I find sometimes the math doesn't always add up here, but that's why you would see food folate.

139
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,629
So if you're ever looking at a USDA food guide, which I'm presumably going to do quite often, although not today, you'd want to be clear.

140
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,880
Are we talking about folic acid or are we talking about the equivalence of the food?

141
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:28,310
Right. And RDA is are always or drives are always based on food folate equivalents.

142
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,670
Okay. So that's food folate versus folic acid.

143
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:41,870
And so you'll notice, for example, in in the canonical platonic bagel, 83% of the equivalent dfis are from fortification, right?

144
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,820
So most of the folic acid in that particular food is from fortification.

145
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:51,000
But the bagels and we have a lot of folic acid, we've added to it through food fortification programs.

146
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,310
So I want to spend probably the next 20 minutes or so talking about food fortification programs, especially around folate.

147
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,540
Now, this is going to be bringing this up early in the semester because this is going to come up a lot.

148
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,350
We're going to talk a lot about different food fortification programs, especially as they relate to global health.

149
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:12,450
So epidemiologists and nutritional scientists identified quite a long time ago that low folic acid was associated with neural tube defects.

150
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,550
We talked about neural tube defects a little bit last class.

151
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,149
And so there was a recommendation in the early 1990s that we start getting putting more folate into our foods.

152
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,610
Right, because there's too many people that were deficient in falling.

153
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,770
So what you can see, if you look at this graph here and I'm going to focus here on the black non-Hispanic sorry, the Hispanic line,

154
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:41,220
which is up here, you can see there was about nine per 10,000 live births, had some type of neural tube defect as fortification became optional.

155
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,880
So it was recommended to food manufacturers that they be fortified.

156
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,600
In this case it was wheat flour with folate.

157
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,420
You can see there was a pretty precipitous drop for those two years until it became mandatory again in wheat flour.

158
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,270
And then you can see it sort of stabilized across here. Right.

159
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,960
So that reduced neural tube defects, at least in the Hispanic population from, you know, around ten to around six.

160
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,230
Right. So, you know, a pretty, pretty reasonable reduction here.

161
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,680
This trend is generally true for for other populations as well.

162
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,140
It's actually more impressive for whatever reason in the state of Victoria, which is in Australia.

163
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,959
So you can see this was the rate of zero to defects is about the same as the states.

164
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,200
It's about eight per 10,000 live births.

165
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:28,770
They started from fortification in wheat right here in 1998 and you can see right away there was a really precipitous drop in order to defect.

166
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,239
And that's continued on. This graph ends in 2006, but it's continued on up until today.

167
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,569
So this is one of the sort of major victories of public health nutrition.

168
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,540
Right. So this is a disease that was associated with a nutrient deficiency. There was a public policy that changed something in the food supply.

169
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,260
That change in the food supply largely alleviated what was a disease.

170
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,029
Now, of course, it didn't go all the way down to zero.

171
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,830
There's other reasons why somebody might have neural tube defects, choline, B12, things like that.

172
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,400
But in terms of the folate question, this largely resolved the following question.

173
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,800
It reduced it pretty dramatically. And so this is a good example of why this happened.

174
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,839
Now, you'll notice this is largely in what we called last semester ultra processed foods, right?

175
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,600
So this is all in foods where we are, where flour was added separately.

176
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,180
This had no effect on on the and the non ultra processed food thing.

177
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,590
Okay. So what are we fortified? First of all, what is fortification versus what is enrichment?

178
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,060
So fortification is where you add something to a food that either didn't have it or didn't have enough of it.

179
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,370
So we actually natively has a little bit of folate, mostly food folate, but not that much.

180
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:35,279
So fortification is you're using wheat as a delivery vehicle to get more folate into the into the population.

181
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Right. So it's not that you took the bullets out of the wheat, you're adding it back.

182
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:44,610
That would be enrichment. Fortification is where you're like, well, this is a convenient way to get more Floyds into into people.

183
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,780
Right? And we picked wheat because many people eat a lot of wheat.

184
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,380
Right? And so especially in the 1990s before people were concerned about low carb diets and the like,

185
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,880
there was that seemed like the appropriate vehicle, at least in the US population.

186
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:05,339
For the video Dr. Anderson talked a little bit about in the US populations how we were not fortifying maize flour, right?

187
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,760
And that exacerbated the original issue that Hispanic women were already at higher risk of of neural tube defects.

188
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,540
Right. And as a generalization, Hispanic women were consuming more maize flour compared to.

189
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,779
We feel right now that's been somewhat changed.

190
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,480
And now that it is in the optional fortification for Masdar but is still not required, at least in the United States.

191
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,290
Okay. So what do we fortify in terms of foods? So right now in the U.S., these are the things that we are fortify.

192
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:37,660
And this includes both recommended and required. So you can see folate is in multiple things in our food supply.

193
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,139
Most of the rice floury grain, calcium, iron, niacin thiamin are in all of them.

194
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,860
Vitamin D is in maize, flour and rice, but not wheat flour. And then riboflavin is in wheat flour, me flour, but not race.

195
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,730
So it seems like a bit of a weird decision to make on these.

196
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:01,920
We don't fortify anything as a requirement in the US, in our oils, although other countries do, and we fortify salt with iron.

197
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:08,880
Right. And we'll talk about iodine quantum later. So that's the decisions that the Food and Drug Administration have made in the United States.

198
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,950
Things that are not fortified the United States, but are fortified somewhere else, are listed on the bottom.

199
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:21,450
So, for example, Mexico fortifies maize flour with zinc Canada fortified with vitamin B6 in wheat flour.

200
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,729
Several countries in South America is fortified with selenium and in fluoride in their foods.

201
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,980
We quite often, of course have fluoride in our water supply. Several South American countries also fortified with vitamin D.

202
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,830
So when we say food fortification, we can talk about it in the US context.

203
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,690
So this is what we do in the U.S., but it's always, not always the same across different countries.

204
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:47,160
So this is a map showing that, right? So the color as you go from yellow to green is more things that are fortified in that country.

205
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,700
Right. So, for example, the U.S. inheritable fortified 12 things are actually not the exact same things, but they do fortified 12 different things.

206
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,239
Whereas if you look down in Brazil, they fortify less things.

207
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,580
If you look in sub-Saharan Africa, there's less fortification.

208
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:06,509
And in Europe there's much less food fortification than there is in in North America, for reasons that I don't know.

209
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:12,270
But I was quite curious about Peru and sort of Western and South America tends to be at the higher end use a lot

210
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:18,690
of the things here that people are fortified that we don't fortify in in America or South American countries.

211
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,519
And a lot of those are Peru, Venezuela, Chile, countries like that.

212
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:32,179
And I don't have a good reason why. I'm trying to figure out how I want to read the question, but how what are the regulations?

213
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:39,600
And so. What was under a mandatory fortification versus option?

214
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,990
Interlink Vietnam. Sean. Yeah. I mean, that's the regulation.

215
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,280
The law, if it's mandatory, is mandatory. Right. So in the US, we have mandatory fortification of wheat flour with folate,

216
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:55,640
which means you cannot sell wheat flour without having folate unless you clearly mark that as it is un fortified flour.

217
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,770
Whereas optional is for example, b six in the US is optional.

218
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,640
And so therefore you can put it in there if you want, but you don't have to.

219
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,479
Right.

220
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,900
So I figure Cheerios has a certain number of vitamins and minerals and you don't have to add those, but they are adding it and that's their choice.

221
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,200
But if they decided to take that away, they wouldn't be breaking the law. But if.

222
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,980
Trying to think like red is a red mill who makes flour. And it was red mill.

223
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,480
Yeah. So Red Mill was like, no fault. That would be a little bit of a choice.

224
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,420
Whereas if cereals was like, no, be six, they'll be like entirely on that. Does that mean that companies at a certain level,

225
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:37,320
like if you have local people are making under a certain amount of tons are applicable or is that across the board?

226
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:44,030
It's for sale. My understanding is that has to be clearly marked as not fortified if it is doesn't meet this recommendation.

227
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,050
So for example, you can go to Whole Foods, you can buy fortified flour and people do.

228
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,050
But it has to be very clearly marked in bold on the label that it's unfortunately.

229
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,840
So like, why is like grains flour is still voluntary and we're still seeing like the industry.

230
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,910
That is an excellent question. I do not have a good picture. It should be it should be required.

231
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:09,360
The fact that it took from 1998 to 2016 to even make it optional is like crazy on its own.

232
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,320
I have no there is no good rationale for that. In fact, I think you should write your congressperson.

233
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,190
All of you should write your congressperson and say that Mayflower should be fortified and

234
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,479
pointed out that as a culture they are a little bit more suspect of supplementation and stuff.

235
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,380
So maybe. But I mean they can still make the choice to buy non fortified means flour.

236
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:34,420
Right. The question is for people who haven't learned what food, foliage and folic acid are, it's going be more convenient for them to be looked at.

237
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,589
And violence. Mm hmm. Yeah, exactly.

238
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,350
So, of course, you know, when you ask about fortified foods,

239
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,129
what we're trying to find is the thing that most people eat and put it in that thing right.

240
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:50,010
At a population level. Right. But people who are gluten sensitive aren't going to eat wheat flour or very much less likely to be flour.

241
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,499
So they are going to be more at risk, right? For sure. Right.

242
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,450
People who are on low carb diet are not consuming either grain or maize, and therefore they're also going to be at risk.

243
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,760
So they need to be getting their folate from somewhere else. Sorry.

244
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,980
Now. Go ahead. I was wondering if there's like a specific amount, hopefully that.

245
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,270
Yes, definitely. It does look like. Is there like a range or.

246
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,840
It's a. So the FDA sets a specific amount. So we're getting into the activity we're going to do in a minute.

247
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,760
But like what they would do is they'd be like the average person consumes X number of pounds of flour per day.

248
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,340
And therefore, if we add X number of grams of folate to X number of pounds, that will make them to the dry.

249
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,950
So that's how it just. Right. So you have to make some assumptions.

250
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,879
It's a pretty vague assumptions about like how much flour to eight per day I don't know what a bagel is morning.

251
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,580
So so far like most of my calories have been flour based. Right.

252
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,700
But like the other day, I had eggs, so I was like super good and coding, but I don't have a bagel.

253
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,409
Right. So but that's how they set them, right? So they and that's an important thing that we're going to get to in the activity is you

254
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:50,180
have to identify a food source that is eaten at a reasonable rate and your population.

255
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,620
Otherwise it's not going to work. Right.

256
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,440
That's why in the Hispanic population, which prefers maize flour to wheat flour, fortified wheat flour is of less benefit.

257
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,260
If you looked at a Southeast Asian population for buying any flour of any sort, it wouldn't make any sense.

258
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,380
In fact, fortifying milk in that population wouldn't make any sense. Right.

259
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,670
So in that case, you'd want to find another staple food that you can add.

260
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:16,460
In that case, most countries in Southeast Asia are fortifying rice supplies, although fully the folic acid.

261
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,210
Yeah, they'll get it the same spot. I don't know where they get it from. That's a good question.

262
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,760
Right. I mean, you can buy it. It's a pretty simple chemical to synthesize.

263
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,159
So I presume they're big chemical manufacturers that just make a bunch of it. I presume it's not extracted as chemicals go.

264
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,940
It's pretty easy to make.

265
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:36,649
But yeah, I don't think I mean, they probably have to have a like a source that is regulated and reliable, at least in the United States.

266
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:43,490
But I don't know if they like. For example, if you told me that 90% of our fortification of foods comes from Russia or

267
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,700
something like if our folic acid all came from some chemical plant in Russia,

268
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,790
I wouldn't be shocked. Right. It seems possible. I'm not trying to scare you.

269
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,570
I don't know if that's true, but I wouldn't be surprised because that would be scary.

270
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,190
Yeah, it turns out that would not be good, but yeah. And so this is just another example.

271
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:06,110
So you can see this folate here on the left. So this is fully fortification of any type across across the world using most countries, but not all.

272
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,590
It not not Russian are fortified with folate.

273
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,150
Whereas if you look at vitamin E, which is largely fortified in the form of of oils,

274
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:22,640
isn't really done at all in the Western Hemisphere, but it's done in China and Australia and Papua New Guinea.

275
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,050
I think that's probably over in the bottom, right. New Zealand maybe.

276
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,280
Is that New Zealand in a way that's kind of I don't know.

277
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,900
It's not not Canada. Let's be clear. We're not talking about Canada some not Canada countries.

278
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,229
All right. So I think as you guys have kind of guessed, there's some regional global variation here.

279
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,450
So the activity for the next 50 minutes is for you guys to go to the food fortification data,

280
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,150
which is where I got all of these data from, is this very handy global resource of who fortified what and why.

281
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,130
And I want you to pick a country. Can't be the USA. Don't all pick Canada.

282
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,100
You pick any country that you're interested in.

283
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:09,020
And I want you to both look and figure out do they qualify for it or not, and then figure out how they do it right?

284
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,200
What food did they use? And then is it required? Is it optional?

285
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:18,380
Why did they pick that food? All of that information should be on there. So if you go to this link, it's the same link on the QR code.

286
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,459
You should be able to type in the country in the top right corner and then there should

287
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,970
be a country specific page that gives you all of the sort of what they fortify,

288
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,660
how and the legal regulations for that. Right.

289
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,920
So I want you to learn about that country's fortification, figure out how they could fortify food and how they made that choice.

290
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,980
Is it required? Is an optional? And then do you have any recommendations if you are, say,

291
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,180
involved in the Public Health Nutrition Administration of that country, for example, in the US,

292
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,589
you would say, why are we not requiring fortification of maize flour would be the recommendation I would make,

293
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,360
for example, that individually or as much as groups. As groups, yeah.

294
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,430
So submit your group first so general can approve it.

295
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,140
There's two group activities that are going to be the same groups, both activities where you can submit the group and click both activities.

296
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,770
It's food, fortification and folate trap are the two activities for today.

297
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:16,950
I'm not doing anything, so I think I just had a quick question on this and I know you get your what, I was just going to make that.

298
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:32,510
So I think, you know, I learned a lot of people sort of like the landing pages and all for something.

299
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,800
So what have you can do if you want to read about a whole bunch of other things

300
00:25:39,800 --> 00:26:00,500
that you're going to get another 700 meters of clothing over the years without.

301
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:30,860
Oh, yeah, I know that. Once you get sober, James, I think like how know?

302
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:44,200
Nothing like her had invited him to the White House.

303
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:55,600
Could you. I just tell me, was that.

304
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

305
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:22,620
I don't know much like would because it's like you're saying it's not like, you know, anything that you have to go through a lot of things like that.

306
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:30,160
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

307
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:37,570
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think so.

308
00:27:37,610 --> 00:28:09,430
Yeah. No, I don't think that, you know, I, I was like, I really don't want to get involved in your crazy here.

309
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,810
Yeah. Yeah.

310
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,610
Just being with you.

311
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:30,080
Oh, I know there are a lot of mistakes that so alone could mean that I could, because it was like.

312
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,760
Well, I mean, I think when I guess I would be like, what is it?

313
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,870
Why is it? I mean, is it you shouldn't have done this?

314
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:52,370
Is it safe? I'm not really sure.

315
00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:02,030
I know that the protocol is like corporal punishment.

316
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:16,780
Right. Right. So it could be like, well, all right, there's a lot going on right now, so that probably makes you okay.

317
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:23,500
So there's something about race, things that might be about that or something.

318
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:32,750
Yeah. What did you learn?

319
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:46,530
You were pretty good, so, you know, I was like, I don't think is clear here.

320
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:58,970
The verification is you may recall, oh, well, this is including for us.

321
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,670
Like, you see that only I can go now. Yeah, I know.

322
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:12,280
That's what I'm not a normal person makes my mother.

323
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:36,860
I'm not sure if I go to the USA and then around the world about the political world, they often go out of the ground.

324
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:44,590
I mean, I don't know, like, what are we doing right now?

325
00:30:44,760 --> 00:31:00,200
Yeah. So we've not made the switch country in the world.

326
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:09,270
So we do what is right.

327
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:19,300
I know you have the opportunity to kind of make the financial choice.

328
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:25,330
So it's actually like you're trying to decide what would I recommend?

329
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:38,530
Just put it in the right order and then the House of Representatives.

330
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:57,870
Yeah. At one point, one of the things we did in terms of the role of the United States, therefore I like say, okay.

331
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:16,809
And I wasn't really going to like and it was like 250 countries.

332
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,770
You know what? They can have enough that that's the only I know.

333
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,840
You can be like it's a perfect get sort of.

334
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:34,350
I think they have other. I really know how that is over there.

335
00:32:34,680 --> 00:33:00,720
Yeah, I know. I think I mean, I think a lot of things I think it's important because I remember where you were when your years,

336
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:16,360
when you're sitting at the meeting resisting any other kind of information, I guess, you know.

337
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:26,320
And then we were talking about the reason, you know, if you scroll down, this one is really you don't see these graphs are not going up.

338
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,310
It's been about two more minutes or so.

339
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:57,120
And the reality is only that there is so much in the country, so get so crazy that I think I'm trying to change my current one.

340
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:30,030
And again, because of the fact that you can actually get one right before you got to be even bigger than the one you actually produce.

341
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,339
Okay. So let's let's spend a couple of minutes.

342
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,790
Did somebody want to report something interesting they found about their country, what country they did, sort of what they were doing?

343
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:52,980
Sort of any sort of provisional thoughts? Yeah. Uh, we compare the U.S. and the USA, and we found that the U.S.,

344
00:34:53,640 --> 00:35:07,600
the rise of the rise of its fortification is monetary about in that India is volunteer voluntary and USA is the amount of the all

345
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:21,360
for that is kind of higher than the India which uses coupons three one milligram per kilogram in India is only 0.1 0.24 less.

346
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:29,640
So yeah, the, the opportunity to take the rise is much higher than U.S. and that's where we thought.

347
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:34,560
Okay, that's right. That's all right. Any other countries?

348
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,999
Country representatives? Yep. Going to Saudi Arabia, which is voluntary.

349
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,610
But when they do supplement of wheat flour with have they do it 135% of the recommendations

350
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:55,680
where the United States is only 3% even though and we thought maybe it's because I'm not sure,

351
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,180
but it is a staple food there, so I'm not sure why.

352
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,209
So in the section on fortification opportunity,

353
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:11,040
it should say something about how many the average grams per grams of flour per day to give you a sense of like is flour the appropriate vehicle?

354
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:19,860
I think it shows all. Oh okay. Yeah. So so we don't know what they fortified so it's more then also compared to the U.S. one with them

355
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:25,590
for example so it could be they're fortified more because people in Saudi Arabia eat less flour.

356
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,600
Yeah, that's that would seem like a coherent explanation or could be they have some other reason for it is one of them.

357
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:37,319
And the rest of us think anything is really, really strange about it to keep on preaching.

358
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,510
How much flour Americans. Yes, that's correct.

359
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,800
Yeah. Okay, great. All right. So I'm going to move on.

360
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:49,260
We'll come back to an activity very much like this multiple times over the course of the semester about other fortifying things.

361
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,820
So okay, so I'm going to move on to transport metabolism.

362
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:01,079
So as I've alluded to a few times, most of the folic acid, which is the fortified form almost everywhere,

363
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,890
I presume nobody found any other non folic acid fortification.

364
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:12,570
It is already in the monarch glutamate form, which is good because the model glutamate form is generally the type that can get in or out of cells.

365
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,020
So more food for later in the poly glutamate form. Right?

366
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,799
So they have many glutamate residues. Effectively. What that does is two things.

367
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,230
It traps it inside the cell. Right.

368
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:28,440
So the analogy here would be like glucose gets trapped when it's in the cell by phosphorylation, by Google or exabytes.

369
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,960
Right. So that's one big thing. What could possibly do to me.

370
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,930
The other thing is, when it's Hollywood animated, it tends to be a better cofactor tend to bind to the enzyme more effectively.

371
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,770
Right. So that Hollywood imitation is important for getting it into keeping it in the cell

372
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,830
and then also making it a more effective cool factor for for the for the enzyme.

373
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,860
We'll talk about the folic acid is molecule admitted. So it's better absorbed.

374
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:56,669
But it needs to be it needs to add it. So you mean what that means is if we're eating food, folate, so folate from a primary food source,

375
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,130
not supplement it, it's probably in the poly glutamate form.

376
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:07,970
So the first step of the digestive process is this enzyme folate hydrolyzed, one of all, each one which removes those poly glutamates, right?

377
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:16,379
So that's secreted into our digestive tract. It breaks down the possible tamilian folate into the model glutamate form.

378
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,320
That is the form that can be absorbed into our bodies. Right.

379
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:27,150
So if you had a deficiency in ethyl H1, you would not be able to your poly contaminated folate would not be bioavailable to you.

380
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,889
Right. And there are people out there that have that.

381
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,000
And as would be surprised, they have low folate doubles in our high risk for neural tube defects.

382
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,920
Folic acid, on the other hand, is already pretty readily absorbed. It's in the monarch glutamate form.

383
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,639
Right. And then there's also folate. Derivatives that we secrete in our biol.

384
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,100
That's in another form. We'll talk about that later.

385
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:50,970
So in terms of how it gets into the cell, as with almost every nutrient we're going to talk about, it's an active transport mechanism.

386
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:59,250
It seems like the most important transporter is this transporter here, PCF, proton coupled folate transporter, also known as SLC 46,

387
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:08,729
a one which I'm assuming one is generally roughly as far as I could tell, about similar specificity to folic acid and folate.

388
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:15,000
So the reason folic acid is more bioavailable is not because it's a better log in CFT, it's because it's more stable.

389
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,120
On the other hand, the other important transporter in the entire site is called the reduced fully carrier.

390
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:27,270
So whereas this will deal with folic acid, this generally will only transport in VHF, right?

391
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:37,140
So once you've already gone through the FA dependent metabolism that can get in or out of the cell through the through the reduced folate transporter,

392
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,120
it tends to work a little bit better for the metal and formal version of folic at work on all of them.

393
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,409
The CFT tends to work best at lower pages, right?

394
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:51,690
Which is convenient because after you go through the stomach, the page of the kind is going to be quite a bit lower.

395
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,370
But again, you can imagine a scenario where people who have elevated in their gut because

396
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,269
they're saying taking some sort of antacid might have reduced folate uptick.

397
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:06,090
Right. That's less clear for folic acid deficiency as it is going to be for B12, which is the next lecture.

398
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,500
There's a third set of transporters here, MRP, multi-drug resistant proteins.

399
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,130
MRP three seems to play a pretty big role in Efflux as well at the level of the entire site.

400
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,920
So that's how we get it into our bodies. The most important thing is, is PFG.

401
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,320
And as you can imagine, there are people out there who are PCF T mutations.

402
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:30,120
They basically cannot absorb folate, so they need ID folate to survive.

403
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,170
And there are neurological and blood disorder, defects, anemia,

404
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,510
all the sort of one carbon metabolism defects that are going to be consistent through this in the next two units.

405
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,340
Yeah. Okay. So we've talked a little bit about here.

406
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,850
These were the first couple of steps of of folate metabolism.

407
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,090
The next few steps are now going to take the reduced folate.

408
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:58,080
So the t h up and it's going to further modify it by affecting the methylation at these various sites here.

409
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,389
Okay. So we're going to go through all of these as an example,

410
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:09,930
but the difference between all of these is differential methylation at different points, but they're all to have to have derivatives.

411
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,220
It turns out there's three bioactive forms of reduced folate.

412
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:25,470
Ten, five, ten methylene is important for cimetidine synthesis B for me, ten for me, for multi is important for pairing biosynthesis.

413
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,629
And then the five methyl THC, which is right here, is the one that we've been talking about.

414
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,660
That's important for regeneration of Sam from homocysteine.

415
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,590
All right. And we'll go through all of these in the next few slides. Okay.

416
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:45,870
So once you've reduced your folic acid into THC and potentially modified it into methyl hoy or something else by the bar,

417
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,280
you're going to transport it to other cells. So in other cells, not the entire site.

418
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:55,440
Now we're at a neutral page. So it seems like the most important transporters are now going to be the reduced

419
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,460
fully carrier and another receptor which is called the folate receptor.

420
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,420
So RF key is pretty straightforward. It's an anti transporter.

421
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,690
It transports every phosphate for every folate that it brings in.

422
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,550
Now, the folate receptor works differently. What the folate receptor does and I couldn't find a great image.

423
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,320
Four. This is a bullet receptor, binds it on the outside of the cell.

424
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,560
Then the whole receptor is internalized inside the cell.

425
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:26,730
Right. So that's kind of like how the LDL receptor work, right? The LDL receptor bound LDL particles and the whole thing gets internalized, right?

426
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,659
So then it gets internalized. You have internalized fully, that gets acidified.

427
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,100
And then PCP is important for getting the folate that both of them are required.

428
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,000
There isn't a clear deficiency that I've seen with folate receptor alpha,

429
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,640
but the reason folate receptor alpha there's so much interest in this is because cancer cells use a lot of folate.

430
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:52,500
Cancer cells have a lot of folate receptor alpha. So some chemotherapeutic drugs take folate and then attack a cell killing chemical to it.

431
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:57,090
So then that's a way to get delivery in specifically the cancer cells of the

432
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:00,899
sort of cytotoxic moiety that then gets dissociated and kills the cancer cells.

433
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:08,070
Right. So far Alpha has in a lot of research on it in terms of cancer treatment, but it's not 100% clear that if you have deficiencies in after alpha,

434
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:15,660
you're necessarily going to systematic folate because they're still RC, which probably does most of the most of the work.

435
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,090
Okay. In terms of storage and excretion, we don't really have storage most.

436
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,900
The organ that has the most of it is the liver. We have about four months worth of folate.

437
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,879
If you're going to fully reduce die, it'll be completely gone in about four months.

438
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,990
That's largely just like calling because we've quite efficient renal resorption.

439
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,360
So our kidneys, if they're functioning properly, are going to find the void and keep keeping it in our bloodstream.

440
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:43,860
About 100 micrograms per day is secreted into bile and then that is largely reabsorbed back in the intestine.

441
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,670
Right. So we have efficient resorption of the kidneys and also efficient reabsorption.

442
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:54,450
This is similar to what we talked about in terms of bile. So it's very bile saltier kicked out and they're generally reasonably efficiently resolved.

443
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,549
Right. If either of those processes didn't work, we would be at high risk for some of this without a gallbladder.

444
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,480
So they're just kind of bile constantly potentially going through morphology.

445
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,750
Can they be pretty absorbing blasphemy, absorbing more?

446
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,450
That's a good question. So I looked into I looked in the first half of that question,

447
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:16,020
I couldn't find any evidence on whether people like whether the folate secretion in the absence of a gallbladder is the same as bile faults.

448
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,260
As far as I could tell, nobody's been locked into that. And so then the second question, certainly nobody's looking.

449
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:26,190
Yeah, okay. So like I said, there's different structural forms here.

450
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,340
So the key thing after we've done the reduction of folios here are what are the chemical modifications at these two positions?

451
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,510
So number five and number ten amino positions.

452
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,400
And depending on what you put there, you can have different types of folate.

453
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,960
So for example, if you have a methyl group on the number five position here, you have five methyl.

454
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,370
When it's a hydrogen, that just means that there's nothing, right? So that's five methyl.

455
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:57,800
If you had a methylene group, which is a group that connects the two here now you would have methylene five, ten methylene, right?

456
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:05,010
You had a formal groups on either the five or the ten, right? So there's a lot of heterogeneity and that's what dictates how they work as as cofactor.

457
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,540
So generally there's one carbon group added that methyl group that carbon is the thing

458
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,469
that gets donated as part of its role as a cofactor and then they can be recycled.

459
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:21,060
So as a general rule, you might add the metal group here make methyl to use that methyl to as a cool factor that takes that methyl group in,

460
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,370
say, for example, passes it along to homocysteine and then you can recycle and make the methyl trough all over again.

461
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,389
All right. So that's what the cyclical part about. And as I talked about,

462
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:36,840
the number of tails also varies generally intracellular you have more improves tissue retention and improves its role as a cofactor.

463
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:43,050
So again, just as an example of what this might look like, this is the five and the ten position here.

464
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:48,240
This is a methylene group. So this would be a metal group with two hydrogens and it's bonded with the five and the ten.

465
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,090
When you go through and a far what you're doing is you're taking the methylene group and you're converting it to a metal group.

466
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,820
So make a metal group here and a hydrogen there. Right.

467
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,349
So what any of the inner conversions, you'd be converting one of these back to the other thing.

468
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,059
Right. And so I found this really in like I feel like I'm pretty good at structural biochemistry.

469
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,880
I found this like really hard to interpret from the readings. So I think hopefully this helps clarify what we mean by the different structures.

470
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:18,290
Is there any way that they ever can go back like we were talking how they they can't go back there.

471
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,819
Yeah. So they go through they go through a pretty linear cycle.

472
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,049
So a lot of these reactions, some of these reactions, for example, here, these are these are reversible.

473
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,550
So the Met actually built this reaction here. Reversible, right.

474
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:35,100
Whereas not all of them are. So for example, this reaction here is not so it sort of depends on depends on which inner conversion happens.

475
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,930
So there's a lot of forms, right? There's a lot of different types of flags, but there's only three that are, excuse me, bioactive.

476
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,710
So 510 methylene, ten formal and five metal.

477
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:51,660
Okay. So the five metal is important for sand regeneration.

478
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:59,430
The ten floral is important for purine biosynthesis and the 510 methylene is important for the material synthesis.

479
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,380
Okay, these two here are both parts of DNA, so they're really important for DNA replication.

480
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,489
This is important for all the various methylation, all the rest of the methylation factors,

481
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,910
the same reactions that we've been talking about throughout. So.

482
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,950
Again, sort of pretty briefly, this is an example of the Middle Ages synthase.

483
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:20,090
You can see there's a methyl group that goes from the metal interior, which is right here.

484
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,690
That metal group ends up over here, right there.

485
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:31,100
And so that's how you get from your cell to commodity. And now you're left with the shaft which can get recycled back if needed for metal.

486
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:36,860
Right. So if you do not have enough for me in this process or you have some problem with any of these steps,

487
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:42,020
it's harder to make a TNP which was off to become TPI and important for nucleotides.

488
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,070
So this is the metal on issues like the one carbon.

489
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:51,940
Yeah. This is one part of the one carbon cycle. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Okay.

490
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,319
So that's one example.

491
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:01,760
So that is what's going on with them with that methylene group in the terms of the Andean iguana scenes, it's somewhat more complicated.

492
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:08,060
So this is the final form of you want to see. These two methyl groups are both added at two different steps.

493
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:15,500
Now, in the notes I posted a much long, very complicated diagram of the 11 steps of purine biosynthesis, which you do not need to know.

494
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:22,700
But the key thing is there's two methyl groups that are added. Both of those methyl groups come from ten formal of CHF.

495
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,629
FH four means the same as. All right, so in the case of Purines, which is a different type of nucleotide, you need methyl groups,

496
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,300
but they're coming from a different place are coming from the ten formal to if

497
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:37,230
not from the 510 metal VHF like for the middle questions and taking care of

498
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:43,370
purity synthesis good you can end up with gout is there that's a relationship

499
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:48,109
between like folate intake or certain kinds of filling intake or pathways,

500
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:51,610
propylene intake that then reduce your risk of ending up.

501
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,330
That's true.

502
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:57,950
So usually when you have too much periods for gout, that's because of the nucleotides that are broken down, not because of excess synthesis.

503
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:03,530
All right. And then this is the third example which we've talked about already a couple of

504
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:08,090
times in terms of metal to have is the donor for homocysteine becoming in the back.

505
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,940
Right. So if I do this intentionally, for what it's worth,

506
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,620
I'm showing you a bunch of different perspectives on that same diagram that we've been going on throughout.

507
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,010
Right. So some of them we're focusing on what happens with the 510 methylene.

508
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:25,930
Sometimes we're focusing on the five methyl two. But all three of these are important factors for four different processes, right?

509
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,850
The first two, mostly for nucleotides, the last one for all the rest of the methyl donation pathways in the body.

510
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,240
Now, this is pretty different from Colleen, right?

511
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,360
So Colleen only feeds into Sam, right?

512
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,800
Colleen does not directly feed into all of the rest of the period biosynthesis.

513
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,989
Thanks. Right. That's a quick quiz question from beginning.

514
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:50,180
So Colleen supports Sam Methylation, but Colleen does not support directly folate metabolism.

515
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,690
And we'll talk we'll talk about the indirect regulation of that next class.

516
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,980
Okay. So how is this regulated? So this is the general cycle that I've been showing.

517
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,100
So again, I've shown you this picture probably a bunch of different times,

518
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,850
but this picture is all of the stuff we've been talking about are just different turnings of the same picture, right?

519
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:12,920
They're all the same. They're all the same reactions. So most of the regulation that we think of is happening right now in terms of

520
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,850
you have sufficiency of all the rest of the cofactors are when you have excess.

521
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,280
Sam That is a allosteric inhibitor of mTOR Afar.

522
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:27,700
So what that means is as you build up enough of this, you stop sending formal groups over here, right?

523
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:38,300
So that's just a negative feedback. That means you can say of the five methyl five methylene and the voltage up for nucleotide synthesis.

524
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:44,480
Right. But on the other hand, if you need Sam, as in this number goes down, then you're going to start sending the battle groups towards the bottom.

525
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:54,709
So that's one, one major step of regulation. And then there's an inverse regulation where five methyl thc generally inhibits the SAM utilization by

526
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:59,600
inhibiting the the methyltransferase is the best example of this is the glycine methyltransferase.

527
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,610
So and again, it's working at the same point, right?

528
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:05,959
So if you have too much of this now, you're going to stop sending things through the second civil rights.

529
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,490
All those two cycles intersect at that level. Right. So they're intersecting here.

530
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:15,350
Now, you'll notice on this diagram and I've used this diagram for like many years at 630,

531
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,990
it wasn't until like yesterday I realized that that was actually wrong. That should say methylene THC.

532
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:25,910
Right? So put that down here. Right. I think hopefully that was an abbreviation, but there is no 510 methyl it's methylene.

533
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:32,210
So okay, so that's a lot of biochemistry.

534
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:39,590
So what I have for you guys now is sort of this activity that I want you guys to do in in groups, right?

535
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:47,840
So I'll given you some facts. So Sam inhibits him to Jabbar and then we already, as we talked about previously briefly, we'll talk of more next class.

536
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,200
This step here is dependent on vitamin B12.

537
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:57,410
Right? So I want you to try to walk through the logic of if you have high Sam, low sorry, low Sam,

538
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:02,210
high homocysteine or the inverse or you didn't or you had extra cooling or you got a B12 deficiency.

539
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:09,049
Given that this is the key regulation here, what would that cause in terms of the levels of this and this?

540
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:15,770
And then how would that indirectly affect. Purine biosynthesis slash the ability of Sam to perform methylation reduction.

541
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:20,180
Okay. And trust me, you probably have to draw this out to get a sense of what this is going to look like.

542
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,660
So why don't you guys try to spend about 10 minutes or so on that and then generally circulate around?

543
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,070
I realize this is a pretty complicated question, but we'll circle around in case you guys need to.

544
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:36,980
And if you didn't already submit both projects to as a group activity sent out to the jury as well.

545
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:58,620
These losing jobs created those by forcing them to them back.

546
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:17,450
And that has something to do with.

547
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:30,220
I would be proud of that.

548
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:46,780
I think it's also important that you like the women and that even if it's a very,

549
00:53:47,900 --> 00:54:06,910
very small thing because it is going to be an interesting place and I didn't really know it was going to be a good idea.

550
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,660
Well, maybe it's not writing or anything like that.

551
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:27,780
Is there anything that promotes. Yeah, because of this being an environmental field, you think that person is anybody else?

552
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:39,820
People are going to do this? Yeah. I think it's all about the end of the year.

553
00:54:41,610 --> 00:55:03,880
Yeah, definitely. The number one cause is that if there's hardly ever a job for the first time, there are.

554
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:24,809
You can have everything that happened in the first 100 days in over one time, the first one, home office.

555
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:38,980
Take it for anything. But I don't know, like what kind of.

556
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,320
You know, years.

557
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,740
I don't see why I would not have.

558
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:16,379
It was like, you know, I really don't know as I never had really good things going on with this one story.

559
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,610
I could go back.

560
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:25,370
I can go this way.

561
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:36,750
I know that they're having a mental issue. I don't know.

562
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:52,440
I don't know what to say. I don't think we would need to hold a job.

563
00:56:56,370 --> 00:57:13,740
Yes. Oh, those are my friends and family are the ones who are out of work.

564
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:18,570
I know what you're gonna do.

565
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:27,240
Okay. Oh, yeah.

566
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:57,050
You're right here. As soon as your question to you is, they're not going to say that it was that this was an action here.

567
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:12,510
We will try to downregulate the swimming or whatever, things like that.

568
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:17,770
Yeah. So what I just found out the other one family.

569
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:26,340
I don't even want to spend a few more minutes on that.

570
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:34,110
I wouldn't you know, I don't have any idea.

571
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:47,850
How do you think that schooling working right now in polling is just not going to change?

572
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:53,850
Yeah, I think yes, I think I know.

573
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,870
I know that. I'm glad you. It was a.

574
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:10,480
I used to have a nightmare, but I have no idea how it would work.

575
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:20,800
Certainly he would abide by the approval of all the European countries.

576
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:38,250
Yeah. You really don't know anything yet, but no, I don't think I can just get inside without looking like things, you know, to the the.

577
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:50,680
So I think that I would like to see more of those and I really am glad I did that.

578
00:59:51,160 --> 01:00:00,590
I don't think there is a problem with posing against each other.

579
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:12,900
Writing from a diet to make things might be able to make a reputation for being more pleasant.

580
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:18,580
Okay, so let's let's kind of hear some of your thoughts. So why don't we start with the first question?

581
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:22,780
So the one key piece of information that I sort of intentionally didn't put on this diagram,

582
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,430
but I think is is relevant to the answer is the nucleotides are being made like over here.

583
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:33,160
Right. So before the 510 double THC and the ten forming trough, which isn't shown but is right there.

584
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:39,670
Okay. So if you had high Sam, low homocysteine, what would end up happening to the folate cycle?

585
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:53,960
So if question one. If you have high Sam.

586
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:57,650
Sorry, low Sam. High homocysteine, I should either. The chip is kind of the same question.

587
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:06,850
Yeah. I would have liked the products to be the five metal that if you had higher level sample.

588
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:11,010
Right. So if you have low Sam, you're going to proceed in this direction.

589
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:18,810
Right. So that's going to have less nucleotides available, less stuff for nucleotides, but more for similar kind of methylation reactions.

590
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:22,470
Okay. And then the converse would be true if you had high. Okay.

591
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:30,850
How about calling? Did anybody get as far as calling? You have raised your hand.

592
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:38,479
So when we talked about if there's increased polling that there's increased million to

593
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:46,990
make it more Sam and then that would in turn inhibit and teach up are more to exactly.

594
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:53,450
So what Colleen can do or Betty it doesn't matter. It can conserve these things for nucleotide synthesis.

595
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,810
Right. Because it's an alternate source. Right.

596
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:01,100
So even though cooling doesn't directly affect nucleotide synthesis, it will do it indirectly.

597
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,910
Right. Because it's conserving both leaves and feelings aren't needed to make sense.

598
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:10,790
Yeah, that was that was great. Okay. Did anybody get to the actual folate trapped B12 deficiency part?

599
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:18,960
So we try to do one thing in the afternoon just before each day.

600
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:29,320
So if we have a B12 deficiency, the function of this enzyme would be disrupted and this will try folate and the level of supply from the folate.

601
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,080
And this is known as the folding strategy to transfusions. Yeah.

602
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:38,400
So why does it trapezoidal? Because we cannot move forward because NTR is not working.

603
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:41,800
Because we have got the deficiency in the complexes for this. Yeah.

604
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:44,710
So that's part of it. Right. So you get here and you can't go any farther.

605
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,910
But the other part of it is if you have less MDR, you're going to have less sound.

606
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:54,160
Yes, right. And so less Sam is going to be you're going to be pumping stuff in here, but you can't pull it out.

607
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,880
Right. So that's why it's called the mental track of the bullet trap.

608
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:03,490
So if you have a B12 deficiency, all of these methylene groups that could be used for nucleotide synthesis get stuck here.

609
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,910
Right? And they can't go back around. So they end up getting stuck here.

610
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:14,470
Right. So in the case of B12 deficiency, you end up with low Sam and you end up with low purine biosynthetic precursor ideas.

611
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:23,260
Right. So that's what's known as the Metal Trap. So that's why B12 deficiency next fast can kind of integrate both of these and is extra problematic.

612
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:26,890
Right. So that's great. Thanks to you. Okay.

613
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:34,120
All right. So physiological effects. So if you have impaired methylation, you're going to have elevated homocysteine, reduced with iron, even.

614
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:40,510
Sam, we've talked about a lot of that. The methylation reactions including amino acid, DNA, protein, biosynthesis, all of those will be disrupted.

615
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,459
If you have problems with the production of Sam, I'm going to focus more on them here.

616
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,070
DNA synthesis. So you need to make DNA.

617
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:53,650
The challenge is you need to make three 6 billion base pairs or 3 billion base pairs times two every single time you divide a cell.

618
01:03:53,860 --> 01:04:01,509
So if you're a rapidly dividing cell like a neutrophil or red blood cell or even an entire site, you need lots and lots and lots of DNA synthesis.

619
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:07,870
Right. And so you need that DNA synthesis. Therefore, you need a really, really, really good supply of regeneration of these of these folate.

620
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:15,790
And in specific, it's going to because of reductions in both the purines adenosine going to and that immunity and which have different precursors.

621
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:20,919
So what ends up happening at a cellular level is cells are trying to go through this cell cycle, right.

622
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:27,310
So they're trying to go through this division. So they get to the point where they're trying to do all this DNA synthesis, but they can't.

623
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:32,030
Right. They get stuck because they run out of nucleotides. So what ends up happening is you end up with these cells.

624
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:38,950
There's halfway through cell division, so they're swollen and they may even have multiple half dozen completed copies of their chromosomes.

625
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:42,280
Okay. So that is called catch cell.

626
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,339
That's so you arrest that something we actually look forward to in cancers.

627
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,990
All we try to stop cancer cells are dividing.

628
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:53,530
But in the case of red blood cells, what you end up are these larger swollen red blood cells that have multiple copies of DNA in them.

629
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,360
Okay. And that's what's called NEG negative plastic anemia.

630
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:00,670
Right. And so this would be normal red blood cells.

631
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:05,830
But you can see in this case, this red blood cell has a bunch of extra DNA records, kind of half completed.

632
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:09,430
And then because it have completed DNA, that cell is much, much bigger.

633
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:15,319
Right. So the key clinical measure of this particular type of of anemia.

634
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,229
It's anemia because your red blood cells are not working very well, is you have a higher volume of the cells.

635
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:24,280
And that's something that people can calculate clinically. This is called the mean corpuscular volume.

636
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,060
We'll come back to this both next class and our our whole class on anemia.

637
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:32,800
So this is one of the hallmarks of folate, B-12 and coding deficiency.

638
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,870
Right. And all of these directly for in the case avoid an and indirectly in the case of B12

639
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:43,090
and colon are because of the lack of ability to make the complete the DNA synthesis.

640
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:52,720
So for people who have cancer there is a higher number because or the lower not necessarily the reason I'm alluding to cancer is a lot of anti folate.

641
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,900
So things that disrupt folate and capitalism are also chemo therapeutics.

642
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,130
The reason for that is cancer cells are also dividing. And so you're trying to stop the division of that.

643
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:05,680
Now, like as a byproduct of methotrexate, for example, do you get Big Lebowski anemia?

644
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:09,940
I think so, but I'm not 1% sure. But yeah, I wasn't trying to I wasn't trying to connect the two.

645
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:21,850
I was just using that as an example. As with EMT and coli, there's a pretty common variance in in in the folate cycle, which is at the end of four.

646
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:29,320
So somewhere between 20 and 53% of the entire this is US population have somewhat reduced and

647
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:35,170
then about somewhere between three and 30% have pretty substantially reduced our activity.

648
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:41,350
And that's because of a specific coding variance where a system becomes a39 at the number numbers 677 position.

649
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:44,649
Right. And so those people are going to have much higher folate requirements.

650
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:50,740
You could probably also argue they would, for example, benefit from choline supplementation because that will preserve the folate.

651
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:54,280
But again, they're not going to be able to efficiently go through this pathway here.

652
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:58,240
Right. So just like PMT, it's a variant that's common enough in this population.

653
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:05,650
Like it would be shocking if five or six of us in this room didn't have that variant, that would pretty dramatically impact fall requirements.

654
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:11,380
Okay, so that's folate, biochemistry. And so what I want to finish with in the last 13 and a half.

655
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,040
Minutes. Here is the dry and good news.

656
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:18,760
The dry is not like a total random gas like golf course. So it's a lot better.

657
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:24,550
So it turns out there's a good two good biomarkers, at least two, maybe three good biomarkers for folate sufficiency.

658
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:32,230
And luckily, because unlike PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE for coli, there's not some like random neutral, inaccessible storage form of folate.

659
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:40,240
Right. So generally what happens is before late that's in a red blood cell is determined when that red blood cell is made.

660
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:45,340
Right. So during the Marquesas, when the red blood cells made, it has a certain amount of folate that folate stays there.

661
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:51,159
So what that means is the amount of folate in a red blood cell is about the average amount of

662
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,580
folate over the last four months because the average red blood cell lasts for about four months.

663
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:57,340
Right. So it's a really good long term chronic measure.

664
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:05,500
So that's the best measure that we use is long term folate levels and the healthy ranges in red blood cell folate is 140 to 260.

665
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:09,970
Right. And that's in the red blood cell fraction of your cup of your blood draw.

666
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:14,170
You can also look at short term folate. That's the amount that's not in red blood cells.

667
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:19,930
That's just the amount of free in plasma. So you can consider that sort of the amount that's moving from place to place or reason in the diet.

668
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,890
That level is much lower, right, because most of the folate is being used in tissues,

669
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,280
but it can be used to sort of determine really short term things.

670
01:08:27,550 --> 01:08:32,700
The third biomarker, which is not on here, but you'll see gets used quite often is indirect measures like homocysteine.

671
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,830
Right. So you can also use homocysteine as a proxy for for how much food.

672
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:40,540
So that's great. So we can measure how much folate a person has that makes this way, way, way easier.

673
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,630
Okay. So in terms of the drive, there are several at risk groups here.

674
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:49,570
So for example, all women who are at a birthing age are recommended to consume folate because again,

675
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,920
the folate requirement is very early in pregnancy, quite often before with the women in those, they're pregnant.

676
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:57,370
There is genetic risks. The age of our in our full age one.

677
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:01,480
All of these have pretty common variants that make you have higher folate requirements.

678
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:06,910
If you had more coal mining in your diet, you would not be doing the preservation of folate.

679
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,940
Alcohol interrupts folate absorption.

680
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:17,589
Several drugs like and sets and promote phenobarbital have somewhat less clear mechanisms, whereas the drugs that are called antiplatelets,

681
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:22,780
most notably methotrexate, they are specifically intentionally interrupting folate metabolism.

682
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:28,959
So methotrexate, which is right here, you can see, looks a lot like folic acid and it binds and inhibits d r, right.

683
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,090
So it sort of impairs your body's ability to use that.

684
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:41,080
It is commonly used in cancer treatment to reduce the proliferation of cancer cells and in disorders of inflammation.

685
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,500
Right. To reduce the proliferation of white blood cells. Right.

686
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:47,320
So these are pretty common use drugs and that's going to increase your requirements for bullets.

687
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:53,490
And then, of course, any active digestive order, celiac IBD is going to affect your ability to absorb that.

688
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:57,100
But like hemophilia or sickle cell stuff. Blast.

689
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:02,130
Yes, they will also be higher. Yeah. And iron deficiency will also be hard to get.

690
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:05,920
We'll talk about we'll talk about all of those in the lecture. Okay.

691
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:13,510
So let's see. At risk groups, these are the drugs. So they are set. You'll notice there's A's for here, but there's actual RDA is here.

692
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:17,770
Right. So these are pretty confident based on pretty good science that I'm going to go through a minute.

693
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:23,230
These two are a little more projection, but even relative to Colleen, much less projection.

694
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:31,779
There is an eye I'm sorry, 12 four for co-lead author for folate in adults 2000, which is actually pretty low.

695
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:36,370
Right. So I gave the example I take like the Costco brand men's one a day.

696
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:39,639
It has 400 micrograms of DfE per per day.

697
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,030
So if I got that for my diet, plus I had that multivitamin item already at 800.

698
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,020
Right. So I'm already pretty close to the upper limit even without actually really trying that hard.

699
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,290
Right. They took two multivitamins. I'd be like probably way over the limit.

700
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:56,500
Right. So this limit is based on quite a good threat on perusal from, from, you know, with,

701
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:03,010
with a not as good comment for me talks about this this is based on a risk of anemia due to pseudo B12 deficiency.

702
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:06,850
And we'll talk about that in the broadcast on Wednesday. So we'll talk more about that.

703
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:10,480
But that's what the basis of this rule is set up.

704
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:14,440
Okay. So how do they get the adequate intake and the dry?

705
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:19,840
So for infants, very, very, very similar to coli, how much folate is in breast milk?

706
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,530
The average is 85 micrograms per liter. How much breast milk to make.

707
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,870
Turns out 66 babies get that much breast milk. That presumably is the right amount.

708
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:34,300
Right. Again, recalling like how sure we are. But luckily this is not based on like one study of 12 people.

709
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,090
This is based on three reasonably large studies of several hundred women.

710
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:42,850
And it does turn out that 65 micrograms per day of folate is reasonably well defended in breast milk in women.

711
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:46,120
So there's not a huge range. There's a summary, but not a huge range.

712
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:54,639
I was curious, the FDA mandated formula has at least 8.4 micrograms per cow, which turns out to be at least 28 micrograms per day.

713
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:02,980
So the FDA mandate for formula is a little bit lower, actually quite large, about half of the the RDA, but many have much higher.

714
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:06,670
And I did kind of going through different brands to figure out which ones, which ones are the same.

715
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:11,220
Now the reason we're doing this is because it's like to say mildly ethically.

716
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,020
Problematic to give children less food. Right.

717
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:21,310
So you could imagine a scenario where you took a bunch of babies and you restricted them for year or whatnot, but no RB would ever let you do that.

718
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:24,729
So that's why we said it based on this breast milk equivalence. And again,

719
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:31,440
this is based on the logic that the amount in breast milk is probably the right amount because we've evolved for that to be the right amount.

720
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:40,990
And you could quibble with that. Why up to one year it is extrapolated using the same formula which I'm showing you now from infants.

721
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:47,890
Right? So as you get to be six months, your bigger and the canonical six month baby is exactly nine kilograms, 37 kilograms for an infant.

722
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:52,240
And so you plug into that formula and you get a slightly higher number. So that's where the infant one comes from.

723
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:56,550
Okay. So for adults, like I said, we have a good biomarker. Right.

724
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,490
So the question is, how do we use that biomarker to make some sort of informed decision?

725
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:04,840
So what we want is we want to figure out at what dietary intake are.

726
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,870
50% of people going to be below this cutoff.

727
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:12,540
Okay. So first, we'll start off with how do you get to this cutoff? And then I'll come back to the point.

728
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,260
So this started off pretty bad, right? Trust me, I read the first two sentences. I was like, Oh, no, not again.

729
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,890
And so the question is how much folate in the red blood cells is that?

730
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:26,920
So in one study, they took people and they put them on a low folate diet of five micrograms per day.

731
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:33,040
And one person developed Megalodon and it was not Megawati's hyper segmented neutrophils, which is very similar.

732
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,820
It's just swollen neutrophils, white blood cells that have lots of DNA.

733
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:41,200
That person had a cutoff of 140.

734
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:46,980
So that was the first date. That was like 1960. And then that got expanded by two more people in order to an end of three.

735
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:56,700
We're on the similar sort of thing, low diet. The one per two people had a protective neutral nuclear that those people both had levels below 140.

736
01:13:56,710 --> 01:14:02,530
So that suggested 140 was was better. Luckily this has gotten much better over the last 20 years or so.

737
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:06,639
We're now cohorts of 40 and 230. Very similar things were done right.

738
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,000
So in this case, now they're looking at remarkable plastic anemia in red blood cells.

739
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:14,290
They looked at people who had that anemia and then figured out what was their folate levels.

740
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:24,429
So every single person that had an opportunity in this study had four weeks, 140, and then all 238 pregnant women that had anemia also were under 150.

741
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:29,350
So that gave us pretty good idea that 140 seems like the cutoff point, right?

742
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:32,979
So below 140 is back when I was showing you the ranges.

743
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:37,660
The lower limit was was one for you. So now that we know and then there's some case control studies where they looked

744
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:41,740
at DNA synthesis and they showed the DNA synthesis was reduced below 140,

745
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,220
not bar. So that suggests 140 seems like the right target.

746
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:52,010
So now all you need to do is feed people a certain known amount of disease and then figure out when their coli level sorry,

747
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:55,450
their folate level gets down below 140. Right. And so you can do that.

748
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:59,170
And this has been done in multiple controlled feeding studies.

749
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,959
So what they did is they brought people in, they controlled what they ate.

750
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,840
They vary the amount of folate equivalents that they were giving them disease.

751
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:11,440
And in most cases, they just directly measured red blood cell folate. Sometimes they also measured homocysteine levels.

752
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:17,560
So everything looks good so far, goes off the rails a little bit because it's largely based on this one study here.

753
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,410
So I'm going to walk you through O'Keefe, which is the most important study.

754
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:27,130
So what they didn't keep is they gave people exactly 320 micrograms of DPS per day for quite a while, two months.

755
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:33,490
And what they found is three patients were above the 140 cut off and two patients were below.

756
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:37,270
It's about 5050. So then they said, well, that must be the exact right number.

757
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:43,550
So 320 must be the exact 5050 mark where 50% of people are less efficient and 50% of people are sufficient.

758
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:47,590
Right. So there have been other studies that were larger, but they didn't use exactly two, 320.

759
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:54,729
So, for example, studies where they gave people 500, nobody was below the cutoff and studies where they gave people the equivalent of 100.

760
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:58,150
Everybody was below the right. And so those two studies came first.

761
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:04,300
Those were the studies. And then this study up here, the other one being a repeating study.

762
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,110
And then O'Keefe used those two pieces of data and said, well, I think the right number is 320.

763
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:14,800
And then they did that. So that's pretty good because you have a population of people, 50% of which have folate deficiency at that dose.

764
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:21,010
People don't. I would love if the end was like bigger than five, but but you know, it is what it is, right?

765
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:25,299
So again, if I had the interest or desire money to do this,

766
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:30,490
I might want to produce this by like a factor of like at least 100 or something to get a sense of is that where that comes from?

767
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:33,580
But anyways, 320 is where the RDA comes from, right?

768
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:37,330
So again, that's the level at which 50% of people are sufficient.

769
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:41,559
You add to standard deviations that you end up with 400, which is the RDA, right?

770
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,900
Remember, the RDA is the amount that is good for 97.5% of people.

771
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,550
Right. Okay. So that is how we set it for adults.

772
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:55,810
So much better than much, much, much, much better than I mean, compared to calling, this is like wildly rigorous science.

773
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:02,240
Not great, but better. And so we'll see. We'll see how was done and what they are basing and pulling.

774
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:07,989
So this is better, but they are basing the thing with the whole population on these studies.

775
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:15,680
Yes, it was done in 1998 and they did not. Repeat after that 1985 is subjected to many random errors.

776
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,399
Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah. And it's like, really, it's just one person on one set of the other.

777
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,930
Like, if one of these people was in this group, which is probably going to happen right then we might be way off.

778
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,320
Right. So you're right. It's not as I said, it's not great. It's better, like.

779
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:31,040
Like literally calling with, like, we're just, like, barely better than guessing, right?

780
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,790
So this is better. But I think, yeah, you would want to have a much more rigorous, larger.

781
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,510
I can't remember the population level, Keith, but you can't have that much diversity in five women,

782
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:42,590
no matter how diverse you try to find your population. So yeah, I agree. It's not great.

783
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:45,820
But that's where we we've it's not. Yeah.

784
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:49,400
Yeah, for sure. No, I probably yeah. No. Yeah.

785
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:53,569
Although I feel like calling problem is maybe more of an issue, so. Okay.

786
01:17:53,570 --> 01:18:00,500
So what about the other three groups that we didn't talk about. So children, what they do is they back extrapolate from the RDA.

787
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:08,870
So this is different than Colleen where we forward extrapolated from infants in folate we back extrapolate from the RDA

788
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:13,820
and there's a formula for that where you can take a R and plug it into this formula based on the canonical child weight.

789
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:18,950
And then you get the the children's of the various girl students for lactation.

790
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:23,839
It's very similar to Colleen. So we figured out what the average folate excretion in breast milk is.

791
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:32,420
That turns out 133. We add that to 320, we end up with 450 and then add that up to an RDA of 500 because that's 95%.

792
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,479
So again, very much like Colleen, we set a number and then we said,

793
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:40,430
plus the amount that you're secreting in your breast milk is probably required in calling it a little dubious,

794
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:43,740
because we know that women who are pregnant, lactating, are making more, Colleen.

795
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:47,689
They are not making more for you cannot make folate, right? Colleen is the exception.

796
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:52,920
What about. Um, because I was reading when I was doing the fruit of the day and it said like,

797
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:57,230
what was, I think like woman who had like experience to folate deficiency.

798
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:02,300
Then she'd be like a before pregnancy or during pregnancy, supplementing with more folate.

799
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:07,550
Well, how much more folate? Because I saw one thing that was like, oh, 400 is like a thousand, like what was here?

800
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:11,090
And then there was like one that was like 4000, right?

801
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:16,939
I was like, is that actually correct? Yeah. So, yeah. So what what can you talk about is sort of the pregnancy part.

802
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:20,809
So not all like this one's a little more complicated. So I mentioned this last part.

803
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:26,000
So this is non supplemented women what happens your point levels during pregnancy right.

804
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,080
In early fully pregnancy, there's about a 60% drop in your Foley levels.

805
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:36,540
So what the studies like the one Kenneth had suggested were let's supplement women with who

806
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,920
are pregnant with folate to try to keep this level and bring it back up to that level.

807
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:46,130
So they use different doses, avoid it, struggle with the right ones and use a bunch of different doses, like you said, all the way up to 4000.

808
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:50,900
But they figured out that if you all you'll need to support with about 200 to get you back up to this level,

809
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,070
this is probably maybe logically the most dubious one to me,

810
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:00,799
because it seems to me that if naturally folate levels are supposed to drop, maybe that's like, okay, right.

811
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,680
Because that's like what happened naturally, right? So the idea that you're trying to reverse that and get back to pre pregnancy levels

812
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,850
of fully and that should be the end target seems like again pretty dubious.

813
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:15,469
But again just like for children, the idea if you're going to take a bunch of pregnant women and you're going to intentionally,

814
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:20,180
fully restrict them is also, to say the least, somewhat ethically problematic.

815
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:25,969
Right? So so that's why that's not done. So I'm surprised that the pregnancy one is a is an RDA.

816
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:27,360
It is it RDA. It's based on a yeah.

817
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:32,959
I would more likely call this an I if it was, if it was me because it doesn't seem like the rigor on this is quite as high.

818
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,880
Whereas for these ones it seems a little more a little more based in, you know, logical coherence.

819
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:43,550
Okay, so that's all I have those your learning objectives. So remember, no class on Monday.

820
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:49,760
Take a look at Kenneth's presentation and put any comments you want on Yellow Day and have a nice Martin Luther King Day.

821
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,880
And I will see you guys next Wednesday or B 12th.
