1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:18,840
Thanks, Sarah. In Congress and the U.S., she's doing everything she knows.

2
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:42,230
I can direct you to help me as you've worked so hard to do what is important to keep you safe.

3
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,340
Okay. 830. Is that what you say?

4
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,149
I don't remember. I do for time all day.

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:05,070
Just like this? All the time. Then I'll tell you something.

6
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,560
She was like, Oh, yeah, I made it because it has windows.

7
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,300
Yeah, absolutely. That's so crucial. Like its survival.

8
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:29,960
The case like that, because I was at first I was perhaps in the first instance, which every 21st year,

9
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:57,540
two years, although it doesn't say exactly, but it is a number that I think I would not have to think of that.

10
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:18,710
I mean, what about this question of, you know, she told us we had asked kind of what I would have remembered and how you.

11
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:36,310
We're trucking through the region. Yesterday I was living in Israel.

12
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,890
Don't remind me of the Jews.

13
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:55,470
Yeah. And especially because in the manuscript, people realize that they didn't want you think was likely to be hero.

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:32,130
Yeah. I think that's an unconscious sensibility because I think that it was a number of years on me and I'm like, I'm.

15
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,790
The key is that you don't take it seriously.

16
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:52,090
You know, not really know.

17
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:08,670
Really? Section four. I know you're not surprised.

18
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,950
I think I still think you know what was right.

19
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,090
I was up there like a six and seven depending.

20
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,450
I guess I just wasn't everywhere.

21
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,190
1120. I think I was like maybe another one. Why is that?

22
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,420
That was my mind was I was talking to somebody, a lot of people as is going to be.

23
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,749
I have a question for you, like half the classes in here.

24
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,190
So this isn't totally fair,

25
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,040
but I don't know if you've all seen there's a pretty interesting D-I seminar that's going to happen on Thursday at this class time.

26
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:59,890
I'm just curious if any of you would prefer to cancel the test on Thursday and have it Tuesday or if you want to keep it.

27
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,209
So I'm guessing that there's probably some people who are flying,

28
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,460
even though or like moving or going to Thanksgiving, even though you're supposed to class on Tuesday anyway.

29
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,620
So I would want to keep it because I'm being silly.

30
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,970
And if we want to vote on here, let's see what happens.

31
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,249
Know, there are some of you who are definitely not here on Tuesday.

32
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:35,470
Is that what you're telling me? Okay. Even though, you know, you are supposed have class that day, right?

33
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:46,030
I learned it. Okay. I'm also so expensive, so it's easier to fly at nine times.

34
00:05:46,050 --> 00:06:07,390
Mean. I know. Okay.

35
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:17,820
I you. Why don't you keep voting?

36
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,900
Is it still open for you to vote? Seems like Tuesday is not a viable option.

37
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,480
So even if this is you, I'm not going to show it to you.

38
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,190
Because even if it says yes, then I have to deal with all the people who are going to be here.

39
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,569
And I don't have to do that. So. Okay, so we'll just keep it Thursday as is, remember.

40
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:46,020
So you have a test Thursday, you can use one page front and back again, whatever you want.

41
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,090
And it's very similar, very similar format to last one.

42
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,690
So a bunch of multiple choice and then short answers. Any questions about your test?

43
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:08,830
Yeah. Is this like accumulations with like so it's generally just phase three, like everything after phase two, it's all a sample size randomization.

44
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:20,100
Also, we've done. It's everything after.

45
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:30,540
So it's like from the lectures ten, four through 11, ten, there are things that are related to what we did earlier, right?

46
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:38,610
Like research ethics are permeating throughout. So I can't say it's like completely separate, but it's mostly just based on those lectures.

47
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,900
Any other questions about the test? Yeah.

48
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,070
Will there be calculations? Do we need to know? Calculator.

49
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,270
No computers. No phones. Use usage during it.

50
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,810
Just bring your pen or pencil. Any other questions?

51
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,020
Okay. What was the topic? You said that you covered what we talk about today, crossover designs.

52
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,420
So it just goes up until we're finishing the 1110 lecture today, which will be on it.

53
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,110
But anything after that lecture is not on.

54
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,780
Okay. All right.

55
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:32,020
So we were talking about protocol deviations, and I just wanted to finish this one briefly.

56
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,120
So we were talking about noncompliance. Right.

57
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,920
And so how patients are randomized between treatments in a trial,

58
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,700
but then they can decide not to take that treatment, to stop taking it, to take another treatment.

59
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,900
Right. There are different types of noncompliance and regardless of the type, it can be an issue.

60
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,719
So once we see once we know that there is noncompliance,

61
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,910
which often we do know about because we're asking the participant questions, we can try to account for that.

62
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,899
And one way that you would want to account for it in the design stage is to say,

63
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,110
okay, well, if we think this many people are going to be noncompliant,

64
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:22,820
then let's inflate the sample size so that we still have enough people who are actually getting the treatment as intended in our ITC analysis.

65
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,110
Now, how would we get that expected proportion of noncompliance?

66
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,390
We'd have to have some idea, right?

67
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:36,469
We'd have to have some pilot data or some information from previous trials about this is in this setting with these treatments,

68
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:48,510
this is the number of likely noncompliance. And so then this is an example of issues with how we analyze the data.

69
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,290
So this is survival, which we didn't talk about, but you can still see some issues here.

70
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,960
So over here is the percent probability of individuals with disease free survival.

71
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:07,030
So meaning that these patients, it's what is the proportion of individuals who are alive without breast cancer?

72
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,510
Okay, that's the y axis. And the x axis is years post mastectomy.

73
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,900
So this is breast cancer disease free survival years post mastectomy.

74
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:26,420
And this first method is saying that we're going to separate these groups by considering the dose received, the individual.

75
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,059
It's like a chemotherapy.

76
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:35,860
So the dose that the individual received over the total amount of dose that they should have received if they were following the protocol correctly.

77
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:47,500
Okay. So this is saying, well, these people up here right in the solid line, they got 85% or more of the drug that they should have gotten.

78
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:55,450
Right. And why maybe would people get less drug? Because they have toxicity or there are lots of follow up.

79
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,160
Right. And so they just don't get the the drug as they should have.

80
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,689
So this so those are the filled in circles.

81
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:14,620
The open triangles, this middle on are the group of individuals who got 65 to 84% of the drug and then the group, the lowest group.

82
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:22,190
So this means that this this set of patients was most likely got the disease faster.

83
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,330
Right. There is less of them who are disease free.

84
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,460
These are the patients who have less than 65% of the dose received.

85
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,140
So it looks like, right, if we look at this method, the more treatment you get,

86
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:41,320
the better you do, the the longer it takes for you to get breast cancer again.

87
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,150
However. Right. That's there's a lot of assumptions going on in here.

88
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,540
And so there are other ways in which we could potentially separate these patients.

89
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:59,260
So, for example, right, this is now a different method where we would say, well, how much dose did they receive,

90
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:06,820
given the amount of dose that they could actually receive on a study for while they're on a study?

91
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,209
Right. So it's not how much in the protocol that they should have.

92
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,710
It's while they were in the study, how much should they could they have gotten?

93
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,430
So if they ended early? Right. We don't count for all that dose.

94
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,520
They should have gotten on the protocol because they weren't actually on the study for that time.

95
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:28,150
So this is a little bit more of like a true proportion of the dose that they could have possibly received that they had.

96
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:37,629
And so you see now, right, if we look at this, those who received over 85% of the total possible dose for them.

97
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,850
Right. They're actually now in the middle. They're not on the top.

98
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:51,230
And those who had 65 to 84 right there now on the bottom and those who had less than 65% are actually on the top.

99
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:58,490
So we have a real switch of. The the curves here.

100
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,600
Right. So now it's not that those who received the most did the best.

101
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,300
They actually did the middle. And those who received the least actually are doing the best.

102
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,159
So kind of interesting, right.

103
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:18,920
Is that because maybe the study ended right as they were starting or is it because they had some issue and they stopped getting the drug?

104
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,050
But that issue was unrelated to getting the disease.

105
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,370
Right.

106
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:31,310
It's but it's interesting how it very much matters how you account for the treatment they had when you're looking at the relationship with survival.

107
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,250
Um, and so this is right, this amount that they actually received is related to compliance.

108
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:46,400
How compliance were they with the treatment? And if we stratify by that compliance, then we can see that there is this reordering of the outcome.

109
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:56,260
And so the problem is that we need to think about how compliance biases results because compliance is both an outcome, right?

110
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,320
They have the treatment and an outcome of taking the treatment is how compliant they are potentially.

111
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:10,549
But also compliance is a predictor potentially of the actual outcome like survival or or mortality, right.

112
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:21,260
Or disease, whatever. And so that's very difficult to you really need to make sure that you're accounting for compliance in the right way.

113
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:30,320
Otherwise you can get this issue of bias. So you really just want to make sure that in any trial you're documenting compliance if you can,

114
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:37,300
and then you're correctly accounting for it and or or and or aware of the potential for bias.

115
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:44,210
Your results. Obviously the best thing possible would be that everybody was compliant.

116
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,969
Right. So you do want to have some measures in the trial.

117
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:53,930
These are measures that the investigators should have that are written out in the protocol in order to try to optimize compliance.

118
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:04,070
So we want to try to minimize the noncompliance, giving clear directions, having research staff, encourage compliance,

119
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,839
having regular check ups where you're looking at compliance, etc. The best way is preventative, right?

120
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,860
Just prevent the noncompliance and then we don't have to worry about it.

121
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,290
Of course it'll be inevitable, but hopefully we can at least minimize it that way.

122
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,620
It's also important to think about, so what is the duration of the study?

123
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:31,460
What is our primary outcome? Where the longer we go, the more opportunities we have for noncompliance?

124
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,780
So you want to think about in the clinical trial, right? You want a long enough time period in which you can see a treatment effect,

125
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,140
but you don't want it too long so that you can see all of these issues with potential bias.

126
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,830
So please comment somewhere very quickly, but not here.

127
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,030
So you want to think about when is when are you measuring that endpoint in a pilot study can really help with that.

128
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,839
Now, remember, I don't we didn't explicitly talk about pilot studies,

129
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,180
but pilot studies are small studies that are often run prior to the larger study.

130
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:15,990
So they don't fit into like a phase one, phase two. They're really they they're kind of like on their own and they might be, what,

131
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,870
prior like in between phase two and phase three or they may be even all the way at the end.

132
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,030
If you're not finding a dose, they could be sort of like in the beginning of of thinking about trials.

133
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,780
And it's a small number of people that you're gathering information about,

134
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:36,520
see the feasibility of your design and to really refine things like one issue, the endpoint comes right out.

135
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,610
What is this the best way to measure the to define the outcome?

136
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,550
How much noncompliance do we expect?

137
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:54,980
And then the a really important thing is that if a patient withdraws from the study, that doesn't mean that we have to lose their outcome information.

138
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:02,000
Right. What it should mean is that they're not necessarily getting treatment, but we're still collecting data on their outcome.

139
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,440
Right. So that maybe they say, I no longer want to take this treatment.

140
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,450
Right. And you say, okay, fine. But I still need to know at six months or whenever that is what your outcome is.

141
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,050
Now, this is something that most people know, right?

142
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:21,350
The investigators will continue to get data on anybody enrolled in the study, regardless of whether they've stopped taking the treatment or not.

143
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,110
However, some investigators don't know this,

144
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:31,129
so it's just important that you're aware that we want to try to get as much data as possible on all the participants who we enrolled throughout,

145
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:41,480
even if they are noncompliant or stop taking the the treatment, because then we can try to use methods in analysis to account for the bias.

146
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,220
But if we don't have their outcomes right, then we're going to have to impute a number potentially increasing the noise along with the bias.

147
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,000
So we just want to get as much of the data as possible.

148
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,810
Okay. Here is another kind of example that's related to that breast cancer one.

149
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,059
This is saying that we should resist the temptation to analyze response by treatment duration.

150
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:12,860
So this was again US cancer studies of malignant melanoma trial and these are showing response rates by treatment duration.

151
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,459
So there are two different treatments here and this is the duration of treatment.

152
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,680
So they either got less than five days, 5 to 34 days, 35 to 64 or greater than 65.

153
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,340
And you can see here that if they had that, if we look across here,

154
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:40,910
it appears that there is more response with greater duration of the treatment, particularly in the disease DTIC level here.

155
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:47,550
Right. But this is kind of like your survivor bias, right?

156
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:56,630
The longer you can get the treatment right, the better you're likely doing because you're in the study, you're continuing continuing to get treatment.

157
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,370
And so you can't totally tell. Right. If you look at the treatment response by duration,

158
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:10,189
if it's really due to the treatment or if it's really due to the fact that these participants could endure that much treatment.

159
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:17,450
Right. And make it okay. So you don't know if it's that the patient could spend more time just because something specific about those patients

160
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:24,800
that they are but healthier or something are maybe less likely to have side effects or less likely to complain,

161
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,600
or whether it's really that the treatment, a longer treatment is better.

162
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,589
There's always missing data in trials, and it's very important.

163
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,499
Missing how to deal with missing data is something very important.

164
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:50,559
So if you didn't take the missing data class, I recommend that you at some point do and or you look into a book because as a biostatistician,

165
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:57,790
you're always going to have to deal with missing data. And how you deal with missing data is very important, right?

166
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,949
If missing if the data is missing between and it's missing differentially between the treatment groups.

167
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,029
So that treatment A has more missing this than treatment. Be right.

168
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:17,530
This could be a real issue. It could be the fact something about treatment A has made less people provide their outcomes.

169
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:25,210
Right. And so we need to take that into account and deal with that in the analysis.

170
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,560
And even as the missing date data, the missing data is similar.

171
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,840
So like 50% missing and a 50% missing and B, the missing could be due to different reasons.

172
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,150
And so still then there could be issues in the analysis and things we need to consider.

173
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:47,839
So one thing that's really important in trials is that you try to collect as much data as possible so that there's minimal missing.

174
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:55,130
But then also, if it is missing, you still try to get in touch with those participants and figure out, well, why is it missing or is it missing?

175
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,469
Why? Why is this? Why did you not have this? Is it because of toxicity?

176
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,530
Is it because you stopped complying? Is it because you moved away?

177
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,670
Is it because the person died? Is it because they had a different issue? You had to change treatments, right?

178
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,860
You try to get as much information as possible so you can figure out what is the cause of missing.

179
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,340
There's also an issue. There is there can be potential design flaws.

180
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:32,760
So if you have treatments where the groups are being seen at different risk on different schedules or different amounts of times,

181
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:40,170
then you could be potentially catching a lot more in the group that's seen more often than those who are seen less often.

182
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,170
And so this is really something that's a design flaw,

183
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:50,160
such that you might attribute some difference to the treatment when it's actually attributed to the fact that you just like ask these people more,

184
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,580
right? Or seen them or had a bigger opportunity to see some issues.

185
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:04,910
And so you. Should in clinical trials be following the patients for their outcomes at the same times.

186
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:13,190
Right. You want to. On the same schedule so that it's not this like just because you've seen them more often.

187
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,570
Right. It's the fact that you've seen everybody the same.

188
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,639
And so this is really attributable to the treatment.

189
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,750
So this is, again, something in the design and something that if an investigator is saying, okay, well,

190
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:29,650
this this treatment, right, it has to happen every 14 days, whereas this treatment, it only happens once a month.

191
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,599
So we'll just collect the data once a month for this group and once, twice a month for this group, you should say,

192
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:41,410
well, even if we're not giving them the treatment, we should collect the data the same twice a month for both groups.

193
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,510
And then, of course, we can always potentially have, like, outliers.

194
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,520
Right. You learn in regression that there can be these outliers. This can happen in clinical trials as well.

195
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,530
First, you want to make sure that it's a true outlier. It's not like a typo or mistake.

196
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,450
Right. Check to see if it's a problem. Corrected if you can.

197
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,990
If it's not, then you can't just delete them.

198
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,559
Right. You can't just say like, oh, this doesn't match everybody else. Right.

199
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,210
And any regression, you can say, oh, exclude that. You have to.

200
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:22,110
Usually what you do is you want to know why it's such an outlier and explain that and then usually do sensitivity analysis, right?

201
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,670
Like what does it look like when everybody is included? What does it look like if we do exclude outliers?

202
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:31,620
And you also want to be cognizant here of the treatment group of these outliers.

203
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:41,010
And ideally, you're deciding whether there are an outlier blinded to the treatment group so that you're not saying like, oh, you know,

204
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:49,559
all of these people were outliers in this treatment group and like trying to make them outliers when they're not really right.

205
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:58,050
You just want to be honest and document anything you're doing and then usually do sensitivities, sensitivity, analysis with and without these people.

206
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:09,460
Again, you want to minimize missing data. If you can try to go back in time and get that missing data, then you should do that, right?

207
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,659
Like maybe it's missing from the clinical trial information, but it could be information in there.

208
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:21,670
Electronic health, medical record data. Right. You could try to fill that in, but it could truly be missing,

209
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:28,510
in which case you need to you want to try to figure out why it's missing and then appropriately count for the missing this.

210
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,290
Okay. So part of the reason why data can be missing is due to loss to follow up.

211
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,890
And so this is usually it's it can be due to several different reasons.

212
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,680
One which is totally independent of the treatment or disease they move.

213
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,140
The patient was in a clinical trial at the University of Michigan.

214
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,020
This person's family moved to Ohio. They no longer want to come to University of Michigan to be a part of this.

215
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,200
Right. That's one reason why they could be lost. Follow up. Another reason is that, you know,

216
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:10,790
they were on this treatment and then they experience some side effects or some other bad thing happened to them

217
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,589
and they can no longer really receive that treatment and so they can potentially be lost to follow up that way,

218
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:23,030
too. Hopefully you're still collecting data on them if you can, but it's possible that they're transferred or whatever.

219
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,890
If the loss of follow up, if it's missing, independent of treatment or disease, right.

220
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:36,530
This means that it's missing at random or potentially missing completely at random.

221
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,510
And so if it's missing completely at random and a complete case analysis is fine.

222
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Okay. These are, again, things that you would learn in the missing data class.

223
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,550
If it's missing at random, you can potentially use covariates to account for the missing.

224
00:25:49,550 --> 00:26:01,640
This, you can maybe use propensity score analysis or to to do like a weighting of the of the patients.

225
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,670
Or you could use imputation, right? But now you're missing data is related to the treatment group or to the outcomes.

226
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,360
Then you can have some issues.

227
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,989
And if you can account for you know, you can account for the reasons for this messiness, even if it's related to these things, right?

228
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:23,870
Using imputation, perhaps you're okay, but if it's missing for reasons that you can't actually you don't have these covariates,

229
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,350
you can't account for them, then you can have biased results.

230
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,339
So again, this is really kind of going much more into the like how to deal with missing data.

231
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,579
But just be aware that this is not just a problem with observational data.

232
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,780
This is definitely still a problem in clinical trials because humans are humans

233
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,409
and they're not perfect and they don't always continue through a trial,

234
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,620
as we would hope. There's also potentially an issue of competing events.

235
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,090
And this is something that if you take survival next semester, hopefully you will talk about.

236
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:00,040
So that's the fact that like say we're in this trial for looking at the outcome is like a heart attack.

237
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,880
Right. Well,

238
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,210
there could be other competing events or other events that could happen that could preclude us actually seeing if you've had a heart attack or not.

239
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,630
Like, what if the person dies from cancer? Right.

240
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,240
Well, we don't know if they would have had a heart attack later or not.

241
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:21,660
And so competing events can cause the same bias as the dependent loss to follow up if the competing event is linked to the treatment.

242
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:29,770
So like if the treatment cause the competing events, right, then we can have this issue of bias again and again.

243
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:36,340
We need I'm just saying let's advanced analyzes to account for these types of missing ness.

244
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,740
And so again, this is just sort of telling you that dealing with missing data is important and it can be right.

245
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,600
It's not just usually a complete case analysis like excluding these people and not worrying about it.

246
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,270
There's often potential bias if you do that.

247
00:27:52,270 --> 00:28:01,479
And so you have to correctly account for the reason for missing this and try to use model based methods to potentially imputation,

248
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:09,980
if you can, to correct for that source of bias. So ideally you don't have any messiness, right?

249
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:19,410
You design the trial as if you have zero missing amazingness and you hopefully implement the trial minimizing the messiness.

250
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,500
You're trying to collect all the data, but there is definitely going to be missing this.

251
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,900
And so you want to understand the reason for the missing this and.

252
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:39,660
Potentially use different methods sensitivity analyzes for accounting for that missing this and see if they agree.

253
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:49,170
If they do, then it's more persuasive than that. You know, the result is truly of the treatment and not due to potential biases due of missing this.

254
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,799
One of the simplest ways of a sensitivity analysis is if things are missing and for example,

255
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,170
you have like a binary outcome, you can do what's called a best and worst case scenario.

256
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:08,829
So you can say, all right, well, let's say here's the data that we did have in the treatment arm.

257
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,979
There are 170 events in the control arm.

258
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:19,200
There are 220 events, but 30 in the treatment arm are lost follow up and ten in the control room, arm or loss to follow up?

259
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:31,720
Well, the best case scenario is that there are no more events in the treatment arm and there were all the events in the control arm.

260
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:36,819
Right. That would mean that the treatment did as best as possible and the control didn't do as well.

261
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,410
And so here's the best case scenario, whereas we can compare that to what's the worst case scenario.

262
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,280
Will everybody in the treatment arm would have an event and no one in the control arm would have an event?

263
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,610
And then we could figure, you know, use our test artistic apparatus,

264
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:55,780
comparing proportions or whatever in the observed data and best case and in the worst case and see how different those results are.

265
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,570
If they all come to the same conclusion that we can feel pretty confident that the treatment effect is.

266
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,350
You know, it's not due to the fact that we have this differential loss of follow up.

267
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,410
Okay. The next few slides are just all about trial reporting.

268
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,709
This is the fact that like when somebody you have the trial, you analyze the data.

269
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,030
Now you're writing the manuscript for the trial, right? Usually this is the format.

270
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:29,190
And so often there's an introduction and a background of like, how did you actually get here?

271
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,250
And then viewers, the next few slides are a list of methodological guidelines.

272
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:41,370
And so it's just really these are things that you want to consider even before you've started the trial.

273
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:41,579
Right.

274
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:51,270
But certainly once you're writing a trial and or once you're reading a trial that like if you have a control group, why is that an ethical thing?

275
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,800
Right. Who's in the control?

276
00:30:52,800 --> 00:31:05,700
And how is that how is that chosen that you want to see this consort diagram of like everybody eligible, screened, enrolled, randomized, right?

277
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:12,839
You want to make sure that everybody is accounted for in this trial and who it's actually representative of this

278
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,930
says that the study should not have an impact in the value ability rate for major end points of greater than 15%.

279
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:25,350
They're basically saying that like they don't want to see missing nurse of more than 15% for the primary outcome

280
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:32,250
which sometimes you have more missing this ideally you do not this doesn't mean that you can't publish it.

281
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:40,290
You just need to be careful about how you're dealing with that and upfront about why there was that messiness.

282
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:46,669
If it's if it so happens. I would say that most messiness is like 10 to 20%.

283
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:52,400
And if it's over that, then there there's probably design issues or treatment issues.

284
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,840
It says in randomized studies, you want to report this comparison.

285
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,950
At the end of it. The sample size should be sufficient,

286
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,239
meaning that you should have had a sample size calculation prior to the study and you want to include it in there.

287
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,780
And it should be justified if you included interim analysis.

288
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,540
You want to say that you did that prior, right? And you accounted for the fact that you had these multiple looks.

289
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,940
You want to discuss any potential sources of bias.

290
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:32,980
So if you read a clinical trial, usually at the very end in the discussion, there's like limitations and strengths, strengths and limitations.

291
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:39,500
The limitation section usually lists any potential other sources of bias that you hadn't already accounted for in your analysis.

292
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,240
Your patients should be adequately described as always at table one.

293
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,900
You always have methods section, and that should be very clear.

294
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:55,940
Often what happens now, particularly in like really high quality medical journals or journals with clinical trials,

295
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,980
is that you have a short method section, right?

296
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,549
It's like a relatively short manuscript, but you attach the full protocol and or the statistical analysis plan as well.

297
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:09,380
And so that much of the greater detail is in the appendix.

298
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:17,630
And so there has been a lot of literature in terms of like how do you report trials?

299
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,629
And so there's kind of a standard template in some ways,

300
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:32,420
especially if you read these bigger these bigger journals like New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, British Medical Journal.

301
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,140
Right. You kind of see the same format for any type of trial.

302
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:42,830
And you want to see that you describe the plan, you report the results, you confess to the problems.

303
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,330
So that's not the strengths and limitations. And you're supposed to interpret objectively.

304
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:54,680
Right. And again, this is where the statistician really comes into play, that if you're if you've designed if you've been a part of a trial.

305
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:00,950
Right. Likely you've designed the trial and you analyze the trial. But the investigator is going to write up this manuscript for the most part,

306
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,670
and you're probably going to be editing it and you want to make sure that it's not.

307
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:12,620
It's not overly optimistic or overly pessimistic,

308
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,230
but you want to make sure that they're still being objective and that they're really

309
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:23,370
pointing out the limitations and that the results are not overly confident in what happened.

310
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:30,480
So your office is like honest broker in the trial or in any analysis, any collaboration.

311
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,220
All right. So this is just sort of like usually what it looks like if you've read any papers, you see this.

312
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,890
We don't have to go through this very, very much in detail.

313
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:54,700
But the results, you know, generally starts with like, so who's on here and who is lost of, you know, is this complete or is there loss of follow up?

314
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,610
Then there's this, you know, usually relatively simple comparison of the groups, the primary endpoint,

315
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:09,660
but then also kind of backed up by a more complex analysis, either longitudinal or thinking about accounting for any missing mass, etc.

316
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:16,410
There's always secondary endpoints. There should be adequate handling of these potential biases.

317
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,319
We always want to account for if we had interim analysis or if we're doing, we have multiple primary endpoints.

318
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,219
How we accounted for the multiplicity. Usually there's still a section about safety even in phase three, right?

319
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:35,220
We still want to account for the fact that there could be adverse events. And so safety is still included in all of these reports.

320
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:47,290
All right. So we already went over that. So the right the the goal of this class was to help you learn about clinical trials,

321
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:52,179
but also to get this intuition about where potential biases can come from and then how

322
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,360
you can attack the bias from many different courses that you've learned in this program.

323
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:05,019
And so hopefully it's sort of coming together and or will, once you're out of here and in the real world,

324
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,059
working on trials are going to be like, Oh yeah, I remember. This is something that we kind of talked about in 619,

325
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:16,060
but we really talked about and how I need to deal with it in missing data or longitudinal data or and survival,

326
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,800
etc. And what we're always doing as biostatistician is learning on the job.

327
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,830
We're learning about the disease settings, but we're also still learning statistical methods as they are new and as they're new to us.

328
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,799
So this is this class is trying to help a little bit.

329
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,460
You'll really get the the work in that with 699 next semester.

330
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:46,630
Okay. So let's move on to crossover designs. So I don't think any of the projects had a crossover design, did they?

331
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,240
Did anybody does anybody have a project crossover.

332
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,710
I think there's factorial designs, but not crossover designs, and there are smart designs, but not crossover designs.

333
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,880
So I wanted to make sure that you learned a little bit about crossover designs.

334
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:10,050
These are not used as often as just like parallel designs, but there are still use and can have a huge savings in sample size.

335
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,560
And so it's really important that you're aware of these designs.

336
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,280
We've talked about phase one designs, algorithmic model based.

337
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,980
We talked about phase two design, single arm and randomized.

338
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:29,400
And then when we talked about all the free phase three material, that mostly was like sample size and randomization and whatnot.

339
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,290
We were really focused on these two arm randomized trials, like a simple parallel trial,

340
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,580
which may be most of you thought was just like what we were going to talk about the whole time, right?

341
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,920
But there's a lot of different types of clinical trial designs that we're not able

342
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,209
to spend time on in here because we could have a whole year dedicated to them.

343
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:57,570
So we'll see more of them through your projects. And then today and post Thanksgiving, we'll talk a little bit about different types of designs.

344
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:03,389
So many other trial designs exist. There are multi arm designs, multiphase or multi-stage designs.

345
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,260
There are seamless designs of you will talk about potentially in your projects.

346
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,190
On everything that we've talked about so far,

347
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:19,350
we've talked about what are called like individual randomization designs where the individual participant is randomized to the treatment.

348
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:27,180
However, there are other levels of randomization, so there's cluster randomized trials where you randomize a group of individuals,

349
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,749
particularly usually randomized like sites, right, like Michigan.

350
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,790
We'll get this, Ohio State, we'll get this, MSU gets this right.

351
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,860
So you you randomize actual sites.

352
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,829
Alternatively, within Michigan, you can think about will this doctor all of his patients will get this thing for this doctor.

353
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,190
All of her patients will get this thing for this physician.

354
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:52,740
All their patients will get this thing right. We can randomize by these groups as opposed to the individual.

355
00:38:54,090 --> 00:39:01,860
We might do that if we're testing, for example, like implementation strategies, how do we implement a change at a practice?

356
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:14,280
We might do that if we are going to test an intervention for which if we give it to one person, that could affect other people in the area.

357
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,640
Right. And so therefore we have to actually just give it to the full group.

358
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:26,790
So there are cluster analyzed designs and what you're learning in 653, right, with the longitudinal design and or hierarchical design,

359
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:31,770
you'd have to account for that in these if you use one of these designs,

360
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,550
you have to account for the fact that people are nested within clusters which are randomized.

361
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,820
There are biomarker strategy designs,

362
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,300
there are a basket of umbrella designs of which we'll talk about post-Thanksgiving, we'll talk about crossover today.

363
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,500
And then there are even individual crossover trials which are called end of one trials.

364
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,250
And these are just some of the other trial designs that exist.

365
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,270
Right? This is a very small set of other trial designs.

366
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,140
There are tons and tons and tons of clinical trial designs.

367
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,790
And so don't don't leave here thinking that there's just A versus B, right?

368
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:17,570
There's a lot. And so that's why this is a whole area of biostatistics that people can study, because there's so much that we can we can do.

369
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,530
We can apply. Right. And we want to apply the right design to the right setting.

370
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,680
Okay. So we're going to talk about crossover designs today.

371
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:30,680
They're most often used in phase two, but they can be used in phase three, particularly for rare disease.

372
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:35,270
And they can also be used and what's called the phase four, which we haven't really talked about.

373
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:45,139
And that's like post-marketing where you're trying to perhaps get more information about these treatments, not just about the outcome,

374
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:51,710
but about safety and or like what's the mechanism of action of the treatment if that wasn't already known.

375
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,139
And post-Thanksgiving, we'll talk about master protocols, umbrella platform and basket designs,

376
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,960
which are primarily used in oncology in the phase two or face seamless to three space.

377
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:09,709
So we want to understand crossover designs and contrast them to standard parallel designs.

378
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,010
So how does it compare to just A versus B?

379
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,410
We want to understand the assumptions and when these can actually be used so they're not appropriate in every setting.

380
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,030
And then we want to understand how we model the treatment effect in a crossover design.

381
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:33,890
So this is a standard two by two crossover design patients are randomly allocated to a sequence of treatments.

382
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,680
So you either first get a and then you switch to B or you first get B and you switch to A.

383
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,360
So if there are two treatments,

384
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:48,440
every individual gets both treatments and you're randomized to which sequence you get them in and in between the treatments.

385
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,000
So if you first start with B before you get A, you have to have what's called a washout period.

386
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:00,560
So we want to take away any of the effects of that initial treatment so that now when we look at you and how you do on the next treatment,

387
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,590
it's not because of getting the first treatment, it's just that because you're getting that treatment at that time.

388
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,129
And so this is a design where we're going to have these repeated measures, right?

389
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,590
We're going to have how you did a baseline, how you did at the end of your first treatment, how you did that,

390
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:27,740
your baseline for your second treatment, and how you did at the end of your second treatment, if not even more measurements.

391
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:34,730
And our goal here, right, of a crossover design is to compare treatment A versus treatment B.

392
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,580
And the great thing about this trial is that now we don't just compare these things between patients, right?

393
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,590
We can actually for everybody we have there are two outcomes how you did on A and how you did on B.

394
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:50,210
So we have both within patient differences and between patient differences.

395
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,400
So you can imagine now that we have the within patient differences, right, we can gain a lot of power,

396
00:42:55,790 --> 00:43:03,139
increase our precision because we have a lot more data right within a person we've controlled for all those external factors,

397
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,840
all of those potential confounders that we can't when we just have a parallel design of A versus B.

398
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,640
Okay. So there's a bunch of vocabulary and crossover designs. There is the sequence.

399
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:22,100
So the sequence is like, what order do you get these treatments? Do you get A first and then B or B, and then there's also the period.

400
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:29,219
So there's period one and there's period two in a in this type of design that looks like this, right?

401
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,300
There could be more periods.

402
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:39,510
But this is essentially kind of like you might think of it as like a stage of the trial, but it's, you know, the time of the treatment administration.

403
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:44,880
So at this time period, one, did you get A or B and A period two, did you get a review?

404
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,819
The carryover effect is what we call any effect of the treatment.

405
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,540
That's from your initial treatment into the subsequent treatment.

406
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:03,899
So usually you want to have that washout period to get rid of any carryover effect, but you can't necessarily know that you did right.

407
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,670
So you potentially b to model for this and account for a possible carryover effect.

408
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,490
And that washout period is the time between the two treatment periods to try to get rid of a carryover effect.

409
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:22,200
If any of you are doing the project about smart design, sequential, multiple segment, randomized trials,

410
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:30,750
so they do not have a washout period and they actually want to take advantage of these carryover effects or what they call delayed effects.

411
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,670
Right. But here in crossover designs, we don't want carryover effects.

412
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:42,630
We want to get the pure treatment outcome on the initial treatment and the purer treatment outcome on a subsequent or second treatment.

413
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:54,550
Okay. So when can a crossover design be used? So the ideal settings are that the intervention effects are quick and they're reversible,

414
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,120
and so that we can have a short period of time in which we can see the intervention effect.

415
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:09,760
And when we take away the intervention, right, the effect of that intervention goes away so that our washout period can be short.

416
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,780
It fully washes out that treatment. And now we can give a subsequent treatment.

417
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:22,540
You know, one, would this not make sense? What if this is like a really terrible disease where withholding treatment is not ethical?

418
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,860
Right. We cannot do a crossover trial if we cannot have a wash out, period.

419
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:34,810
We cannot do a crossover trial another way or another where this wouldn't be appropriate.

420
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,979
The treatment actually takes a long time, right? There's a cumulative effect of treatment.

421
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,730
If this treatment is going to take a long time to be effective, we don't want to do a crossover trial.

422
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:52,930
It's going to take way too long. We also want that internal and external factors are constant over time.

423
00:45:52,930 --> 00:46:00,610
So this needs to be a stable disease, right? It can't be the fact that this disease is waxing and waning over time.

424
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:06,880
Right. That might affect the outcome. We actually want the disease to be stable and it's the treatment that is affecting the outcome.

425
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:15,820
Similarly. Right. Whatever else they're receiving outside of the trial, it remains constant over time.

426
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:20,530
These external factors aren't changing so that we can actually attribute the change,

427
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:28,030
the treatment and then ideally the endpoints have large between subjects variation.

428
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:36,850
And so we're doing a crossover because we have now we can look within patient, right?

429
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,940
We can get the within patient difference or sorry, the interest object is the within patient variation, right?

430
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:48,639
So that the the endpoint is going to be different on treatment A than treatment B for the same patient.

431
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,180
Right. We can actually see these differences. We want to account for that as well as accounting for patients for differences between patients.

432
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,530
So ideally this disease is chronic but it's stable, right?

433
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:06,850
So it's it's about the same over the entire period of this trial and any changes that we see is going to be due to the treatment.

434
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:14,890
So the advantages of a crossover design is that because we have these within patient different these within patient differences, right?

435
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:23,700
Every patient is getting both treatments, then we're automatically controlling for any confounding because we have the same person getting both right.

436
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,000
We can actually see that difference between treatment and treat B within a person.

437
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33,700
Whereas usually we're trying to we use that that world of potential outcomes to use

438
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,830
differences between people to have some information about differences even within person.

439
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:48,100
So if we have these within person differences, then our treatment effect estimates can be more precise.

440
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:55,270
We can have more precision, more more efficient treatment effect estimates and require fewer patients or participants in our trial.

441
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,240
Disadvantages of this design. So you can see that there are a fair amount of assumptions, right,

442
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,490
or restrictions on when this design is appropriate as to be a stable chronic disease.

443
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:15,710
It has to be a treatment that is relatively fast. It has to be a treatment that has a short half life so that we can have a short washout period.

444
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,730
And so if you don't have those things, then you shouldn't do this trial.

445
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:28,580
It can also be very difficult to validate your wash out period to ensure that it's the right amount of time and that you don't have carryover effects.

446
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,030
There's also the potential that there are period effects,

447
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:40,159
so that the fact that somebody receives something first, right is actually having an effect on the outcome.

448
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,309
Whereas if they have it second right, the outcome would be different than if they actually got it first.

449
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:51,980
So these are what's called period effects and we'll we can account for those in our analysis,

450
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,300
but if you don't account for them, then you're going to have biased results.

451
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,909
And a bigger problem is that every patient has the switch.

452
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:10,069
Right. But if you get on this trial and you're getting treatment and you're doing great on treatment, A, do you want to stop the drug and switch?

453
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:14,719
No. Right. So there is this issue with loss of follow up or noncompliance,

454
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,030
because if there is some dramatic effect, then participants don't want to actually do the second stage.

455
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:29,630
And so that's a disadvantage or a potential issue with the cross-over design and making all patients switch.

456
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:40,400
So when we compare a parallel design to a crossover design, right, and a parallel design,

457
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:45,470
every patient just gets one treatment and they every patient would get different.

458
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,930
Right. You'd have these, the parallel randomization of the two groups and a crossover design.

459
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:55,990
Every patient's going to get both treatments in a parallel design because you're just getting that one treatment.

460
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,170
It can be shorter. Right. We don't have to see the effect, that same effect on the other treatment.

461
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,480
So that's usually probably hassling half the amount of time that a crossover design would take.

462
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,430
A parallel design or simple size is going to be larger.

463
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:14,959
A crossover design or sample size is going to be smaller, but you can see there's going to be these trade offs, right?

464
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,190
Your set, your sample size can be smaller, but you're going to have to follow them for a longer period of time.

465
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:23,280
So the amount of resources saved is not necessarily right.

466
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,350
It's not like you're saving half the resources because you're actually doing this for a longer period of time.

467
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,470
In a parallel design, there are no carryover effects because you don't have that second period in a crossover design.

468
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,630
You can potentially have these carryover effects.

469
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:43,700
Parallel designs you can do in any kind of disease setting and in a crossover design really can only be chronic, stable diseases.

470
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:52,460
So you can see that parallel designs are much more flexible and appropriate in

471
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,470
various settings wherever crossover designs are going to be more restrictive,

472
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:05,060
but potentially have some savings associated with them in terms of sample size and resources, even if you go longer.

473
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,480
Okay. So this is the most common crossover design.

474
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,820
It's that figure that I showed you before. It's just in table format. We call it a two by two crossover.

475
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:25,190
So we have two treatments, two sequences and two periods such that patients are randomized to you get A and B or B then.

476
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,300
So this is the most common design. Right.

477
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:35,390
Why are they randomized? Because if we just had everybody get A first and then B first, right.

478
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:40,580
We can never see if there is a period of fact or we couldn't account for the sequence effect.

479
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,080
And so we wouldn't be able to say at the end of that trial that it was really due to the treatments.

480
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,100
It could be due to the fact that they got something first and we didn't account for carryover

481
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,389
effects or we didn't account for the fact that we got better by the end of the trial,

482
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,290
etc. Right. So this is why we have this randomization to the sequence.

483
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,980
However, you can have more periods, you can have more treatments, right?

484
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,129
So these are variations on the design. This is a three by two.

485
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,190
So there are two treatments, three periods.

486
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:21,329
And we can get you know, maybe you get A, B and B and then be A, right.

487
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:30,180
This is not you don't have every possibility here, but it's it's one possibility of randomization to these two sequences.

488
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,100
Here is a three by three crossover. So there are three periods and three treatments.

489
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:43,260
And so you could get randomized to either getting A, then B and C or B than C, than A or C than A and B, right.

490
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:49,980
So you can take any number of treatments, any number of periods and make that kind of crossover design.

491
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,309
So how do you decide on what that crossover design looks like?

492
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:57,330
Well, obviously, you have a disease setting and the number of treatments you want to look at.

493
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:05,340
Right. But then you want to think about these other terms to figure out if you have more than two treatments.

494
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,470
How many periods should you have and what should those sequences be like?

495
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,910
So there's a crossover design called Uniform Within Sequences,

496
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:23,950
and a crossover is uniform within sequences if each treatment appears the same number of times within each sequence.

497
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,230
So a crossover design that's uniform within sequences will remove the sequence effects.

498
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:38,180
Right. Now says that we can account for the fact it's not because you've got A than B than C, right.

499
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:49,299
We actually now are randomizing you to A and B and C, even A than C, C, than B than a randomizing you to these different sequences.

500
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:54,190
And so we've accounted for all of them. And so now our note we'll know that it's not due to the sequence effect.

501
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:02,000
A crossover design is uniform within periods if each treatment appears the same number of times within each period.

502
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,050
I'll show you some more examples and tables so that this is more clear.

503
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:12,940
But right, this is kind of like looking down the columns that if you look down at period one and you have three treatments,

504
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,530
you'll see A and B and C, right? If you look down at period two, you see A and B and C, right?

505
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,670
But they can be in different order.

506
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:27,490
So just the two by two being randomized to the sequence A, B and the randomized to sequence be, there's only two options.

507
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:31,720
We now have a design that's uniform within periods and sequences.

508
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:41,020
If we look at this design where there are two treatments and three periods, AB, A and B, maybe this is uniform within period.

509
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,370
So within every period, right. And period one there's.

510
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:52,049
You're either randomized to A or B, right into it's you got B or A and then A or B, right?

511
00:54:52,050 --> 00:55:01,440
So we see just each treatment within each period once, but it's not uniform within sequences because we see a twice year and B twice here.

512
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,910
Right. And so that design is uniform within period but not within sequences.

513
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:18,200
So that doesn't remove the sequence effects. You would call a design just uniform crossover if it's uniform within sequences and periods.

514
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,010
So ideally you have a design that's uniform within sequences and periods.

515
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:31,850
Okay. So where does this all come from? This comes way back to like the agriculture literature that first started.

516
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:41,820
This was like an agriculture. This is where they were first thinking about multi periods, I guess, randomization.

517
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,130
And so part of this is from what we call Latin squares.

518
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:54,800
So this is a foundation for our period, our treatment, crossover designs that can yield uniform crossover designs.

519
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,610
And so, for example, this is a for a period, right?

520
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:02,080
We have. So the patients say each periods like six months, right.

521
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,730
Every six months with a washout period,

522
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:12,590
the patient is going to receive some different treatment and the patient is randomize across one of these sequences.

523
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,969
And if we look down every period, right, we would be uniform within period.

524
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:20,600
If we see ABCD in every column, right?

525
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:28,760
And we're uniform in sequences, if we see that in every sequence that we're randomized to, each treatment is used only once.

526
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:36,320
And so we can see that here. Right. We have the four combinations of ABCD in.

527
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:46,380
Different sequences. And in each period we see that each letter, each treatment is only used once.

528
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:55,290
So even though there are 24 possible sequences, we've chosen these four so that we're uniform within period and uniform within sequence.

529
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,810
So this is the way in which we try to set up the crossover design, right?

530
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,520
With all of these combinations that we have multiple treatments, multiple stages.

531
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:11,940
We try to set up the crossover design so that we're uniform within treatment in our uniform, within sequence, in uniform, within period.

532
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:18,390
In addition, you can have what's called a balanced design.

533
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:26,970
And so a balanced design means that each treatment precedes every other treatment the same number of times.

534
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,530
Okay. So for example, here, right, a comes before all the other treatments.

535
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:37,139
Once B comes before all the other treatments, once C comes before all the other treatments.

536
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:40,620
Excuse me once and comes before once.

537
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:47,340
So this is a uniform within period, uniform within sequence, balanced design.

538
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:58,430
What's a strongly balanced design is if the treatment precedes every other treatment and itself the same number of times.

539
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,590
So then you would have like a BCD, right?

540
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:08,670
BBC And once you get strongly balanced, then you no longer have a uniform design because now you have a repeat of a treatment.

541
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:17,490
And so you have to decide, right? Is it more important to have a uniform design or is it more important to have like a strongly balanced design?

542
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:22,740
Usually people go for a balanced uniform, not a strongly balanced design.

543
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:31,839
So this is an example of a uniform and strongly balanced design where we have two treatments

544
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:41,709
but four periods so that A can come before itself and be the same number of times.

545
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:47,560
And in every period we see twice and be twice, and in every sequence we see A twice and B twice.

546
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:54,490
So this is just giving us more opportunities to account for potential period of X potential sequence effects.

547
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:01,270
Right. And so now they're all balanced so that we're going to say that any difference in the treatments is due to the treatment,

548
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,770
not due to the fact that they got first or second or third or fourth or they got it in period.

549
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:16,540
One or two or three or four. Right. Essentially, we're trying to cancel out these effects of the period and of the sequence by having use additional

550
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:22,930
randomization or additional right receiving of treatments over time for these patients.

551
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:28,470
Okay. I rarely ever see a trial like this.

552
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:34,010
To be honest, I don't usually see cross-over designs with two treatments that have for periods and for sequences.

553
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:43,040
Most crossover designs have two treatments two periods, a, B, B, A, because that's the most resource.

554
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:51,380
It uses the minimal amount of resources, and it will be completed in the shortest amount of time.

555
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,580
So unless you have a treatment that can be that can where the effects could be seen very quickly, you don't want to go for periods long.

556
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:09,860
Right? That's going to be way too long of a trial. And it also gives right more periods, give more chance to have noncompliance, drop out, etc.

557
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,380
Right. So we usually try to keep it simple.

558
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:25,100
Now if you have more than two periods, right, you can potentially have these additional carryover effects like this.

559
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,020
A let's go back to this one.

560
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:37,099
Right, the meet the first what we call first order carryover effect is like the effect of a affects the outcome of whatever you have on B, right?

561
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:43,309
That's a first order. Carryover effects. Another first or a carryover effect is whatever you did on B, right.

562
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,820
Still is affecting how you do on C, how are you doing?

563
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,710
C is affecting how a region D now you can have second order carryover effects.

564
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:57,860
How you did on A is now affecting how you do and see how you did on B is affecting how you did on D, right?

565
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,850
You can have third over third third over carryover effects, right.

566
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:10,819
How you did on a is now affecting how you did on D. However, usually we only account for first order carryover effects.

567
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:14,510
So we generally in our models would just say like, well,

568
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:20,089
I know that this period is closest to this period and perhaps this affects I didn't fully wash it out.

569
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:25,040
So it's affecting B, but I don't usually account for a still affecting C, I think that's long enough.

570
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,249
Go, that is out of the picture. Okay.

571
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:34,310
So that's the same we usually only carry we only usually only consider these first order carryover effects.

572
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:42,440
Okay. So here's the notation for the model that we're going to build. So you're going to see regression and here's what's in it, right?

573
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:46,970
We have what's called the direct effects of the treatments and B right.

574
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:50,690
So we have MU a movie. These are what we're really interested in, right?

575
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:57,079
How is the treatment affecting the outcome? And in a parallel design, we usually just have this right.

576
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,760
This is what we're interested in. But now in a crossover, we have to account for a potential sequence effect.

577
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,229
So we have V or NU, however you want to call it, we have a potential period effects.

578
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:11,840
We'll call that P and then we have these possible carryover effects and we'll call those lambdas.

579
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,040
And so we have a carryover effect from A to B and A carryover effect from B to A.

580
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:26,460
So Lambda and Lambda B. So remember, the sequence of fact is, did you get randomized to a plan B or did you get randomized to B with A?

581
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,979
The period effect is how what did you get a period of a right and I mean, period one.

582
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,880
And does that does it matter that you got it in period one or how you got it in period two?

583
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,250
Okay. So here's what the model looks like, right?

584
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:48,180
If we're looking at what's the effect? In period one for those who get the sequence A, B, right.

585
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:54,959
So the period one getting a so they have the effect of a, the direct treatment effect of a plus.

586
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,070
They have their period one effect v. Or is that the sequence?

587
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:07,620
Sorry. This is a sequence of fact, B of getting sequence A, B plus the period effect for period one.

588
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:16,730
Right. We're going to assume that these V and because we have two periods, two sequences, we're going to assume some contrast coding here.

589
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:24,360
So it's positive one for a period one and negative one for period two, piers.

590
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:33,329
And it's positive one for sequence AB and negative one for sequence b a often in biased out, we use dummy coding, not contrast coding, right?

591
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:38,909
But you can similarly use contrast coding. Okay, so period ones facts here, right?

592
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:46,379
We have the direct effects, we have the sequence effects. We have a period effect this effects for this person in sequence AB and period two while

593
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:51,060
they're now getting B so they have the direct effect of B plus their sequence effect,

594
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,270
right? They're still in the sequence. AB But they're in period two.

595
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:59,790
So we have this contrast coding for the period two and we have a carryover effects because they had a first, right.

596
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:06,569
So this is the lambda a similarly we can see what's the effect in period one for those who got the sequence.

597
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:10,340
V Well, they got treatment. B They're on this sequence.

598
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:16,950
B So we give them a negative one. We're just indicating that sequence and they're in period one and period two.

599
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:22,680
Now they're getting a so it's the direct effect of a they're in there in the sequence, right?

600
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,370
So this is still the indicator for this sequence B A they're in period two.

601
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:33,880
So we have the indicator negative one for that period and they got B first, which could carry over into their effective day.

602
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:37,710
So they have a carryover effect of Lambda B Okay.

603
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:45,389
So what's the actual effect of A Right. So now we got to figure out, well, where is A is here and A is here, right?

604
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:50,280
So we're trying to figure out the effect of A or we're averaging over the effects for

605
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,780
period one for those who got AB and the effect in period two for those who got VA.

606
01:04:55,140 --> 01:05:00,270
So this is just the average right of all those individuals.

607
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:06,720
So this is the average outcome for those at sequence one are sorry, those are sequence AB and period one.

608
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:11,190
And this is the average outcome for those who are in sequence B A for period two.

609
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,589
Right. And we take CAS, we're just taking the average here and then assuming right.

610
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:20,130
That there are randomized equally, that's what this happens here for.

611
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,480
Similarly, we can get the treatment effect of.

612
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,620
For me. Right.

613
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:34,070
And why? Why does it just go to this average? Right.

614
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:38,130
Well, if we look at. If we combine these. Right.

615
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:41,240
V cancels out. Right. I had a positive view here.

616
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:44,719
That was my sequence effect for AB and I had a negative V here.

617
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,080
That was my sequence effect for V. So now my sequence effects goes away.

618
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:52,130
It's not here because I had I took away.

619
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,090
Right. With my with uniform within sequence design.

620
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:59,950
I took away my sequence effect, my uniform within period design.

621
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:06,760
I took away my period effects. Right. Because I no longer I have period one and I have period two.

622
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:15,530
So now I'm I've averaged out that effect. So what's left is this potential accounting for the crossover effect, right?

623
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:27,950
And so if I actually look at my expected value of my treatment effects, well, it's my direct effects plus potentially this averaged carryover effect.

624
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:35,780
Right. And for my effect, my expected effect for treatment B is my direct effects, plus this potential carryover effect.

625
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:39,829
And so now if I take the difference between these two treatments, right,

626
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:43,129
I get what I'm actually interested in, the difference in the two direct treatments.

627
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:46,310
But I also have this carryover effect that I have to deal with.

628
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:53,209
Right? So ideally we got rid of the carryover effect with the washout period.

629
01:06:53,210 --> 01:07:00,230
That's what we want to assume, right? We want to assume that there's no more carryover effects because we don't want to deal with this.

630
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:03,290
Right. We don't know what this is. We don't know the true carryover effects.

631
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:09,589
And so we want to be able to say the difference in the direct treatments is really the difference in the treatments,

632
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:13,010
because we've counted for these potential wash over effects.

633
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:21,050
What this text is saying under here is that given I had a uniform in sequence and a uniform in period design,

634
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:26,239
I have canceled out my period in sequence effects such that the only thing

635
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,500
that is sort of upsetting my treatment effect is a potential carryover effect.

636
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:46,989
So one reason why you might have additional periods in a crossover design where you have two treatments,

637
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,410
but now you want to have additional periods, not just two.

638
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:56,470
It might be that you're trying to balance the carryover effects so that your carryover effects, your first order carryover effects wash out.

639
01:07:56,830 --> 01:08:03,580
But like I said, we usually don't do this because we don't have the time to wait for more periods.

640
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:11,140
If we can somehow say that our washout period washed out the carryover effects or that our carryover effects are equal,

641
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:16,570
so that going from A to B has the same carryover effect of going from B to A right.

642
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:22,840
Then they would cancel each other out. And so often we have to make these assumptions in our analysis.

643
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:34,630
So the way that we could get rid of the period sequence and wash out our end carryover effects is a strongly balanced uniform design.

644
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:42,250
But usually we don't have that strongly balanced design because it requires more periods and we don't have the time to do that.

645
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:51,790
And so often what we do is that we say that we've washed out the carryover effects.

646
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:58,670
In our model.

647
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:08,380
So this does also that often researchers argue that there aren't sequence effects because the sequence effects would just be randomization effects.

648
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:17,360
And for not we're not worried about that. But ideally, you would have a model that accounts for potential sequence and period effects.

649
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:24,050
And if you don't account for sequence effects, you at least account for potential period effects because period effects are quite common.

650
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:29,100
It's often not like when you're first in a trial, right? You do 0%.

651
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:33,710
You know, you're right in this trial, you're trying to figure it out. You're getting comfortable with the treatment.

652
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,359
Comfortable with the trial processes. And now. Right. You're getting the second treatment.

653
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:44,040
You're like more comfortable, right? Your first year in the master's program, really only on what's happening in the second year.

654
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,239
You're like, Oh, I got this right. Like, I know it's I know it's happening.

655
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,330
I know what's expected of me, right? It's the same thing in trials.

656
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:57,020
And so the fact that we have this like timeline, the time to right difference, that's going to that's pretty usual.

657
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:03,260
So usually we want to count for this period effect. Also, there's just a potential increased patient knowledge.

658
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:07,549
Maybe you're in this trial, you didn't know much about the treatments that are under consideration.

659
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:11,870
You didn't know much about the disease you're being treated for. And now you're in this trial.

660
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:15,019
And so you're like researching it all the time. You're looking up more, right?

661
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:22,280
So you just know more. And that can affect how you're doing and how you're maybe engaging in that trial.

662
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:26,180
And then there's also not just for the patient or participant,

663
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:31,819
but the clinician or investigators are improving over time and how they're dealing with the trial as well.

664
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:41,540
So period effects are quite common and so we often want to account for them in analysis,

665
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:51,440
but also prioritize a design which is uniform within periods as opposed to strongly balanced or a surly uniform within sequences.

666
01:10:53,500 --> 01:11:02,200
Okay. So just to show you a example of the game in statistical precision,

667
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:09,879
I want to show you a comparison of the number of patients required for a two by two crossover design.

668
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:15,670
So as you get randomized to AB or baa4 by two crossover design, right.

669
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:23,739
So this is you could get randomized to AB B, A, A or B or a two period parallel design.

670
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,350
So that's where you would get A or B, right.

671
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:34,940
And so just to make it more clear how it relates to saying that's the same amount of time as the crossover design, right?

672
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:38,979
I assume that they got a and they kept getting a right or they got B and they kept getting beat.

673
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:45,760
But it's just like a standard. You get A or you get the crossover design versus VS or sorry, parallel design versus the crossover design.

674
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:46,780
Okay.

675
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:56,500
So even though we have in total patients and that this integer is divisible by four, we want that because we could have as many as four periods here.

676
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:06,790
Okay. So in a two by two trial, we actually have 3.5 and patients randomized to each sequence, right.

677
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:13,809
So we have half the patients getting a B and half the patients getting A in a four by two crossover trial.

678
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:17,480
If we have total patients while quarter are going to each sequence, right,

679
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:22,510
a quarter are going to be a quarter are going to be a quarter are going and a quarter are going to be B.

680
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,980
And in the parallel design, a half are getting a and a half are getting B, right.

681
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:32,320
So this is just telling us how we're splitting up. These designs.

682
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:41,250
Okay. Now we have to get some more notation to look at the variability because we're interested in precision, right?

683
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:48,129
So the between patient variability is that difference in the outcomes because I differ from you right

684
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:55,840
in the within patient variability is that my outcome is going to differ from one treatment to another,

685
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,919
right, or from one time point to another. Usually within patient differences are smaller than between patient differences, right.

686
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:09,040
Like how I me the whole time. So my differences are going to be smaller than when you compare me versus you.

687
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:14,500
So I'm calling these within patient or sorry, these between patient.

688
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,810
It's terrible to use a W isn't it.

689
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:28,629
I'm calling the between patient variances w awb w a b so it's a is the between patient variance for a WBB is a between patient

690
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:36,220
variance for a treatment B and a B is that between patient covariance between A and B and then within patient variance,

691
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:40,270
I'm using sigma. So it's sigma AA and Sigma B.

692
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,400
Okay. So what does the variance look like for each one of these designs?

693
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:54,020
Well, it looks like this, and we don't have time to say why it looks like this, but just take me for it.

694
01:13:54,020 --> 01:14:02,870
Is that it looks like this. And if you did the if you were looking at how you know, how people were randomized to the sequences,

695
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:11,510
if you think about it, and that way you can figure out how these how these variances come across.

696
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:18,320
And so this covariance, this between patient covariance between treatments and B, that's almost always positive.

697
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:24,140
And so what you can see is that you compare these and it's hard to see here, but I'm going to show you in numbers.

698
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:28,280
But there's two by two design, you can see really.

699
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:35,899
Right. This one is the smallest here. And this, too, is the largest that we're subtracting from here.

700
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:47,830
When you look down this two by two crossover design that has the smallest variance across these different designs, but it says here,

701
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:53,180
right, if we're concerned about difference in carryover effects, that we want to have more periods to count those out.

702
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:56,720
But here we're assuming, okay, we've washed out the carryover effects. We don't care about them.

703
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:01,009
Okay. So let's see how what that looks like in terms of actual numbers, right?

704
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:09,799
So if I want a total sample size for a two sided alpha level test with say 100% times one minus B 2% power.

705
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,040
And this effect size is the difference in the two treatments. Right?

706
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:19,400
I can use this sample size calculation. It looks very similar to our one arm.

707
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:25,360
Difference in treatment for a normal, normally distributed outcome.

708
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,489
And so, for example, if we want at the 5% significance level,

709
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:36,610
90% power to detect an effect size of size ten and the within or the between treatment

710
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:42,700
variances and covariance is all are all 400 and within patient variances are 100.

711
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:48,580
For a two by two crossover trial, we need 21 patients for a four by two crossover trial.

712
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:51,760
We need 108 total patients for a parallel trial.

713
01:15:51,760 --> 01:16:00,730
We need 190 patients, right? So this sample size in savings is massive due to the precision that we gained in the within patient differences,

714
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:10,510
so that if we randomize people to A versus B, we need 100, 190 total patients to have 90% power to see a difference of ten.

715
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:18,520
Whereas if we have a two by two trial, we randomized people to first get A in A, B and B in, and they really need 21 total patients.

716
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,850
That's a massive, massive savings. Right.

717
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,960
So you can see why people are interested in doing crossover designs.

718
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:30,520
But we have to remember that they're not always appropriate for a setting.

719
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:35,080
Right. We have to have a treatment that is appropriate in the disease setting that is appropriate

720
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:39,640
and a time period that's appropriate to see these differences in order to use this design.

721
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:47,620
Okay. And so then we have our treatment effects and we want to test to see if those

722
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:51,640
differences are if there really is a difference between these treatments.

723
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:59,560
And what we do is that we usually assume that the carryover effects have either washed out or they're the same, so that they essentially cancel out.

724
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:06,820
And we can just use a to sample T test or a wilcoxon rank sum test here.

725
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:17,629
If the outcome is binary, we can use a I think this should say a parity test of the outcome is binary.

726
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,350
Then you use a McNamara's test or a logistic regression.

727
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:26,060
If it's time to events, you usually don't have a crossover design because once the event happens, you can't undo the event.

728
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,850
So you don't often ever see these crossover designs in time to event outcomes.

729
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:38,629
And then if the design is more complex than a two by two, you can't do these simple t tests right or wilcoxon rank.

730
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:44,209
Sometimes you have to you have to use mixed effects models or generalized estimating equations.

731
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:49,250
Those things that you're learning in 653 because you have these longitudinal measurements, right?

732
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:53,210
So now you have to correctly account for those once you have more than two periods.

733
01:17:54,530 --> 01:18:00,559
Okay. So we'll end here. This is just an example of a crossover trial, one that I actually worked on.

734
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:08,390
I was in diabetes and they were they these drugs were already approved, but they're interested to see like an off target effect.

735
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:18,020
And so they did a crossover design. This is like the most complicated looking, but figure for the design.

736
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:21,079
I don't recommend doing so. They're showing the figure in this way.

737
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:27,440
I didn't design it. But you can you can see that they got this drug and then this drug or they got this drug and then that drug,

738
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:31,790
but they added all this other stuff that makes it look horribly difficult.

739
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:37,220
Anyway, you can see how we did the sample size and the analysis.

740
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:46,129
And generally I just want you to know that the crossover designs can save sample size substantially based on those within patient differences.

741
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:51,980
However, there are lots of restrictive assumptions on using this design, hence why it's not used all that often.

742
01:18:52,280 --> 01:19:01,070
And if you are going to use this design, then you need to consider the potential period and sequence and carryover effects in the analysis.

743
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,180
All right. I will see you Thursday for your test.

744
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:28,820
Come with your page of notes and a penalty pen or pencil and you'll have the hour and I'll see you at 645.

745
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:43,560
What is it that you think I'm going to answer?

746
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,400
Designation only allows you to start the projector.

747
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:51,810
Oh, sorry.

748
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:55,610
Short notes as my philosophy, because I just.

749
01:19:55,610 --> 01:20:09,730
That it's going to be nice to see you again.

750
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:22,760
Yes, yes, yes.

751
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:38,360
So you would have no use that time for the study.

752
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:48,180
So yeah. So you're kind of like kind of ASCO like.

753
01:20:48,410 --> 01:21:00,230
So we had three references to figure out the number of people, you know,

754
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:13,310
so that people are expecting it says an indicator is a use a sign to see somebody right like this where I have like some sequins, right.

755
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:18,700
So I usually see a part of the design, right?

756
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,070
I guess we have a lot of questions.

757
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:28,400
Right. I'm actually so why aren't you really like yeah.

758
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:40,250
When you when you actually what you're doing right now you're just for discovering things I think.

759
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:50,750
Why not explaining their data? Yeah, but I just feel like okay, exactly.

760
01:21:50,750 --> 01:22:00,220
Now that what we feel like, we don't ever see other examples of questions and that's why that was okay.

761
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:05,300
And I know I haven't responded to your question about just Mellinger.

762
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:20,360
I think that like is there any because there's so many which really quickly, I was wondering actually just I'm going to be nice.

763
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:24,200
So I was just trying to figure out how it times yeah.

764
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:31,080
Nicely yeah. And it's like we do that already have the two other models which I feel like it's pretty good right.

765
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:39,650
I mean if they were primary outcome, I think it's all like that looks like that for you because.

766
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:50,959
Yeah. Because not only do you have to do negative or zero flips, but it's like a generalized equation which just doesn't sound.

767
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,100
I mean, the other option is.

768
01:22:53,660 --> 01:23:03,200
Fertile model, the place where you do a model that you would do, like a cricket scene with zero versus four, like zero versus not zero.

769
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:07,910
And then you do no regular DJ for anything, not zero.

770
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:12,410
That's cool for a while, but I also just don't think that's necessary for a pilot.

771
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:21,620
So I'll respond. I'll respond to either today or other, etc. I'll double checking, let you know.

772
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:26,180
Yeah, I don't. Yeah. So. Question. Yeah.

773
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,350
What else we've had.

774
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:34,750
Well there is some question about was that project.

775
01:23:35,550 --> 01:23:42,580
Yeah. Yeah. Remind me what we have achieved and that's phase two.

776
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:47,200
Yeah. So we were wondering what sounded like calculation.

777
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:57,030
Good. You know what I think is one thing like keyboard, the head of the keyboard effective.

778
01:23:57,050 --> 01:24:09,380
So something like a good effect and then like, ah like I should give us just like one of these like set up like write this.

779
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:17,450
So I was thinking that what we would do is and if we're on the same page on crazy ideas and great.

780
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:21,829
Let me show, you know, I'm like following you 100% up to here.

781
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:22,340
Yes. Okay.

782
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:33,350
So what I'm thinking is, since we have this for like nothing from phase one is currently affecting anything right now at this point, right, Bruce?

783
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:36,400
Bruce, do you still have one or one more?

784
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:40,760
And then I think that that's actually like.

785
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:47,190
Recruiting new recruits to it is like that.

786
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:54,299
So like that. Like that first stage is going to be like that.

787
01:24:54,300 --> 01:25:08,560
Like maybe four people plus like, you know, like this is the thing is more and more people who are sort of like, okay, okay.

788
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,940
So and then there's the number of responses to that.

789
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:20,790
And I just always told the like agents are great that with the responses to Yeah.

790
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:44,950
So. So none of the world number of responses was not only or was like how responsive that we wanted to be greater than our one just for if we want it.

791
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,530
If the drugs are not in the case, of course. Okay. That is what I was.

792
01:25:49,530 --> 01:25:54,960
I just wanted to make sure we are bringing this into here, too, and not just this anger that exists.

793
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:59,909
Okay. So are we going to have simulation to, like, model?

794
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:05,940
How many are coming to that process? Like this thing that we're bringing actually happens in the trial?

795
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:14,550
I'm thinking because like, I don't know how we would all like we would.

796
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:21,520
Yeah. If we like different times. Is that so much?

797
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:27,410
So I just think this is the design. Yeah.

798
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:33,120
Yeah. I don't think it's. I'll ask her about whether she read the simulations only to think it's going to

799
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,570
happen based on what we know because we don't know too much about the drug.

800
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:43,199
The other thing I was wondering too is how is this going to be happening at the same time as this?

801
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:51,840
So like, you know, you have a patient coming in now the minute that we get one on here, they're not coming.

802
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:58,150
We just have to wait until the end of class so we might be able to it.

803
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:06,760
That's no reason to move on to things, to see how you're like, what dosage you putting on.

804
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:10,959
Right, exactly. Okay, cool. Those were like the things that I was that I like.

805
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:16,080
It was like, okay, I know we're bringing these people into this and one day, but how are you considering the responses?

806
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:19,350
Keep keeping them in simulations. And then what?

807
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:30,390
We're actually going to be very close that way I can actually charge a little bit longer.

808
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:37,840
So I'm not really I thought we were like, this is what they just thought based on what the group said.

809
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:48,720
They just finance like, you know, have a run through what we're doing and then ask if they want if she wants to look for an individual,

810
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:57,290
like how would you find them, you know?
