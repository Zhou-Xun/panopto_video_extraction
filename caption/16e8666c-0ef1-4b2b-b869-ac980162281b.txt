00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,335
Hi, welcome back
to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:16,710
So this point, I'm sure
you're fascinated about

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,820
the mechanisms of

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,580
DNA methylation and
histone modification,

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,030
as well as their association
with human health outcomes.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,790
However, you may be
beginning to ask yourself,

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,210
"How do I measure
or quantify them in

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,590
the real world if I have

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,065
my own research question
I want to explore?".

10
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:35,900
In this module, we are going to

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,480
provide an introduction
to the type and

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,030
methodologies we commonly use to

13
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,770
assay DNA methylation and
histone modifications.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,385
The learning objectives
are twofold.

15
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:50,570
First, to describe
the three basic types

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,825
of epigenetic
analyses, and second,

17
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:57,545
to understand study design
limitations by sample,

18
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:02,170
throughput and cost, as
well as data storage.

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,125
When we approach the measurement
of epigenetic-marks,

20
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:08,660
there are three basic flavors.

21
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,290
The first is what I
call global analysis.

22
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,870
So this is to assess
the global levels of

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,760
DNA methylation or

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,825
a particular histone
modification in the genome.

25
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,350
The thing to remember about

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,795
global analyses is
that they are not

27
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:24,830
linked back to

28
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,460
a particular or specific
location in the genome.

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,860
It just gives you a
broad measurement of

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,140
the amount of DNA
methylation or histone mark.

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,570
For example, if a mom
consumes a lot of folic acid,

32
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,520
we can measure the
global levels of

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,560
DNA methylation in the
infant cord blood,

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,180
but we won't know anything about

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,990
the particular genes
that are methylated.

36
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,880
In the literature, you'll
see two different types of

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,880
global analyses, one is LINE1,

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,310
which is simply a measurement of

39
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,660
the global levels of

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,245
DNA methylation at repetitive
content in your genome,

41
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,140
as well as an assay called LUMA.

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,600
The second flavor of

43
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,125
epigenetic analyses is
what I call gene-specific.

44
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,580
It can also be called
candidate gene or targeted.

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,175
This is a very hypothesis-driven
approach where you have

46
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:18,260
a particular region
of the genome or

47
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,780
a particular gene that
you have a hypothesis on.

48
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,890
For example, does exposure
to the endocrine disrupting

49
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,530
compound Bisphenol A affect

50
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,290
DNA methylation or
histone modification

51
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,365
at the estrogen receptor Alpha.

52
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:35,120
So you can use specific assays to

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,410
look only at estrogen
receptor Alpha.

54
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,665
Examples include bisulfite
conversion and sequencing.

55
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:44,300
There are a number of
different platforms

56
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,380
that you'll hear about this,

57
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,085
including pyrosequencing
as well as sequenom.

58
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,855
The third flavor of

59
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,500
epigenetic analyses are
called epigenome-wide,

60
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,375
and it does exactly what it says.

61
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,195
It looks at the entire epigenome,

62
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:04,185
the millions of CpG sites in
our epigenome at one time.

63
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:06,260
So you can imagine that this is

64
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,335
much more expensive
approach and also has

65
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:11,960
much more complications as far as

66
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,940
how much data it
gets back and how we

67
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,420
store and how we
analyze this data,

68
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,680
and because of this complexity,

69
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,345
there are two different types of

70
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,160
epigenome-wide approaches.

71
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,425
These can be truly unbiased,

72
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:28,040
where you are really looking
at every possible CpG site,

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,875
every possible histone
modification in the genome,

74
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,110
or what we call a
biased approach,

75
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,149
which will still look across

76
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:39,330
the genome but won't look at
every single possible area,

77
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,640
and this is meant to reduce

78
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,520
the complexity in the analysis,

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,230
but also the price
tag of the assay.

80
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,070
I really liked this chart
because it is a way that

81
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,340
you as a researcher or a
public health practitioner,

82
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,585
can begin to think about

83
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:58,044
your study design
and your question,

84
00:03:58,044 --> 00:03:59,995
and whether you want to do

85
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:02,140
a global candidate gene or

86
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,725
epigenome-wide approach
in your study.

87
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:08,035
So the first question you
might ask yourself is,

88
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:10,900
"Do I want to do a global
analysis or do I have

89
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,020
a specific region in the
genome that I'm looking at?".

90
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,630
So if you decide to
do a global analysis,

91
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,565
this is where you would go down

92
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:21,325
the left side of the node here,

93
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:23,455
in which you would do
a genome-wide assays

94
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:26,165
like LUMA or LINE
that I introduced.

95
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,590
The exact technologies that
are listed under these boxes,

96
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,220
are not as important as

97
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,425
the questions that you ask
yourselves to get there,

98
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:34,910
and that's because the field of

99
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,580
epigenetic technology is rapidly

100
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,050
evolving since there are

101
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,730
slight permutations to each of

102
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,634
these different types of assays,

103
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:45,095
which we can go into
in greater detail.

104
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,105
So let's say, though you have

105
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:48,710
a specific region
of the genome that

106
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,570
you want to look
at, this would be,

107
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,480
for example, the
estrogen receptor Alpha

108
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,420
or all genes that endocrine
disruptors target.

109
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,190
In this case, you would go down

110
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,640
that locus-specific node,
and when you get there,

111
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,770
you have a second
question to ask yourself,

112
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,170
"Do I want to look at
a targeted approach,

113
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,560
so one candidate gene,

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
or do I want to look at

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,230
the whole epigenome
at one time?".

116
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,925
Often cost can help

117
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:15,820
figure out the answer
to that question.

118
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,660
But let's say that cost was

119
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,880
not an option here,
so for example,

120
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,290
if you really just
wanted to focus

121
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,940
in on estrogen receptor Alpha,

122
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,485
you will go down that
candidate gene node.

123
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,320
Then some of the final questions

124
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,580
you would ask yourself is,

125
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,275
"Do I want to be quantitative
or just qualitative?".

126
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,800
If you really need to know

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,200
the exact percentage of
DNA methylation that

128
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,240
is changing following an exposure

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,010
to an endocrine
disrupting chemical,

130
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,230
then you'll want to take
a quantitative approach.

131
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,665
If you just want to
get a relative answer,

132
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:47,655
you can take a less
sensitive approach.

133
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:50,495
So finally, going
back to the question

134
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:53,015
of genome-wide versus
candidate gene,

135
00:05:53,015 --> 00:05:54,860
let's say you have
a wonderful budget

136
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,305
and you can do a
genome-wide experiments,

137
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:59,540
then you have to
ask your question,

138
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,830
"Do I want to take advantage
of array-based technology?".

139
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,110
In the cases of human studies,

140
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,170
there's some wonderfully priced
and very effective arrays

141
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,885
called the illumina bead array,

142
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:14,614
or do you want to look at
next-generation sequencing,

143
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:16,760
which can look at
four or five million

144
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,995
CpG sites at one time.

145
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:20,870
So these are some of
the questions that

146
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,310
you'll ask yourself
when you begin to

147
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,825
formulate your own hypotheses
and study designs.

148
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,935
This table from 2012

149
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:30,440
summarizes the state
of field regarding

150
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,870
DNA methylation and looking at

151
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,455
folates in human population
and animal studies.

152
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:40,250
We can see that the vast
majority of studies at

153
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,790
this time are either
global or candidate gene,

154
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,335
with only one study,

155
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:47,450
the second one on
this list looking at

156
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,319
epigenome-wide effects
of folate exposure,

157
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,250
and in this case
it was looking at

158
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,400
DNA methylation in
primary breast tumors.

159
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Other interesting
observations in this table

160
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,404
include a bias towards
more human studies,

161
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:03,320
and when you look at the bottom,

162
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,745
which are the animal studies,

163
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:09,215
a bias towards more adult and
less developmental studies.

164
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:13,715
Here's a second example of
types of epigenetic analyses,

165
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:17,165
this time with metals as
the exposure of interest.

166
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,145
So you can see that
in the first column

167
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,010
there's arsenic,
nickel, chromium,

168
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,260
cadmium, and mercury,

169
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,785
and different histone
modifications.

170
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,285
In the second column,

171
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,490
you'll see the
nomenclature for the type

172
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,345
of histone modification
that's investigated.

173
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:36,150
In the third column,

174
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,720
you'll see the gene and
you can note if it's

175
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,910
a candidate gene or whether

176
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,675
it's a global analysis
with the word global.

177
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,245
In the fourth column,

178
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,840
the authors have denoted
whether the modification

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,170
is inactive or
silencing modification.

180
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:55,130
Of note, unless you investigate
all the references,

181
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,320
you cannot identify
the model system

182
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,170
used by this table alone.

183
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,210
But there are many studies
here that are done in humans,

184
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,070
some studies that
are done in mice,

185
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,990
and then there are a few
studies that are done

186
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,545
in other less common
animal models.

187
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:12,440
In the case here of metals
and histone modifications,

188
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,900
we're seeing a lot of

189
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,730
candidate gene approaches and

190
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,334
a number of global approaches,

191
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,300
but we are not yet seeing,

192
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,760
as of this time in 2011,

193
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,145
the use of epigenome-wide
approaches

194
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:28,645
to analyze metals in
histone modifications.

195
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,205
In addition to the type of assay,

196
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:34,280
there are several other
study design considerations

197
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,095
for epigenetic studies.

198
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,270
The first listed here deals with

199
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,240
the amount of sample needed
to perform the assay.

200
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,160
With some assays requiring

201
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,260
a relatively large amount of DNA,

202
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,445
such as greater than two
micro-grams of DNA and

203
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,285
other assays that require
really high quality DNA.

204
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:55,129
So that, although we
can get a lot of DNA

205
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:56,555
out of certain studies

206
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:58,430
that we are recruiting
in the field,

207
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,470
it might not be stored in

208
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,630
a way that we can get
very high quality DNA.

209
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,640
So you have to think about
these things when you're

210
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,255
picking which assay to evaluate.

211
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,430
The second consideration
in which we'll examine

212
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,550
more on the next slide
is sample throughput.

213
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,520
Several years ago when I
started out in this field,

214
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,185
we could only look at
one sample at a time.

215
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,650
Now, there are assays
where you can look at

216
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,330
96 or even over 300 different
samples at one time.

217
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,399
These are relatively low labor,

218
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,430
but they can end up
being quite costly.

219
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,100
The third consideration
on this slide

220
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,250
refers mostly to those
epigenome-wide studies.

221
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,285
When you start to develop

222
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:41,975
and generate data on
the whole epigenome,

223
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:45,635
this data can often be
quite complex to analyze,

224
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:47,390
so we often collaborate with

225
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,235
bioinformaticians to do this,

226
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:52,355
but also can be
really a lot of data.

227
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:53,840
So you have to think
about how we're

228
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,340
going to store this data,

229
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,130
which can come back
in terabytes from

230
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,680
one experiment on the
servers that you use.

231
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,670
Finally, the last point listed

232
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,680
here is, inherent public health,

233
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,665
we're often looking at humans

234
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:09,600
or animal models that
are well-characterized.

235
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,270
But to take advantage of some of

236
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,400
these more
epigenome-wide studies,

237
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,015
you have to have a sequence
of the model system.

238
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,365
So for example,

239
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:20,930
last year I was working
with a graduate student for

240
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,765
Michigan State who had a
population of hyenas in Kenya,

241
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,250
and they were looking
at the maternal care of

242
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,680
the hyenas and
thinking about whether

243
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,780
a high maternal care reduce

244
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,070
stress and also change the
epigenome of the offspring.

245
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,530
But doing the study was
quite interesting when we

246
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,870
started because there
was no hyena genome,

247
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,770
and so we had to rely
on other approaches

248
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,840
to figure out the DNA
methylation of the hyena DNA.

249
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,710
In this slide, I want to
focus on sample throughput.

250
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,110
This is a really
important emerging issue

251
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,390
in the field of
epigenetics because we

252
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,285
can now look at millions of
CpG sites in one experiment,

253
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:07,310
but we may not be able
to look at millions of

254
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,830
subjects because of the cost and

255
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,715
relatively high-labor
intensive process.

256
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:16,490
So here you can begin to see
a plot of sample throughput

257
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,140
against genome coverage of

258
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,840
various DNA methylation
techniques.

259
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,480
Throughput is determined
by the number of

260
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,510
samples that can be
analyzed per experiment.

261
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,240
Coverage is determined
by the number of

262
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,100
those CpG sites in

263
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,010
a genome that can be
analyzed per experiment.

264
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,895
So starting on the top
left of this graph,

265
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,530
you can see that there are

266
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,325
many different assays such
as MethylLight and EpiTyper,

267
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:47,120
which can analyze lots
of samples at one time,

268
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,784
so thousands of samples,

269
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,720
but they only look
at a small number of

270
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,665
CpG sites between one and 100,

271
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:57,320
and as you go from the top
left to the bottom right,

272
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,660
you have a huge increase

273
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,790
in the numbers of
CpGs that we can

274
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,590
analyze such that
you get down there

275
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,630
to MeDIP-seq and WGBS,

276
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,315
which stands for Whole
Genome Bisulfite Sequence.

277
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:13,865
We can look at millions of
CpG sites in one experiment,

278
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,710
but the numbers of
samples that we

279
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,860
can assay is quite low.

280
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,774
So this can become a trade-off,

281
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:22,265
especially in human
population studies,

282
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:24,575
where we often need large numbers

283
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,995
of samples to see an effect.

284
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:30,590
These genome-wide technologies
are very interesting,

285
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,090
but not at the sacrifice of

286
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,819
the number of samples
that we can use.
