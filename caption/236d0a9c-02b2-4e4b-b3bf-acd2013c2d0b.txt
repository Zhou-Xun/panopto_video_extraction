1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,270
Hey, this is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,830
We're going to dive back into

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,600
our analysis of the MPLS dataset.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,830
This time we're going to
incorporate inference by using

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,080
the likelihood ratio
test to perform

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,360
hypothesis testing on questions

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,010
we've already been exploring.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,460
Particularly whether there's
evidence for an effect

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,570
of time in risk group
effect on reading scores.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,790
We have fit mixed models to

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,850
the MPLS reading scores
in our previous lectures.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,370
We've argued that these models

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,840
are more appropriate because they

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,250
properly handle the within

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,395
student correlation
of test scores.

16
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:47,240
Although we observe the trend of

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,950
increasing scores with grade,

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,310
we have not formally
tested that hypothesis.

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,420
Likewise, we consider
test scores by groups.

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,075
Most notably student risks,
are graphical analysis,

21
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:02,030
descriptive statistics, and
fitted mixed models all

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,380
hinted that scores tend to be

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,570
higher among the
advantaged students.

24
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,600
But is there sufficient
evidence to definitively reject

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,050
the notion that risk group
does not affect test scores?

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,670
For these questions, we will use

27
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,375
likelihood ratio tests to
perform hypothesis testing.

28
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,135
As a quick reminder,

29
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:21,940
the likelihood
ratio test, or LRT,

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,730
tests the significance of
regression parameters by

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,635
comparing the fit between
a pair of nested models.

32
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:29,920
In the following
slides we'll use R

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,170
to perform LRT that formally

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,330
tests for grade in
group effects in

35
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,375
the mixed model framework
for the MPLS data.

36
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,880
To perform an LRT and R we

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,680
first need to fit the
two nested models.

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,135
In this case, if we want to
test for a grade effect,

39
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:48,430
our full model will
include fixed effects for

40
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,160
the intercept and the
grade effect or slope.

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,110
We will include a
random intercept to

42
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,265
account for the within
student correlation.

43
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:59,465
This model is fit as usual
using the lmer function.

44
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:01,950
Next, we fit the reduced model.

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,160
This model contains
all the parameters

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,225
from the full model,

47
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,740
except for the ones
that we want to

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,765
perform the hypothesis test on.

49
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:10,550
Here we will exclude just the

50
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,445
Beta one term for grade effect.

51
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:14,420
Note that we have left
the random component

52
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,800
of the model unchanged,

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,095
specifically the
random intercepts.

54
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,495
Finally, to perform the LRT,

55
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:22,610
we use the ANOVA function in R,

56
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,830
passing it the objects
for the fitted,

57
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,115
full, and reduced models.

58
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,945
Here's the output
that R will return

59
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:32,710
for the likelihood
ratio test in ANOVA.

60
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,819
The output nicely summarizes

61
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,130
the nested models
using the analysis.

62
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,840
Note that it's up
to you to ensure

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,775
that the models
are infact nested.

64
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:44,120
R will perform the ANOVA on
whatever models you supply,

65
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,600
even if they are not
nested. So be careful.

66
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,710
We can confirm that
the difference between

67
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,780
our full model m.grade and

68
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,460
the reduced model m.null is
the grade fixed effect term.

69
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,430
Details for each model
are then provided,

70
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,005
including the number
of parameters

71
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,000
in several goodness
of fit measures.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,574
Remember for the LRT,

73
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:06,145
we will be using the
deviance metric.

74
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:09,410
Note that the full
model m.grade contains

75
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,930
one additional parameter
over the reduced model

76
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,295
m.null corresponding
to the grade effect.

77
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,400
The red box shows the
results of the LRT,

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,575
specifically the
chi-square statistic,

79
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,065
the degrees of freedom,
one in this case,

80
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:26,380
and the corresponding p-value
for the hypothesis test.

81
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,100
The p-value for the hypothesis
test that the grade effect

82
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,260
parameter is equal to zero is

83
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,705
8.2 times 10 to the minus 12.

84
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:36,790
Meaning we have very
strong evidence to

85
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,710
reject the null hypothesis
of no grade effect.

86
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,865
We finally have formal
statistical evidence for

87
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:44,470
increasing reading test scores

88
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,810
between the fifth
and eighth grades.

89
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,195
Now that we've established that,

90
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,355
let's take a look at how an LRT

91
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,810
based on standard linear

92
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,325
regression would have played out.

93
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:55,900
Remember, this is not

94
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,750
the correct way to
analyze the data,

95
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,790
but let's look to see if it
would have made a difference.

96
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,085
We start by fitting the
standard regression analogs

97
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,890
of the full and reduced
models by simply removing the

98
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,605
random intercept term and
using the LM function in

99
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:13,420
R. The reduced model
contains just an intercept,

100
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,380
and the full model contains

101
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,305
the intercept and
grade effects slope.

102
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,810
Again, the ANOVA function will

103
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,435
perform the likelihood
ratio test.

104
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:26,150
Here's the corresponding
output table.

105
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,800
Like before, this is

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,770
a hypothesis tested Beta
one, the grade effect.

107
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,915
Well, we get a very
different answer if we

108
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:35,285
incorrectly use standard
linear regression.

109
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:39,890
In this case, the
p-value is 0.05182.

110
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,750
We would not even reject the null

111
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,840
for an Alpha level
of five percent.

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,055
Contrast this to the mixed model,

113
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:48,590
which had a p-value
of 8.2 times 10 to

114
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,755
the minus 12 for the
same hypothesis tests.

115
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:53,990
This example clearly demonstrates

116
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,130
the effect that ignoring

117
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,200
correlation and improper use

118
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,340
of statistical methods
can have on inference.

119
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,960
Finally, let's return to

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,460
a question that
we've been exploring

121
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,630
throughout the course.

122
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,030
Namely, whether there's
a difference in reading

123
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,215
test scores between

124
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:12,050
advantaged and
disadvantaged students.

125
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,670
We now have the means to

126
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,695
formally test the null hypothesis

127
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:19,915
of equal test scores between
students regardless of risk.

128
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:23,090
Here are model containing
fixed effects for

129
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,355
intercepting grade
and random intercepts

130
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:26,855
will be the reduced model,

131
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:28,895
and the model with
an additional term

132
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,225
for risk group will
be the full model.

133
00:05:31,225 --> 00:05:33,950
Again, we will use the
ANOVA function to perform

134
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,600
the likelihood ratio tests

135
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,690
and we get the following output.

136
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,670
This likelihood ratio
tests corresponds to

137
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,290
the null hypothesis that

138
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,780
the risk parameter
is equal to zero.

139
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,580
This test has a p-value of

140
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,100
1.8 times 10 to the minus fifth.

141
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,505
We have strong reason
to reject the null.

142
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:52,930
Combined with the sign of

143
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,260
the risk parameter
estimate, negative 19.6,

144
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,645
we finally have
statistical evidence

145
00:05:58,645 --> 00:05:59,815
to support the claim that

146
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,350
advantage students have
higher mean test scores

147
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,735
than disadvantaged students
based on this study.

148
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:08,050
With this step complete,

149
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,320
our analysis of the MPLS
dataset has gone from

150
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,990
an exploratory
graphical analysis to

151
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,134
a formal inferential analysis

152
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:18,920
of our original
motivating questions.

153
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,800
In this lecture, we used

154
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,350
the likelihood ratio
test to formally

155
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,420
perform hypothesis tests of

156
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,540
mixed model regression
parameters.

157
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,770
Something we couldn't do with
the usual Wald statistic.

158
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,870
In so doing, we provided

159
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,700
valid statistical evidence for

160
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,120
both grade in risk group
effect on test scores.

161
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,340
We also showed why
it's so important to

162
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,770
use models that are
appropriate for the data.

163
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,725
Misuse of a standard
linear regression model

164
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:48,695
would have obscured a true
