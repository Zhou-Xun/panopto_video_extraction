1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:11,630
Any questions about? So, Dr. Gates, any questions about any of this?

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,860
Is this stuff you already knew? Some of those things are new, but this is unavoidable.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:28,800
Okay. What would be the most common or most common cause of death in the timeline in the under 28 days?

4
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,030
So I would say respiratory problems.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
And we can look this up, I don't know. But this is my clinical guess.

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,889
Respiratory problems, poor feeding. So they're not feeding because they're there's only breastfeeding, right?

7
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,390
Because there is nowhere to get any other kind of formula or anything like that

8
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,610
in low resource settings usually are it's very expensive it if it is available.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,960
So it would be respiratory, poor, poor feeding.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,810
And it was tetanus for a very long time.

11
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,690
There's a lot of there's a lot of cultural things around caring for an infant's cord.

12
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,649
And one of the things that is I've seen a lot is that traditional midwives and families or families will be told

13
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,729
by traditional midwives that they should use herbs around the cord to help dry the cord or to keep the cord moist,

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,100
which is exactly the opposite of what they want to do.

15
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,490
And so then they'll get an infection around the cord and they'll get tetanus and they'll and that will be the cause of death.

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,740
So those are the main things that I've seen in that age bracket.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,140
And then if there's any trauma related to the birth. So if there was if the baby was asphyxiated and yet they live for some time after.

18
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,520
But then that would usually be something neurological.

19
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,180
Yeah. And then the other thing is the number of stillbirths.

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,080
And in 2020, there were about 2 million stillbirths.

21
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:14,089
This is also something that's not counted very well, because if you're not going into the facility to have your baby,

22
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,840
if you're having your baby at home and the baby dies.

23
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,839
Well, for one thing, there's not necessarily a birth registry in all countries.

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,850
So not every baby that's born even gets a birth certificate.

25
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:36,440
But if a baby is born, has died before it's born, if the baby's born dead or it's intrauterine fetal demise, no one is necessarily reporting that.

26
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,730
So there's a lot of a lot of controversy around this if this is even a real statistic that we should think about.

27
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,030
Right. Or is it much different from this? Is it much higher than this?

28
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,080
So I'm sure that, you know, ad nauseum about the MDGs and the SDGs,

29
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:04,729
but I'll just point out that in the MDGs we had four of the eight goals were related to maternal child health.

30
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,910
Right. And so there was a lot of emphasis on that.

31
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,230
There was a lot of funding that was put into that, and there was a lot of focus on that.

32
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,989
And with the Sustainable Development Goals we have won, some of these other things sort of feed into it.

33
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,180
But we have one of the goals that's around health, which is very different.

34
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,470
So and, and not that it shouldn't be, but so there's focus on a lot of other things.

35
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:36,740
But as you know, these are the things that drive the development agenda and these are the things this this is what the money follows, basically.

36
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:44,420
So this is what USAID and diff it and all of those funding agencies go and look at and say,

37
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,520
what have you got for your strategy in your country related to this this development goal?

38
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,710
And this is what we're going to give you money for.

39
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,080
So that's why it's important to know these things and to to understand where they are, what they mean.

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,190
So the Lancet Commission on Quality also provided us with some recommendations.

41
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:12,680
On how to improve the quality of health services. And so the first thing that they said was that we have to treat women with dignity.

42
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:20,420
Right. And I think that's one of the things that and there's a lot of this in the literature right around respectful maternity care,

43
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,680
that women are not respected when they go in to have a baby, that sometimes they're slapped, they're hit.

44
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,249
They are not given informed consent when something happens,

45
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,540
they're not they're being examined without anybody explaining to them what they're going to do.

46
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,500
And they're not treated with with dignity when they go into a facility.

47
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,290
And so there's a lot around that, and that could be a whole lecture on its own.

48
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,620
But I think it's really important.

49
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:56,180
And there's a lot of a lot of research that's being done and a lot of sort of interventions that are being done to help change this.

50
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,130
But it's a big systems problem, right? Because it isn't necessarily the individual physician or the individual midwife.

51
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,790
It's the system. It's it's a broken system out there for women who are coming in to have a baby and to have any

52
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:17,750
other kind of care because they're really so stressed and they have no resources and they.

53
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,040
In Liberia, for instance, where I go,

54
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,160
sometimes the nurses and midwives go months and months and months without getting a paycheck from the government.

55
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,640
And their pay is only really about $300 a month anyway.

56
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,100
But they don't even get the pay that that they're that they're due, but they still come to work.

57
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,010
So they have it's not an excuse for not treating people with dignity,

58
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:50,050
but it's one of the stressors that's put on on the worker that really then kind of cascades down to the people coming in for care.

59
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,860
The second thing that they said is that we have to communicate clearly.

60
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,700
And I think this is another huge thing and and maybe have done some reading or you understand or you've heard about health literacy.

61
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:10,420
So when women come in for care, if I'm giving the information to this group and this is often how antenatal care or prenatal care education is done,

62
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:18,249
there is a big group of women, more like 200, rather than the 15 or 16 of you that are in the room, 200 women.

63
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,700
And I'm standing up front as the nurse and I'm the one that's telling you, you should eat this and you should do this and you should not do that.

64
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,950
Well, in Ghana, for instance, there are over 70 tribal languages.

65
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:37,270
Right. And not everybody speaks English. And so the information it's given, it's a very hierarchical way that the information is delivered.

66
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,870
And it's not an exchange of information so that they can have they can get questions can be asked.

67
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,090
And it's not really targeted toward their particular gestational age.

68
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,940
So you might be ten weeks pregnant, you might be 30 weeks pregnant, but I'm talking about getting ready for labor.

69
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,319
What, you don't really care about that at ten weeks, right? So it's it's that kind of thing.

70
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:07,090
So we have to communicate clearly and we have to communicate in a way that the information that we're depart, that we're that we're giving to people.

71
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,220
They can then they can use that information. They can process that information and use it to make decisions in their life.

72
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:24,630
The other thing is that we have to provide autonomy, which, again, this is this is a big thing and it's especially a big thing within families.

73
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,340
So women don't have a lot of autonomy.

74
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:35,159
Often the husband is the one that's making the decision if she can even go to the facility for care and or if there if she needs to be transferred,

75
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:44,370
if there's an emergency, he has to say it's okay. He has enough money for them to buy, get a taxi or buy gas or a motorcycle or whatever it is.

76
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,700
The other thing we have to do, the first thing they said is confidentially confidentiality and treatment of women.

77
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:59,589
And so again. The places are the places the and I have some pictures and a little bit they're very crowded.

78
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,770
Right. So there's a lot of people in the same space.

79
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,670
It's very difficult to provide confidentiality when you're talking with women,

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,790
when you're doing an exam, when someone is in labor, there are multiple people in the room.

81
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:19,960
There is not necessarily curtains even between the beds. So it's there's not very much privacy or confidentiality available.

82
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,440
The fifth thing is that we need to develop confidence in our in our services that go beyond satisfaction.

83
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:34,330
So I've seen a lot of satisfaction surveys done from women in low resource settings.

84
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,749
And they always say they're satisfied. They're satisfied. They're satisfied.

85
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,940
And I it makes me wonder the way that the questions are asked, you know,

86
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:47,620
what are what are they really what are we really asking them and what's their expectation like?

87
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:55,599
Maybe that maybe they don't even have an expectation of what they can what they can expect for when they when they go in to have a baby.

88
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,370
Yeah. You talk a little bit more about, for instance, prenatal care that's done.

89
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:08,499
For example, do women have access for vitamins and folic acid prenatal and do they have access to checkups?

90
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,860
Like what is the knowledge behind that? Right.

91
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,540
So that's going to really vary by from place to place. But I'll tell you that a lot of place.

92
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:25,360
So it depends on the country. So in Ghana, for instance, Ghana has an insurance scheme, they call it.

93
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,750
And yes, so things like folic acid and iron tablets would be covered.

94
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,620
But if you needed antibiotics, for instance, because you had a urinary tract infection during pregnancy,

95
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,300
you would have to probably you would have to buy those on in the market yourself when you come into the facility.

96
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,410
And this is true in in almost every country that I've been in when you come into the facility,

97
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,050
so say you need a medication, so you need oxytocin to to stop bleeding after the baby's born.

98
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:11,390
Often the family has to run out to the market and buy it and bring it in for the woman so they don't always have.

99
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:20,239
So that's a big commodities issue. So they should have it at those at the places that that women are going for care, but they don't always have it.

100
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,790
And a lot of times the other thing that the places that the things that they will do at the facility is they will they only get a little bit of it,

101
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:36,050
right. So they'll hoard it and they'll say, we're going to keep this for the most severe patient till she comes in and she needs it.

102
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,420
And we're going to make other people go out and buy their own.

103
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,819
And, you know, and so that also doesn't work very well because you can't you can't always predict these things.

104
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:50,290
Right. So. And then people do have a lot of difficulty getting in for care.

105
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,160
And I'll talk about that with the maternity waiting homes and how that's trying to address that.

106
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,600
Did you want to ask something? Oh, no. Okay.

107
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:09,140
That's okay. And that that women have to trust and be willing to use reproductive health services.

108
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:16,070
So a lot of times and I did some of the early work that I did really looked at this and that women don't trust the health facilities.

109
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,380
They trust the traditional midwife in their community because she's part of their community.

110
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,250
She knows them. She knows their family. They know her family.

111
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,910
She's a trusted member of her community. They go to the health center.

112
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,840
There's a nurse there, there's a midwife there. There's a physician there that they don't know.

113
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,770
They and the person talks down to them and doesn't treat them with dignity and doesn't give them information in a useful manner.

114
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,140
Why would I go in? What's the point?

115
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:48,260
Why should I walk five miles for care if I'm not getting the any kind of care that I feel like that's benefiting me at all?

116
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,510
So that's the other thing that that we really need to think about. Okay.

117
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,530
So anybody have any questions so far?

118
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,110
Anything else about that? And then I'm going to kind of transition into some of the research.

119
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,230
You need to stretch. You need to get up and move around. You okay?

120
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,270
Okay. So I'm going to talk about the work that I've done in Liberia.

121
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,840
So I first went to Liberia in 2000 and.

122
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:39,910
Or I think it was so almost 20 years ago, and they had had a huge internal civil war conflict for 14 years.

123
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:50,110
You may have read some things about it. Charles Taylor, who was on trial in The Hague for war crimes, was was one of the leaders of it.

124
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,840
He was also the president. They had a very corrupt system.

125
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:05,409
And it's a country where there was a lot of tension between the what they call American Liberians,

126
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:15,550
which were black folks that were sent back to Africa from the United States.

127
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,649
I think somebody thought that that was a good idea back in the 1800s.

128
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,970
And but they were not from Liberia. And they went back and they became the ruling class.

129
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,180
And they and they the indigenous people that lived there, were treated very poorly.

130
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,629
And so Samuel Doe was one of the indigenous people. That was the sort of the beginning of that was a rise up against the government.

131
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,250
I think Tubman was the president at the time and that started the Civil War.

132
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,420
And then Charles Taylor took over, who was probably somebody more that you would have heard of.

133
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,469
And it just went on. There was a lot of people that were internally displaced.

134
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,140
There were people that went across the border. And so when I first went there.

135
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:02,260
And it's a very small country in between the Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone.

136
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,040
It's a very, very small country. When I went there for the first time, I think there were only 3.5 million people in the entire country.

137
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,339
It's something like 5 million now. They have a very high maternal mortality ratio.

138
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,800
It's 742 per 100,000. They have a high under-five mortality rate.

139
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,720
Half of births still occur outside the facility.

140
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:33,430
They don't go into the facility for care. There's a lack of professional providers, which is increasing now.

141
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:45,940
But when I first went there, there were something like 28 physicians in the entire country for 3.5 million people, and there were like 400 nurses.

142
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,380
Everyone else was gone. And in in 2015, it was designated as a as a fragile country.

143
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,220
So what happened then during the war was that.

144
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,240
There was. There was. Everything was. Everything was destroyed.

145
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,020
Right. So the hospitals were destroyed. The there was no electricity in the entire country.

146
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,820
So this is actually a picture of a gas station. So this is these are bottles of gas.

147
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,250
So if you don't have electricity, you can't pump gas. Right.

148
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,150
So these are bottles of gas and that's a hose that you would stop by the side of the road and they would, you know,

149
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,250
suck on the hose and put it in your car's gas tank and put a couple of gallons of gas in your car that way.

150
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,490
There were still U.N. peacekeepers there. And so, you know, as you've learned.

151
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:45,490
So when you when somebody when a country comes out of a humanitarian crisis or a conflict, there's a humanitarian aid first.

152
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,960
Right. So Medecins Sans, Frontier, Doctors Without Borders, they go in first.

153
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,660
They try to try to get things stabilized. They try to get people working again.

154
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,730
They try to give some education to the health system.

155
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,240
And then the development people come come in and start to do development.

156
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,110
So when I went in, it was still it was still there were still 22,000 U.N. peacekeepers there.

157
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,749
It was still the humanitarian aid. The Doctor Medecins Sans Frontieres was doing most of the the work that was being done in the country.

158
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,530
And it was just starting to figure out, like, how are we going to move forward.

159
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:26,550
Right. Because the other thing is, when you have internal conflict, it's all of your neighbors, right?

160
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,650
It's it's factions within a country against one another.

161
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:36,940
And when you go back to peace times, then who is the friend and who is the foe?

162
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,480
Right.

163
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:46,090
And so if I'm going to go into a clinic for care, maybe you were the one that killed my brother, you know, or you were the one that chased my family,

164
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:54,129
or so there was a lot of mistrust and there was a lot of people were just afraid they would not access services.

165
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,160
They wouldn't go in for care. And so there was a lot of damage to the infrastructure.

166
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:08,420
This is a lake bed in one of the clinics. So you can see it's just a piece of cardboard on a couple of slats of wood.

167
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,640
There's an I.V. pole that's made out of a tree limb.

168
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,759
There were no supplies. The there was no equipment.

169
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,510
There was there was nothing really. And it was just amazing.

170
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,700
And there were there were these nurses and midwives out at these very rural places trying to care

171
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:34,019
for 20,000 people in their catchment area with no commodities and no supplies and no no lights.

172
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:41,399
So they couldn't you know, they were doing verse at night in the dark and it was really pre sort of iPhones.

173
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,950
So they didn't even have like phones that had flashlights on them. So it was it was quite something.

174
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,940
And then, of course, when there's war, there's a lot of gender based violence, and rape is often used as a tool of war.

175
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,990
So there were lots of issues around that as well.

176
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,470
And so you can see how that how that happened,

177
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:09,270
how that impacts the way people access care and what they're able to to do for care and to it to go for care.

178
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:20,160
So like I said, they had a very decimated workforce. So if you think about it, they had 15, 14 to 15 years where no one learned anything new.

179
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,840
Right. And in medicine and in nursing and in health care, things changed in 24 hours.

180
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,660
It changes right the way the standard of care, the evidence that we have, how we do our practice.

181
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:43,499
So they had 15 years with no upgrading of skills, so they had no idea about basic emergency, obstetric care or comprehensive.

182
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,710
All of that came about when they were in war.

183
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,270
So and they were running from place to place and they were so they weren't learning anything.

184
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,200
And there were no new workers added to the health workforce. So.

185
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,600
Because there was no infrastructure for schools when there's an internal conflict like that.

186
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,890
I can remember going to villages and meeting people and I met one young guy and

187
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,259
he was carrying some books and he was probably about 21 and he was so excited.

188
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,350
He said, I'm in school. And I said, That is so great.

189
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,020
What are you studying?

190
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:25,300
And he said, I'm in grade three, you know, and he was 20 years old because if he was 20 years old and they'd been in in a war for 15 years.

191
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,260
He was five when it started and he didn't have any schooling before that.

192
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:44,350
So it was the first time in my career that I had worked in populations that were totally not literate, not no literacy skills at all.

193
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,489
So when you do research in the United States, right, they say make your consent form,

194
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:54,330
make your questions at a fifth grade level so that everybody can understand the questions that you're asking them and the end,

195
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,830
then the informed consent sheet and all of that.

196
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,510
And I remember doing the first I did a qualitative study first, and I was doing interviews with women who.

197
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:12,720
Had had a near miss who had almost died during their pregnancy, got to a facility, did not die.

198
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,920
And I you know, I had this basic demographic questionnaire that I asked them that had maybe like ten questions on it.

199
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,389
Right. And I thought, I'll get this done in like 5 minutes. Right? Like, what's your age?

200
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,110
How many people live in your house? When did you.

201
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,840
When when how old were you? When you first got pregnant? And they couldn't answer, right?

202
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,260
They didn't know how old they were. They said adult.

203
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,040
That's when when you ask that age, they said adult.

204
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:49,590
They didn't know how many people lived in their house because the question was because it's a very fluid living arrangement,

205
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,600
often where multiple families live together. So who's who are we counting?

206
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,840
Are we counting just my family? Are we counting?

207
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,830
My sister and her family. Like there were lots of.

208
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,910
Lots of.

209
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:16,050
It just it was just really amazing to me because if you and I had a had a I have a very good friend who's a speech therapist and does a lot of work.

210
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,990
With kids that have have issues. And she said to me, you know, Jodi,

211
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,579
you take for granted that when you're in preschool and they tell you to put all these shapes that

212
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,860
are the same together or put all these colors together that are the same or match these things,

213
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,819
those kids, you really learn something when you're doing that as a child.

214
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,340
And if you've never done that, if you never had the experience, if you've never had the ability to do that,

215
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:50,420
if no one's ever done that with you as a preschool or as a young child and you don't learn numbers,

216
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:59,680
how would you know the answer to any of those questions? So that was I mean, that was kind of changed my life when I when I kind of figured that out.

217
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:06,259
But anyway, so that's the long and short just to say that, you know, over at that time,

218
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,380
I would say probably 20% of deliveries were happening in a facility.

219
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,000
And even if the person went to the facility, there wasn't a skill provider there necessarily.

220
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,620
Okay. And then again, the sort of limited clean water, limited supplies.

221
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:29,149
So you can see this is a picture of a delivery room and it has the red, yellow, green buckets.

222
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:35,750
So that's two that's to that's different concentrations of chlorine solution to

223
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,190
sterilize the instruments that they use so they go from one bucket to the next.

224
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,309
And this time this is how people wash their hands.

225
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,560
There was no running water. So it's in a it's in a big jug, but there wasn't soap.

226
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,450
There was just a bucket down at the bottom to catch the water. So you can see how that would impact.

227
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,860
Infection and and all and all of the things that we've been talking that I've been talking about.

228
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,190
And this is my if you ever want to do research in a real research setting.

229
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,750
This is the record room. Right. So this these are the charts.

230
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,850
So if you want to get any information from the charts, you go in here and you get on this ladder and you try to figure out which charts that

231
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,470
you want to look at and how you find the chart of the person that you need the data on.

232
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:29,860
So it's it's kind of a daunting experience. So I'm going to talk about mainly this research that we did around maturity

233
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,500
rating homes and how each of these other things sort of came up and all of that.

234
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:46,179
And so what happened was when I said I went in first in the early 2000 to do that humanitarian work, I went in not to do research.

235
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,970
I went in as a trainer.

236
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:57,010
So I went in to teach nurses, midwives and physicians how to do basic emergency obstetric care, so how to do neonatal resuscitation,

237
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:04,690
how to stop a postpartum hemorrhage, how to use a vacuum extractor if you need to to get a baby out,

238
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:11,559
sort of all the things that go in and how to do management of of Thursday stage of labor

239
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,250
and when to give drugs things like that that they hadn't had training on for a long time.

240
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:22,300
And when I said earlier in the talk that I've never seen a woman die in childbirth in the United States,

241
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,740
I was there for, I think the first time I was there for like six weeks.

242
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,960
And I probably saw ten maternal deaths in a matter of six weeks.

243
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:40,870
So that was very, very different for me. And that was very, you know, and I and and I just I didn't understand it.

244
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,089
I didn't understand it. I didn't understand why that was happening, because we couldn't do any laps.

245
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:50,440
There was no way to do a lab. I didn't know if the person had HIV. I didn't know if she was anemic.

246
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:59,200
I didn't know if she you know, all the tools that I used in the United States to try to do a diagnosis or an assessment of somebody that comes in.

247
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,180
I didn't have that in my fingertips when I was there. And so it was like, well, why did she die?

248
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,720
I don't understand why she died. She came in. She was really sick. She had a fever.

249
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,960
She died. Did she have malaria? Maybe she had malaria.

250
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,430
So it was so it really spurred me into this question of like,

251
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:21,010
why is this happening and what could be done different within the system to prevent some of these maternal deaths?

252
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,870
So when we were out doing these trainings,

253
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,880
we met with lots of different people because we were training the nurses and the midwives and the physicians,

254
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:38,130
but we were also there was a large cadre of traditional birth attendants or they called them teams,

255
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,120
trained traditional midwives is what they call them in Liberia.

256
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,729
So they were TBAs traditional birth attendants in the communities that were really caring

257
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,690
for a lot of the women that were coming in that were so sick and then ended up dying.

258
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:59,830
And so we had discussions with them about how do you identify a problem early and then how do you how do you do a referral?

259
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,100
That was sort of the basis of what we were talking about.

260
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:14,740
But one of the things that came out of sort of the first study that I did following that was that after the war, there was no place for women to go.

261
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,569
They didn't feel comfortable going to the clinic or the clinic was very far away and they had their baby at home,

262
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:27,510
but they couldn't have the baby in the house because all the other family members were there and all their other children were there.

263
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,340
And so this phrase kept keep kept coming up. We go behind the house.

264
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:40,350
Right. So when women went into labor, they went behind the house, into the forest, into the jungle, into the bush.

265
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:47,430
And the traditional midwife went with them and they had their baby there because there was no place for them to really go.

266
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,180
Right. And they couldn't have the baby in front of their husband or their other kids.

267
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,530
So they were having their baby in the bush and then they were going back into their home.

268
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,740
And so at the. What came out of that was just this behind the house.

269
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,060
So then we said, Well, what was it like before the war? Like, what did women do then?

270
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,049
And they said, Well, we have these things that we call birth centers in towns.

271
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:15,450
And it was a space in town where women could come and they could give birth.

272
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,840
And it was a clean space and that traditional midwife would take care of them

273
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,590
and they would give birth there and then stay for a few hours and then go home.

274
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,700
And so so we kind of took that idea and we kind of mold it around with a bunch of other people.

275
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:35,940
And there was a USAID call out that was looking for some projects,

276
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:43,140
and we put in a proposal to do attorney waiting rooms, which had been kind of tested in mainly Nicaragua.

277
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,450
Medicine custom attorneys there called there and a little bit in Cuba.

278
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:54,959
There was a little bit of data on it, but we said, well, rather than just make a birth center in the middle of town,

279
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,810
which is not going to have a skilled birth attendant added anyway,

280
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:06,479
why don't we do this idea of having maternity home near a rural health facility where women can come before

281
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,670
they go into labor so they don't have to walk ten miles when they're in labor because they're not going to.

282
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,550
No one really who would. Right.

283
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:21,780
And so we worked with the traditional birth attendants and we worked with the midwives in the communities and the women themselves to say,

284
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,940
what should this look like? And so that's that's sort of how this was dreamed up.

285
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,460
And this is just a very old it's called Pathways to Survival.

286
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,109
I think it was first developed by USAID from the three delay model.

287
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,450
If you know, the theory is the mainstream delay model, and it's back from the 1980s,

288
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,279
but it still makes sense today that you're in your home, you identify a problem.

289
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,130
First, you have to recognize that it's even a problem. Right?

290
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:58,170
Because if you haven't gone for antenatal care and there's a lot of myths in your community and you have some bleeding,

291
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,280
maybe you don't even know that that's a danger sign that you should go in.

292
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,310
And believe it or not, that is really some of the things that happen.

293
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,530
Women would have bleeding and they would not know that it was a problem when they were pregnant.

294
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,960
They would wash out their clothing and not go in and then the next day they'd have more bleeding.

295
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,549
So you have to recognize that it's a problem. You have to get whatever.

296
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,420
Kind of like a first responder, right? What would a first responder in our country do?

297
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,990
Then you have to decide to seek care. Then you have to actually get to care.

298
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,580
And then you have to get good care once you get there. And then women will survive.

299
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:44,480
So we developed this this model, and we use this participatory action research model that was based on community mobilization.

300
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,530
I don't know how well you can see this, but it's sort of in phases.

301
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,709
So we kind of organize the community for action. So this was something that we really did in the communities.

302
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,850
We said, Is this what you want? What do you or first tell us what you want.

303
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,089
They told us what they wanted and we kind of worked with them.

304
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:08,290
We worked with the communities, we worked with the the development people, we worked with USAID.

305
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,719
And then we kind of explored the issues and set the priorities.

306
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,670
What did they want? Then we plan together. What would it look like?

307
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,019
Then we acted together and then we evaluated.

308
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:26,380
And so the barriers that we were looking at were distance, the cultural preferences for being with the traditional midwife,

309
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,100
and then the need really to access skilled birth attendants.

310
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,550
And what we wanted was this survival column.

311
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,629
So we wanted we wanted to make linkages within the health system.

312
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,950
We didn't want people siloed. We didn't want the traditional birth attendants siloed.

313
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:48,370
And we didn't also want to if that's their livelihood, you don't really want to kick them out of a job, right?

314
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,920
Because then they're not going to they're going to tell the women, don't go in.

315
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,499
So we wanted to be inclusive of them and the ministry really wanted to be inclusive of them.

316
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:04,660
And actually, to this day, the ministry and health in Liberia, which is very different from almost every other country, really still.

317
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,980
Is attempting to give the traditional birth attendant a role in the health care system.

318
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,290
Because if you have so few providers,

319
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:20,370
you need people that are in the community that can be the eyes and ears of the people that are at the facility because they can't go out every day.

320
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:26,050
They can't even go out once a week if they're seeing. 200 patients a day at their clinic.

321
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,730
Right. And so we wanted to have improved collaboration between the traditional birth attendants and the skilled birth attendants.

322
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,990
We wanted to have increased rates of facility delivery, and we wanted to impact maternal morbidity and mortality.

323
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,469
So we did this. We set this up as a two group comparison model.

324
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:54,480
We only had five facilities, so five facilities got maternity waiting homes and five facilities did not get mature any rating homes.

325
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,230
And we match them based on a bunch of criteria that we had. And then we worked with the community and.

326
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,639
They we had responsibilities for the community and they really stepped up.

327
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:12,080
So they made some of the bricks for the maternity waiting homes.

328
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,520
They had the sand delivered that we needed that they needed to use for the mortar.

329
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:26,000
They provided labor. The women in the communities cooked for for the laborers when we had to bring in skilled laborers from outside the community.

330
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,110
They wanted cooking facilities. This was some of the things that they said they wanted.

331
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:35,240
So each of the maternity waiting rooms had cooking facilities. They had toilets.

332
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,620
They had basic furnishings, such as mosquito nets and beds.

333
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,840
And they wanted to beds in a room so that the traditional midwife could go with them.

334
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,820
And then we engage the traditional midwives. So we we set up a system with them.

335
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,870
And this was this was very early. This was flip phone days that they communicated via cell.

336
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,100
So when they found somebody in their in their community that was pregnant,

337
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,999
we had this code that they did and they started out with a nine for a four, a big belly.

338
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,450
That's what they call pregnant women in Liberia, big bellies.

339
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,489
They started out with a nine and they put the code that they had a two digit code for who

340
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,020
they were and a two digit code for the community they were from and the woman's age,

341
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:31,980
so that we could get an idea of how many women were praying. So we had a denominator for how many women were pregnant coming from these communities.

342
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,950
And then we did a comparison. And this is a comparison that we did about halfway through.

343
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,170
So this was in late 2012.

344
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:53,440
And so you can see the the blue community is the community that had the maturity weighting home in the red community is the one that didn't.

345
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,450
And I'm just going to show you a few of them, but it's basically the same that the births went up.

346
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,430
They were going up in both, which was good, which is really what we wanted.

347
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,020
But they were going up more in the the facilities that had maturity rating homes.

348
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,030
This one that it went down. There was lots of reasons for this and I'm just showing you these.

349
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:21,880
So that gives you some context for where I'm going next. Because as you know or as you, I don't know if you know or not.

350
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:30,760
Before I get to that. But and then we did this was the number of of deliveries at baseline the number of

351
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,200
deliveries after the maturity rating homes were built in all five communities.

352
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,390
We looked at team births and I'm not going to talk a lot about that.

353
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:47,530
But we look what we were trying to do was get the traditional births attended to, come to the facility with the woman because that's who she trusted.

354
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:57,280
And for that person to work with the midwife or the nurse at the facility that was doing the delivery to gain some experience,

355
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,399
but also in like a dual role, right, if you know what a dollar is.

356
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,629
So that's a woman that supports another woman in pregnancy and in labor.

357
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:10,060
So we were trying to kind of shift the role of the traditional midwife into a dual role,

358
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,879
but still being able to be there because the midwife at the clinic is not just doing this birth.

359
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,520
She's taking care of all these other people that are coming into the clinic.

360
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:25,600
So and you can see that that that really went up in the places that had the maternity waiting homes.

361
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,130
And then we looked at. Yeah, pre and post.

362
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:39,959
And then we looked at the number of stillbirths from the maternity and home communities and the nine maternity home communities,

363
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,340
the number of neonatal deaths and the number of maternal deaths.

364
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,870
And that was from, you know, like almost two year periods.

365
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,600
And so this project was going on just fine.

366
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,950
And as you all are probably well aware of.

367
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,770
Ebola hit in March and early of 20, early 2014.

368
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:16,040
And so I was actually it was it was March 13th or 14th and I was about to get on a plane with about seven people from the school of nursing

369
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:23,629
students and other faculty members and some other people that were coming along with us to go to this hospital in Brown County where we work.

370
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:28,340
And then we go out to the villages from there where the maternity waiting homes were were built.

371
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:37,250
And I got a call from one of my colleagues in Liberia, and she said, you know, that Ebola is in Guinea and this hospital is like right on the border.

372
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,670
Right. And a lot of patients come over from Guinea. And I said, no.

373
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,489
I mean, I really didn't know that it wasn't in the news here yet.

374
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:48,860
And she said, Well, it's in Guinea and it's probably going to be here, you know, at any time.

375
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,360
And so so we canceled so we didn't go.

376
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,800
So we called the airline. We said, we're not going, there's Ebola.

377
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,000
But the airline people said, I don't see anything on my screen about Ebola, you know, but we canceled.

378
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,709
We didn't go. And then, you know, the rest of the story, I mean, I guess you know the rest of the story.

379
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,430
So it had a huge effect on maternity care and had a huge effect on all care.

380
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:15,859
So now we're back to I don't trust the facility.

381
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,929
I don't trust the provider of the facility because everyone thought they were getting Ebola from

382
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:25,190
the health care providers or they thought they were getting it from the health care providers.

383
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,229
They thought that they were if they went there, that they were, you know, they were increasing their risk.

384
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,220
So they stopped going for antenatal care. They stopped coming in for deliveries.

385
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:41,659
They the nurses, many nurses died.

386
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:48,860
Many midwives died. Five nurses from the hospital where we were going died from Ebola during the first few months of this outbreak.

387
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,340
So it really it really was a setback.

388
00:37:52,670 --> 00:38:00,739
And I guess sort of the takeaway from that for me, not only about Ebola, because that was 2014.

389
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:07,490
So that's ten years after the Civil War is over and I still do work there now and I'll get to that.

390
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:18,110
But it takes generations for a country to really recover from conflict and crisis when

391
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,960
they have had a war or a conflict or something huge like that happening in their country.

392
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:35,240
And then when you have the effect of something like a pandemic or an endemic, then it really it just quickly sets it way back.

393
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,460
So we actually.

394
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:48,350
We actually we collected some data during this time because we were out there or the people that we were working with on the ground were out there.

395
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:55,410
And it was it was we got some really interesting data from the from the health care providers as well as from some of the women.

396
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:09,840
So then. So time goes by. And in 20, I don't know if somewhere around 2015 I started another maternity rating home project study in Zambia.

397
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,760
And part of the funding for that was from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

398
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,900
So I said to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the folks there, I said, You know, we're doing this trip.

399
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,610
I'm so sorry. We're doing this big study in Zambia.

400
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,850
And we had it was much larger than the Liberia study.

401
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:35,280
We did this we did this study in Liberia of like five maternity waiting homes.

402
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,729
And my colleagues in Liberia tell me, like there's like 25, 25 returnee waiting homes there.

403
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:50,040
Now, wouldn't it be interesting to do sort of an evaluation like what happened at the original five and are they scaling up or what does it look like?

404
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:57,180
And so they gave us a little bit of money to do that. And we wanted to look at we wanted to document what was happening.

405
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:06,330
So then you can see the map. We just did so we just did a mapping of of sort of how the majority weighted homes expanded.

406
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,520
So what we found out was there weren't.

407
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:20,250
25 more maternity waiting homes. There were 140 more mature and waiting homes, and they were in every county except one.

408
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:29,760
And so I had a fabulous research assistant who had done work with me there as an undergrad and a grad student, and he was in medical school.

409
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:37,320
Now, he was taking a year off from medical school, and he went to Liberia and he visited every one of the 114 maternity waiting homes that were there.

410
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,150
And so we got a lot of really good information about scale up.

411
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,170
What did that look like? How was it successful? Which ones weren't sick?

412
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,740
Because there were 114 but 190 at that time. But they weren't all successful.

413
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,880
And it really was it was really a very,

414
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:05,309
very nice study that that really looked at what do you need to scale up and what do you need to have a project be sustainable?

415
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,620
Because that's what everybody's looking for now, right?

416
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,499
When you start out on a research project or you start out with an intervention, they're going to say to you, How are you going to sustain this?

417
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,860
What are you going to do after the money's gone? How is the country going to be able to do this?

418
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,860
So you have to have a plan for that. So what we found was the places that.

419
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,870
Were sustained or that scaled up successfully had very strong local leadership.

420
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,010
I mean, none of this is really going to be a surprise to you, and it wasn't a surprise to us,

421
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:40,610
but it was good to be able to get the data and to put the data out there in a way that says this is not just what we think,

422
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:48,740
this is what we know, and this is what we learned when we went to the communities. So strong local leadership, active community engagement.

423
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:58,460
So there were places that W.H.O. came in and looked at a map and said, Oh, the maternal mortality rate is really high in its community.

424
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,570
Let's build a maternity waiting home there and just throw a bunch of money at it.

425
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,560
Built a beautiful maternity waiting home and no one used it right because no one had talked to the community.

426
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,060
No one said to the community, is this where you want to put this maternity waiting room?

427
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,450
Is this going to meet your needs? Who's going to use it?

428
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,140
How are you going to get people here? There was no buy in from the community.

429
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,390
And so there were other ones that were just shacks that were overcrowded.

430
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:32,570
Right. Because the community really supported it. The traditional midwife said, this is important.

431
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,970
The women said, the men said it's important. We want we want the women to be able to go to these places.

432
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:44,360
We want to go to the facilities for delivery. So you also need strong government support.

433
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:53,380
And so one of the things that Liberia did after that first five majority weighting home study was they drafted some policies.

434
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:57,799
Right. So they said when a new click because they were building lots of clinics, right.

435
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,370
When a new primary health care facility is built.

436
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:05,389
Part of what we need to consider and that we try to get money for.

437
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:11,270
Right. Because they said that's what drives the agenda for this. All of this is the policy that they make.

438
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,620
So they have it in their policy.

439
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:19,430
Their five year strategy for decreasing maternal mortality is that they want maternity waiting rooms at rural health facilities.

440
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:29,719
So as rural health facilities are being built, you know, medicine demand comes in or Save the Children comes in and they have an extra $10,000,

441
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,410
and they say, well, we'll give you the $10,000 to build a maternity rating on there.

442
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:43,370
So that so that was good. So they had a lot of they had a lot of it in their public in their policy, again, sort of county.

443
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:49,220
So it's Liberia is divided up by county. So that was important for county leadership.

444
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,770
And I think the other thing was to have early and sustained engagement with the communities.

445
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,360
So like I said, the ones that did not do that were not doing very well at all.

446
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,940
And they needed self-governance models. They didn't need somebody from the outside saying, This is how you need to do this.

447
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:14,219
So the other thing that we did in that project and this you can see these are the research assistants going out to the communities.

448
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:22,100
We geocoding the communities from the five original villages that we did the maternity waiting rooms to see exactly how far women were walking it,

449
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,970
to use the majority weighting, because then we had a log book at the maternity home.

450
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,310
But you can see these guys are walking out or coming back from the villages.

451
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,960
So this is what women would walk through or walk how they would have to walk to get to the facility.

452
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:53,310
So what we found with that was that you can see in the green part of this, I think it is so 21% of the women of and that was 560 some women,

453
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,640
564 women actually traveled greater than 20 kilometers to get to the health facility for delivery.

454
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,720
And you can just you can read the numbers yourself, but you can see how far women were walking and having to get to get to the facility.

455
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:14,520
So having a place to go before you go into labor and spend the last few days or the last two weeks or whatever,

456
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,740
the amount of time is that you can be away from your family was beneficial.

457
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,950
The other thing that came out of this was one of the things that we heard a lot was food security, right?

458
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,030
So food security was an issue for everybody,

459
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:34,220
but it was really an issue also for the women of the maternity waiting rooms, because now they've left their family.

460
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,120
They can't take the food from the family to bring with them.

461
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:43,820
There's really there's not a cafeteria. There's no way to get food when they're at the maternity waiting room.

462
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,829
So what are you doing? So we tried a lot of different things in the original study.

463
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,920
We tried gardens. Some work, some didn't.

464
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,590
We tried some different income generating activities to act to generate income for the facilities.

465
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,940
And then we tried this idea with a very little amount of money.

466
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:11,910
So we didn't we didn't get very far with this. But one of the things that is even in Liberia are pumping lava.

467
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,750
So by you, you drive down the side of the road and there'll be people,

468
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:24,840
little vendor standing there with a bag with like these worm like looking things, their lava that they get from the falling down palm trees.

469
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:32,159
Right. And they cook them up or they eat them raw, but they usually cook them up and they're loaded with protein.

470
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,360
Right. So so I had seen this many times and I was just kind of having a conversation with some friends.

471
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:48,149
And I said, you know, it seems to me like we do like worm farming in the United States for like compost and stuff like that in gardens.

472
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:54,299
Right. Why couldn't you like do like a larva like compost growth thing?

473
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,950
I mean, I didn't really have any idea about it.

474
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:02,040
And actually, Cheryl Walker, who I think she said came and talked to the right, she said, I can't believe you're saying this.

475
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:08,099
I had a Fogarty fellow who's an entomologist from Ghana, and that's what he's that's what his research is on.

476
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,340
It's on edible insects. And he's like so into it.

477
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,660
And he's done a few like small studies with pregnant women in Ghana.

478
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,170
And I think I should connect the two of you. So I got connected with Jacob.

479
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,840
And he has this system where he teaches people how to race.

480
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:32,239
So so the way that they do the the lava harvesting is they go in the forest and the palm tree has to already be dead and falling down.

481
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,760
And they just dig through the the. The bark or the inside of the tree.

482
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,110
And that's where they get that's where they get these larva. And then that's what they eat or that's what they sell.

483
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:49,370
But he has this way of doing it that you can actually grow them in a plastic bucket with sugar and stuff like that.

484
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:55,010
So we got a little bit of money and we sent him from Ghana to Liberia to the maternity waiting homes to work with.

485
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:59,210
Three We only had enough money for him to go to three places and set this up.

486
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,559
And it was so one of the places it did not work at all.

487
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,670
It got they got a lot of torrential rain and everything got wrecked and ruined.

488
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:14,389
But two of the places and one of the places in particular made a nut grew enough of these that they

489
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:21,049
could supplement the diet for the women that were coming there and use the money that they made,

490
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:26,690
selling the extra to buy like cornmeal or rice or whatever it is that they need to eat.

491
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:28,909
So it was a very fun thing.

492
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:36,470
We haven't done anything with it since then, but I think it has great potential if anybody wants to do something like that in the future.

493
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:50,960
And then what we're doing now is. We're looking at a midwife led OB Triage and WhatsApp study that's funded by a couple of different places.

494
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,000
Again, the Gates Foundation and USAID is funding this.

495
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:03,820
And so what we're doing is we've done a. A training with the midwifes that work at the facilities and at the hospital.

496
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:11,050
And we have connected the midwives from the rural health facility to the hospital on WhatsApp.

497
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,560
So what they're doing is they are when when they're at the rural health.

498
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:23,739
So at a rural health facility, there's a midwife and a nurse and they can give basic emergency obstetric care,

499
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:30,910
but they can't do C-sections and they don't have blood products and they usually have IV

500
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,500
fluids and they are trained to do manage postpartum hemorrhage and things like that.

501
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:42,190
Right. So but if a woman is having a lot of problems and she needs a caesarean section or she is

502
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,920
pre-eclampsia and might need mag sulfate or something like that for her blood pressure,

503
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,190
they don't they can't manage that. Claire So they transfer her to the hospital.

504
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:58,510
So and one of the problems is that when they get to the hospital, there's often a huge delay once they get there, right?

505
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:02,319
Because maybe they're not ready for the person.

506
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:08,530
And there's so many other things going on and they can't find a doctor and she needs a C-section and on and on and on.

507
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,929
So and they don't really triage the way that we triage in the United States.

508
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:18,940
So triage is a very. A developed country.

509
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:27,920
Idea, I guess. So when you when you get to a facility in a low resource setting, you often just sit there until your number comes up.

510
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:35,090
So if there's 20 people in front of me and I'm having a heart attack, but, you know, five people in front of me have a cold.

511
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:41,060
They're still going to get seen before me because it's just bye bye when you come in, when you arrive at the facility.

512
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:48,110
So we did this whole training on triage for the midwifes and the nurses, and then we connected them with WhatsApp.

513
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:56,010
So when the the rural health facility is sending a woman in. They text on WhatsApp and they say who they are.

514
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:04,070
They give the woman's initials so that it's it's confidential and they say that they give a little bit of background.

515
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:10,270
She's 38 weeks gestation and she there's no fetal heart tones, whatever whatever the problem is.

516
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:21,819
And then they say looking for transportation or she's left by private car or whatever the situation happens to be with the theory or the hypothesis

517
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:28,600
being that the person that at the health at the hospital was going to get ready to receive this person will know that the person's coming,

518
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:35,799
can arrange what is going on, on the unit or in the trip with themselves and that the colleagues that they work with

519
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,850
or if it looks like they're going to need to have somebody come in and do a C-section,

520
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,060
they can kind of get that step ready for when she comes.

521
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:50,680
So that's the the study that we're doing now. And it's sort of all all related to that in the same place and with the maternity waiting rooms.

522
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,850
Okay. Any questions about any of that? Yeah.

523
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,889
Did you ever try the worms or other medications? I did.

524
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:06,740
But you know that medical student I told you about? What do you think?

525
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,079
They weren't too bad, but, you know, she's so I can't eat anything.

526
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:17,010
Like we go out there and we just. Does that, you know?

527
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,719
Yeah. You know what? I have a very this is this is very exciting.

528
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,370
But when I was there one time, really early on, and when I told you I first went,

529
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,329
I would I stayed in this house by myself that was on the hospital compound.

530
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:34,050
And I used to have a guard come at night. Right. And sleep on the back porch.

531
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:43,200
This this little guy named David, who, you know, I mean, he just I was I was probably stronger than he was.

532
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:49,139
And he would come and knock on the door at 10:00 at night and he'd say, I'm here, Jodie, I'm going to sleep on the porch.

533
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,980
And I'd say, Fine, Dave, it's nice to see you. Right. You sleep on the back porch.

534
00:52:52,980 --> 00:53:03,930
And he was my guard, right? And so one night he came and it had been raining and there was this big beetle on the screen, right on the screen door.

535
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,850
And I, I opened the door and we're talking. And he said to me.

536
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,330
So are you going to eat that? And I said, no.

537
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,050
And he said, Can I have it? And I said, Of course, what are you going to do with it?

538
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:24,060
And he said, My kids love those.

539
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:32,320
Right? And he said, You know, during the war, there was no food, right?

540
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:36,000
No one's farm. I mean, when I went there, there weren't even birds.

541
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,820
The first time I went there, it was such a surreal experience.

542
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,799
Everything that most people would eat anything, right?

543
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,060
Because they had no food. They had no protein. They had no way of getting food.

544
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:54,660
And so, you know, they eat bugs and they eat larva and they eat a lot of things.

545
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:00,930
I would never dream of eating right. But that that's my that's my bug story.

546
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:10,060
Could you speak a little bit more to the process of building trust with your community, starting with regard to the trauma experience?

547
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:16,650
So that's that's a really great question. And I think that I would say the main thing.

548
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:22,440
So one of the things that happened when I first went, so we had the first thing we did was of course like this assessment,

549
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,990
right where you go out to all these communities and you talk to people.

550
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:33,149
And so, of course, I had a team that I was like the white girl from the United States, and I had a team of Liberian women that I was working with.

551
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:38,160
Right, that were nurses and midwives. And we would get in a truck every day and we'd go out to these communities.

552
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,560
And, you know, one day that one of them said to me, like. You're actually coming with us.

553
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:48,770
Like, no one ever usually comes with us. They just, like, tell us what to do and send us on our way.

554
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:54,019
Right. But I rode with these women, like, every day out to these communities.

555
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:59,870
And it was so interesting to me that there was not a day.

556
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:09,880
There almost still is not a day, 20 years later that they don't have to share a story about the war because it was so traumatic.

557
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:14,170
It was so traumatic. Everyone has PTSD.

558
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:22,389
I meet people at the airport. They just spill their guts about what happened to I don't know them from the man on the moon.

559
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:27,760
And I'm sitting next to them and they tell me everything that happened to them during the war, everything.

560
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,510
What happened to their family if their child was killed, if they ran, where they ran, who they ran with.

561
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,940
It's it's it's quite incredible. So.

562
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:47,870
So you have to be present. The other thing you have to do is you have to listen and not talk, which is not very easy for Americans.

563
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,009
Right. So we're used to being the person in the room that and that's valid.

564
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:52,669
And you're right,

565
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:58,670
you want a room and you want to say something because you want to show people that you know what you're talking about or you have an idea or,

566
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,750
you know, I mean, it's a cultural thing for us, right? That is not.

567
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:07,460
You've got to. And when I when I bring other faculty members with me, I tell them right away.

568
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:14,510
Just be quiet and listen. Right. Don't give your opinion right away.

569
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:19,130
Don't give your idea right away. Let people tell you what they want.

570
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:23,870
Right. The other thing is to keep I I've been going for a long time now.

571
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:29,630
I you know, some days I feel like I have more friends and colleagues in Liberia than I do an introvert.

572
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:33,050
Because when I'm there, I'm really, really there. Right.

573
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,859
I'm there. I'm I'm in the field every day. I'm working.

574
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:41,060
I know. I mean, I know, I know people's families. And so they trust me.

575
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:49,130
And I go back to these rural places where maybe it's not you I met the last time, but they know who I am.

576
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:58,909
Right. I mean, I think that's a big part of it is just being present and being and not feeling like, you know, way more than everybody else.

577
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,660
Because you don't you don't really know, Jack about what's going on in their lives.

578
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:11,510
Yeah. Anything else? And my way over my time.

579
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,250
Just about that moment. Okay, I'm almost done.

580
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,560
I'm sorry. I thought I was gonna let you out early, but you guys really got me talking. Sorry.

581
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,649
Okay, so the other thing is that one size doesn't fit all. So don't think that you can go in with an idea like this.

582
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:30,560
Worked in this place, so let's do it here. So just some some challenges.

583
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:37,969
So what I already said this lack of resources, electricity, clean water, sanitation.

584
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:42,860
I mean, I used to carry reams of paper with me because there was nowhere to make a copy of anything.

585
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,280
Right. So I to bring all my all my questionnaires with me.

586
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:49,430
There's not Internet, there's not mobile network.

587
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:56,690
There's no you know, you're going in, you're asking people to do something for you, for your study, and they're already way overwhelmed.

588
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:03,380
Right. And you're asking them to do one more thing. And there's not necessarily always reliable transport.

589
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:08,510
And that. So you have to change your strategy about how you how you approach things.

590
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:14,780
There's the environmental challenges. You know, we couldn't you can't get out to some places during the rainy season.

591
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:20,030
There's flash flooding. It's really hot. And if there's no electricity, there's no fan.

592
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,800
There's not an air conditioner for sure, but there's not even a fan. The terrain is difficult.

593
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,730
It's it's exhaust environmental. It can be exhausting.

594
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:32,510
And the air quality, depending on where you are, can be really poor.

595
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:41,870
Language and literacy. So how do you how do you ensure that people are understanding your questions?

596
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:48,350
Right. And that was what I kind of tried to get across with that first, those demographic questions, how are you going to do it?

597
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,550
Who's going to ask it, how you're going to phrase it, what kind of response you're looking for?

598
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:58,040
I swear to God, every time I read an article that said they used a Likert scale in a low literacy population,

599
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,000
I had to say Your line, this did not work. I know it doesn't work.

600
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:07,040
People cannot do that. People with education can barely do all Likert scale when it's verbal, right?

601
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:16,090
So you might have to use visual analog. So that was the point of that cultural, how that influences research.

602
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:24,300
What's the gender of the of the interviewer? It's really important sometimes that it's a female interviewing a female or a man interviewing a man.

603
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,840
It just depends on on where you are. You have to have permission from the.

604
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:32,290
You always have to ask, can I enter the community? Can I do this?

605
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:40,360
Is it alright with you? Do I have your permission? There are town chiefs in all these places that are sort of like, I don't know, the Senator,

606
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,800
the House of representative person or something, but they there are the mayor, right.

607
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:49,000
Analogous to the mayor that you need to make sure that it's okay with them.

608
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:54,340
You need to think about when the religious holidays are and what kind of observances are happening there.

609
00:59:54,490 --> 01:00:00,879
I can't tell you how many times I've gone somewhere and I'll have like five days of work planned and I and I get there.

610
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,350
And I mean, I've learned over the years I don't do this anymore, but I would get there in like three of the days.

611
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:09,879
Of the five days are some sort of country holiday and no one's working.

612
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:16,970
So I can't talk to anybody. You have to really be thinking about coercion, right?

613
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:22,400
Because if you're working with people that make one or $2 a day, if they're if they're lucky,

614
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:27,710
are you going to give them $10 to talk to you for an interview or you're going to give them $25 to talk to you for an interview?

615
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,750
I mean, those are things that you need to take into consideration and the power dynamics.

616
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:44,000
So and, you know, I mean, really, I. We I always work with my my in-country partners to do the interviewing and all of that and all of that stuff.

617
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:50,380
And there's no there's no gold standard for this stuff. It's you know, it's kind of learn as you go.

618
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:56,470
But there are some there are some things to kind of guide you. And then also, how are you going to keep yourself safe?

619
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:01,210
How are you going to keep yourself? You know, road safety is an issue.

620
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,180
How are you going to stay in touch with people at home? Just common sense stuff I've learned over the years.

621
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,250
Like I hate instant coffee.

622
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:17,590
I always bring a little coffee press and regular coffee so that I am happy at the beginning of the day and I can get through the day.

623
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:23,080
So, you know, you figure those things out. And there's just lots of rewards to it, right?

624
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:30,459
I mean, in addition to advancing scientific knowledge, you learn about other people, you learn about other places.

625
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:37,120
You learn that life is different in the world and and and, you know, maybe you'll make an impact.

626
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,410
Maybe you won't, but you will gain a lot for yourself from doing this kind of work.

627
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:46,340
So I think that's all I have, is there's a few books that, you know,

628
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,430
we often we have in our office for folks that are going abroad that they might want to look at.

629
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,370
That's it. Thank you. Questions?

630
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,260
Well, thanks for having me. It was a pleasure.

631
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,780
Thank you for coming in. Really interesting. Yeah, I hope it was helpful at some level.

632
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:23,270
I think that's okay. We will stay behind for a while. And it is one of many first impressions of the two of Will on the break.

633
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:24,020
Have a good weekend.
