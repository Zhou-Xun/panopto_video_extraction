00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:05,932
Hello, Before we get into some of

2
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:10,595
the problems associated with pediatric problems and

3
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:16,926
dialysis infections I wanted to review the bloodborne pathogen rules.

4
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:21,297
So in 1991, the Occupational Safety and

5
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:25,783
Health Administration which is called OSHA,

6
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:30,844
it's a federal governmental program that requires

7
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:35,110
employers to have a safe work environment.

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,495
Hello, before we talk about some of the issues that we see

9
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:20,331
with breast milk in pediatrics and dialysis infections,

10
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:24,585
I wanted to review the OSHA bloodborne pathogens.

11
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:29,305
So the occupational Safety and Health Administration which is part of

12
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:34,905
the federal government, requires that employers have a safe work environment and

13
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:38,760
generally this has not applied to the health care field.

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,084
However, in 1991, when the HIV

15
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:48,244
epidemic was first coming into fruition and

16
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:55,380
it was clear that this may pose risk for health care workers.

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,090
They developed some rules which are actually law.

18
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,762
These are published in the Federal Register and

19
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:11,168
are Basically required by

20
00:02:11,168 --> 00:02:16,750
all health care facilities who hire employers.

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,685
With this comes a mandate for yearly education, but

22
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:25,881
they also have to do more than just say they have these rules in place.

23
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:29,429
They have to actually make sure that their health care workers

24
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,935
are following the rules.

25
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:37,061
So they have come up with a list of what is potentially infectious material,

26
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:43,011
which includes primarily blood body fluids, but any blood components.

27
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:44,359
So that platelets or

28
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:49,270
red blood cells also are considered to be potentially infectious.

29
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,881
Any genital fluids are infectious obviously that's how it's

30
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,797
generally transmitted.

31
00:02:55,797 --> 00:03:01,870
Fluids that are derived from blood and this includes CSF (cerebral spinal fluid),

32
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,015
peritoneal, pericardial, synovial, pleural and amniotic fluids,

33
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:12,110
are potentially at risk although the magnitude of the risk is unknown.

34
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,988
I will also include in here that breast milk

35
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:21,873
also can transmit a blood borne pathogen.

36
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:27,135
However that's not usually a risk for employees,

37
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:31,800
so it's not included in this employee rule.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,525
Any tissue taken from patients infected obviously is infectious.

39
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:42,516
If you're working with concentrated virus in the lab,

40
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:45,817
that is also obviously infectious.

41
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:50,954
There is no risk from nonbloody saliva, nasal secretions,

42
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:55,295
sputum, sweat, tears, vomit, feces or urine.

43
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:59,962
Now, nevertheless in the hospital setting we don't want our employees

44
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,192
touching things.

45
00:04:01,192 --> 00:04:06,455
Because there may not be HIV transmissible through it, but there could

46
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:12,167
be resistant microorganisms that we just simply do not want people to touch.

47
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:16,115
So the bloodborne pathogens when it first came out,

48
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:19,621
that rule only applied to Hepatitis B and HIV.

49
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:23,327
But we know hepatitis C can also be transmitted very

50
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:26,688
similarly not as efficiently as hepatitis B,

51
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:31,110
but through the same mechanisms as both HIV and Hepatitis B.

52
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,087
There are other infections that are in blood and

53
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:37,146
can be transmitted through blood transfusion.

54
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:41,217
But in general none of these have really been associated

55
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:45,733
with transmission of the infections to healthcare workers.

56
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,844
The risk of transmission from a needle stick which is

57
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:57,812
the biggest concern for employees in the health care setting,

58
00:04:57,812 --> 00:05:02,441
is different by the different types of viruses.

59
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:07,005
Hepatitis B is the most infectious virus and

60
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:13,293
can be transmitted up to 60% of the time to an unvaccinated

61
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:18,130
health care worker if they get a needle stick.

62
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:26,709
And now that's if they have a certain antigen called the HBeAg+..

63
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:32,501
If it's not, that's if the HBeAg+ is not circulating the risk of

64
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:39,961
transmission of Hepatitis B with a needle stick to an employee is still about 30%.

65
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:46,464
So somewhere between 30 and 60% that people can get Hepatitis B through

66
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:52,979
needle stick exposure in the healthcare setting if they are unvaccinated.

67
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,962
Now hepatitis C is less transmissible and

68
00:05:56,962 --> 00:06:01,399
studies have ranged anywhere from 0 to 7%,

69
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,090
most of them come average around 1.8 to 3%.

70
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:13,232
Whereas HIV is the least infectious of all of these viruses and

71
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:20,395
thankfully will transmit to an employee from a needle stick.

72
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,786
About 0.3% of the time.

73
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:27,520
There have been multiple cohort studies of people who were

74
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,675
exposed to needle sticks from a patient with HIV and

75
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:35,460
this number is very consistent it's 0.3.

76
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:43,073
We have some ways to decrease this risk and I will talk about those in a minute.

77
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:47,955
Now, for the purposes of the bloodborne pathogen rules they were

78
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:50,361
focused on Hepatitis B and HIV.

79
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:56,200
So I'll tell you a little bit about these two infections.

80
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,804
Hepatitis B can lead to a fulminant hepatitis and

81
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:05,310
death in about 1% of patients who require it.

82
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,918
But the majority of people have a minor infection and recover.

83
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:17,501
5-10% of the people who are infected can become chronic carriers.

84
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:20,978
And this is where we have a problem in our health care setting.

85
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:25,651
Some of those carriers will develop chronic hepatitis and

86
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:29,750
those who get hepatitis can go on to get cirrhosis or

87
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,256
that scarring fibrosis of the liver and some of those can get cancer of the liver.

88
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,176
But the majority of these people,

89
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:43,918
75 to 80% will be asymptomatic chronic carriers.

90
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,980
And there is no way to tell,

91
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,760
from their clinical presentation that they have Hepatitis B.

92
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,195
So approximately 1 to 1 1/2% of all hospital admissions are people

93
00:07:56,195 --> 00:08:00,926
who carry the Hepatitis B surface antigen and are infectious.

94
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:06,325
And the majority of those 80 to 90% are never identified.

95
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:10,512
We don't test our patients when they come into the hospital for

96
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,975
hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV.

97
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:17,568
So, this is the basis we've already talked about standard precautions.

98
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:23,035
This is the basis for standard precautions that we assume that all blood and

99
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:29,311
all body fluids are potentially infectious with one of these bloodborne pathogens.

100
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,236
Now we have some ways to prevent transmission and

101
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,960
the most important one is by vaccine.

102
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,220
Hepatitis B vaccines are very effective and very safe.

103
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,430
We currently use the recombinant vaccine.

104
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,497
Prior to the recombinant vaccines, we had something called

105
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:59,269
HepB vax which was a vaccine that had Hepatitis B antigen derived from patients.

106
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,843
This was developed at a time when HIV was also present and

107
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:09,120
you can imagine that there was not a good uptake of that vaccine.

108
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,476
People did not want to run the risk of possibly getting another

109
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:15,680
infection from that vaccine.

110
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,353
While that may not have been warranted,

111
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:23,794
it led to a lot of ineffective vaccine programs.

112
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:30,850
The new vaccine is recombinant, it does not have anything derived from patients.

113
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,018
It's very safe and the side effects are really minimal,

114
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:37,191
this is probably one of the safest vaccines that we have.

115
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,790
And in 1997, about 65% of at risk HCWs had been vaccinated.

116
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,827
And that was included 75% of those with frequent exposures,

117
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:54,184
but it was even less than people who had low risk

118
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:58,240
dietary in clerical healthcare workers.

119
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,056
However despite that,

120
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:05,875
hepatitis B declined.

121
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:10,427
In 1983, there were 17,000 hepatitis B infections in health care workers and

122
00:10:10,427 --> 00:10:12,561
that had declined to 400 in 1995.

123
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:19,005
To the point that Hepatitis B was less at the time of this study in 1997,

124
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:23,713
the Hepatitis B was actually less common in healthcare

125
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:27,828
workers than it was in the general population.

126
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:31,233
Now, we don't have any more recent studies but

127
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:35,501
I would expect that the risk is pretty much equivalent now.

128
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:40,091
Because we've started vaccinating babies and teenagers and so

129
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:44,911
more of the general population has been vaccinated now.

130
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:49,890
The Hepatitis B vaccine has long term protection in adults at

131
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,860
least till 11 years.

132
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,196
And a recent study of children and

133
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:58,546
adolescents the immunity was lasted for at least 22 years.

134
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:02,357
And if you've had the vaccine and developed an antibody,

135
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:06,558
even if your antibody should drop below the detectable levels,

136
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:11,265
you can still be protected because there will be an amnesty [INAUDIBLE].

137
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:16,166
However, if an employee has had an exposure,

138
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:21,570
we measure the antibody levels and we give a booster

139
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:28,504
to make sure that they have a good response in case of an exposure.

140
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:35,360
Now I'm going to move to HIV which thankfully is less transmissible.

141
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,973
Again, 0.3% of needle sticks will result in transmission of HIV.

142
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:46,970
These were the early serial conversions in healthcare

143
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,671
workers that were collected by the CDC.

144
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:54,245
There is no recent information, but

145
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:59,549
it gives us information about the epidemiology of what

146
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:05,213
it is that will result in a health care worker getting HIV.

147
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:11,514
You can see that they had 57 exposures that had been collected.

148
00:12:11,514 --> 00:12:17,150
These were people who were known to be HIV negative at the time that they got in.

149
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:22,305
It'll stick with or had an exposure to HIV.

150
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:26,215
And the majority of those 48% excuse me,

151
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:32,041
48 out of the 57 not 88% were from percutaneous exposure.

152
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,414
That means something sharp pierced the skin,

153
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:42,150
percutaneous across the skin, and resulted in infection.

154
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,195
There were also five mucocutaneous exposures,

155
00:12:47,195 --> 00:12:53,100
that means that blood landed either on mucous membrane or

156
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,060
on open skin and resulted infection.

157
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,316
So, we know That blood on open

158
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:08,110
skin can can cause transmission of HIV.

159
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,486
If it causes transmission of HIV it can cause transmission of any of

160
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,371
the blood borne pathogens.

161
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:19,789
Now, importantly no surgeons or searcher needles

162
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:25,459
that's the closed needles that used in the operating

163
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:30,633
room have ever resulted in transmission of HIV.

164
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:35,242
Of these people who zero converted in this study,

165
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:40,071
the type of fluid that resulted in transmission 49

166
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:45,131
out of the 57 or 86% were from HIV infected blood.

167
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,480
So blood is the risk [LAUGH] blood is the risk,

168
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,640
people who were working in the lab with concentrated virus resulted

169
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,456
in three of those infections, and then visibly bloody fluid.

170
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:03,042
So one of the fluids that we mentioned earlier that had blood in it that

171
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:07,631
is clearly infectious, but it's probably mostly from the blood and

172
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,475
not from the fluid itself.

173
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:14,576
Although, we assume that any of those fluids can result in transmission.

174
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,424
And this is a case control study looking at it was

175
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:24,610
done in several countries again by the CDC.

176
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,665
Looking at all types of needle stick exposures, and

177
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:33,471
looking at what were the risk factors that lead to infection.

178
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,805
And a deep injury that's something that crosses the skin and deep into the muscle,

179
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:45,165
or deeper tissues had a 16 fold increased risk of transmitting HIV.

180
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:50,757
If there was visible blood on the device so that if they had some type of a scalpel

181
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:56,289
or something that pierced with blood on it that increased the risk fivefold.

182
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:57,805
If they had a needle,

183
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:03,390
if they were stuck with a needle that was placed directly into a vein or artery.

184
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,639
Those needles have a lumen, and so there's more blood on

185
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,418
the inside of that needle than as opposed to the suture needles,

186
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:17,569
which we already mentioned don't seem to transmit these very well.

187
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:23,200
Terminal illness, that means somebody who's dying of

188
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,350
their HIV had a sixfold increase of transmission,

189
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,138
and what this tells us is that this is likely to be

190
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:38,668
the correlated with the amount of circulating virus.

191
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:47,380
Right now, we can measure the viral load of that the patient has in their blood.

192
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,969
People who are at the end stages of HIV have a large amount of

193
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:58,580
circulating virus and so there inoculate is much higher.

194
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,722
Now, we would measure the viral load, but

195
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:07,180
at the time of this study, there was no such tests that we could do.

196
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,610
So postexposure zidovudline, that's our first ever antiviral.

197
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:19,978
This also showed that if health care worker was given postexposure zidovudline,

198
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:24,791
that there was an 80% reduction in the risk of HIV.

199
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:30,987
And so that's been the basis for our postexposure prophylaxis that

200
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:37,420
we give to patients who have a significant exposure to HIV.

201
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,222
So what can health care workers do to decrease their risk of

202
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:46,541
infection with one of these blood borne pathogens?

203
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,455
Well, the risk is dependent on a few things number one,

204
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:53,051
the prevalence of the infection in their community where they work,

205
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:56,050
most people don't choose where they work based on this.

206
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,327
So that one may not be in, unless they make a conscious decision that

207
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:07,456
they're going to work somewhere where there is fewer blood borne pathogens.

208
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:12,363
Again, they're not going to be able to control this however, they can control

209
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:17,125
the total number of exposures they have and there are some things they can do to

210
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:21,911
decrease the risk of transmission associated with an individual exposure.

211
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,331
So, how can they decrease their risk of exposure?

212
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:32,354
Number one, we have already gone over standard precautions,

213
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:37,020
they can also be very careful with the handling of sharps.

214
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,750
There are other work practice controls that will decrease the risk of exposure.

215
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,095
We have a post exposure evaluation and treatment program through

216
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:50,677
occupational health that you've heard a little bit about already,

217
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:54,240
and then management of infectious waste.

218
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,551
So, standard precautions you know it assumes that all patients are infectious.

219
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,701
We assume that all body fluids are infectious even though ocean does not

220
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:07,853
necessarily say that we know there are other things besides blood borne

221
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,230
pathogens that we want to be of concern.

222
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,546
So we use the same precautions for

223
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:16,361
all body fluids regardless of the patient diagnosis.

224
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:21,213
And you know that hand washing is the most important thing that health care workers

225
00:18:21,213 --> 00:18:23,660
can do for their own safety.

226
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,414
So, gloves are required in some settings,

227
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:33,426
we want health care workers to wear gloves with

228
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:38,566
most body substances before touching anything

229
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:45,420
that's moist either mucous membranes or non-intact skin.

230
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,403
It is part of the blood borne pathogens law that health care workers have

231
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:55,080
to wear gloves before performing any vascular access procedure.

232
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,764
So, this was an issue when we first started implementing this rule,

233
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:05,566
that flat bottom is the people who draw blood for a living,

234
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:10,564
felt that their dexterity was decreased by wearing gloves,

235
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:13,118
they've since got used to it.

236
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,868
We also required gloves for handling of any item or

237
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:21,871
surface contaminated with body fluids before cleaning up blood or

238
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:25,176
body fluid spills and over abraded cracks or

239
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:29,940
non-intact skin that's for the patient's own protection.

240
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,555
Excuse me for the healthcare workers protection from splashes onto open skin,

241
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:38,586
which we know can transmit these viruses.

242
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:44,646
But it's also for the patients protection because it's been speculated that

243
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:51,070
a dentist transmitted HIV to a number of his patients through open skin while work,

244
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,241
that may have contaminated them while they were having work done.

245
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,369
So, this is flat bottom is drawing blood wearing gloves,

246
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,725
you might ask why do they need to do this when

247
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:11,730
the risk is really from a needle stick.

248
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,760
But there are studies that show if you have a needle stick through

249
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,163
a pair of gloves that way tips off a significant amount of the blood and

250
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:27,970
inoculation that reaches the skin and pierces into the skin will be less.

251
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:35,988
So we recommend it even though we know that the needle make pierce it,

252
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:42,495
it's going to decrease the in oculus of that exposure.

253
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:47,067
In the operating room it's very well

254
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:51,800
known that gloves will break and rip.

255
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,540
And if they wear a second pair of gloves,

256
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,620
that inner glove will usually stay intact.

257
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,185
And healthcare workers are actually recommended in

258
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:09,587
the operating room to wear two sets of gloves for that reason.

259
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:13,464
We have employees where facial or

260
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:18,032
something to cover their their eyes and

261
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:23,161
a mask if any splashing might likely occur.

262
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,842
And as always with standard precautions we asked them to wear a new pair of

263
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:33,530
gloves with each task on a single patient, not wash the gloves and reuse.

264
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,528
These gloves are very cheap, they are not meant to be washed and

265
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:39,580
they should just be discarded.

266
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:45,610
And whenever they remove their gloves, hand washing is still essential.

267
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,535
We have them wear gowns that protect the clothing,

268
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:54,670
these are impermeable if there's gonna be any type of splashing.

269
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,103
These may not be the same type of gowns that are used for

270
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:02,075
contact precautions where we're not expecting splashing,

271
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:06,070
it's more to protect the clothes from resistant organisms.

272
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:11,056
And of course people should be covering their shoes if they

273
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:14,690
might get a splash to the shoes.

274
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,582
Now, sharps are the biggest risks we've mentioned that, and

275
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:24,288
it is essential that health care workers discard the syringe

276
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:28,100
with a needle attached into a sharps container.

277
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:33,003
So the natural thing for a health care worker after

278
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:37,564
using a needle is to try to recap it for safety.

279
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:44,066
But over and over and over again the data from occupational health shows that

280
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:50,976
most of the needle sticks occur on the non-dominant hand, either on the thumb or

281
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:56,481
the first finger because people have tried to recap the needle.

282
00:22:56,481 --> 00:23:01,631
So we teach this over and over again, it doesn't always

283
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:06,690
work [LAUGH] but we recommend never recapping a needle.

284
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,336
It's just the syringe should be disposed of without

285
00:23:11,336 --> 00:23:15,455
removing the needle, without recapping it,

286
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:20,650
we don't have them bend or break or cut the needle by hand.

287
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,581
There is a way that they can recap the needle if

288
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:28,160
they feel it's just not safe to be walking around with an open needle.

289
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,731
They can do the scoop method which they lay the cap on to a surface,

290
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:40,970
they scoop up the cap and then they give pressure to attach it.

291
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,174
We do not recommend this as a general rule, but

292
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:49,611
every once in a while there are situations where a needle needs to be re-kept.

293
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,154
We also asked them to perform all procedures in a manner that is

294
00:23:56,154 --> 00:24:01,162
meant to decrease splashing or spray that doesn't come up so

295
00:24:01,162 --> 00:24:05,700
often, but everybody should be thinking about that.

296
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,177
We have all specimens that are going to the lab placed into

297
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:12,990
what's called the biohazard bag.

298
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,597
You can see here the biohazard label,

299
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:21,561
tells everybody that's handling this that there could be infectious material in it.

300
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:27,970
People should not be eating patient care areas because they

301
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:34,982
may be putting things into their mouth that they picked up in the environment,

302
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:41,375
or they should not be applying makeup or the balm in a patient care area.

303
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:46,229
They should not be keeping food in a refrigerator where infectious

304
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:47,968
materials are stored.

305
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:53,580
You probably think why does this have to be even said?

306
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,856
You probably would not ever consider eating in a patient room,

307
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,778
but I can tell you that people become desensitized after they've worked

308
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:06,018
in an area, it becomes almost like their home.

309
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:07,941
And I have seen nurses,

310
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:13,037
physicians doing all kinds of things that are simply not safe,

311
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:19,494
for the most part especially now with COVID things have gotten a little better.

312
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:24,854
If there is a blood spill in our hospital, we follow this protocol,

313
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:29,942
different hospitals have different spill cleanup protocols.

314
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:36,084
We always have the healthcare worker wear gloves, they should absorb the blood with

315
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:41,287
paper towel or something absorbent to remove as much of it as possible.

316
00:25:41,287 --> 00:25:47,016
Flood the area with 70% alcohol or bleach or one of the disinfectants

317
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:52,184
that's up on the floor and then allow the disinfectant to work.

318
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:57,230
And at that point you can do this, the health care worker can do this,

319
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:02,462
or they can have employed the environmental services come and do this.

320
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:09,864
But eventually environmental services will need to finish cleaning up this mess.

321
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:15,111
We especially do not want anybody, if there's glass that's broken with

322
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:20,796
the blood, they should not be trying to pick that up with their hands in any way.

323
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,366
There are brooms,

324
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:27,678
old brooms that can be used to clean up sharps or there are tongs.

325
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:33,488
There are lots of different ways that we can pick it up without using hands,

326
00:26:33,488 --> 00:26:36,083
but still exposures can happen.

327
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:40,717
So, an employee should wash the area with soap and water,

328
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:44,878
let the water flow over the area as much as possible,

329
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:48,473
if it's bleeding let it bleed a little bit but

330
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:52,842
they shouldn't be massaging or irritating the area.

331
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:58,016
If it's a mucous membrane, then it should be flushed copiously with water or

332
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:02,250
there's some eye flushes that are available upon the floors.

333
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,034
And then the healthcare worker collects the name and

334
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:08,614
the registration of the patient and

335
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:13,779
they call occupational health services, we have a 24 hour hotline.

336
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,980
This goes to the emergency department on off hours when

337
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,200
occupational health is not open, the exposure will be evaluated.

338
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,675
If it was a true exposure, then they will initiate

339
00:27:27,675 --> 00:27:32,262
testing of the patient and the healthcare worker,

340
00:27:32,262 --> 00:27:38,034
they will start prophylaxis for HIV if it's deemed important.

341
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:43,263
We do have a rapid HIV test that is available to test

342
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:48,626
our our patients if there is an employee exposure.

343
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,704
In Michigan you are not allowed to do HIV testing without

344
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,838
the patient's permission or knowledge.

345
00:27:55,838 --> 00:27:58,188
However, we have one exception and

346
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:02,507
that is if there is an inpatient exposure to a health care worker.

347
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:07,347
We are allowed to test the patient, we still want to make sure that

348
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:11,926
the patient is aware and that they're having this test done.

349
00:28:11,926 --> 00:28:16,548
But we are allowed to go ahead and do that,

350
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:23,032
all follow up is through occupational health and safety.

351
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:26,212
The triage nurse will evaluate the exposure,

352
00:28:26,212 --> 00:28:30,869
they will test the patient and the healthcare worker as mentioned.

353
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:35,305
The employee will get appropriate counseling and

354
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:38,684
we have post exposure prophylaxis for

355
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:43,338
HIV that is given if there's a true exposure to HIV.

356
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:49,540
It's not an easy regimen, and you have to take that medication for

357
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,079
four weeks, but it can decrease the risk of HIV,

358
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,983
in fact it significantly decreases the risk of HIV.

359
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:02,872
And so most health care workers will definitely take it.

360
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:10,723
The post exposure hepatitis B vaccination will be offered if appropriate.

361
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:16,344
We also have a hepatitis B immune globulin which is high dose, immune globulin that

362
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:21,666
can be given to people who are not immune, who've had a hepatitis B exposure.

363
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:28,088
Testing and treatment for, we don't have prophylaxis for hepatitis C.

364
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:32,400
We will test the patient and will test the employee,

365
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,672
if there should happen to be follow up conversion to hepatitis C infection,

366
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:43,681
then we would start treatment for that employee right away.

367
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:48,749
Unfortunately there is no prophylaxis that's intermediate,

368
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:54,185
but we do, do follow up and make sure that we get people on appropriate

369
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:59,746
therapy which is pretty good about, at eradicating the disease now.

370
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:05,006
So let me finish by talking about regulated and infectious waste.

371
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:07,351
There are multiple laws regarding this,

372
00:30:07,351 --> 00:30:11,245
there's the blood borne pathogens which is what's included here.

373
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:18,471
But Michigan also has their own law for medical waste that we also have to follow.

374
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:24,262
For the blood borne pathogens they consider liquid or semi-liquid blood or

375
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:28,799
potentially infectious materials to be regulated waste.

376
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,399
Any items that are contaminated with blood or body fluids which could be

377
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:38,229
released if compressed, so that's a dressing that has blood in it that's

378
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:43,235
enough that it would sip out, then it's considered to be infectious waste.

379
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:48,243
A bandage with a drop of blood on it, is not considered infectious waste.

380
00:30:48,243 --> 00:30:52,234
Items that are caked with blood, dried blood enough so

381
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:57,277
that it could flake off once, is also considered infectious waste.

382
00:30:57,277 --> 00:30:59,316
Contaminated sharps obviously,

383
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,340
very concerning those that's the biggest risk and

384
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,276
those that's considered to be infectious waste and requires special treatment.

385
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:13,985
Pathological and microbiological waste are also considered infectious waste.

386
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:21,270
So anything that is on list has to be labeled as a biohazard.

387
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:28,479
We use the red bag system for the most part, So red bags all have a biohazard.

388
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:33,334
And anything that fits the category of infectious

389
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:37,611
waste needs to be placed in a red bag unless,

390
00:31:37,611 --> 00:31:42,244
it is a sharp object that could pierce that bag.

391
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:46,094
So here on the left hand side is a picture of

392
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:50,504
all the things that are considered to be sharp.

393
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:54,710
This is a glass vial, so if it broke it would pierce the bag so

394
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,331
it has to go into a sharps container.

395
00:31:57,331 --> 00:32:02,371
Now, in Michigan for they have always considered syringes

396
00:32:02,371 --> 00:32:07,327
to be a sharps, even though there may not be a needle on it.

397
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:14,684
So this would also require a sharps container.

398
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:17,848
These items, these cannulas and

399
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:22,933
wires are not exactly sharp, but they could pierce,

400
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:27,578
these are pretty stiff and they can pierce a bag.

401
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:32,604
So these all have to go into a sharps container which is impermeable,

402
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:35,041
these things are tough plastic.

403
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:42,607
They have a lid that closes so that these needles and sharp devices won't fall out.

404
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:52,069
And then they are managed as waste.

405
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:56,505
Instruments are also obviously sharp but they are reusable and

406
00:32:56,505 --> 00:33:00,193
they have to be reprocessed, usually sterilized.

407
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:04,636
But if you put them into a bin, we don't want our employees

408
00:33:04,636 --> 00:33:09,635
to be reaching in to grab these things and then get a needle stick.

409
00:33:09,635 --> 00:33:14,705
So, all of our instruments are placed into these

410
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:21,631
containers where there's like a calendar that can be pulled out,

411
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:28,328
so that employees don't have to reach in and grab these things.

412
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:33,031
It's labeled with a biohazard again just to make sure everybody

413
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:37,747
knows that there is something that needs special care in there.

414
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:41,580
So, one final thing, there's always

415
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,586
controversy of what to do with this medical waste.

416
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:51,600
We have used landfills in the past, the problem is those are becoming

417
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,537
much scarcer and it's not the greatest thing for the environment.

418
00:33:56,537 --> 00:34:01,194
So, in our hospital we have something called the autoclave which is

419
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:05,455
actually a grinding machine that autoclaves this material.

420
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:11,930
Even the sharps container are placed into this and ground up.

421
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:17,719
It gets rid of things like the syringes and the needles so that trash like this

422
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,426
does not wash up on the Great Lakes shores, which has happened in the past.

423
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:30,146
So, there's a lot of controversy about what we should be doing with this but

424
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:35,081
our hospitalists have chosen to use the autoclave now.

425
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:37,669
So, key points for this lecture,

426
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:42,847
blood borne pathogens are a risk for employees and there's a risk for

427
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:47,414
help for patients too that we'll talk about at a later date.

428
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:52,448
They can be prevented, exposures can be prevented

429
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:56,670
through the use of standard precautions.

430
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,989
Mostly the safe handling of sharps, handwashing is still most

431
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:05,235
critical infection prevention intervention that we can do.

432
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:10,146
Standard precautions incorporates protections for blood borne pathogens,

433
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:13,426
and we've been discussing that all semester long.

434
00:35:13,426 --> 00:35:17,414
Exposures of employees to blood borne pathogens can still occur.

435
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:21,516
And we have a post exposure evaluation and testing and

436
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:26,805
treatment program to make sure that employees who've had exposures

437
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:31,563
have a much decreased risk of actually acquiring infection.

438
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:34,923
So thank you, we'll talk about this more in class.
