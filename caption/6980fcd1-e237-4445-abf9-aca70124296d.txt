1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,885
After watching this video,

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,525
you will be able to
use PROC PHREG to run

3
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:14,805
multivariable Cox
regression models

4
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:17,580
and test for interaction terms.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,095
Once more, we keep using our
return to drug use example.

6
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:23,670
Now we're going back to

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,280
our original main
exposure, treatment.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,380
We're going to adjust
for other variables in

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,030
the dataset that maybe
potential confounders.

10
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,890
Remember the sum of
the variables that

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,005
we have in the dataset are age,

12
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,075
number of previous
drug treatments,

13
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:41,475
site, and heroin or cocaine use.

14
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,545
Note that those variables

15
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,750
could perfectly be
potential confounders,

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,160
since they can affect
drug relapsing,

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,970
and they could also
be associated with

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,600
the type of program that
the patient choose.

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,395
Remember that in any
observational study,

20
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,569
the association between
the main exposure

21
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:02,180
and the outcome can
always be confounded.

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,560
So we will need to adjust

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,585
for other potential confounders.

24
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,070
The process to choose

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,085
potential confounders
is the same as before.

26
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:12,470
We chose among
known predictors of

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,935
the outcome using
the prior knowledge.

28
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:16,700
Now we can check if they're also

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,549
associated to the exposure
in our study population.

30
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,390
Let's assume that we
have done already this,

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,715
and we want to adjust
our final model by age,

32
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:28,720
number of previous
treatments, and site.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,085
We have already seen the
code for running Cox models.

34
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:33,830
The only difference
now is that we're

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,200
entering more than one
variable in the model.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,120
But just to review, remember that

37
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,940
the outcome variable is
defined by both the time,

38
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,280
and the censor variable.

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,610
Once more, remember
you need to specify

40
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,395
the code for censoring,
in this case, zero.

41
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:49,560
Then you have your main
exposure variable,

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,870
which is treatment,
short versus long.

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,510
You add the three potential
confounders that we

44
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,910
mentioned in the
previous slide: age,

45
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,745
number of previous
treatments, and site.

46
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,460
You get your variable
estimate as before with

47
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,960
their corresponding
[inaudible] test,

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,595
and the hazard ratios.

49
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:08,180
The interpretation
of this hazard ratio

50
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,575
would be something like this.

51
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:15,050
The rate of relapse the
decreases by 21.6 percent when

52
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,450
people follow the long
program compared to

53
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,945
the short program adjusting
for potential confounders.

54
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:22,280
Note that to decide

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,785
which variables to retain
or not in the model,

56
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:28,115
you will do the same as you
did before with other models,

57
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,230
checking the impact
of those variables

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,130
in the data estimate
of your main exposure.

59
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,450
So now, let's look at
statistical interactions.

60
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,100
Exactly the same as before,

61
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,075
just enter a product term.

62
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,245
In older SAS versions,

63
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,780
you had to do it slightly
different, but not anymore.

64
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,850
Imagine we want to
test if there is

65
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,055
an interaction
between age and site.

66
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:52,220
Because we hypothesize that
the association between site

67
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,395
and drug relapse varies by
age, or the other way around.

68
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:59,100
We can enter a
product term to test

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,095
for the interaction
between site and age,

70
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:02,385
same as we did before.

71
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:05,535
In this example, it will
be the age by site term.

72
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:07,950
When we run the model
because we said

73
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,280
variable is binary and
age is continuous,

74
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,070
we get one unique [inaudible]
for that product term.

75
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,070
We can evaluate the significance

76
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,020
with the corresponding
[inaudible] test.

77
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,875
In this situation, the
p-value is 0.0294,

78
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,570
so it's significant
and therefore,

79
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,770
we will give the
interaction in the model.

80
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,630
Note that we don't get

81
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,355
hazard ratios for the variables

82
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:32,810
involved in the interaction.

83
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,100
If you check the log,

84
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,140
it actually tells you
that if you want them,

85
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,645
you will have to use the
hazard ratio statement.

86
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:40,700
You can also use the statement to

87
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,590
get 95 percent
confidence interval,

88
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,660
or you could also use contrast

89
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,125
or estimate statement
as we did before.

90
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,860
But for the sake of simplicity,

91
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,970
we are not going to go over

92
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,590
that since I only want you to get

93
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,450
some flavor of Cox models

94
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,020
and not give you too
much information.

95
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,125
In summary, in this video,

96
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,760
we use PROC PHREG to run

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,625
multi-variable Cox
regression models

98
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,245
and test for interaction terms.

99
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:05,015
In the next video, we will talk

100
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,531
about time varying covariates.
