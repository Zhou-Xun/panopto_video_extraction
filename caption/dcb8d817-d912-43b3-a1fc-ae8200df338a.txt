1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,340
We're living in unprecedented times.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,041
And it seems like the experience of many faculty and

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:18,300
students is one of disillusionment.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,880
In some cases it's overwhelm and frustration and this kind

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,798
of state of affairs means that as we think about developing the new core and

6
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:35,596
maybe even just how we think about our own classes,

7
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:43,100
we should be trying to figure out what can actually get us out of this situation.

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,080
We're a caring institution,

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,800
we've got compassion and innovation as two of our core values and

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,341
we've got this opportunity right now,

11
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:59,706
I mean, this is a very difficult time, but it's a great opportunity for us

12
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:05,349
to re conceptualize how could we do things in a way that creates new community?

13
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,840
It creates a better connection between people.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,036
We've been so isolated and in a kind of virtual box on Zoom

15
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:20,840
that how do we find the gentle ways to bring us back into 3D.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,992
That allows people to feel like they are valued and that they have something

17
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:31,940
to contribute and that it really is important for us to come together again.

18
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:38,374
So how do we take this moment and build our listening are supporting and

19
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:43,719
actually are challenging to be our best selves in this next

20
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:49,065
iteration of the school of public health at the University

21
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:54,140
of Michigan in 2022, 2023 and beyond.

22
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,109
We've got lots of things that we can do and in this video, I'm going to talk about

23
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:03,001
some of them and break it down from these more generalities to.

24
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,626
Well, alright, well what do you mean?

25
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:07,740
What can we do?

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,940
Well, one of the first things that we can do is,

27
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,426
we can really think about the learning environment.

28
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:17,900
So all of us and I shouldn't be completely generalizing,

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,037
but I think all of us spend much of our time in the passive

30
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:30,099
lecture learning our particular knowledge base and in a sense our craft.

31
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:35,785
That learning environment today needs actually more attention and

32
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:39,481
it needs more data and support to be honest.

33
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:44,900
So as we think about creating the learning environments of the future,

34
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,328
we're gonna start with identifying the student assets,

35
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:54,411
sending out a baseline survey during the summer before they come.

36
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:59,701
So we can better understand where are they on all of the fundamentals?

37
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,100
Where they already got expertise and

38
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,201
where are they just beginning as well as what is some of their work experience,

39
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:11,221
because some of them within jobs have learned things that they

40
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:15,975
never learned in the classroom, but actually are quite proficient at.

41
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:21,996
So this gives us another way to start the process of community building,

42
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:25,067
which is how can we see the students?

43
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:30,402
We're also going to focus in through this process are on enabling ways so

44
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:35,911
that all the students can feel like they are gonna come into an equitable and

45
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:39,510
inclusive environment where they're valued.

46
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,040
So when we build the courses were gonna be thinking about,

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,880
how do we build the community to nurture those student assets?

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,821
We're gonna create connections where students that have expertise can

49
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:55,040
give it and receive some credit for that.

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,117
Or for instance, we are thinking about hiring some coaches

51
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:04,788
of people that are actually students that are actually

52
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:09,340
proficient at some of the key sort of elements.

53
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,602
We have never actually used an assessment of our student body as a way of

54
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:20,756
understanding its strengths and there's a lot of richness within our students

55
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:27,206
lived experiences that they can bring both professionally, as well as culturally.

56
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:30,710
Every culture has wisdom to provide and

57
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,338
we've never actually opened ourselves up as a core curriculum

58
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:41,024
to the students actually being sort of co-creators.

59
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:45,509
How we're gonna do that is not only asking them and the listening, but

60
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,259
then supporting them when they do tell us.

61
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,539
And we're going to ask for the feedback on how we're doing on a regular fashion.

62
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:58,315
So that we can see where is it that the community is growing

63
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:03,301
stronger as well as are there things that have weakened it.

64
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:07,790
We know that we've got a lot of great students in our midst and so

65
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,602
inside of the core, we will find ways and build ways so

66
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:16,460
that the students can actually demonstrate their own leadership.

67
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,301
This is a core skill and public health.

68
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,420
I mean, Michigan is leaders invest.

69
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,177
So we have to build it so that they can have the students walk into their

70
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,802
leadership shoes and and try it out and

71
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:36,240
gain the experience that allows them to take that into their careers.

72
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,901
We also are gonna infuse as one of our main cross cutting themes an

73
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,693
anti-racist framework.

74
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:47,566
That will allow both faculty and students to connect sort of

75
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:52,146
the individual actions, how, they are actually, for

76
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:57,019
instance, from a faculty perspective working on this part

77
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:01,988
of their own development and putting it into their classes,

78
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:06,396
into their course design and you know, the great DEI

79
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:11,517
work that all the departments have been doing so that we can see

80
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:16,940
the trajectory into changes in our programs and in our policies.

81
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,673
So we're gonna be supporting faculty in doing this work through creating

82
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:26,340
learning communities for anti-racist principles and practices.

83
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,118
But then we're also gonna be supporting students training in equity and

84
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:36,206
inclusion and some of this anti racist framework as well as how to organise and

85
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:40,612
do this work so that they can see the benefit of collective action.

86
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:45,697
If we can get collective action by both faculty and students on this really

87
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:51,028
important domain, it'll make a huge difference not only to us as a school but

88
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:55,210
to the world and to public health as a major field of action and

89
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,140
influence in fighting racism as a public health problem.

90
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,922
So infused into the courses that will form both the fall and

91
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:12,704
the winter will be a underlying curriculum that is focused

92
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:19,330
on building skills that are associated with working with people.

93
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,534
So leadership skills, project management and problem solving

94
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:30,795
skills that are focused on the team project, but then also group behaviour and

95
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:35,710
conflict management and understanding social identity and

96
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,520
being able to give constructive good feedback as well as to receive it.

97
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,993
So those are sort of natural and

98
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:49,514
important ways that the core itself will start to become an ecosystem

99
00:07:49,514 --> 00:07:54,463
that will have reflective as well as kind of forward motion in

100
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:59,412
skill development that will make sure that the faculty are not

101
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:04,940
trying to do everything, the GSIS are not trying to do everything.

102
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,301
The students actually have this as a major part of what they're

103
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:15,040
developing in terms of looking at excellence and trying to achieve it.

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,232
I already talked a little bit about having that professional

105
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,753
development also tied to the authentic public health products,

106
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:28,380
both written and oral to both lay and to professional audiences.

107
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,743
And this is one of those places where you can start to see that these skill

108
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:36,015
sets start to build together because if you can lead,

109
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:40,012
if you can manage conflict and if you actually are good at giving or

110
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:46,040
receiving feedback, you're gonna be a better communicator.

111
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,460
So hopefully some of you are starting to think how are you going to do this?

112
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:58,143
Well, we've been incredibly lucky that the university has recently completed and

113
00:08:58,143 --> 00:09:02,255
rolled out team based project classrooms and

114
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:06,688
we are gonna put in our application in the Fall for

115
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:12,890
the students to be able to use these as you can see from this picture,

116
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,520
it allows the students to actually work on their own space.

117
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:24,375
We're thinking team sizes of four or five, there might be some wiggle room in there,

118
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:29,340
but that's kind of the best, not too large, not too small.

119
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,299
And inside of these classrooms are these big screens where you can, for

120
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:39,756
instance, spend the first half an hour lecturing and getting key concepts and

121
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:44,801
making sure that the students know what they're supposed to be doing and

122
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,880
then they move into the the team based work

123
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,535
where they will be practicing some of their team skills as well as integrating

124
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:58,755
in that new knowledge into kind of their pressing public health issue,

125
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,105
that is a part of their project.

126
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:05,412
One last piece of this community building and

127
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:11,305
integration that we feel like has been missing in our previous

128
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:16,743
incarnation of the core is ways in which we can tap into and

129
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:21,048
amplify what is the, I'll call it values and

130
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:25,952
the work that we're doing for instance, in our DEI

131
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:30,736
kind of work at the school wide level as well as departments, our emphasis and

132
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:34,497
our attention to things like really good research ethics.

133
00:10:34,497 --> 00:10:36,417
How do you treat human subjects?

134
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:39,924
How do you do a good job of managing projects?

135
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:45,860
I talked a little bit about the need for us to incorporate basics and wellness.

136
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,508
And we have a great called blueprint or

137
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:53,309
path to follow from some other sort of leading institutions that have

138
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:58,356
tried to get really specific about how do you do it in your course that will

139
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:04,140
incorporate into the core and we'll distribute to everybody.

140
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,810
But all of this work on living and walking our values.

141
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,488
Working with other offices that make the school the vibrant sort

142
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:19,440
of place that is approaching the biggest public health problems.

143
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,801
It is one of the nice things about having this moment to revise the core.

144
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:28,698
We have a chance to look at our assets and to see, okay,

145
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:33,597
how might they interact with and amplify our vision for

146
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:40,440
what the students can and will accomplish in their careers.

147
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,731
We've heard a lot lately about students not having a lot of initiative,

148
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:50,067
having it be difficult to reach students in many cases or for

149
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:54,579
instance, this sense of a greater divide between faculty and

150
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:59,940
students because of the pandemic and the way that we're teaching.

151
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,404
And I just wanted to put in a note that as we've been reaching out to students,

152
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:11,205
they've also been reaching into us, so we have a student advisory committee that

153
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:16,700
we've been working with this entire semester and they have been wonderful.

154
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,956
They've been showing up of their own accord without any incentive providing us

155
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:24,957
at a critical feedback that we needed in order to design something that they

156
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,840
would really like.

157
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,104
The other thing is that we were approached by some student groups or

158
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:38,510
student reps that were really invested in trying to make the core a better place.

159
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:44,722
So unsolicited, we got contacted from some students that were on DEI committees and

160
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,744
departments and they had just taken a class and came and

161
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:53,817
said we think that we could help to take this class on leadership and

162
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:58,103
really sort of map it onto the anti-racist principles and

163
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:01,191
practices because we already know this.

164
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:05,281
We've worked with intergroup relations on main campus.

165
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:10,228
We've done this as a part of our other work and activities and

166
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:14,981
so this is one of those cases where if somebody says we've got

167
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:19,651
a great map to the new framing it's like we don't say no.

168
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:25,469
So we've invited them to come in and to to help us sort of conceptualize how can

169
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:32,340
we transfer what was a great course into something that is actually even greater.

170
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,413
And then the last but

171
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:37,770
not least I want to just do a shout out to the Health Policy Students Association and

172
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,720
our Population and Health Sciences Online Students.

173
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,568
Their reps came and provided us a pretty thorough set

174
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:49,761
of reports based on surveys of all students.

175
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:54,833
They had about 250 students that had responded to their survey about

176
00:13:54,833 --> 00:14:00,411
the feelings of whether or not we were achieving the competencies on policy and

177
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:05,566
there are basically four competencies that are in this sort of policy and

178
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,240
advocacy space.

179
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,202
And so they did a survey, they did a report and

180
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:17,667
then they did a video both with them and an alumni pitching to us the need for

181
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:22,040
us to have real live kinda work on policies.

182
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,050
And it just was one of these moments where it's clear

183
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,810
that the students want to be their best professional selves.

184
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:36,340
We just have to find the ways to get to that interaction and meet them there.

185
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,457
So students have got a lot of initiative for this work that we are proposing and so

186
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:48,482
I think find ways for the students to come and work with you in your own courses or

187
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:54,143
if you know of students that are really wanting to affect the curriculum,

188
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,655
send them to me, I'm happy to talk with them. All right,

189
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:03,775
one of the last pieces of the vision of this core curriculum change

190
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:09,453
that I wanna put within our long view is that these team based projects and

191
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:14,574
the authentic products that the students will be creating really

192
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:20,475
could change the impact of the U-M Masters of Public Health degree.

193
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:25,519
Because this is going to be on the pressing problems of today and

194
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,467
while we might start in the first phase of work on the core doing

195
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:33,531
this all within a classroom setting.

196
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:38,286
We have the ability to work to create a relationship between

197
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:41,550
the students team projects and alumni.

198
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,840
There's already a great mentoring relationship.

199
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,687
There's no reason why we couldn't do a phase II, where we're asking for

200
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:55,968
the alumni that are working within the field to come in and review or

201
00:15:55,968 --> 00:16:00,804
to provide comments or to be mentors to some of the projects.

202
00:16:00,804 --> 00:16:04,457
And then last is that there could be an and

203
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:10,366
even third phase here where we are actually putting what we do out for

204
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:14,243
professional partnerships to be formed.

205
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:17,560
And there's a lot of different ways that different schools do this.

206
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,457
For instance, the Ross business school for

207
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:26,932
decades have had what's called a map project where different

208
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:33,440
businesses put together an application and submit it to the school.

209
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,771
The students actually review the applications and

210
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:40,440
select what business they're gonna work with.

211
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,970
This is a way in which the students actually gain that real world experience,

212
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,794
but then also on the company's, I'll call it, financial support

213
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:55,913
are able to travel, are able to do market scans,

214
00:16:55,913 --> 00:17:01,840
are able to do the real work out in the world that's necessary.

215
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,397
So this would be that Phase 3 as an example and

216
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:10,688
we don't have to follow this model, but it's being done on campus,

217
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:15,707
not only at the Ross business school, but also in Engineering and

218
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:21,845
I think in other places as well, like SEAS has some projects that are like this.

219
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:25,948
I recognize that some of you are already doing sort of small

220
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:28,460
versions of this in your classes and

221
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,922
please bear with us as we sort of get our own running shoes on and try to do this.

222
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:38,802
But please reach out to me if you feel like you've got experience that you

223
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:43,202
would like to share, we are all ears because this is a big shift for

224
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:46,562
the school and we really could use your support and

225
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:51,540
your insight into what works and what doesn't work.

226
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,027
So I just wanna round out this conversation by saying that we recognize

227
00:17:57,027 --> 00:18:01,869
that there's gonna be the need for ongoing faculty support.

228
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:06,999
When we start and I can talk to my own experience doing teaching

229
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:12,330
is one where we're really kind of questioning what do we know,

230
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,771
where is our authority, where is our credibility?

231
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,640
How are we navigating that with students?

232
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,914
How does that form into the class that we teach?

233
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:29,318
And that kind of sort of laying the groundwork of an identity as a faculty

234
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:34,091
member who is teaching in a big university like the U of M is a very

235
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:39,226
crucial developmental stage where we know that we don't currently

236
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:44,114
give enough support to faculty and we would like to change that.

237
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:48,725
It's been one of the reasons why there's been investment into

238
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:51,423
the Instructional Services team and

239
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:57,252
I would say to any of the faculty who are just beginning, they're a great resource for

240
00:18:57,252 --> 00:19:02,472
everything from your Canvas site to the way that you think about putting

241
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:08,340
together authentic assessments or a syllabus or things like that.

242
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,126
But as we sort of move from that beginning step to really now refining

243
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:17,583
how effectively we're teaching and delivering the content and

244
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,540
many of us are incredibly good at it.

245
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,651
We just gave out awards in teaching and we've got a whole

246
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:31,523
list of great teachers that have been hitting it out of the park,

247
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:35,740
but that work itself is not often enough.

248
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,946
As we are thinking about this new sort of challenge of meeting students

249
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:46,240
in a much more engaged activity, like a project based learning because

250
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,006
then we need to actually consider not just the effectiveness and

251
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:56,440
how the delivery is sort of getting students to the learning goals.

252
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,215
We now shift to the student centred learning where they are in

253
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:07,333
a sense the driving force of how we create the courses.

254
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:12,168
And that movement again, we will be supporting as we are moving

255
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:15,910
into the core and please if you're interested,

256
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:21,111
let's say in doing it in your own course, but not in the core come and

257
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:25,948
join us in the conversations. We'll be having many conversations

258
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:30,693
around how do we move to a community minded kind of teaching and

259
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:35,374
school experience, both for the faculty and the students.

260
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:40,378
Those of you that know that have gone to the student centred learning

261
00:20:40,378 --> 00:20:45,553
knows that it's a little shift in our roles and challenges that initial

262
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:50,383
stage of well in the project based learning, I'm no longer the one

263
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:55,073
who is really driving and controlling the entire environment.

264
00:20:55,073 --> 00:21:00,306
What I've set up is an environment, an ecosystem of sense that is actually

265
00:21:00,306 --> 00:21:04,877
sort of beneficially evolving towards the learning outcomes and

266
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:09,465
sort of excellence and proficiency in the learning objectives.

267
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:14,587
And there are times when we question ourselves as faculty is like,

268
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:18,611
well if I'm the expert on the side that is guiding and

269
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,192
mentoring, is it really credible teaching?

270
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:28,153
And I can tell you without a doubt it is and it actually takes a different skill

271
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:34,597
set because you have to be actually able to do all of these stages simultaneously.

272
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:40,963
I personally love it when the students are really jazzed up around their topic and

273
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:47,049
we're moving as fast as we can to get them the knowledge and the reflection and

274
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:53,132
the critical feedback they need so that they can be as excellent as they can for

275
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:59,840
the short period of time that we have them in the class.

276
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,757
I know that we've covered a lot of territory and so

277
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:08,701
I'm gonna sort of end this with a big conceptual map of how big of

278
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:14,640
an institutional impact the core curriculum revision could be.

279
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,105
So there's a way in which we can think about the continuum of teaching

280
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:25,761
from kind of the prescribed here are the lectures here are the quizzes,

281
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:32,076
here are the exams, here are the pieces that you really need to cover in order for

282
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:36,350
the competencies to be met, the test to be achieved.

283
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,818
And those prescribed kind of by the school or

284
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:44,692
by your department policies or curriculum or pedagogy is what

285
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:50,640
we've been doing because that's really been the state of the art.

286
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,152
But this 21st century sort of evolution of the knowledge economy where so much

287
00:22:56,152 --> 00:23:01,640
of what we already teach is accessible through so many different venues.

288
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,268
It means that we've got this opportunity to move to a much more

289
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:10,896
emergent property, I would say, using the complex adaptive

290
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:15,810
systems lingo where that self organization does indeed happen.

291
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,148
And it's no longer sort of single faculty and student groups and

292
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:24,970
classes, but collectives that are actually creating environments,

293
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,792
creating community where people actually know each other's names and

294
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,011
their assets and we are actually much more connected but don't have to do it as

295
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:40,845
the heavy individual lift because of the way in which it's an institutional change.

296
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:45,072
Not every individual trying to carry the whole institution.

297
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:49,582
So we are working on the ways that will hopefully

298
00:23:49,582 --> 00:23:54,428
make this a much more fun and alive space in which for

299
00:23:54,428 --> 00:23:59,726
us to teach to a new kind of outcome that is beneficial for

300
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:05,141
everybody and actually develops our attention to the big

301
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:10,267
things that we're really interested in achieving.

302
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:13,882
To that end, I wanna say one more time,

303
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:18,925
there are lots of opportunities to become involved and

304
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:23,550
please come join us whenever, wherever you can.

305
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:29,331
So, for instance this summer we're gonna be hosting probably a

306
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:34,907
biweekly sort of seminar or set of created learning community work

307
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:40,399
around what are the big questions that drive us and our fields.

308
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:42,737
It feels like a time for us to pause and

309
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:48,021
to become more reflective about what is it that we're really trying to accomplish and

310
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:51,802
how is it going and where should we be turning our energy to?

311
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:56,097
As I said before, this is an unusual historical moment for

312
00:24:56,097 --> 00:24:59,791
us to take a step back and to see where are we going?

313
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,940
Is this really where we want to go?

314
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,576
And the other thing is that in the Fall we're gonna open up again the learning

315
00:25:06,576 --> 00:25:11,141
community and anti-racist principles and practices and all are welcome and

316
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,940
we will provide the schedule for that.

317
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,020
I think we've got a lot of different material that is being

318
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,017
created both within the MOOC space by Melissa Creary and Paul Fleming and

319
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:28,180
Whitney Peoples, but then also some of the work that the current learning

320
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,034
community has been doing and finding the very helpful that we could

321
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:39,069
again, build community around this really important area of our work.

322
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:42,865
And then last but not least, I just wanna say a great big thank you.

323
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:47,626
We have been working with so many different important

324
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:52,070
stakeholders this entire sort of seven months and

325
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,665
we couldn't be in this kind of strong and

326
00:25:55,665 --> 00:26:00,031
important moment of change without your input.

327
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:05,130
And I just wanna end it with a great big thank you.
