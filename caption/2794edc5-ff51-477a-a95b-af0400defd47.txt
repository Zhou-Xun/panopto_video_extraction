1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:42,770
Originally. But it's important to remember that the.

2
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:56,680
By the end of the year, I will go to reclaim.

3
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,540
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hi.

4
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,000
How are you? There you are. Thank you.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:02:12,510
But nothing. They're all here.

6
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:29,590
Oh, no. I to Victoria.

7
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:41,090
I thought you were. I'll take your.

8
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:53,770
That's. We have taken years of keeping.

9
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:14,280
I didn't have one for recycling, but when the time came, I was.

10
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:35,000
They're the same. I think I have it.

11
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,629
I have it. Yeah. I mean, I did make a little money.

12
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,510
Okay. Thanks. Okay.

13
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah. I don't know, I. Oh, yeah, I know.

14
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:13,000
I know. I think.

15
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:42,230
Yes. Thank you very much.

16
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:05,130
All right. Are going to need someone who know.

17
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:23,670
Okay. Okay.

18
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,340
Did I miss Alexandra? No.

19
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,030
Mackenzie. Know Rebecca?

20
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Sure. You? So those of you who are on the wait list, there may be some of them.

21
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,620
And if you're on the wait list, will you come see me?

22
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:58,320
Or like during the break and I'll write your name down and I will ask Elvira, our student services coordinator, to give you permission to register.

23
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,740
If you're here today, you're pretty committed. All right.

24
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,100
And also, when you come see me, hold up.

25
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,590
We're going to do we'll figure it out for the group activity if you don't have a number.

26
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,980
Very. Everybody. It's good to see you.

27
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,549
I figured out the technology we're recording for those.

28
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,390
See, we already had one student who wasn't able to make it today due to illness.

29
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,520
So, you know, it's going to be something that we experience this semester.

30
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,819
And so I'll be recording the lectures. And that way, if you need to miss class for whatever reason you can, you can watch it.

31
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,060
But I'll see more about that in a little bit. Um.

32
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:50,800
So what I want to do today is start with just a welcome and introduction and give you a little bit of an overview of the course,

33
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,560
you know, hit the kind of highlights of the syllabus and talk about the final assignment a little bit.

34
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:05,140
Then we're going to do a small group activity. So on the back of your your name that I just gave you, will you tell me your name?

35
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,630
Yeah. And then as I should be.

36
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:21,190
I know. Okay. So on the back of your name, there's a little number, and that will be your your group number.

37
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,269
And I'll, you know, we'll figure out where to go once we break up into that.

38
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,819
But the small group activity today, we'll just be talking about some ground rules for discussion.

39
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,490
And I'll have some props for you to talk about your group. And then we'll come back together and talk about that.

40
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:45,340
And we will take a break. And then and sort of the last half of the class, we'll talk about the theory readings that you had for today.

41
00:07:46,810 --> 00:08:00,100
Any questions about that? So I thought I'd start by just telling you a little bit about me, and then I'd like to hear a little bit about you.

42
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:07,960
So I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and my parents still live in Alabama.

43
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,180
I went to college at Texas A&M University.

44
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,840
I wanted to go far away from home, and that was as far as I could get.

45
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:29,990
And while I was at A&M, I got a Bachelor of Science degree in sociology, which is a little unusual to get a Bachelor of Science in sociology.

46
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:38,530
But I was always really interested in science. And my the first major or the major that I declared when I applied was biology.

47
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,640
At the time, I thought I wanted to go to medical school. Anybody here in that same boat?

48
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,500
Yeah. It's pretty typical that people end up in public health because they at first thought they were interested in medicine and then were like,

49
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,159
Oh, well, I don't really want to be a doctor, but I'm still interested in health.

50
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,600
So anyway, so I did a Bachelor of Science, so I loved my like genetics and biology classes and all that kind of stuff.

51
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,960
But I also really loved sociology,

52
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:14,080
which I had never heard of until I decided to major in it from picking it out of a list of like seven liberal arts majors.

53
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,160
I was like, Oh, that that two sentence description sounds great.

54
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:27,760
That's what I want to do. And my parents were not super thrilled about my choice to major in sociology instead of being pre-med, as you might imagine.

55
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,910
I was a first generation college student, and so they had great hopes that I would make a lot of money,

56
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,910
but they're kind of okay with how things turned out. But it didn't look it didn't look so hot there for a minute.

57
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:46,389
But I majored in sociology. I really loved it, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do after college.

58
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,220
For a while I thought, I want to go to law school. Then I thought I wanted to go to public policy school.

59
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:57,670
I don't know if anybody has had similar experiences and not been exactly sure what they wanted to do.

60
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,250
So I thought, I'll work for a year, I'll get some experience that will help me figure out what I wanted to do.

61
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,360
So this was this was 1999.

62
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,890
This was during the middle of welfare reform.

63
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,020
So this is when time limits were first placed on temporary assistance to needy families.

64
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,120
And so I was determining eligibility for food stamps and Medicaid.

65
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:34,930
So I did that for a year. Part of my job was in a Welfare to work program, and it was a very illuminating, eye opening experience.

66
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,190
And I was like, I absolutely do not want to go to school.

67
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:49,449
We need to understand more about the causes of socio economic inequality and poverty and not just be

68
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,339
focusing on these solutions that I can see day to day were not working like they didn't make sense.

69
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,020
The things that we were asking people to do didn't make sense in the context of their lives.

70
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,250
And so I kind of did a total 180 and said, I want to get a Ph.D. in sociology,

71
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:14,070
which a year before I had told my one of my professors, I will never get a sociology, never.

72
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,350
That's the last thing I want to do. And I did it and I loved it.

73
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:24,280
So let's see what else do we want to tell you about that? So I went to grad school at UT-Austin.

74
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,830
I got my M.A. in sociology there, and I did a pre doctoral training program in demography.

75
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:40,000
And if you've ever studied demography, you will know that there's a lot of overlap between demography and epidemiology.

76
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,489
So we'll come to that in a minute. Um, let's see.

77
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,660
I forgot to mention I got married a week after I graduated from college.

78
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:57,069
I know, right? Isn't that ridiculous? But my parents got married at 18 and 19, so I was 21.

79
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,900
I thought I was like, super grown up and, you know, it worked out okay.

80
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,120
Like next year I think we'll be our 25th anniversary or something like that.

81
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:17,650
You know, it worked out okay, but you never know. And then we adopted our son right after I finished my dissertation also.

82
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:24,670
What was I thinking? Right? Like, I don't know. I make these really strange decisions, but he is a senior in high school this year.

83
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,490
So if you see me come into class and I look like I'm going to cry for no reason, that's why it's like breaking my heart.

84
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,360
He's my only child. He's my baby, and he's going to leave me.

85
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,549
Makes me sad anyway. All right, let's see.

86
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:51,100
So then after I graduated, I did a postdoc and entered, like, an interdisciplinary postdoc in population health.

87
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,110
So this was my very first. Exposure to public health. I had never heard of public health.

88
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,620
We didn't have a school of public at that time at Texas A&M or at UT Austin Main Campus.

89
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,180
There was no School of Public Health located there, so I had never been exposed to this before.

90
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,949
But as a doctoral student, I was studying sociology of health and illness.

91
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,059
So I was already working in this kind of area of either sociology,

92
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,240
of health in all those or medical sociology, but really very much the same thing as social epidemiology.

93
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,600
But I didn't I didn't know that. So I did this postdoc at UC Berkeley and UCSF,

94
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:36,280
and I had already started getting interested as a doctoral student in the biological mechanisms

95
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,260
that were underlying the types of associations that sociologists look at in terms of health.

96
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,490
And but there wasn't a lot of that happening in sociology at the time.

97
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:56,830
So when I did my postdoc and I was exposed to public health and researchers in medicine, I started doing work there on cellular aging.

98
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,110
And after my postdoc I was like, Now what do I do?

99
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,950
I like this public health stuff, but I have no training in public health.

100
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,420
What do I do? I figured, you know, I'll go on the job market and both.

101
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:17,409
I'll see what I get. So I got an offer at University of Alabama at Birmingham in their sociology department,

102
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,840
which they grant a medical sociology Ph.D. So I was like, okay, this is probably a good fit.

103
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:32,110
It has a strong kind of health component. My parents were really excited, as you can imagine, because they got to see their grandbaby on the weekends.

104
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:41,229
And so I was there for about four years. But I increasingly got frustrated with sociology because I felt like I really wanted

105
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,340
I was moving more in the direction of at least biological mechanisms and things.

106
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:53,469
And at the time I do think it's different sociology now, but at the time that was just considered really fringe in sociology.

107
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,930
So that's the thesis student in sociology later.

108
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,470
Yeah, it is. Right. And there are more people doing it, but it's still a little bit marginalized.

109
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:11,950
And so I saw this position open up at University of Michigan in social epidemiology, and I was like, I'm going to go for it.

110
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,160
And I'm like, I have no chance of getting this job, none at all. And somehow I did.

111
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:27,999
So I got this job. I came here, I was research faculty, which if you don't know, research faculty positions here are soft money,

112
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,020
which means you have to pay your entire salary through grants, which is really scary.

113
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:39,610
But I was like, I'm just going to try it. And and so I came and I was like, Oh, this is really, really scary.

114
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,540
I don't know if I like this.

115
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:50,410
And then the person that I came to work with left after a year and a half to become dean of the School of Public Health at another university.

116
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,660
And I was like, Oh, no, really, what have I done?

117
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,630
And then a tenure track position opened up in this department and I was like, Okay, I'm going to apply for it.

118
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,350
And by some miracle I got it right.

119
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,740
And so that was then I came here in 2012 and looked into the tenure track position in 2014.

120
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:14,560
I got promoted in 2019 and then I became department chair last year.

121
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,660
So yes, this like bizarre career trajectory.

122
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,139
Anyway, I tell you this, because usually people are like, you're a sociologist.

123
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:31,640
How did you end up here? That's how I ended up here. And I also tell you this to say that who knows what you will end up doing?

124
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,280
You don't have to know. You can think you know. And it probably won't be what actually happens.

125
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,340
Because I've always had five year plans, ten year plans.

126
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:47,780
Being chair of an epidemiology department was literally never in any of my plans, but that's what I'm doing now and I like it.

127
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,470
So anyway, just, you know, kind of follow you in your interests.

128
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,360
You'll find something interesting, hopefully. Okay.

129
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:05,090
So I did want to say one thing about that. So as a department chair, I am what's called an IRA, which is an individual with reporting obligations.

130
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,209
So this means that I have to report any and all details of sexual misconduct to the equity,

131
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:18,170
civil rights and Title nine office within 48 hours, regardless of the context in which I learned the information.

132
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,140
So this can include anything that comes up in class.

133
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,230
So a lot of times classroom discussions are exempt from this, but when you're a department chair, they're not.

134
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:33,139
So for me, if I'm out at Target and I hear somebody say something about something that happened at U of M,

135
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,860
I have to report it, even though I'm not there in a work related capacity.

136
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,450
So they basically consider me 24 hours a day. I have to report anything that I hear, even if I just overheard it.

137
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,940
So I want you to know that I don't say that to make you not share something.

138
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,690
I actually think that this is a good thing, and I've learned more about the process of the Title nine office.

139
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:04,639
And so if I hear something and I report it, they will contact you.

140
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,310
And depending on the circumstances, they won't pursue anything unless you want you want to pursue it.

141
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,330
But I'm telling you this, because sometimes people really freak out.

142
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,889
If there's a Title nine report and they think that they're in trouble or, you know,

143
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,420
it's going to create problems for them in their in their graduate program.

144
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,940
But really, it's it's a good thing for us to be reporting these kinds of incidents.

145
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,129
So there's one put that out there in terms of my research.

146
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,650
So my kind of broad areas are health disparities, bias, social interactions and aging of the life course.

147
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:47,720
And so I have three main projects that I'm working on right now that are all sort of related to racial and ethnic disparities.

148
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:55,969
So I have one project that's using stored bio bio specimens from enhance the

149
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,740
National Health and Nutrition Examination Study to measure DNA methylation.

150
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:06,770
And so we're using that to try to understand racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular mortality.

151
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:12,799
So that's one project which has been horribly delayed by the pandemic, as you can imagine.

152
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:20,030
And Haynes is a CDC funded study, and they've been a little bit busy with other things in the past couple of years,

153
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,450
and our project is kind of a low priority for them, but it's starting to develop.

154
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:35,540
I have another project that is focused on vicarious structural racism and the impacts that that has on birth outcomes or maternal and child health.

155
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,910
And so we're looking at that through the lens of the Flint water crisis as mixed methods study.

156
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:50,569
And then a new project that I'm working on is using a structural racism related law

157
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:57,260
database and looking at that in relation to cardiovascular health in the purpose study.

158
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:04,849
And so I encourage you the first, the first epidemiology seminar series of the year.

159
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,920
I think it's in late September.

160
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:14,540
Tina Brown is going to be coming to give that talk, and she's the one who developed this board index, which is really cool.

161
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:22,250
And so she'll be talking about that and some of her work that's also related to like legal epidemiology and intersectionality.

162
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,680
So please come to that. I think it's going to be a really cool talk. All right.

163
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,060
And then office hours are Fridays from 1 to 2.

164
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,780
There's a link in the syllabus to sign up using Calvin Lee.

165
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,310
And you can specify in there whether you want to do it on Zoom or in-person.

166
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,509
And then if that those times don't work for you and you want to meet, we can make an appointment to you outside of that.

167
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,510
Just let's see.

168
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,219
I use she her pronouns. You can call me but Linda, Dr. Nina and Professor Nina.

169
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,230
Whenever you feel comfortable. I don't really have a preference.

170
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,780
Okay. That was a lot of information.

171
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,000
Any questions or anything before we hear about you?

172
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,300
All right. Okay. So I'd like to do introductions for the class.

173
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,490
So if you want to just tell us your name. And if you want to share your gender pronouns.

174
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:29,000
Your department and program where you consider how and why you're taking this class and what you hope to get out of it.

175
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,150
And then if you had an extra hour of free time every day, how would you spend that?

176
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:45,420
I know it's impossible to even imagine, but I was thinking this morning, I was like, What would my answer be?

177
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:52,490
And then I was like, Well, what if I saved every hour for the year and I could take an extra?

178
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,940
You could make me sane. But I think that's an illegitimate response, so.

179
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:03,290
All right, Lauren, you want to start? I'm Lauren. I've seen her from my apartment.

180
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:20,550
I consider. And I'm taking this class because I was also very interested in social.

181
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:33,150
And if I have an extra hour, I would probably say no.

182
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:39,910
My name. So I'll let you see her friends. I'm a master's student helping her health education.

183
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,060
I'm from very rural Michigan.

184
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:51,670
And I'm taking this class because it aligns with my interest in how social behavior and structure affects health outcomes,

185
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,800
especially related to factors like stigma.

186
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:01,930
If I had our free time, I'd love to say I'd like a clean or life like academic journal, but I would say Animal Crossing.

187
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,229
Yes, I like the honesty. Olivia, everyone.

188
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,209
And Olivia, I use your pronouns.

189
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm a post-doc fellow in the Environmental Toxicology and Epidemiology Program, so I'm actually housed in nutritional sciences.

190
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,350
But I don't do environmental health like it's I'm all over the place, so I, I consider home.

191
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,409
I'm from Flint, Michigan, but I've not lived there in like eight years.

192
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,559
But I'm back in Michigan now. I just came here from Philadelphia.

193
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,300
So back in Michigan, which is great. I'm taking the class.

194
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,400
I'm really interested in social epidemiology in general.

195
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,460
I think like you, I didn't know it was a thing until a few years ago.

196
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,280
All my previous training has been in nursing actually,

197
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,990
so I worked as a neonatal nurse for a little bit and then get a Ph.D. in nursing with an environmental health focus.

198
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:53,320
So now I'm doing all these epigenetic epidemiology type things, and I want to get deeper into that public health realm.

199
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,910
So that is why I'm here. If I had an extra hour, I would probably walk.

200
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,370
I really like walking. I think the best when I walk and I usually solve all my problems when I walk.

201
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,810
So that seems like a good use of my time. Even in the winter. Even in the winter.

202
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm from Michigan, I think. Oh, that's right. Yeah, I remember.

203
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm from Alabama. Exactly. Sure. Weather completely bizarre to me.

204
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,309
I don't understand it. Oh, my name Adam. I pronounce.

205
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,120
Ah, he and his.

206
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:27,820
I'm a second year student in the Department of Sociology and then also a first year computational biology master's student in this department.

207
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,830
Home for me is Iowa, from a small town called Mount Vernon in Iowa.

208
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,780
So if anybody knows what that is, school is very liberal arts, very fair called Cornell, Iowa.

209
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,830
Yeah. Yeah. Remember, I was seniors. Oh, okay.

210
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,780
Yeah, I know. All the little Midwestern towns with a liberal arts college look recommended skew.

211
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:58,990
So I think in this class, I. I think so I study the sociology of health disparities specifically, like how people make social sense of them.

212
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,610
I'm especially interested in how ideas about morality intersect with the public health field,

213
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,969
but to understand that, you have to understand epidemiology, which is why I'm taking the Master's.

214
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:16,420
And also at this course, if I had an extra hour of free time, I think I would draw comics, something that I like doing.

215
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,240
But most days I don't. Yeah, I can imagine.

216
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:31,060
Yeah, I think today's readings will probably speak to some of the moral code I use.

217
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,110
And actually president, this is.

218
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,960
Yeah. Yeah. So maybe here and I'll there.

219
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:58,680
Oh. Social.

220
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:15,890
I hope that. I have an MBA.

221
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,310
What do you like? Your, you know, the. Oh, yeah.

222
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,460
Nonfiction. Everyone.

223
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm Christian. I go by. Nothing. I'd say I'd consider home if I called about a year.

224
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:44,700
I think in this class because I'm mainly interested in like the social aspects of how people like off of the laws as like social.

225
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,770
And then if I had an extra day, I'd probably work out, you know, if it was probably 4 hours sleep alone.

226
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,830
Yes. Many of us have that decision to make friends.

227
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:06,960
Hi, my name is Frances. Someone who lived recently.

228
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,120
So I am house and. As a physical, social work.

229
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,640
I'm doing this research practice over there. I live in a house.

230
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:28,089
I was born in New Orleans, so I do about. I did lose in Texas when I was younger.

231
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,900
So I know where is in Texas. Yeah.

232
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:43,610
That's really cool. Um, yeah, I went to the most, like, conservative undergraduate institution in the world, and I was a sociology major.

233
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,010
It was very unique there. We were a small group.

234
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,810
Yeah, the campus is beautiful, so it's really cool.

235
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:00,480
Um, what a lot of seems like there's nothing on.

236
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:12,220
You know, finding and, you know, analyzing health disparities, you know, what exists in the economy, how to understand where they are.

237
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:21,360
And then number. For traveling.

238
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:32,650
You want to save yourself, too? Yes. Victoria and.

239
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,800
Also. I have something for you.

240
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,020
Yes, I can't. My second home.

241
00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:08,720
I have no doubt. I'll take. I mean, I have.

242
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:25,090
Peter. I'm sitting here in the studio.

243
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,180
I don't want how that's wrong. You want to give somebody else here now?

244
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,210
You know, I'm sure somebody would take it. Yeah.

245
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,560
My name is the chin chin. Yeah, but actually, I go by the bathroom there.

246
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,600
Okay. Okay. I know my spouse.

247
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,750
You heard her. And I'm also a second year Army student.

248
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:14,680
I'm also from China. I'm actually from Japan. I'm thinking this, but actually, I know nothing about the show at all.

249
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,730
I'm so surprised to learn how important it is. So I got this class.

250
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,710
It's like a start for me. Yeah. Oh, an extra hour.

251
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:28,659
Oh, actually, right now, I would like an extra hour to video games.

252
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,980
I just got back. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of this waiting for me.

253
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:42,150
Hi. My name is Josh also. You know, she her pronouns and I'm sexy on page 38.

254
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:50,770
And I also came from China and I came to find out about my yoga and my hometown is actually

255
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:57,009
the most awesome western part of China and the weather there is really similar to here.

256
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,660
So a long time. So I kind of like an hour here.

257
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,899
So and and the reason why I'm taking this class is because I'm pretty interesting.

258
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:18,790
So I'm class and I also, you know, all the sort of certificate and I would love to learn more about how the social factors affect the House.

259
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,430
And if I had an extra hour, I may be I love cooking in my free time,

260
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:36,130
so maybe exploring more recipes and all or go outside and have a more healthy, but also a variation of yeah, that's my plan for retirement.

261
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:47,020
Oh, I'm going to I'm going to like cook complicated recipes because that's something that I never, ever, ever do.

262
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,410
And so that's my plan. It'll probably last a week, but I'm.

263
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,170
Is their area.

264
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:17,890
For now, I am. Interesting disparities and how.

265
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,480
Perhaps that was in fact experiments. And then also how those social factors drive biological.

266
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:42,550
If I had an extra hour every day, I would probably also accept that I would be able to do in the hours in the winter time by use reading.

267
00:32:53,570 --> 00:33:01,180
Their home city of Chicago. I don't want to do this right now.

268
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:06,630
So I take this class, but I really want to work. So that's why.

269
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:16,710
Every time I. I think you let everyone know.

270
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,630
And then. I consider.

271
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,460
Um. And if I had to watch this stuff.

272
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,690
Oh. And.

273
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,550
And you to be. The.

274
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,660
We're all born and raised here.

275
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,950
And I'm taking this class because. Undergrad.

276
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,710
And if I were to take the next two or three time, either experiment with my cooking or.

277
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:34,780
Here. Yeah.

278
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,780
This room is a little challenging to see on here.

279
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:45,250
I considering how I was raised until I was about.

280
00:34:49,890 --> 00:35:04,660
I'm taking this class. As for our.

281
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:27,900
Really? Everyone I know well, I saw the whole time.

282
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:39,519
It's very tricky to infringe upon it, but i, i, i, i, i requested that home as well as the U.S. but I've lived in Massachusetts.

283
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,840
That's why I mentioned that I lived in California for a few places.

284
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:50,140
They didn't know this one is not true. Yeah, I'm tired of this when I read the books.

285
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:58,220
So yeah, if I had to move and I wasn't right. I mean, because the Bay Area is so expensive, they don't just love to, um, I,

286
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:08,510
I think it was interesting topic and racial and ethnic disparities, so I was to learn a little bit more about that.

287
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,940
I've taken a number of classes like. And I enjoyed that.

288
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:22,690
So I wanted to take a little bit more. Yeah, because I want to see more places like that area, so I'm in extra time.

289
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:31,450
That's not such a huge fan. I love what you do so much, but I guess in the winter I know I actually did that with you,

290
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:41,110
but I was also I was an air fryer, so I would experiment with an air fryer.

291
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,459
Oh yeah. I like that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,770
I would recommend everyone to everyone and yeah.

293
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,110
So yeah, I would experiment but never cooked fresh green paper better.

294
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,100
It's the most awesome thing in the world or different opinions in an airplane.

295
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,600
They're like, I'll try that, I'll do that.

296
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:14,079
I have nothing to. And he's been very clear that if you want to get products cheaper, I think I know something here.

297
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:19,540
I'm interested in it in general, you know. Do you? I visit her home to Colorado.

298
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,910
And then in terms of why I'm taking this class, I run things that really,

299
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:31,720
for me in the public health was just kind of understanding and learning about how social factors influence an individual's ability to be healthier,

300
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,459
as well as like some of the health inequities aspects that people have as well.

301
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:44,200
So I'm excited about like thank you for having the topic area. And then if I had an extra hour of free time every day, I love being outside,

302
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,740
so I'm probably spending outdoors doing something like therapy or environmental working.

303
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,950
Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm in my second year.

304
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,920
And all of you students in the. I was 43.

305
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,490
Fill in the stuff you.

306
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:17,970
No. And if I were, I would.

307
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,510
Yeah. That's something. I don't have any orphanages.

308
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,760
Right. Second year masters.

309
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,990
I consider home a suburb on that side of the state.

310
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:50,900
I find that social. And I hope you get that.

311
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,390
I hope you get that out of the court system that if you have not done much.

312
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:10,430
Yeah, that's right. It would not be a waste of time and talent either.

313
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,620
Amazing. Sarah. Sarah.

314
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,270
Connell's favorite words in the.

315
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:24,380
Oh, I suppose I'm unfortunately accustomed to the winter,

316
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:33,229
but I recently came back California for a few years and I'm like, Oh yeah, I mean, it's 90 degrees today.

317
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:43,940
So I yeah, hold on to that. And I wasn't even.

318
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,260
I mean, what is it? That's what I keep up with. Sarah, were you for me?

319
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,899
I was. Oh, yeah. And so many different factors.

320
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:01,670
And I really want to bring in the socialite, read one of the articles I was obsessed with.

321
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,340
Like the history the. Where recently.

322
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,780
Yeah. I love the guy, right?

323
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,280
I really love plants. Yeah.

324
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:22,139
And I find that like working with my hands just really relaxed and I don't have time right now.

325
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:28,770
So yes, I, I went a little crazy with the plants during the pandemic as well.

326
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,050
My house is a little bit of a jungle. Yeah, my husband's like, really?

327
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:41,400
How many? How many more? But now I don't know what to do with them because they're all they've gotten so big.

328
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,290
And I'm like, but I. I bought that pie, right?

329
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:50,670
For like, I don't know, I mean, I don't know what to do. Do you? Do you, yeah.

330
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,270
What do you do? Do you buy a bigger pie? But then do they just take over your. I don't know.

331
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:02,760
Erica. Oh, my goodness. I think.

332
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,190
Um. I was born and raised in Ghana. Then I home.

333
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:17,310
Um, I was also a major undergrad, and I decided to.

334
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:24,570
Didn't, but that in my senior year I had not.

335
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:32,580
Yeah, I flew in and stuff, so that got me interested.

336
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:39,330
And then I'm wondering, okay, so one, I'm here to, you know,

337
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:46,290
like you what is all about and you know, but I'm also hoping that I get a lot of food because my.

338
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,580
Um, if I had one, I were attracted to it.

339
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:58,590
And also I knew that I would not do that.

340
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,670
I would probably just watch. What's your favorite show?

341
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,700
Or is it too embarrassing to say out loud for me to see come back.

342
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,860
I love K-Dramas a lot. So having been watching it.

343
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,160
Yeah. I was obsessed with Days of Our Lives when I was in grad school, so.

344
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,290
Yeah. My name is Gary.

345
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,000
And in the and.

346
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,050
I think this case because. I don't.

347
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:57,970
I wish my son would say that he did not think that it was a video game.

348
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:04,830
Absolutely. And.

349
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,900
I've. Yeah.

350
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:51,170
I mean. I also.

351
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,829
Wondering where you are. Hi.

352
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:26,140
My name is Andre. For me is.

353
00:44:32,040 --> 00:45:03,830
I'm really. The second year.

354
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:19,650
Probably consider. For some reason, I'm taking this course.

355
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:31,170
I was very close to. Sociology.

356
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,940
I saw. So it's pretty.

357
00:45:50,990 --> 00:46:08,770
Extra coverage day. But if I had it to do over again, I would get it for.

358
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,580
And I was very I lost my uncle very fast in college.

359
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:22,750
I totally do that. But I think that there's maybe two jobs for that.

360
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,060
So. Yeah.

361
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:32,290
You've got to do it. That's.

362
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:42,230
That's pretty. You have to do it in your free time unless you're, you know, independently wealthy and then you.

363
00:46:52,620 --> 00:47:10,600
Yeah. Yeah. It's funny, because you don't. I've always been.

364
00:47:51,470 --> 00:48:07,840
Sleeping or eating or reading. I was an hour and a second here in.

365
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:18,370
MATTHEWS John and I you know, by the way, I'm taking this class because I.

366
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:23,150
I don't know if I would say this. My current research.

367
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,500
I feel like that as a lot of social media back.

368
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,050
And if I had an extra hour time every day, I would probably be.

369
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,790
I love hearing I love hearing where people are from.

370
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:54,470
And I love hearing what you would all do with an extra hour a day.

371
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:58,630
I mean, I do remember back in the pandemic being like when we were in lockdown, you know,

372
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:04,760
not that there's not a pandemic anymore, but when we were in lockdown, I was like, there's so many hours in the day.

373
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,719
I was like, I can come back, I can exercise like I was teaching.

374
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,170
And there were all these exercise classes online.

375
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:20,110
I just like moved everything online. And so I was like, I can exercise every day, but then I kind of overdid it.

376
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:26,710
I had to kind of be like, okay, maybe six days a week of exercise is not the best.

377
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,259
But yeah, maybe that's probably what I would do if I had an extra hour.

378
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:39,160
I would probably take like a yoga class every morning. Wouldn't that be amazing to just start your day that way?

379
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,570
But that's not how my days start anymore. All right.

380
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,650
So now I want to talk a little bit about the class.

381
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:52,779
So just first of all, some COVID stuff and masking stuff.

382
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,740
So as you know, masks are not required in classrooms anymore.

383
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,480
I will be wearing one when the risk level in Washtenaw County is high.

384
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:06,940
So it was high and then this morning it was medium. So I was like, all right.

385
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,920
I also just, you know, had COVID four weeks ago. So I'm not particularly at risk at the moment.

386
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:21,450
Um, I mentioned this earlier, you know, people will get sick throughout the term.

387
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,030
It's just kind of inevitable with the amount of COVID that's still circulating.

388
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,680
I've also heard from my flu colleagues that it's likely to be a challenging year.

389
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,579
We'll hope that she's wrong, but I'm going to be recording lectures.

390
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,810
And so if you do need to miss class because of illness or whatever, you'll be able to see them.

391
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:45,090
Obviously it's not the same as being in class, but you can at least kind of keep up with the information a little bit.

392
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:54,969
And um, so I want to go over the syllabus a little bit, um, just hit some highlights of that.

393
00:50:54,970 --> 00:51:03,600
I'm not going to ruin the whole thing to you. Um, so my office is up on the fourth floor in the epidemiology suite.

394
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:07,300
I think I already mentioned that office hours are Fridays from 1 to 2.

395
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,350
In the syllabus, there's a link that you can use to sign up for an appointment there.

396
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:16,779
15 minute blocks. And if you want more than one, just sign up twice.

397
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,439
That's fine and that's free.

398
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:26,680
So the textbook is the Berkman Koce and Glenmore Social Epidemiology text.

399
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,819
We'll read a number of chapters from that. I am not sure has anybody to look to see if you can get it online.

400
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,920
If there's not, is there an electronic version through the library? Okay, so you don't have to buy it.

401
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:44,809
You can get it through the library and electronic version. Um, all of the other readings are on the campus.

402
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,340
They just about everything that you need for the class is on the campus site.

403
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,659
Um, so in terms of, of this course,

404
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,750
the purpose is really just to provide an introduction to current theoretical

405
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:00,489
and methodological and empirical work in the field of social epidemiology.

406
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:05,649
So it is intended to be an introductory course. And several of you mentioned, do you have no background in this area?

407
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:14,139
That's completely fine. It's meant to be introductory. Um, some of the readings may feel challenging if you have not studied social science before,

408
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:21,100
but just do your best and then we're going to talk about them in class. So we're going to cover four main areas.

409
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,790
We're going to start with theoretical frameworks. We're going to do that this week and next week.

410
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:31,900
Then we're going to spend a week talking about nothing. You know, it's not going to be a through the methods discussion,

411
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:38,229
but I'm going to talk about particular aspects of methods that that are important for understanding

412
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,980
social epidemiology and the papers that we're going to read over the course of the year.

413
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:47,409
Then we'll focus on empirical research, on social status and health.

414
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:53,500
We'll do that for four weeks, and then we'll do empirical research on social context and health,

415
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,469
and that will be another form in terms of, of course requirements.

416
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:07,480
You know, the first is class participation. So, you know, you won't get very much out of this class if you if you don't come,

417
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,800
because so much of this class is about the discussions that we have as a group.

418
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,010
And hearing from your classmates.

419
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:21,490
I mean, you know, even when the readings the readings change a little bit from year to year, some years I do bigger changes.

420
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,919
But even when the readings are basically the same,

421
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,379
the class is different every year because of who's here and how people are understanding the readings and contributing.

422
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,300
So I strongly encourage you to come to class whenever you are able.

423
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,920
So classes will generally have a didactic presentation at the beginning.

424
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,129
So I'll do kind of a lecture, but it's lecture. A discussion in the beginning.

425
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:54,940
Then we'll take a break and then you'll you'll be in small groups to discuss a research article with some questions about that.

426
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:01,860
Then we'll come back together and talk about that in a large group. Class participation is part of the final grade.

427
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:09,000
I will you know, during COVID, everything was just sort of like, whatever, we'll just figure it out.

428
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:18,570
But I want to try to return a little bit more to typical classroom expectations now, so I will be keeping track of attendance.

429
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:24,750
If you need to miss class, just let me know as soon as you know by email preferably.

430
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:30,600
And that's perfectly fine. I just would like for you to let me know if you're going to miss Class.

431
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:37,620
That's the weekly discussion.

432
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:48,599
So for almost all of the weeks and you'll see it in here under each of the pieces with the readings you will be asked to do,

433
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,010
like a discussion board post and a response to somebody else's post.

434
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,290
And so what I'm asking is that you post a comment or question based on their readings by noon on Wednesday each week.

435
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:10,529
So your first one will be due next Wednesday by noon, and then come back by the next day at noon and submit a response to somebody else's post.

436
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:20,370
And then I read through those and it helps me kind of prepare for our discussion that the Post can be about any of the week's assigned readings,

437
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:26,880
not just the discussion paper. So whatever those readings kind of made you think about, you can have something about that.

438
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,450
The final project is sort of like a mini grant proposal,

439
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:41,999
so the ideas that you'll come up with a hypothetical research project to investigate some kind of question related to social epidemiology.

440
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,610
So as we were talking before, you know, you guys have a broad range of interests, right?

441
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:51,809
And we won't necessarily cover each of those things in the class.

442
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:58,230
Like, I don't have anything specifically on firearm violence in the class, although a lot of the readings will relate, right?

443
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:05,100
And you can use it. And so that might be a nice way for you to explore that topic further through the final assignment.

444
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:10,860
So whatever your particular interest is, you can use this final assignment to explore that some more.

445
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:20,160
There's a link to the guidelines and the grading rubric that you can access from from the syllabus.

446
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,990
I encourage you to take a look at that. Just read through it so you have a sense of what's coming up.

447
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:32,549
I try to have assignments kind of spread throughout the semester so that it's not like all of a sudden, two weeks before the end of class,

448
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:37,680
you start working on it so you'll you'll have ways to kind of gradually work on it throughout the semester.

449
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:43,710
I use peer review for that, so you'll get written feedback on two drafts.

450
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:52,230
You'll have the first kind of a draft in the first half of the proposal and the full draft, you'll provide feedback to another student.

451
00:56:52,890 --> 00:57:00,270
I will sign the reviewers and I just want to make sure you know that peer reviewers are not assigning grades, they're just getting feedback.

452
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,249
I'm assigning the grade to the final project,

453
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:09,300
but the peer reviewers are giving you sort of input and then they'll be presentations in the last couple of weeks of class.

454
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,399
So I might have to adjust the time a little bit, depending on the final size of the class,

455
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,580
but it should be about 10 minutes and there is a link here where you can sign up for the date.

456
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,940
So if you know you want to go the first week, go ahead and sign up.

457
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:30,000
Or if you know you want to go the last week, go ahead and sign up late assignments.

458
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,420
So only turn in a late assignment please.

459
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,380
If you have some, there's a university approved reason like you've been sick or there was a religious holiday or one of those things.

460
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:49,589
If what if there is sort of a legitimate reason why you need extra time, just email me or come to office hours to discuss.

461
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,479
You know, I'm happy to be flexible,

462
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,830
but I want to move away from the like no deadlines thing because I think it was starting to stress people out actually,

463
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,900
even though we intended it to be something to make life easier,

464
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:06,600
I think a lot of people got behind in their work and there were a lot of incomplete somethings.

465
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,559
So if you can stay on track, I think it's it's better.

466
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,570
Ultimately, we will begin class at 930.

467
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,769
I may struggle with the computer for a few weeks,

468
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:28,829
but we will eventually get there and then we'll take a ten minute break after the lecture period and we end at 1221,

469
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:34,860
see if you have accommodations, please let me know and we can talk about that.

470
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:39,960
We don't have there's no timed exams or quizzes or anything like that in the in this class.

471
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,900
But I'm happy to talk about what it is that you.

472
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,490
Accessible in the class. Um.

473
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:52,100
So then in the syllabus there's of course, topics, reading list, assignments, kind of section.

474
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:55,890
And so you can use that to figure out what you need to do for the next week.

475
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:59,800
Um, so the due dates for the assignments are in canvas.

476
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,180
So if you use that for your calendar, it will tell you when the due dates are.

477
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:07,710
I just ask that you complete the readings for that week before class.

478
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:13,440
Um, lecture notes and Panopto recordings will be posted on canvas after class,

479
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:21,209
so I don't want to share my slides in the beginning because a lot of it has props or questions for discussion.

480
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:25,500
And so I want it to be sort of a live experience. I also think it's helpful to take notes.

481
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,020
You know, there's not going to be exams,

482
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:34,770
but it always helps me to learn personally when I'm sort of writing things down as I'm listening and participating.

483
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,430
But the notes, the sites will be available to you after class.

484
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,210
I think that's it for this. For any questions about the syllabus.

485
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,800
Have you all been able to look at the campus?

486
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:56,830
I know some of you aren't registered yet, but those of you who have been able to look at the campus site.

487
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,300
Any questions about it? I'll just I'll show it really quickly.

488
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,980
So this is student view so you can find this.

489
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:16,710
Here's the there's a link to the syllabus on the very first page and then pretty much everything is under modules.

490
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:20,549
So if you go to modules, it will walk you through.

491
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:28,590
You'll see all the readings, you'll see the slides once they're available, if that makes sense.

492
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:35,970
Okay. I know we drive you guys crazy with all of our different campus things.

493
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,940
Few years ago, they tried to make us all do them exactly the same, and it was kind of an epic fail.

494
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:54,090
The faculty couldn't figure out how to do it. All right, so now I want us to break up into groups and sort of do this activity.

495
01:00:54,090 --> 01:01:02,309
So on the back of your name, you have a group number once once we break into groups,

496
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:06,990
what I want you to do is just think about the best group discussions that you've been a part of,

497
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:16,170
like really good group discussions and reflect on why those were satisfying discussions, like what made them good and then think about the worst ones.

498
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:21,750
And what about those made made it really unsatisfying.

499
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:26,010
And then if you can suggest three things that our class could do to promote satisfying

500
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:31,380
discussions and three things that we could do to prevent unsatisfying discussions,

501
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,850
then we'll talk about that,

502
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:41,190
and then I will use that to create a set of sort of guidelines or ground rules for our class that will follow for the rest of the semester.

503
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:46,050
So there is a Google doc that you can all access from canvas.

504
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:55,020
And what I've done is I pasted the instructions in there here, I'll show you where it is in canvas and pasted the or here.

505
01:01:55,290 --> 01:02:01,250
So discussion ground rules when you click on that. The Nigerian.

506
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,870
There's supposed to be a Google doc there. It might be because I'm a student here.

507
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:12,360
Student Can somebody else try to click on it in theirs and see if it works?

508
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:20,219
Okay. Well, why it doesn't work for me, I don't know. But it's there and there's a page for each group.

509
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:27,690
So you'll just scroll down to find your group. If you're group three, it'll be, you know, lower in the document and just enter your responses there.

510
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,840
And so I'm going to put out a group ten.

511
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:39,020
So if group one can meet here ish.

512
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:46,290
Um, group two over here.

513
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,930
Yeah. Every year around.

514
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:09,870
For this year. I don't get that.

515
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,610
That's right. Yeah.

516
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,730
If you don't have a group, just come up to the front and I'll figure it out.

517
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,399
And then I don't think about running.

518
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,580
So take your money. Take your urban, move wherever there's space.

519
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:40,470
Cause I didn't throw that out very commonly. Let me go through all this.

520
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:05,480
Oh, you are there one?

521
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,900
I don't know. Oh, yes, I do.

522
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:23,060
If you're here, if you don't have it, you can either just find one or you can come down here and I can tell you which one to go to try to get.

523
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:46,440
TV, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,690
And if groups like this, it's really open back there.

525
01:04:51,740 --> 01:05:12,220
If you guys want to go back there and it's open back there. If anybody's crowded, you guys are to see your baby in a minute.

526
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:19,340
Will you go back there? It might be tricky.

527
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:23,230
You know, I here, but I will let you decide.

528
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:28,660
Well, not my crew. Okay. This is for you.

529
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:39,550
Okay, you're here. But if you guys.

530
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,280
If you want to go to the back, you might even fully hear each other about her.

531
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:53,920
Yeah. None of our costumes are set up very well.

532
01:05:54,060 --> 01:06:02,260
Here is a group discussion. And.

533
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:46,510
So. Yeah, you know.

534
01:06:54,540 --> 01:07:03,970
Yeah. I know that you can say what you're thinking.

535
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:20,110
So something that I'm not going to do that.

536
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:26,180
But I feel that your knowledge of the.

537
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:42,810
But know. We have a.

538
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:56,770
Another great question.

539
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:05,700
Like, was just like, you know.

540
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:18,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

541
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:37,240
Oh, my God. And I just have to say question actually.

542
01:08:37,270 --> 01:09:13,650
Yeah. I really feel like I've been thinking about my father.

543
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:32,640
But also it's not that I I'm from something else.

544
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,420
I think, you know, in the stuff that I was.

545
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:53,990
I guess what I really like because. So I thought that was like to come.

546
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:14,020
In a certain area. Right, right, right, right, right.

547
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:33,070
And I wanted that to get people I mean.

548
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:39,910
Yes. Oh, yeah.

549
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:45,730
You know, you just sit there, you know?

550
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:56,480
Yeah. You know.

551
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:13,310
I'm sure that. Yeah. Yeah.

552
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:18,880
Yeah. I.

553
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:39,590
Yeah. Was still. So you.

554
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:49,800
I was like, Yeah, yeah.

555
01:11:54,770 --> 01:12:06,230
I really indifferent. Oh, yeah.

556
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:11,830
Oh, right. Like when I was like, okay, I'm just going to happen.

557
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,640
You have the question, is this one really bad?

558
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:40,150
It's just really. Like people would say that I didn't have the exact I was like.

559
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:50,200
Yeah. I think we have yet.

560
01:12:55,300 --> 01:13:15,500
So. Yeah.

561
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:32,950
Yeah. It's about the suspension for classroom discussion, the discussion board, that's appropriate, too.

562
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:37,630
But there's something specific that you want to mention that's related to discussion boards.

563
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:53,790
Yeah. Think that's good? But there was a question over here about whether this applies to classroom discussions or the discussion board posts.

564
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,510
And I would say both. Right.

565
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:02,460
So if you if there's something specific that you think applies to one or the other, go ahead and include that in there, too.

566
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,300
No pressure. The question. You don't have to.

567
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:47,940
Yeah, I was actually. I don't know what's going to happen.

568
01:14:47,970 --> 01:15:00,870
You know, like if they both say, I don't think or maybe you are, I don't know.

569
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:05,180
Yeah, I'm trying to help. But, you know, I was thinking.

570
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:20,310
I. Ever since they got together.

571
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:49,570
Then I would just play that game that there would be probably like, you know, as I understand it, you know, we there's more than two years.

572
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:22,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

573
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:48,850
I feel powerful and I hope you know you're gonna get so it's not like I.

574
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:21,780
I thought I hurt. I feel like probably the first time I've been out there on.

575
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:36,400
And then use that if you haven't got everything right.

576
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:50,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

577
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:58,700
I just.

578
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:10,170
I just love it.

579
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:17,130
I love it.

580
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,810
I love it. All right.

581
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,510
Is anybody still working? Okay, we're ready to start.

582
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:37,650
Okay. All right. I don't want to interrupt your conversations, but so let's see what we came up with.

583
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:41,820
Group one. Do you guys want to go first one?

584
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,470
Such one is great one for you guys. Okay.

585
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:59,630
So what did you come up with in terms of three things that our class could do to promote satisfying discussion so we can five ways you can do five.

586
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:06,479
Our first one was prepared to class. Okay. Do you guys want me to repeat this?

587
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:12,270
Is that hard to hear or can you hear? You can't hear or you can hear.

588
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:18,509
Okay. I don't speak louder. Okay. No, it's fine. My is hard for me to tell up here because the room is like so wide.

589
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:21,809
I don't know how well it spreads going that way, but.

590
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:24,719
Okay, so, so I prepared for track of time.

591
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:32,180
So everyone has the opportunity to speak, engage with people meaningfully, even if you don't necessarily know an answer to a question.

592
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:36,420
Tracking it for, you know, for emphasized clarity.

593
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:40,910
And the last one is people make mistakes, give others space to learn and grow.

594
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:48,710
And three things that we can do to prevent unsatisfying.

595
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:59,910
I don't the three things that have been done to be over others.

596
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:13,450
Non-judgmental environment. Topics give people the benefit of the doubt, but also fails to them.

597
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,280
And then, yes, speak cross.

598
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,950
Speak for me. Not for me. So don't. What, more than 2000?

599
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:34,580
Just don't try to talk further. Right? Yeah, absolutely.

600
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:44,120
You mean discussions over Zoom weren't satisfied? You didn't about how, like, a lot of, like, with just not talk.

601
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:51,380
Yeah. So. Oh, yeah. My son spent an entire year on Zoom school with no camera on.

602
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:54,500
Like, I'm pretty sure you watched YouTube for years. Oh, yeah.

603
01:20:55,700 --> 01:21:00,920
I'm almost certain that's what happened. So, yeah, group too.

604
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:05,270
What did you guys come up with for things that we can do to promote satisfying discussion.

605
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:13,080
So we said. Feel comfortable to essentially say or not.

606
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:17,400
Yeah. They don't have to come up with like someone saying.

607
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:21,940
Smart thing to say that you just have to do something that's super developed in the brain.

608
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:28,959
Yeah, absolutely. Like having a method of kind of choosing the speaker so that everyone's allowed

609
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,170
to speak as opposed to like one or two people kind of dominating the discussion.

610
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:39,670
People having to find a way out. Different opinions and perspectives on the same topics without.

611
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:45,240
Everyone brings with one another. Yeah.

612
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:48,950
We don't want to be social media. Yeah.

613
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,950
Yeah. So those are the three that we decided. That's.

614
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:01,100
Three things to prevent unsatisfying discussions. And these kind of in the same vein show respect to everyone.

615
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:08,140
Everyone come prepared for the assignment. Two points to talk about.

616
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:15,370
Discovery starts making sure. An outline so that everyone.

617
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:35,050
Group three combat. I want to ensure that everyone that's been in all three groups.

618
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:38,970
Right. We agree on that percent. Make sure that everyone.

619
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:47,400
Other are always. Having respect for all perspectives.

620
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:04,230
Refrain from getting. And be willing to take the initiative to.

621
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:17,820
Be willing to go into the. And I mean mindful about the varying backgrounds that understand that everyone is

622
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:23,480
different and that affects exactly how they feel as well as their perspective on.

623
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:33,330
Group for. Oh.

624
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:54,500
And the other thing is. We get positive feedback.

625
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:19,870
And then when you speak. And then it's to prevent.

626
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:26,770
Avoid speaking over one another. Avoid disrespect.

627
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:33,000
When you step back and including trying to avoid.

628
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:43,330
Just be yourself. Yeah.

629
01:24:43,720 --> 01:25:04,900
It was a great group five. And.

630
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:49,040
A lot. Yeah.

631
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:57,139
One thing that I thought of when you were listening to the first set is we're this is a big class this year,

632
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:03,260
and it's really hard to see each other sometimes if you're on the edges of the class and sometimes

633
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:07,580
even hard for me to see here because I have to really like move my head all the way around.

634
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:15,260
I try to move across the classroom so I can see. Plus, I get blinded when I get in front of these projectors.

635
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:21,020
So it helps to raise your hand, like when we're having discussions,

636
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:28,610
even though I know sometimes that makes it feel awkward because it doesn't seem as though it's falling is really that if you raise your hand,

637
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:32,929
it helps with this idea of like not talking over each other and that kind of thing.

638
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:36,739
And I try to watch to see who's raising their hand and calling you in order.

639
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:41,870
But I might mess up sometimes just because it's hard to see everybody all at once.

640
01:26:42,480 --> 01:27:08,340
A Group six. There are five.

641
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,070
After the trial. Three of the men. Yeah.

642
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:22,640
We're setting boundaries and different models for different competition and.

643
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:29,720
And then to prevent unsatisfying discussion. Sort of like.

644
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:39,370
But acknowledging that. And then be prepared.

645
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:49,220
Yeah. Those are great. It sounds like there's a lot of overlapping ideas and kind of a lot of consensus about what makes a good discussion,

646
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:54,159
what to try to avoid if you don't want bad discussions.

647
01:27:54,160 --> 01:28:02,709
And so I think that's really great. And I one of the reasons I like to use small groups is because I think I'm the kind

648
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:07,450
of person who doesn't like it's it's really hard for me to speak up in class.

649
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:16,389
I'm one of the like I'm a three something. And so but I find it easier to to kind of to talk in a smaller group.

650
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:18,310
And so I like to have that mixture.

651
01:28:18,850 --> 01:28:24,249
And I know that that's the case for a lot of people, that they might feel more comfortable in the small group rather than in the larger group.

652
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,639
And it might be that you don't feel as comfortable in the beginning of the class,

653
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:33,700
but once you get to know each other and things, you'll feel more comfortable kind of speaking up in the large group discussion.

654
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:42,759
But one of the things I think is one of the things that you brought up like don't be afraid to answer because you think,

655
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:46,120
I don't know enough about this topic and I'll sound stupid.

656
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:51,910
It's, it's fine to like to say what you're thinking and we'll talk that through.

657
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:57,190
Um, so, yeah, please don't avoid talking because you think, oh,

658
01:28:57,190 --> 01:29:04,809
there's all these sociology majors in the class and they'll know more about this than, than I do because I majored in biology or whatever.

659
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:09,040
But it's totally fine. So please feel free to to share your thoughts and things.

660
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:18,340
All right. A couple of things that I, I just want to I have a few things on here that I like to say in case they don't come up in the discussion.

661
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:23,230
Some of them are very obvious. So you can just roll your eyes at me, but avoid using stereotypes.

662
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:26,890
Um, you know, I think that most of you will, but I just want to put it out there.

663
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:32,950
Um, you know, avoid using derogatory terms for social groups, including privileged groups.

664
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:41,200
I think sometimes that feels more okay. But, you know, just trying to use respectful language when we talk about groups, don't expect any use.

665
01:29:41,230 --> 01:29:46,250
So several of you mentioned don't only speak for yourself, don't speak for a group,

666
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:50,860
but also don't expect anyone else to speak for their group, whatever you think that is.

667
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:58,930
And just that you can't really assume that you know someone's background based on the way they look or where they're from.

668
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:07,990
Right. You know, I think people make all kinds of assumptions about people who are from Alabama, and I don't think that I support those stereotypes.

669
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:12,050
Um, maybe some of them, but hopefully not many.

670
01:30:12,050 --> 01:30:16,450
I don't know what they are, but yeah. Um, let's see.

671
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:22,810
We talked about that. Yeah. Don't be afraid to express a different opinion or an unpopular opinion.

672
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,700
Try to recognize the difference between opinion and facts.

673
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:35,830
Right. Um, and I think just treating each other kind of with respect and assuming that we're all here to learn, you know, this is an elective.

674
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:37,560
You didn't have to take this class, right?

675
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:44,360
So everybody who's here is really interested in learning about this topic and I think that helps in terms of the discussions.

676
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:50,650
So I know we've been in here for a long time, so let's take a break for about 5 minutes and get up, stretch your legs,

677
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:55,840
get something to eat, go to the bathroom, and then we'll come back and we'll start talking about the papers that you have today.

678
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:07,820
This time. This is the part where a city have to worry about what's going to happen.

679
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:14,090
Whichever, doesn't really matter. They're just going to have to port that information.

680
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:20,180
Yeah, you can go back to the point. I do want to let you know we're on the list.

681
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:27,320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm getting answered right here.

682
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:37,170
Yeah. Okay. So why did I read that?

683
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:42,490
I don't know. All right.

684
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:48,620
And I will ask Elvira. They you in you class? Yeah.

685
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:54,679
No, go ahead. Okay, cool. Yeah. Some people really want the first.

686
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:58,010
They really want the last thing. Yeah. Oh, wait.

687
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:04,100
Was. Okay.

688
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:14,560
No, I don't. Well, actually, just talking about that in case, I think there's.

689
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:24,270
There's just too much to lose. Yeah, I don't know exactly.

690
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:31,790
Exactly. Exactly. And even when I write them, sometimes I'm like, what did I mean when I wrote that?

691
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:37,830
I don't. I only have email and I don't know.

692
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:41,510
Uh huh. Yeah.

693
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,640
Like. Oh, I don't know. But you have to.

694
01:32:50,800 --> 01:33:04,580
You. Four and five.

695
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:09,400
But you know what? When people come back like, yeah.

696
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:21,240
Right now. He's down the road. Yes, I agree.

697
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,120
I know. I need to get out. Do you think that?

698
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:56,210
Yea. Yea.

699
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:03,680
Yea. Yea. Yea.

700
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:14,600
Sounds like it's going to get started.

701
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:29,430
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

702
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:33,510
Yeah, I think it was like.

703
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:39,660
Oh, I don't know. I don't. I.

704
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:51,860
Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck as a father.

705
01:34:56,150 --> 01:35:08,160
And. But. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:12,810
I could jump out of there. You just sit down. Yeah.

707
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:20,070
And then Sarah has never changed since you were here last year.

708
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:24,890
I was on the platform. Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

709
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:35,830
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Like I have a car to do something.

710
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:44,380
Like, yeah, probably. You got to have, like, something like that.

711
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:49,750
Yeah. Yeah, I. Yeah.

712
01:35:49,810 --> 01:36:01,730
Yeah. Is it very easy? And it's expensive, but it's difficult to get around the city.

713
01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:09,730
Guns are really hard and we have a lot of traffic current in place.

714
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:13,450
But like compared to a big city, you can get anywhere.

715
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:23,790
It has been helpful, like one of my sister in Wisconsin. And it's like if you look at some of the big, most popular.

716
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:28,050
Yeah, yeah. It was good.

717
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:33,900
And then I come here, it's like I'm like, oh, this is what you really like.

718
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:43,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I was like, it's bad for you, you know?

719
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:54,129
But the commute times, it's yeah, it's better to just go visit it because it is real nice for them to be like, Hey, I'm good.

720
01:36:54,130 --> 01:37:02,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we know that like when we lived in the Bay Area, I mean, I also had a toddler, but I, you know, I didn't go to college.

721
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:09,040
I went to the grocery store and I went to work and I went to daycare.

722
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:14,040
And, you know, so you don't always get to take advantage of.

723
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:24,340
And I was like, I think it's like somebody like I like to have them.

724
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:28,160
Yeah. Yeah. You're right in your D there.

725
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:34,400
And why are you here on Capitol Hill, right?

726
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:48,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

727
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:59,670
Exactly. So what do you think?

728
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:07,450
Is the weather like the perfect fire and all that?

729
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:11,350
Maybe not like, you know, where you are.

730
01:38:11,390 --> 01:38:16,810
Like, it was kind of like, yeah, yeah, exactly.

731
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:24,310
But I hated earthquakes and I know what it is.

732
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:32,870
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. It could happen all the time.

733
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:47,110
I mean, we feel like it happen all the time, but I mean, in two years there was one big one that was over on the South Bay,

734
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:53,140
so not right next to us, but we could feel it in our condo.

735
01:38:53,410 --> 01:39:02,120
I remember watching my son's we have those here to your show and they were like, yeah, yeah.

736
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:06,460
She did not like that was on that it was a blizzard.

737
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:13,870
Yeah. Right. Like I don't know, I don't want to know more of that.

738
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:20,150
And then the whole way higher than I did not know.

739
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:26,470
Oh, all right. Let's talk about theories.

740
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:40,850
What is the theory? What comes to mind when you think about.

741
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:53,630
Yeah. Olivia, you'll be brave. You're trying to explain Lego from another universe.

742
01:39:53,930 --> 01:40:01,010
Yeah. You're trying to explain something. You. Maybe you have observed some phenomena, and you're trying to come up with an explanation for it.

743
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:05,960
Yeah, absolutely. So. So I have a couple of definitions here.

744
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:11,450
One is from the Capilano Daily article. Think we're going to read this soon?

745
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:20,960
But they say that a theory is logically related propositions that aim to explain and predict a fairly general set of phenomena.

746
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:23,060
Pretty much what a Leviathan.

747
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:38,440
And then another definition that we get from the Kreeger reading for today is an attempt to explain why phenomena exist and are interrelated.

748
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:47,030
So theories are really about logic, not about data.

749
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:56,069
And in this class, what we're trying to do is we're trying to understand how things in the social environment affect health.

750
01:40:56,070 --> 01:41:04,980
Right. And so when we combine theory with data and methods, then that's how we accomplish that, right?

751
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:10,439
So sometimes in our epidemiology training, we really focus on the methods, right?

752
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:15,120
So those of you who are epidemiology students, have you taken any theory classes?

753
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:21,300
What you have. Did you say yes.

754
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,480
Oh, like 600 has come here. Yeah. Do you want to talk about that?

755
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:28,680
Like, what is the what are the kind of theoretical concepts that you talk about in 600?

756
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:35,120
Cohort study, case control study is from our study.

757
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:41,430
Okay. So you talk about study design. Yes. Yes, you might talk about counterfactuals.

758
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:50,690
So like a way of thinking about things in terms of understanding the types of analysis we do in theory.

759
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:59,360
Yeah. Like causal theory. Just in the situation.

760
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:06,690
Right. Yeah. So thinking about the difference between associations versus causes, right.

761
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:12,160
You spend a lot of time thinking about that, like what are the criteria for establishing a causal relationship?

762
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,409
Yeah. So yeah, so there's some, there's some theory in there,

763
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:24,130
but it really tends to be a theory about methods rather than theories about how the world works.

764
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:28,329
So, so like a slightly different kind of type of theory.

765
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:31,420
And so what I, what, you know, a lot of what we're going to do in this class,

766
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:34,270
especially when we're talking we're going to talk about theory throughout the class,

767
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:39,460
it's not that we're gonna stop talking about theories, but we're going to really heavily emphasize them for the first couple of weeks.

768
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:45,790
But these theories are really trying to help us understand this big, big,

769
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:51,969
big question of how do things in the social environment affect people's health?

770
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:56,860
Like why would something that's out here that you can't even see a lot of times?

771
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:02,140
Right? How on earth does that get inside our bodies and affect our health?

772
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:06,730
Right. So that's the kinds of like big theories that we're going to be thinking about.

773
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:20,880
So in terms of why theory is important, you know, science is based on both logic and observation.

774
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:26,730
A lot of times we think about the data, but there's also the logic piece that's really important.

775
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:37,200
If we didn't need the logic, we could just take all the data in the world and put it in a computer.

776
01:43:37,740 --> 01:43:43,710
Right. And it would tell us the answer. Why were there racial disparities in COVID?

777
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:49,500
Right. We can just put a whole bunch of data in there, tell the computer to work on it and spit it out.

778
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:54,840
Do you think that would work? It wouldn't, right?

779
01:43:54,870 --> 01:44:01,529
We need we need to use logic and use our ideas and our understanding of other things in

780
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:06,840
the world to put context to the data that we see and to interpret it and understand it.

781
01:44:07,170 --> 01:44:10,440
So theories help us think it helps us.

782
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:17,280
They help us think about these research questions that we want to study and that we want to get data and apply methods to.

783
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:30,280
They help us systematize knowledge. Explanation and prediction and help us generate new hypotheses.

784
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:39,790
So, you know, if you just opened PubMed right now and you did a search because we were talking about racial disparities in COVID,

785
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:45,430
can somebody do it and somebody open PubMed and put racial disparities covered and tell me how many articles come out?

786
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:50,170
Just curious. I haven't done this already. I don't know the answer, I guess.

787
01:44:54,880 --> 01:45:02,170
Oh. 1400. Okay. Yeah. Can you read 1400 articles about racial disparities and COVID?

788
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:08,979
I can't write. I don't even. It would be very difficult to even go through the abstracts for 1400 papers.

789
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:12,970
Right. So if we're just thinking about data and evidence,

790
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:20,470
there's so much and that's like a really narrow topic that has only been something we've been thinking about for like two years.

791
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:25,750
So now when somebody puts socioeconomic status and health in there and tell me how many come up.

792
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:40,940
116,000. Okay.

793
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:44,860
We definitely can't. You could read two or 3000 abstracts.

794
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,660
We really could just take you a while. But 100 and something thousand right now.

795
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:57,690
And so we need you here use to help us kind of make sense of all of this evidence that we have.

796
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:04,680
Right. And, you know, if you've read papers before, sometimes one study says this, another study says something opposite.

797
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:13,200
Studies measure things differently. Right. So theories are really helpful for us, sort of systematizing all of that knowledge,

798
01:46:13,890 --> 01:46:18,330
helping with explanation and prediction and generating new research hypotheses.

799
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:31,290
So when you were doing the readings for today, what did you notice as you read the papers?

800
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:37,210
What came up? Were there themes that were in common across the three readings that you had for today?

801
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:49,190
Yeah. Patricia So I feel like one big thing was that there's a combination of, like, individual choice and structure.

802
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:54,479
Yeah. It really sets the stage.

803
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:59,510
And then also. Yeah, absolutely.

804
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,290
So the readings were kind of talking about how much is is our choices right,

805
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:09,119
that we freely make and then how much of our behavior or other things that influence our

806
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:14,730
health are really shaped by social structures and our kind of social circumstances.

807
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:21,280
Yeah, absolutely. Anything else that you guys noticed about the readings?

808
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:36,410
Yeah. Come on. So all of the readings mentioned uncertainty.

809
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:44,170
So thinking about like that that there's not deterministic processes in in like when you're thinking about the social determinants of health.

810
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:47,549
Absolutely. And that relates to this idea of agency and structure.

811
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:57,330
Right. Because people do make choices, even though they are oftentimes constrained by their social circumstances, people do actually have each other.

812
01:47:57,690 --> 01:48:00,930
So it can sometimes be the right.

813
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:05,340
It can be hard to predict what people are going to do because of that.

814
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:10,170
Yeah. Um. I think that, um.

815
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:20,120
Yeah. Like. Yeah.

816
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:35,820
Yeah. I mean what about their drawing attention to as there's so much of epidemiology in the past had been really focused on

817
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:44,430
individual kind of risk factors and individual behaviors without thinking about social structure and social context.

818
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:52,610
Yeah. In that same vein, I think it was a lot of them were slamming research at the same time.

819
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:59,030
If you're trying to just look at individual associations between the social determinants of health and the health outcome,

820
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:04,130
ignoring all these other things, what are you actually accomplishing? Like, you got me.

821
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:06,440
Like, I need to think about these other things as well,

822
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:11,410
but it's really hard to do all of them to seem like they kept saying like this is super difficult

823
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:15,650
or there's not an easy way to do this and then try to figure out a way to accomplish that goal.

824
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:24,650
Yeah, social epidemiology is really hard, right? Because a lot of what we want to do in epidemiology is we want to have an exposure and an outcome,

825
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:27,889
maybe an effects modifier if you're getting crazy, right.

826
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:31,490
But like we want to be really tough and we want to dichotomies.

827
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:34,280
All of that makes everything so much simpler.

828
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:43,370
And yes, I think these readings are telling us, you know, you can do that, but you may be missing some of them, right?

829
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:47,360
Yeah, that's. Yeah, but we still do it.

830
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:52,740
Yes. I mean, we try to, you know, look at that. You're in the complex systems program, right?

831
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,950
The mathematical modeling programs of you know,

832
01:49:54,950 --> 01:50:04,580
I think that there are epidemiologists and sociologists who are trying to incorporate kind of more than just a simple exposure outcome model.

833
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:08,200
Do you want to say anything about that? Well, I just did the program, so. Okay.

834
01:50:10,130 --> 01:50:15,500
Okay. Well, you can tell us and tell us why you wanted to do it.

835
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:25,420
Yeah. I read the paper by this person who was talking about fundamental classes of systems of exposure.

836
01:50:25,450 --> 01:50:31,400
Yeah, how? Really? Like expanding our idea of what a causal model is.

837
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:36,680
It's not a line. It's like a big, like, I don't know, kind of like a tumbleweed.

838
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:43,340
Yeah, I don't know. Like, and I think that there are I'm interested in looking into ways to measure that better,

839
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:47,120
not just like metaphysical theory, which I also like the but yeah.

840
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:52,010
Yeah. How can you do it empirically. Yeah, I think that's what's so challenging, right?

841
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:58,880
So conceptually and from a theoretical perspective, we can totally understand how complex social systems and human behavior are.

842
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:05,840
But in terms of applying quantitative methods to that, sometimes there's like there's a disconnect there.

843
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:11,989
And so I think these readings are kind of telling of all of the people who wrote these papers for today.

844
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:22,970
All of them do quantitative research. Right. But they're telling us, you know, our quantitative research doesn't always map the reality perfectly.

845
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:31,970
And like we're doing our studies. Anything else that people noticed about the readings as you were going through them?

846
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:37,060
Yes. Okay. To your point, though, like this.

847
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:43,520
I also felt like walking away from the articles. There was like a sense of a call to action, like maybe don't for me.

848
01:51:44,210 --> 01:51:48,260
You know, if you really want people to consider what they're doing and how.

849
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:57,079
Yeah. And I think some of them were from the nineties or early 2000, but it was like they felt like, oh, come on, you need to do better situation.

850
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:02,380
And here's how we can do better. Yeah. And not just an abstract like this sucks situation.

851
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:11,670
Yeah. Yeah. I agree that there is this kind of sense, almost of optimism in the papers that we could move closer to this ideal and social equity.

852
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:18,469
You know, so one of the writers is an epidemiologist, which is two of them are a sociologist by training,

853
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:22,190
but they're all working in this kind of area of social epidemiology.

854
01:52:22,190 --> 01:52:26,900
And yeah, they're kind of challenging us to do a better job with our research.

855
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:30,629
I mean, I think it is interesting because these these articles that, this you know,

856
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:38,600
I would call these the kind of classic readings they're they're older readings now, but but they still very much apply.

857
01:52:38,610 --> 01:52:46,079
Like we haven't really moved that far in the field from what these readings are talking about,

858
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:52,440
like the things that they're discussing, it still happens all the all the time, decontextualized research and that sort of thing.

859
01:52:54,640 --> 01:53:02,820
Yeah. So, you know, one of the things that I think all of these authors talk about is, is they're focusing on this idea of disease distribution.

860
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:10,560
Like, why do we observe social patterning of disease, which many of you when you were talking about why you wanted to take this class,

861
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:19,770
this was kind of the question that you had and what you're trying to understand, like why is there social inequality and health and disease?

862
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:24,360
All of these authors are really talking about that and pointing out that there are

863
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:29,130
these very predictable kind of patterns according to different social factors.

864
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:38,520
And and like many of you said there, there's a strong focus on social structure and on thinking about the causes of the causes.

865
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:41,370
So focusing sort of more upstream.

866
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:52,270
They want to get us away from individually focused explanations for health and disease or what we would think of as like the biomedical model.

867
01:53:56,490 --> 01:54:03,600
So I want us to take a minute to think about common ideas that people have about disease causation.

868
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:08,790
Right? Not epidemiologists, just people you know, your friends who aren't epidemiologists.

869
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:11,460
If you have parents who aren't epidemiologists,

870
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:19,390
like if you ask them what causes people to be sick or healthy, where do you think they would say yes, yes.

871
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:27,540
Choices. Yeah.

872
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:32,320
So they don't sleep enough. They don't exercise enough, Erica. Okay.

873
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,560
So also environment. And when you say environment, do you mean like chemicals in the environment or what do you mean by environment?

874
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:54,190
Yeah. So these environmental kind of like the physical environment, canopies, anything else that people would say?

875
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:59,530
Olivia I would hear it's in their genes, it runs in the family, but we're not really understanding what that means.

876
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:05,440
Sure. Genetics. So you can be genetically predisposed to be healthy yourself.

877
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:13,780
There's also behaviors you choose to smoke or you don't exercising for sleep and anything else that people might say.

878
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:28,200
Yeah. Okay. So it three be that they may have all in their head for psychological stress.

879
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:33,910
You like you might hear people when they when they're talking about how they say stress is important.

880
01:55:34,570 --> 01:55:39,300
Now, if you ask them to define stress, how that would go.

881
01:55:39,390 --> 01:55:48,940
But yeah, I mean, I think I think generally most of what people focus on is health, behavior, genetics, to some extent, this idea of stress.

882
01:55:49,330 --> 01:55:56,250
Anything else that comes to mind? Yet people just like generally drive this notion of what you are, can you stay healthy?

883
01:55:56,290 --> 01:56:01,479
But yeah, and that gets kind of back to behavior.

884
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:09,010
And it also, you know, I think it's interesting because that reflects our thinking about what are the most common diseases.

885
01:56:09,370 --> 01:56:17,499
And so prior to COVID, people came in and focused not much on hand-washing or late word behaviors that are related to infectious disease transmission.

886
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:21,969
They've been more focused on the chronic, so things like exercise and stress and stuff like that.

887
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:29,650
But that's a great point. But depending on what the dominant diseases are, we might have different ideas about what contributes.

888
01:56:29,650 --> 01:56:36,040
But still it's really easier whether that behavior is handwashing or exercise.

889
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:40,520
There's one thing you haven't mentioned.

890
01:56:45,730 --> 01:56:53,250
Maybe it's because you're epidemiologists or public health people and you're like, well, yeah, it's not bad health care.

891
01:56:54,450 --> 01:57:00,960
Right. Like some people say, oh, it's access to health care. That's what makes you sick or what makes you healthy, right?

892
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:07,829
Not so much. Right. How access to health care can be really important for like the course of disease.

893
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:13,049
You know, like let's say you're diagnosed with type two diabetes. Having access to health care is really important, right?

894
01:57:13,050 --> 01:57:14,880
Because you need certain treatment.

895
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:22,100
But having access to health care really doesn't have that much to do with whether you develop type two diabetes or not.

896
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:27,629
But in terms of like your course of disease, that can be really important. But it is something that a lot of people focus on.

897
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:33,150
And I think there was a lot of attention around the Affordable Care Act that if we

898
01:57:33,510 --> 01:57:37,499
if we implement this and we have universal near universal access to health care,

899
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:44,850
that will eliminate health disparities. And there was some evidence of decreases in some types of health disparities.

900
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:50,640
But generally, access to health care isn't the thing that really kind of gets rid of disparities.

901
01:57:52,970 --> 01:57:59,210
So why do you think that people focus on these factors instead of social factors?

902
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:03,320
Why do we focus on behavior or access to health care or genetics?

903
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:14,129
Yeah. I can't. Okay.

904
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:18,190
Yeah, it's a simpler explanation, certainly. Yeah.

905
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:34,370
Traditional forms of. Yeah.

906
01:58:34,370 --> 01:58:38,600
We very much focus on individuals. And why do you think we do that?

907
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:43,250
Why do we focus on the. It's easier.

908
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:49,880
It's kind of easier to tell others to change their behavior rather than trying to keep.

909
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:53,990
Yeah. Or does it change environment in some way? Yeah. Yeah.

910
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:57,550
I mean, these factors affect our health directly.

911
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:04,010
Yeah. Social factors. Sometimes they may affect our health indirect way that sometimes people just ignore it.

912
01:59:04,090 --> 01:59:08,379
So. Yeah, absolutely. So I think there's less focus on individual thing.

913
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:12,420
Oh, go ahead. We live in an individualistic society or.

914
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:15,800
Yeah. Ah. Upbringing. What is normal for us.

915
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:23,410
It's like in the US it's, there's a lot of them, but in other locations, countries, etc., it can be more collectivist.

916
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:26,560
And that's kind of where you feel like your family and.

917
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:30,309
Yeah, it's true. So some of it is cultural. Right.

918
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:38,920
If you, if you live in a very individualistic kind of culture where the emphasis is on the individual and not the group or not the society,

919
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:43,250
then there can be a tendency to focus more on individual solutions for things.

920
01:59:43,750 --> 01:59:51,520
I think it is also easier, right, to say you should stop smoking.

921
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,960
That's easier than saying let's eliminate child poverty.

922
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:02,170
Right. It's easier. It's cheaper, even if it's less effective.

923
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:06,399
Um, I think also just what you said is really true, right?

924
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,120
Like a lot of times we think about, you know. Okay.

925
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:12,010
Yeah. So. Right.

926
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:20,979
I, I see that poverty impacts health, but if you just stop smoking, that's the thing that's directly contributing to your poor health outcomes.

927
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:27,580
So if you get rid of that, then it won't matter so much that there's that you're you have low income.

928
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:35,600
Right. But what does that myth. I mean what are these readings say that that members.

929
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:43,520
Yeah. But just like every other. Oh yeah.

930
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:48,679
Everything else. Right. That's associated with that kind of fundamental cause.

931
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:53,629
Right. It's not just smoking, it's not just exercise, it's not just diet.

932
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:56,540
It's not just the neighborhood that you live in. Right?

933
02:00:56,540 --> 02:01:03,410
There's all of these factors and you can get rid of one, but there's others that are there to kind of take its place.

934
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:12,059
Right. So yeah, I mean, some of this has to do with a focus on individual responsibility in the US,

935
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:21,840
in particular the belief that these are the true causal factors and then also that it's just more practical to intervene on.

936
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:27,600
And so there's all kinds of reasons why we focus on things that are more at the level of the individual.

937
02:01:30,810 --> 02:01:32,670
I'm not doing great with my slides today. All right.

938
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:38,550
We're going to set this focus on this distribution, the focus on social structure and social context.

939
02:01:40,330 --> 02:01:44,140
So I want to talk first about the health lifestyle theory.

940
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:52,030
And any thoughts on this paper before we start talking about it? I know this can be a little bit of a challenging paper.

941
02:01:52,030 --> 02:01:56,860
This is the Cockerham paper. Did anybody like it?

942
02:01:58,120 --> 02:02:03,080
Oh, Colin liked it. It's like anybody else.

943
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:06,710
It's okay if you don't like that. Anybody hate it? Yeah.

944
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:11,800
Olivia, you hated it. Tell me why. So that horrible drawing I did like a drawing.

945
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:16,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's. Oh, wait, no, it's coming. That's coming out more.

946
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:21,390
The collection of the three. I dislike the other two so much more than to be the one I read last.

947
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:25,670
I was like, Oh, what an ending. Is it a run for?

948
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:29,469
Yeah. So it's like a really dense paper, right?

949
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:40,540
There's a lot of ideas in there. There's a lot of like kind of normal queries up in there, you know, any time or do it comes up on a paper.

950
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:43,629
Yeah. I mean ab it like because that's the reality.

951
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:47,020
But for a lot of us, we're like, oh, habitus.

952
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:57,010
But I actually, you know, I've read this paper 20 times now and I always find something new in this paper because there's just so much.

953
02:02:57,430 --> 02:03:12,069
And I, I really admire, um, the author's ability to take these kind of classic concepts from sociology and apply it to like a kind of current context.

954
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:16,330
And so I, I agree it's a challenging article, but I like it.

955
02:03:16,330 --> 02:03:24,670
I think it has a lot of insights that are important. So I want to start with just talking about what life styles are.

956
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:31,810
So he defines healthy lifestyles as collective patterns of health related behavior

957
02:03:33,010 --> 02:03:40,030
based on choices from options available to people according to their life chances.

958
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:54,690
It's a mouthful. So you can think about that since this is what we were saying earlier when we were talking about smoking,

959
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:58,680
how smoking kind of goes along with other things too, right?

960
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:02,010
Like it's not doesn't tend to be an isolated behavior.

961
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:07,260
So we can think about a clustering of behaviors.

962
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:19,710
That are, you know, health related behaviors and that these clusters of behaviors tend to differ by social position.

963
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:27,260
So they're not really like sometimes we think about smoking or drinking or sleeping

964
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:32,570
as these are individual choices that are like we kind of decide what to do.

965
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:38,060
But what's interesting is that they tend to cluster together and that those patterns

966
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:43,129
are observable across social groups and kind of in somewhat predictable ways,

967
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:49,970
not that there's not deviation from that. COHEN Like you said, right, these aren't it's not deterministic, but we can observe this.

968
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:52,909
And so there's this idea.

969
02:04:52,910 --> 02:05:01,340
And Patricia, I think you brought this up, this idea of kind of agency versus structure here and the interplay between those two things.

970
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:12,500
And that's a lot of what this paper is talking about, right? So choices are our agency and then our life chances represent structure.

971
02:05:16,150 --> 02:05:19,480
So we're making decisions about our behaviors,

972
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:28,480
but we're making those decisions from a set of options that are available to us based on kind of our social position.

973
02:05:30,170 --> 02:05:34,340
So we can't just choose anything necessarily.

974
02:05:35,660 --> 02:05:37,940
So there's a set of options and we're picking.

975
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:49,480
So this theory is based on Weber's notion of lifestyles, which was not meant to be applied to help necessarily.

976
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:56,320
And so I'm going to kind of go through all these bullet points and then we'll talk about what they mean.

977
02:05:56,410 --> 02:06:03,460
So the first idea from here is that status groups share a similar lifestyle.

978
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:13,690
And so think about this not just in terms of health, but broader lifestyle.

979
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:18,990
So a status group refers to people who share similar material circumstances.

980
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:23,520
Prestige, education and political influence.

981
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:40,290
And a lot of the emphasis in this article is not entirely about socioeconomic status or social class, but it's it's largely about that.

982
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:46,660
So when you're thinking about status groups, you can think about it in terms of kind of like socioeconomic status.

983
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:55,730
There's also this idea here that lifestyles are about consumption, not about production.

984
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:09,370
But lifestyles are based on choices like we were talking about before,

985
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:15,520
and that those choices that we make, whether it's about what kind of car to buy,

986
02:07:16,030 --> 02:07:26,980
where to live, whether to buy, organic produce, those choices are enabled or constrained by our socioeconomic circumstances.

987
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:36,340
And then lastly, there's this idea that lifestyles can spread across class boundaries.

988
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:49,130
Okay. So let's kind of go back and talk through all of these and what they mean, especially as they relate to health.

989
02:07:50,390 --> 02:08:01,460
So first of all, if I said to you, if you have a healthy lifestyle, what might that mean?

990
02:08:02,090 --> 02:08:05,090
What might I mean by that? Or how would you interpret it?

991
02:08:05,390 --> 02:08:15,570
What's a healthy lifestyle? Yeah.

992
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:25,390
Okay. So this is someone who is healthy through the exercise a lot.

993
02:08:32,350 --> 02:08:38,460
Every night they get 8 hours of sleep an hour, seven or whatever to sleep.

994
02:08:40,230 --> 02:08:46,010
Okay. Person might have a person might have a stable income that contributes to that lifestyle.

995
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:54,340
Right. To be able to exercise. Anything else you think about in terms of a healthy lifestyle?

996
02:08:57,940 --> 02:09:01,120
Do you feel like you have a healthy lifestyle right now? You don't have to.

997
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:06,249
But a lot of times grad students to feel like they don't have a healthy lifestyle because you probably

998
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:12,220
don't get enough sleep and necessarily eat the kind of food that you would have if you had more time.

999
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:14,229
But yeah, you've got that idea.

1000
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:21,910
So there's these sort of help, these behaviors that we know are important for various health outcomes, like exercise, diet.

1001
02:09:22,570 --> 02:09:27,400
A lot of times you might put in here wearing a seatbelt or a bike helmet.

1002
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:36,820
Um, all of these kind of behaviors kind of go together and reflect what we would call a healthy, a healthy lifestyle.

1003
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:42,309
So then the question is which status groups in the U.S. are more likely to have a

1004
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:47,440
healthy lifestyle or healthy lifestyles randomly distributed throughout the population?

1005
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:53,479
What's that? Yeah. So. So.

1006
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:55,309
Incomers, social class. Yes.

1007
02:09:55,310 --> 02:10:03,680
But typically, those who have more middle income or higher income are more likely to have what we would describe as a healthy lifestyle.

1008
02:10:03,690 --> 02:10:12,129
And why would that be? Yeah.

1009
02:10:12,130 --> 02:10:17,700
Because a lot of those. So there's the resources to afford it. So there's the money associated with it.

1010
02:10:17,730 --> 02:10:21,870
What other resources enable or constrain healthy lifestyles?

1011
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:30,930
Yeah, absolutely. So you've got you've got the money.

1012
02:10:31,230 --> 02:10:35,730
There's also the time, which is, you know, what we talked about, how many of you said today,

1013
02:10:35,730 --> 02:10:39,210
if you had an extra hour, you would engage in some kind of healthy behavior?

1014
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:46,740
Many of you said that, right? So some of these these kind of healthy lifestyle behaviors are about time.

1015
02:10:47,730 --> 02:10:52,060
Yeah, I would say kind of the same wavelength, I guess, like.

1016
02:10:54,290 --> 02:10:57,800
Yeah. So it's like having money. That's part of it. And it's like having money.

1017
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:03,560
You have a you live like an area that has a grocery store and.

1018
02:11:04,670 --> 02:11:08,180
Exactly. So you might have the money and you might have the time.

1019
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:15,890
But if you live in an area that doesn't have a certain level of resources to facilitate that behavior, you're not going to be able to do it.

1020
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:16,790
Yeah.

1021
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:27,050
So there's all kinds of different resources that people who are higher socioeconomic status tend to have that facilitate these healthy lifestyles.

1022
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:37,180
So then there's this idea of lifestyles being about consumption, not production.

1023
02:11:37,450 --> 02:11:41,920
So how is the goal of producing good health really about consumption?

1024
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:46,720
You know, typically when we think about consumption, we think about, you know, buying.

1025
02:11:48,270 --> 02:11:53,610
Night. And whatever else we buy, right?

1026
02:11:53,630 --> 02:12:00,690
How does it help about consumption? Yeah.

1027
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:04,589
Buy the house. Services. Okay.

1028
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:08,160
So some of it could be related to health care.

1029
02:12:08,190 --> 02:12:15,750
Right. And like consuming health care services. What might we want to consume by having better health?

1030
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:26,249
Yeah. Status. Okay. Yeah. So absolutely it can be in in of itself.

1031
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:30,170
Good health can be a marker of status. Yep.

1032
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:40,840
Can help you. Oh, yeah. Access to any other kind of food.

1033
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:46,450
Yeah, right. If you're not healthy, what else are you going to be able to consume?

1034
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:53,980
Is that what you're thinking like? You know, if I want to kind of if I want to be able to travel, for example,

1035
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:02,820
then I need to have health that promotes my ability to like to engage in certain types of leisure activities.

1036
02:13:02,830 --> 02:13:07,569
So, you know, it can be about I want to be healthy because I want to live longer.

1037
02:13:07,570 --> 02:13:11,440
I want more years of life. I want to be able to work.

1038
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:19,480
I want to look a particular way. I want people to think of me as someone who has good health and high social status.

1039
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:23,460
So there's all these ways in which health can really be about consumption.

1040
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:33,980
And then this last idea of lifestyle spreading across class boundaries as being healthy, something that only middle and upper class people care about.

1041
02:13:37,090 --> 02:13:43,510
No, it's not right. Like people you know, people want to be healthy, right?

1042
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:50,560
But people who have more resources are just better able to have those healthy lifestyles.

1043
02:13:53,550 --> 02:14:02,960
Okay. The dreaded figure. Let's see how much time we have.

1044
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:08,940
Do we want to walk through all this or we just want to move on and move on?

1045
02:14:09,670 --> 02:14:16,560
Well, I have a text message from my husband saying that it's going to cost $477 to fix our washing machine.

1046
02:14:18,230 --> 02:14:23,100
I shouldn't. I looked at my mom. That's really sad.

1047
02:14:24,930 --> 02:14:28,320
How much does a new washing machine cost if you just buy a new washing machine?

1048
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:41,820
I mean, we've had it since 2008. All right.

1049
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:49,940
That made me really sad, but it also made me really sad when it flooded our library.

1050
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:53,160
So you know what? All right.

1051
02:14:56,790 --> 02:15:00,660
All right. Let's talk about it for a minute. I'll give you the really quick version.

1052
02:15:01,290 --> 02:15:09,360
All right. Okay. So this is just sort of a graphical demonstration of poker games model, right?

1053
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:12,959
So how you get from something like this, social,

1054
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:17,610
structural things all the way down to the health lifestyles that are the behaviors

1055
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:21,990
like what's all this stuff that kind of happens in between to make this occur?

1056
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:28,380
So it starts with these social structural variables that can shape health lifestyles.

1057
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:33,390
And so he's really emphasizing socioeconomic status or social class.

1058
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:36,870
And according to Cockerham, that's the most powerful influence.

1059
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:40,169
But there are many people who would disagree with me about that.

1060
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:43,620
Right. That's that's his perspective about which one is most important.

1061
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:50,370
But also here we have things like age, gender, race and ethnicity.

1062
02:15:51,510 --> 02:15:58,979
We also have collected bodies. So collectivity is just collections of actors linked together through particular relationships.

1063
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:04,260
So I think a good example of this is if you're a member of a particular religious group,

1064
02:16:04,260 --> 02:16:09,540
this can be something that can really shape all of these other things in important ways.

1065
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:16,920
And then also he talks about living conditions. And this is sort of when we were talking before about neighborhoods and the

1066
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:21,780
importance of neighborhoods kind of above and beyond or in relation to these things.

1067
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:27,459
And, of course, you know. This perspective was already around when this was written.

1068
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:30,940
But we can also think about intersectionality, right?

1069
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:39,690
And how these these different aspects of of of social structure and social position interact with one another, right?

1070
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:43,000
Like race and gender and name or location.

1071
02:16:44,470 --> 02:16:51,940
And so the idea is that these types of social structural things influence the way that we're socialized.

1072
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:56,130
And the types of experiences that we have.

1073
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:07,270
And then there's this piece about life choices where you just see.

1074
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:12,830
So our socialization and our experiences influence the types of choices that we make.

1075
02:17:13,730 --> 02:17:20,710
But our class circumstances, our age or gender or race, our social position influences our life chances.

1076
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:24,170
Right? And then there's this interplay between them.

1077
02:17:25,190 --> 02:17:35,970
So there's this interaction between our life choices and our life chances, but then give rise to our dispositions to act or our habits.

1078
02:17:40,190 --> 02:17:48,620
So this is really just the idea that we act habitually when performing routine tasks, right?

1079
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:53,870
Like when you go to the grocery store, how much? What do you give to what you're buying?

1080
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,930
Probably not a whole lot.

1081
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:05,710
I mean, you know, maybe you make a menu or whatever, but like you have your preferences kind of way that you typically do or whatever.

1082
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:15,680
So we kind of have these these dispositions, two acts that are well established this that influences our practices, the actions that we take.

1083
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:21,350
And these can promote health or harm health. And so there's these examples over here.

1084
02:18:21,350 --> 02:18:28,280
Our practices can be related to things like alcohol use, smoking, diet, exercise, going to the doctor for checkups,

1085
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:32,540
wearing seat belts, all of those kinds of things that we know are really important for health.

1086
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:41,420
And then that gives rise to our health lifestyles, which are those overall patterns of behavioral practices.

1087
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:49,100
And then there's this kind of feedback here that goes back to the dispositions to act.

1088
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:57,130
So acting in certain ways either leads us to reproduce our behaviors, to modify them or to stop them, you know?

1089
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:03,259
So an example of reproduction would be like if we exercise, we feel better.

1090
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:06,290
So we're motivated to continue exercising.

1091
02:19:08,630 --> 02:19:17,120
An example for modifying or stopping may be that, you know, when you're a college student, you might engage in heavy drinking.

1092
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:25,219
And then as you sort of move out into more adult roles, that may not work really well for you anymore.

1093
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:29,930
And so you may modify that behavior. Okay, let's move on.

1094
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:33,810
Are there any questions about that? Okay.

1095
02:19:36,540 --> 02:19:39,960
All right. So now I want to talk about fundamental causes.

1096
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:51,509
So, Olivia, was this one that you liked? I did. Okay. Any comments on that paper before we started talking about the fundamental causes?

1097
02:19:51,510 --> 02:19:53,580
Paper, trail and paper.

1098
02:20:06,930 --> 02:20:16,290
So it's just sort of the basic idea, if you want to boil it down, some fundamental causes is that social inequality causes health inequality.

1099
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:22,020
That's the take home message there. And there's a lot more words than that in the paper, but that's sort of the idea.

1100
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:34,530
And the focus, like we said before, is moving away from the proximate and those kind of individual risk factors and moving more toward distal causes,

1101
02:20:34,530 --> 02:20:37,800
things that are further away in the causal chain.

1102
02:20:38,910 --> 02:20:46,590
So things like socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, gender, like what we saw in box one from the Healthy Lifestyles theory.

1103
02:20:56,470 --> 02:21:03,050
So there's four essential components of the theory of fundamental causes.

1104
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:07,569
And the first one is this idea that if something is a fundamental cause,

1105
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:13,390
if we're going to label something a fundamental cause, it means that it needs to influence multiple disease outcomes.

1106
02:21:15,580 --> 02:21:22,569
If something causes cancer but doesn't really cause heart disease or diabetes.

1107
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:35,530
And it's probably not a fundamental cause. So like if you think about in the 19th century when infectious diseases were the leading causes of death,

1108
02:21:36,010 --> 02:21:40,660
you could see that cholera, diphtheria, TB were all socially patterned.

1109
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:44,100
It wasn't like it was just one of those diseases, right?

1110
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:47,349
It applied to kind of all of those things. And today we see the same patterns.

1111
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:55,000
If we think about things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, we can see patterns across all of those leading causes of death.

1112
02:21:55,330 --> 02:22:00,040
Every once in a while, there's like kind of a weird one, like breast cancer or something.

1113
02:22:00,040 --> 02:22:03,280
But overall, the patterns tend to be pretty consistent.

1114
02:22:05,140 --> 02:22:11,920
So the second kind of aspect of fundamental causes is that a fundamental cause operates through multiple risk factors.

1115
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,120
We already talked about that before, right? When we were talking about the example of smoking.

1116
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:20,170
It's not only operating through smoking is operating through other things,

1117
02:22:21,940 --> 02:22:29,260
other health behaviors, maybe things like psychosocial stress, environmental conditions.

1118
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:46,540
And there's also this idea that over time, new intervening mechanisms will reproduce the associations that you observed previously.

1119
02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:53,210
So, for example, when infectious diseases were the leading cause of death, you know, there was more of a,

1120
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:58,340
you know, smoking maybe wasn't as important, but overcrowding was really important.

1121
02:22:58,730 --> 02:23:04,490
But then as chronic diseases become the leading cause of death, maybe overcrowding is no longer as important.

1122
02:23:04,670 --> 02:23:11,959
But now these other things that are associated with the fundamental cause kind of rise in importance for explaining that relationship.

1123
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:15,800
So then it becomes things more like behavior and stress.

1124
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:31,620
And this we also touched on already. What makes it a fundamental cause is all of these things, plus the fact that it involves access to resources.

1125
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:43,590
All different kinds of resources that we can use to avoid disease or to manage disease once we have it.

1126
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:50,050
So just as an example, when you have more money,

1127
02:23:51,640 --> 02:24:00,130
it helps determine whether you know about have access to can afford will be supported in certain health promoting behaviors.

1128
02:24:00,580 --> 02:24:06,310
It also shapes contextual factors like neighborhoods, occupations and social networks.

1129
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:19,690
And so I have this this quote from the article from page 87, which I really like.

1130
02:24:19,690 --> 02:24:26,530
And they say that no matter what the current profile of diseases and known risk factors happen to be,

1131
02:24:27,070 --> 02:24:33,550
those who are best positioned with regard to important social and economic resources will be less affected by disease.

1132
02:24:34,810 --> 02:24:42,610
And I think that COVID has really helped us see that in a way that wasn't always as obvious to many of us before.

1133
02:24:43,310 --> 02:24:47,410
Right. It was like all of a sudden, there's this brand new thing immediately.

1134
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:59,510
There's disparities. Right. And so the people who have more resources always have an advantage in terms of avoiding this use or managing this.

1135
02:25:00,220 --> 02:25:05,510
Once, once they have it. So.

1136
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:16,059
What is the depressing implication of this? Well, maybe it's not depressing.

1137
02:25:16,060 --> 02:25:26,600
Maybe you're an optimist. How will we eliminate health disparities or health inequalities?

1138
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:40,330
Noel and then Patricia by eliminating the social conditions that we have.

1139
02:25:40,650 --> 02:25:47,880
Is that what you're going to say, Patricia? Yeah. We have to eliminate social inequality, essentially, if we want to eliminate health inequality.

1140
02:25:48,510 --> 02:25:59,230
So why did I say that's depressing? It's a long term goal that somebody say it's hard for the.

1141
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:20,590
Yeah, we require that many of us give up certain advantages that we currently have that would require radically different policies,

1142
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:25,360
you know, around things like taxation and redistribution of wealth.

1143
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:35,790
Do you think we could do it? No, Jackie, y'know, I don't.

1144
02:26:35,910 --> 02:26:40,650
I don't think anyone at the top. Down.

1145
02:26:42,810 --> 02:26:53,910
Yeah, it seems it seems unlikely, given our current circumstances, that people would voluntarily relinquish privilege and wealth.

1146
02:26:53,940 --> 02:26:57,920
Cullen, you agree? Yeah.

1147
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:09,590
Does it does anyone feel optimistic about it? How could you feel optimistic about it?

1148
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:20,550
I mean, I think it's possible. Yeah, I think a what else do you think about it?

1149
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:29,900
Okay. You know. But the information on top of that and the.

1150
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:36,639
Okay. So you have more optimism and more hope for your generation.

1151
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:40,870
You hope that they'll come before you.

1152
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:44,670
Yeah. And you live in their home. Uh huh.

1153
02:27:48,370 --> 02:28:03,360
Based on circumstance, maybe. But it may vary from place to place.

1154
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:10,969
Yeah. In smaller areas. Yeah, absolutely.

1155
02:28:10,970 --> 02:28:14,330
So there could be kind of micro context in which this is more.

1156
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:16,410
Or are you happy?

1157
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:31,750
I mean, to me in some ways, like the depressing side of like, oh, yeah, I don't think we're ever going to eliminate all social inequality.

1158
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:39,339
But on the more positive side, it says that if there if there was the will right.

1159
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:43,090
That you could reduce or eliminate disparities.

1160
02:28:43,090 --> 02:28:46,480
It's just that it's a hard solution. It's a hard sell.

1161
02:28:46,900 --> 02:28:53,230
But it's not that you could never do it necessarily, but that it would take really dramatic action.

1162
02:28:53,830 --> 02:29:00,040
And I think sometimes we have to remember, too, that it's not an all or nothing proposition.

1163
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:03,910
It's not like, oh, we can't eliminate inequalities. Let's stop trying.

1164
02:29:04,390 --> 02:29:11,110
Right. I think there are ways to work toward reducing social inequalities and health inequalities,

1165
02:29:11,110 --> 02:29:19,540
but they require us not to focus on smoking interventions or physical activity interventions.

1166
02:29:19,540 --> 02:29:26,700
Right. They're telling us you need to increase the minimum wage or you need to, you know.

1167
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:34,300
Right. Like it's telling us that we need to really focus on these more upstream things that are about broader access to resources.

1168
02:29:35,070 --> 02:29:42,990
And so in some ways that's encouraging because it can tell us, stop wasting your time on these things that don't work your time and your money,

1169
02:29:43,230 --> 02:29:50,790
and start focusing on these other things to the extent that you can, to the extent that it's politically and economically usable.

1170
02:29:51,210 --> 02:29:56,820
Right. So it's kind of both depressing and encouraging in a way,

1171
02:29:56,820 --> 02:30:02,219
depending on your mood that day and whether you just found out that you're paying $500 to

1172
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:09,750
fix your very old washing machine via essentially the implications of this or that we have,

1173
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:13,950
you know, reduce health inequality without reducing social inequality.

1174
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:17,820
Got to focus on that if that's what we really want to do.

1175
02:30:19,290 --> 02:30:28,030
Check the time. So eco social theory.

1176
02:30:28,510 --> 02:30:30,310
The web of causation.

1177
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:43,140
So Krieger is talking about this metaphor of the Web and this idea that there are multiple interconnected causes of particularly chronic disease.

1178
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:54,690
And so this web metaphor came about because the single agent germ theory as a disease didn't really apply to the study of chronic diseases.

1179
02:30:54,690 --> 02:31:01,680
And so epidemiologists had to figure out another a new way of thinking about chronic diseases and what causes that.

1180
02:31:01,950 --> 02:31:14,160
There's not this, like, single cause, right? And so what does Krieger say is missing from this web of causation idea?

1181
02:31:15,390 --> 02:31:18,450
Is the spider. Spider is missing.

1182
02:31:18,480 --> 02:31:21,820
So what does that mean? Like the underlying cause of the.

1183
02:31:22,450 --> 02:31:26,410
I was like, Yeah, that's right. I know it's nerve wracking, smart.

1184
02:31:26,830 --> 02:31:30,150
So yeah, it's like, whoa, something made the web.

1185
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:35,520
So I think cause the web to be there. What is what is that cause?

1186
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:42,120
And so that's what's missing. And so it's a we're lacking a discussion about the causes of the causes.

1187
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:45,840
And that's what she's really bringing our attention to. Same with fundamental causes.

1188
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:55,290
Same with health, lifestyle theory. They're all really trying to make us think like go back, way back and like what caused all of that stuff?

1189
02:31:56,910 --> 02:32:03,990
And so she makes the argument that for most of epidemiology, there is an underlying theory,

1190
02:32:04,230 --> 02:32:09,870
there's an underlying kind of view of how the world works that's driving the way we do most of epidemiology.

1191
02:32:09,870 --> 02:32:12,390
And she says that's biomedical individualism.

1192
02:32:18,490 --> 02:32:27,520
And so that kind of underlying theory, whether it's stated or not, emphasizes the biological determinants of disease.

1193
02:32:29,990 --> 02:32:33,710
It considers social determinants as secondary at best.

1194
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:38,180
You know, maybe we control for them as confounders, right?

1195
02:32:38,390 --> 02:32:43,970
They're like producing noise and trying to understand this true relationship that we're interested in.

1196
02:32:44,540 --> 02:32:47,990
And it views populations as the sum of individuals.

1197
02:32:48,020 --> 02:32:51,480
It really doesn't have a population perspective.

1198
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:54,560
It's very narrowly focused on the individual.

1199
02:32:56,980 --> 02:33:04,500
And this the kind of idea from the biomedical model is that you cut the strings of the web, right?

1200
02:33:04,510 --> 02:33:10,149
There's the web. And if you cut one, then now you've you've prevented that relationship, right?

1201
02:33:10,150 --> 02:33:21,130
Like you fixed it. So this would say focus on smoking or focus on high cholesterol or focus on the thing that's very proximate to your outcome.

1202
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:27,580
And then it doesn't matter, like the spider doesn't matter anymore because we've now cut that relationship.

1203
02:33:28,210 --> 02:33:33,040
But we know from fundamental causes and these other theories that it doesn't really quite work that way.

1204
02:33:34,090 --> 02:33:39,880
So eco social theory also has this kind of notion of embodiment,

1205
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:47,590
which really speaks to me as somebody who's interested in the biological mechanisms that link social factors to health.

1206
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:57,490
Is that idea of how do these things from outside of us, many things that we can't even see, how do they get inside our bodies to influence our health?

1207
02:34:00,210 --> 02:34:05,560
And so a lot of times the alternatives to biomedical individualism,

1208
02:34:06,810 --> 02:34:11,100
they focus on social and political determinants of health, but they often ignore biology.

1209
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:15,810
So did you see anything about biology in the Cockerham reading?

1210
02:34:16,890 --> 02:34:21,090
It wasn't in any of those boxes or anything. There's no biology in there.

1211
02:34:21,360 --> 02:34:24,660
Even Lincoln. BYLINE There's there's no biology in there.

1212
02:34:26,100 --> 02:34:32,339
And so eco social theory is kind of meant to bring in this focus on social and political determinants of health,

1213
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:38,160
but also integrating and incorporating biology. And so there's this concept of embodiment,

1214
02:34:38,580 --> 02:34:48,360
which is really literally how we incorporate biologically the material and social world in which we live from conception to death.

1215
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:54,450
So it has a life course kind of perspective, which we'll read more about next week when we talk about life first epidemiology.

1216
02:34:58,710 --> 02:35:06,930
And the goal of this theory is to really help us understand these population patterns of health,

1217
02:35:06,930 --> 02:35:13,530
not thinking about what makes an individual healthy or sick, but what makes populations healthy.

1218
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:25,110
And to think about those as biological expressions of social relations.

1219
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:37,450
Now this doesn't really get into the details of how you choose your exposures and your outcomes and how you model them.

1220
02:35:37,450 --> 02:35:45,220
Right. But this is like this is theory. This is helping helping to orient you to the research question and to the data.

1221
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:51,490
So it's big. And when you do research, right, you've got to get it narrower than that.

1222
02:35:51,490 --> 02:35:54,610
But this is giving you this larger framework to kind of think about.

1223
02:35:55,510 --> 02:36:03,720
So the last thing I want to mention from this article is just this idea that Krieger talks about around the social production of science.

1224
02:36:03,750 --> 02:36:09,370
It's not something that we talk about a lot in epidemiology, anything, but it's really important.

1225
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:20,420
So the theory is that we have the research questions that we have, the way we collect data,

1226
02:36:21,170 --> 02:36:28,250
the methods we use, the way we interpret and report results are influenced by society.

1227
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:32,090
A lot of times we think of science as being objective, right?

1228
02:36:33,170 --> 02:36:39,590
It doesn't matter who's doing it or where they're doing it. But her point is that it does matter how we do.

1229
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:45,920
Science is influenced by society's predominant worldview and the position of scientists within that.

1230
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:57,600
So part of what she's trying to to discuss and explain is this idea that science is simultaneously objective and partizan.

1231
02:36:58,290 --> 02:37:06,150
So, yes, like the scientific method, this idea of being able to replicate things and whatever, sure, that has a certain objectivity to it.

1232
02:37:07,020 --> 02:37:14,730
But science itself is kind of influenced by society,

1233
02:37:15,090 --> 02:37:21,210
especially in terms of the types of questions that we even think to ask or that are acceptable to ask.

1234
02:37:26,990 --> 02:37:33,350
So as she says, which I think is very true and this will be something that we come back to every week in this class,

1235
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:37,339
especially as we talk about measurement of social constructs.

1236
02:37:37,340 --> 02:37:41,570
Because, like I said before, a lot of times they're not observable.

1237
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:46,280
A lot of the things that are in the social environment, even socio economic status, right?

1238
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:50,210
We use words like middle class, upper class that's not observable.

1239
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:54,770
We have to define that. We have to figure out how to measure it and what it means.

1240
02:37:55,100 --> 02:38:03,620
So her point is that we have to be as rigorous about our categories of thought as we are about our approaches to analyzing data.

1241
02:38:07,330 --> 02:38:14,709
And I think one of the things I like about what she says is that when we when we can acknowledge that science isn't purely objective,

1242
02:38:14,710 --> 02:38:22,960
it helps us be more humble about our work and to avoid the hubris that comes along with the biomedical model.

1243
02:38:27,390 --> 02:38:31,740
Any closing thoughts on that? Do you feel better about the world or worse about the world?

1244
02:38:31,930 --> 02:38:35,670
Sasha It's not really like that.

1245
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:40,220
In the briefly mentioned with.

1246
02:38:41,980 --> 02:38:46,310
I was wondering what that was like. Like any where you're like.

1247
02:38:48,150 --> 02:38:55,260
I don't know. I like doing things or trying to do like how they do not like with that with respect

1248
02:38:55,260 --> 02:39:00,280
to help lifestyle theory itself or just how to measure happiness in general.

1249
02:39:01,290 --> 02:39:05,340
Well, the U.S. government, we'll talk about those. And we talk about race and ethnicity.

1250
02:39:06,060 --> 02:39:13,140
In the U.S., there are two ethnicities. Do you know if they are Hispanic and not Hispanic?

1251
02:39:13,530 --> 02:39:18,070
So you're either Hispanic or you're not Hispanic and those are ethnic categories.

1252
02:39:18,090 --> 02:39:26,309
Right. But that, of course, varies, like the whole notion of what is race and what is ethnicity varies across place and time.

1253
02:39:26,310 --> 02:39:33,120
So we'll talk more about that, too. But yes, measuring ethnicity, defining ethnicity is kind of tricky.

1254
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:38,549
And actually that but if I have that in these slides or if it's just in a presentation that I did one time,

1255
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:47,459
but like the way that the US government defines race and ethnicity and racial categories, they mix the concepts up a whole bunch.

1256
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:57,360
Like it's really fascinating because they talk about race involving continental ancestry, but then it also is about country anyway.

1257
02:39:57,390 --> 02:40:01,540
Well, we'll talk about it, but yeah, it's a tricky thing to measure.

1258
02:40:04,330 --> 02:40:10,000
Anything else anybody wanted to add? All right.

1259
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,530
I hope you have a good weekend and I will see you next week.

1260
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:20,620
Don't forget to do your discussion post the first one on Wednesday and then come back and respond to somebody else's comment on Thursday.

1261
02:40:21,850 --> 02:40:27,729
Yes. Oh, yes. Will you put your name tents back at the front?

1262
02:40:27,730 --> 02:40:32,260
Because I'll use those. So learn your names and to keep track of attendance.
