1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:05,791
In this session of HMP600 the health services system.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,862
We are going to talk about a brief history of financing health care in the us,

3
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:18,295
going back to the early part of the 20th century.

4
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:26,110
In this session we will cover the 1900s up to about the 1940.

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,326
Our goals for today are to describe this early history of paying for

6
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:33,852
health care services in the US.

7
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:38,842
To define a few key features of health insurance as that

8
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:43,081
first emerged in the 20th century in the US.

9
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:48,121
And explain some of the connections between this early history and

10
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:54,161
the current structure of US health care services that we continue to see today.

11
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,646
Before we look back at this early history,

12
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:05,420
it's helpful to think about the structures that we

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,527
have in place in the US health care system and

14
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,330
particularly how we pay for care today.

15
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,169
So I'm gonna start by showing a slide that provides a basic

16
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:22,770
overview structure of the US health care system.

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,200
Don't worry about trying to understand all these different pieces right now.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,498
This is just to give you a sense of where we're going and

19
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:37,271
we're gonna get to the place where we see this system today.

20
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:44,020
We're gonna go back in this session to talk about how we started to get here.

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:50,133
The US healthcare system today is called a third party payer system.

22
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:55,009
Because we have the insurers are that

23
00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:00,201
third party who pay many of the bills for

24
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:04,921
health services provided by health

25
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:09,338
care providers who are party 2.

26
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:14,309
They're providing those health care services that care

27
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:19,072
to party 1 who are patients, citizens, employers,

28
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,130
etc sometimes now called purchasers as well.

29
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,081
And so this third party payer system and structure is what we have today.

30
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:35,482
And you see there are many different names and

31
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:41,878
terms in each of the boxes for the different groups and

32
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:47,870
parties who make up those elements of the system.

33
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,951
Different ways we pay different money flows,

34
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:55,600
etc the public and private insurance systems that we have today.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,100
So these key features evolved over the 20th century.

36
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,710
And so it's helpful to go back to look at where they started.

37
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,714
So when we go back to this early period, prior to the third

38
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:17,151
party payer system that we have today in the early 1900s.

39
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:22,393
We can think about health care in a really basic way in

40
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:27,526
which there are patients, party 1 who need care.

41
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:32,995
They seek out that care, those health care services

42
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:38,103
from providers like physicians and hospitals.

43
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:44,210
They would go for a health care service for example, if you broke your leg and

44
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:50,140
needed to have your leg set and a cast put on, you would go to the provider.

45
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,105
They would set the bone put on a cast and charge you a fee for

46
00:03:56,105 --> 00:04:01,831
that service and you as the patient would pay that fee.

47
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,551
So pretty basic fee for service system.

48
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:14,951
And you've probably heard that term, that's what we call

49
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:21,541
the exchange of a care service to a patient for money, a fee for service.

50
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:29,809
But it's just like we experience in other industries when you go to a restaurant and

51
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:34,311
you order food and they serve the food to you.

52
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:37,634
And when you're done, you pay the bill and

53
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:42,735
you have have just paid a fee for the service of a restaurant meal.

54
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:47,562
We don't call it that when we're talking about restaurants,

55
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:52,206
but it's the same idea of paying a fee directly to the service

56
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:56,055
provider from the party who who gets the service.

57
00:04:56,055 --> 00:05:00,036
So for health care, the patient pays the fee to the provider who

58
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:03,960
provides the health care service to the patient.

59
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,776
Now, early in this period from 1900 to about 1930,

60
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:14,908
there were a variety of calls for actually starting to

61
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:20,290
provide compulsory government sponsored insurance.

62
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,490
We were looking some other countries were doing that.

63
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,760
And so there were some progressives in the United States calling for

64
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,270
compulsory health insurance.

65
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,534
Other calls to actually seek to subordinate medical practice

66
00:05:36,534 --> 00:05:43,340
to public health to create group practices, lots of ideas during this time.

67
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,100
But there was also quite a bit of resistance to these ideas.

68
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,033
So, even though there were some employee groups who were

69
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:57,580
getting what were called national sickness plans.

70
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,848
So the granite cutters for example,

71
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:06,880
arranged to have this insurance for them as a employee group.

72
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,050
Others were very opposed to this.

73
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,676
So the AMA, the American Medical Association was gaining power over

74
00:06:14,676 --> 00:06:21,569
this period and was very resistant to any call for government sponsored insurance.

75
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,997
Employers were also resistant to government sponsored

76
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:29,590
insurance they did not see the need for that.

77
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,385
And even unions like the American Federation of Labor resisted calls for

78
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:37,695
government sponsored insurance in this period.

79
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:41,065
Because they thought it might weaken the need for

80
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:43,630
in the role of the union for example.

81
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,565
So most healthcare services were delivered as directly

82
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:52,390
to patients and paid for by patients.

83
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,370
And of course this is the early period of medicine is still

84
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,370
becoming medical care the way we know it today.

85
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,089
Germ theory the establishment of hospitals, professionalization of

86
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:11,681
physician training and nurses training etcetera was all happening in this period.

87
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,292
Okay, so we're gonna now skip ahead.

88
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:21,391
As I said, this is a brief history skip ahead to the 19

89
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:28,860
thirties when we start to see the rise of this third party in medical care services.

90
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,949
So the rise of private insurance And what happened

91
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:39,280
is an administrator at Baylor University in Texas

92
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,491
organized a group of 1000 teachers in Texas and

93
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:50,187
realized that if they each paid a small amount of money,

94
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:55,278
$6 a year into a pool that pool of resources could

95
00:07:55,278 --> 00:08:00,246
then Enable any one of those 1000 teachers

96
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:05,900
to have up to 21 days of hospital care if needed.

97
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,881
You might recognize this as the basic idea behind insurance,

98
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:17,013
pooling resources across a population in this case, 1000 teachers and

99
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:22,661
if each of them contributed a small amount of money, only $6 a year,

100
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:28,850
They would be able to access health care services if and when they needed it.

101
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,071
The health care services in this example is 21

102
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:37,309
days up to 21 days of hospital care if needed.

103
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,130
That was it.

104
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:46,123
So this was actually eventually got the name that we know it today.

105
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,971
The Blue Cross.

106
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:51,060
So by 1934 it had the name Blue Cross.

107
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,980
It was nonprofit hospital insurance.

108
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,605
The American Hospital Association adopted the Blue Cross

109
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:04,415
symbol in 1939 as an emblem for any plans that met certain

110
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:09,341
standards that could be used to provide hospital insurance.

111
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,723
Now, looking at this, the american Medical Association

112
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:20,693
thought this seems like a good idea and there were similar

113
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:25,562
plans already providing this basic insurance a small

114
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:30,503
monthly fee in order to get access to doctor services.

115
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,530
This was being used in certain places throughout the The country.

116
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,888
And so in 1939, the first official Blue Shield plan

117
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:45,132
was founded in California soon after in Michigan, and

118
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:50,262
this was another insurance plan to provide nonprofit

119
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:55,281
based insurance coverage for physician services.

120
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,101
And today we know these as blue cross.

121
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,150
Blue shield.

122
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,146
This has evolved to today, this is a combined health plan, but

123
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:09,824
at the time they were two separate plans and for

124
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:15,691
much of the the 20th century, they were two separate insurance plans.

125
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:20,629
Blue cross and Blue shield and all of the Blue cross and

126
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:25,040
blue shield plans have similar features.

127
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,816
The, those who are ensured that is the beneficiaries pay

128
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:34,790
a premium that annual fee in order to own the insurance for

129
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,969
the blues, the premiums were community rated and

130
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:45,670
that means that everyone in the group pays the same amount to own the insurance.

131
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,960
And it's based on the core idea, core basic idea in insurance

132
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,641
that you are pulling risk across a population group and

133
00:10:55,641 --> 00:11:00,830
then everyone in the same, everyone in the pool pays the same

134
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,409
amount to own insurance that helps cover any losses or

135
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:10,192
costs that might be associated over that time period for

136
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:15,011
this to own this insurance, there were no exclusions.

137
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:19,042
People were, could not be excluded for a health reason.

138
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:23,666
And you'll, you'll recognize that as something that we know about today, but

139
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:28,018
at the time there were no exclusions though, It should be pointed out that in

140
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:32,166
these early blue cross and blue shield plans, the number of services and

141
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,800
the type of services that were covered were also very limited.

142
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,120
So for example, the, you know, that early Baylor University Teacher plan,

143
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,701
Blue cross really just covered some number of days of hospital care.

144
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,965
In addition to paying premiums, the beneficiaries of the insurance

145
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:59,440
had to pay out of pocket coinsurance for each service.

146
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,228
So coinsurance, some percentage of the bill that the beneficiary

147
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:07,180
always had to pay out of pocket.

148
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,650
In addition to what the insurance policy covered covered services.

149
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,787
Typically were procedures,

150
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:21,440
not consultations, not preventive care.

151
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,470
Remember this is in the early 20th century, the concept of preventive care or

152
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,629
even education related to medical care was not actually an idea that existed.

153
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:38,032
This was treatment typically acute treatment for

154
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:42,748
acute medical conditions and injury and illness,

155
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:47,381
A disease, a known disease and treatment for that.

156
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,175
Other things that were not covered at the time, Mental health, vision care,

157
00:12:54,175 --> 00:13:00,581
dental care, none of those were included in these early types of health insurance.

158
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,319
Finally, another key feature of

159
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:11,260
the blues was that the providers were paid fee for service.

160
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,701
So the providers of the health care were paid directly

161
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:22,375
by both the beneficiary that out of pocket coinsurance and

162
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:27,931
then the rest of the bill for the service was paid directly

163
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:32,715
to the provider by the blue cross or blue shield.

164
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:39,026
And it was whatever fee the provider set for that service.

165
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:49,057
Again, this is just some of the basic insurance terminology that is often used,

166
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:54,430
some of the definitions there that we just used in hearing

167
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,909
about the blue cross and blue shield systems and in general,

168
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:04,959
we will discuss when talking about health insurance and

169
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,546
so what we can see by the 19 thirties, in in our brief history

170
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:17,314
of the third party payer system is we now have the third party established so

171
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:23,224
we can see that the basic features are here, we have insurers,

172
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:27,628
we have who are who are basically party three, so

173
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:32,679
the purchasers of care, the patients or in some cases,

174
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:39,340
employees like teachers pay a premium to a health insurer, Blue cross and

175
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:45,730
Blue shield in order to have some coverage when they need health care.

176
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,969
If that if those patients need health care,

177
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:58,220
they go to a provider who provides them with a service, a health care service.

178
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,522
The providers are paid in part coinsurance

179
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:08,970
directly from the patient as well as the rest

180
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,123
of the bill is paid by the health insurer,

181
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:18,420
blue cross or blue shield.

182
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,114
And this is the basic Structure of health insurance and

183
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:28,590
the parties that we have in the us today.

184
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,837
And of course with many more now insurers, different types of providers

185
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:38,860
when we think about not just patients, but other types of purchasers.

186
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,110
We see that grow and grow throughout the 20th century.

187
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,539
But by the 1930s, this is what the basic infrastructure for

188
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:50,320
financing healthcare in the United States looked like
