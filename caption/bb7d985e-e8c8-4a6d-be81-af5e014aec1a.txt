1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,630
Small group today, it looks like, but that means will be nimble for something.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,410
All right. So today, December 1st, I don't know how that's possible, but here we are.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:21,889
And sadly, this will be my last lecture in this course, because next week we'll start with the group presentations.

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:32,430
So on Tuesday, we'll have groups one in three scenarios, four in three, and on Thursday, groups to for any questions on that.

5
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:40,650
And then recall there is a peer evaluation form. I'll set up a place to deposit business interests and things like that next week.

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:51,630
Again, if your group has questions, feel free to reach out to me. Insert prompts as you finalize your presentations.

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,410
Connect. All right.

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,040
So today we're going to finish up with consumer products.

9
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,620
All right. If it will work.

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,940
All right. Has anyone here ever used consumer credit?

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,400
Just kidding. Everyone has experience with consumer products, whether you acknowledge it or not.

12
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,060
It's part of our lives. So let's dive right in.

13
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,140
So what are we going to cover today? Some key questions I thought of and thinking about consumer products is what are they?

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,739
Who regulates them? Because back then we talked about standards, guidelines and things like that.

15
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,370
We didn't really touch on consumer products much. What chemicals can people be exposed to and how?

16
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,820
How do we assess exposures from consumer products and how can people reduce their exposures?

17
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,980
So consumer products, we have lots of stores like this around in the United States.

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,459
This one you might recognize if you've been to one of these based on how it's designed.

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,250
But if you just kind of, you know, this is a pretty normal scene for for most of us.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,770
But if you actually sit and think about everything that's here, all of it is made out of something.

21
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,900
Right? And all of that is related to some kind of chemical makeup.

22
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,700
Whether it's harmful or not, we don't know. But everything is based on.

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,550
So and this is representative of just a fraction of what we consider to be consumer products.

24
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,720
So here's the Webster's or Wikipedia definition.

25
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,729
Personal property for sale use by people, family or households.

26
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,549
And it includes a whole bunch of different things home furnishing toys,

27
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:00,290
etc. But also it can be found that it's food, pesticides, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals in addition to that.

28
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,660
So, you know, pretty much everything you buy and use might be defined as a over consumer product.

29
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,280
But again, if you think about what comprises them,

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,440
there's all kinds of stuff that may be worth looking into or potentially being concerned about within each of those types of products.

31
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,330
But of course, we have a good grasp of this. There's never been any stories that we had regret.

32
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,490
Right. Well, there's plenty to cover.

33
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,990
A few things. So. DDT. We've all heard of rape. It's a persistent pesticide.

34
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:44,520
It's been around, but we now know it's probably associated with a whole range of reproductive and other types of health effects.

35
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:53,040
But, you know, back in the day, you know, with good old marketing, they branded it as being a healthy thing.

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,760
So we wondered how it got into our food supply because it's being marketed.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:04,020
They're even saying, you know, cows that are treated with DDT provide, you know, eat better and their meat is better.

38
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,990
And here's milk. The baby being fed even produce items.

39
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:21,630
So, you know, there's that's a prime example of something as a consumer product that was probably used probably marketed and then come to find out,

40
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,020
maybe that was a good idea. I mean, there's some crazy ones. Look at this.

41
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:35,970
On the right, you have children's wallpaper that is incorporating DDT that's being marketed, which, you know, in hindsight maybe wasn't a great idea.

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,980
Here's another one that's very commonly known paint.

43
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,320
But, you know, again, see how it's marketed.

44
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:55,590
You know, it's it's a durable easy to use you know less coats required all that stuff because of the lead in the product which we now know has caused,

45
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,080
but just immense problems later on and at the time that they didn't know it.

46
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,710
People applying the paints.

47
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:10,200
But later on when the paint dried out too and started to chip, as we talked about earlier, this must have had a sweet taste to it.

48
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,500
So children take up, put in their mouths, things like that.

49
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:24,000
And the marketing on this one was even better. They went with the kids coloring book, the glad party, where you can color different led characters.

50
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,180
So it's it's always interesting to kind of go back in time and look at how we got to where we are.

51
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:43,020
Here's one I saw on Twitter a while back. Science News was saying in 1958, science news had an advertisement for dish towels made of 20% asbestos.

52
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,890
Another one that probably in hindsight was a terrible idea because as we've talked about, asbestos fibers, they become aerosolized and buried them.

53
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,830
Can't get lost in the deep recesses of the lungs, cause scar tissue, asbestosis, mesothelioma, lung cancer, etc.

54
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,110
So yeah, it's another one.

55
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:14,850
Cigarets, of course, but this aspect of the Cigarets was, you know, talking about the advertisements related to scientific evidence.

56
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:23,040
So this one's saying that Chesterfields. Scientific studies show that they're milder and are healthier than other brands.

57
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,940
I don't know. I'd have to dig into what what studies are referencing.

58
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,520
And at this point, more doctors smoke candles than any other brand. So, you know, these are it's pretty crazy.

59
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,030
Thinking about the P fast as you were doing it now, you know.

60
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:47,870
Tough one of course, was marketed as a very innovative and useful product for many types of consumer items of irony.

61
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:56,740
Cookware shown there and here, Scotchgard. Back then, people were just spraying Scotchgard at everything because it would prevent.

62
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,610
Stands and things like that. But again, now it's you know, it's everywhere and we're still dealing with it.

63
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,890
So Scotchgard still that says no way is still there, you know?

64
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,459
Well, it depends on how you say Scotchgard.

65
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,340
They changed the formulation to have less of the long chain PFAs chemicals and more the short chain ones.

66
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,969
But, you know, short chain ones aren't as persistently permanent, which gets you partway there and being better.

67
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,530
But we don't know toxicity wise, what the specific chemicals are.

68
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,920
What they might be doing. Yeah.

69
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,000
And then first, where you only see Old Spice has a great marketing campaign.

70
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:46,499
But then I was in the news. Every couple of months you see articles like this, this inspiring and the good projects.

71
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,900
We'll hear about it next week. You know, things found in there that that shouldn't be there.

72
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,909
So in this case, benzine, so brings to mind, you know, what's going to be 20 years from now.

73
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,330
Are we going to say, I can't believe we were using this.

74
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,180
I can't believe we're doing that. And marketing, it is great. So in any event, it's a little background there.

75
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,960
So the next question is who regulates consumer products?

76
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,750
There is something called the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

77
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:25,020
CPSC you may have heard of established in the 1970s, was a big, big time period for environmental related laws,

78
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,370
and it was amended again in 2008, but seeks to promote safety of consumer products by addressing unreasonable risks of injury.

79
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:42,720
But if you're familiar with CPSC, you probably know them from things like car seats, a lot of baby items that are more about acute injury,

80
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,970
fires, burns, things like that is where you see them devoting most of their attention.

81
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:53,970
You don't see a whole lot with regards to chemicals and maybe chronic health effects.

82
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,660
They're much more focused on children, I'd say.

83
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:06,750
Some other laws and administrations have rolled in the U.S. here, FDA, USDA, Tosca.

84
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,070
We've talked about Europe has the REACH regulation, which does help with consumer products as well.

85
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,110
But different aspects of different consumer products made in the U.S. fall under different, different laws there.

86
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:34,850
So as we know, the US laws are not super effective or haven't been in the past actually doing a good job of regulating toxic chemicals.

87
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:42,440
And that's true of consumer products as well. If you can, you know, just think back to the slides I showed from historical examples.

88
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,370
This is where California I believe my California people here today. Yeah.

89
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Have you heard of Prop 65? Yeah, it's everywhere.

90
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,499
Yeah, absolutely. So this is where, you know, the progressive nature of California kind of bit them a little bit on the flame retardant

91
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,070
thing where they requiring more flame retardants in products trying to be safer.

92
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:12,139
This is where they, in my opinion, they've helped move things along on the consumer product side were where the federal government has fallen short.

93
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,940
So this dates back to 1986, something called the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act.

94
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,659
And it was, as it says, more focused on on drinking water.

95
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,420
But it does expand into things like consumer products.

96
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:33,770
So what it does is it requires warnings in advance for consumers to know that something in that product might be harmful, which makes sense, right?

97
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,170
From a consumer rights perspective, we should, as consumers know what we're purchasing, we would think, but that's not usually how it goes.

98
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,790
So this law helps because most companies sell products in California as well as nationally, internationally.

99
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,160
So the fact that one state has this and helps them to it actually has helped the landscape over time.

100
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:05,330
It's not perfect by any means. But, you know, I think a lot of corporations don't like it for that reason, but it has made progress overall.

101
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:12,530
So it has led to many consumer products being reformulated in order to remove those toxic ingredients.

102
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,780
So what happens is, you know,

103
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:26,569
if there's a product and somebody measures so many measures of toxic chemical in that they then can sue that company and that company can be

104
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:38,240
forced to label that product to say this product exposed contains a known chemical known by the state of Maine as reproductive or carcinogen.

105
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:47,480
So a lot of companies will either do that label or in negotiations, reformulate their product to not include as much of that chemical anymore.

106
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,329
So that's that's how it goes. So this is in the news every once in a while, like Starbucks.

107
00:11:53,330 --> 00:12:00,440
I think a few years ago, they wanted to force them to put this sign on every Starbucks store and on every Starbucks product because,

108
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,190
you know, it contains acrylamide and some other chemicals, coffee, beans and things like that.

109
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,150
So so it ends up in the news quite a bit.

110
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,570
So this list, they have a group of experts that comes up with that list.

111
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,340
So it's it's pretty long list. I can find it.

112
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,649
Search it, but they updated every so often.

113
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,770
And I'll tell you, you know what the chemical is, whether it's a reproductive developmental toxin or carcinogen,

114
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:44,809
whether there are two focus areas and what year it was added to the list or taken off the list goes on and on.

115
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:51,500
So there's hundreds of chemicals on here and most of them do have supporting documentation, things like that too.

116
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:02,510
So to help interpret what's going on, so if somebody detects one of these at a level above what is considered safe for some chemicals,

117
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:12,400
they have what's called the safe harbor level. And it'll tell you how much the state of California thinks is allowable for a person to be exposed to.

118
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,990
So somebody can show that people are likely to be exposed above this level to a specific chemical.

119
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,600
That's when things start to happen, those either labeling or reformulating the product.

120
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:37,740
So that's Prop 65. But it's worth mentioning because it is kind of a big deal in the consumer product world.

121
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,030
Okay. Three questions on Prop 65. Okay.

122
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,629
So exposure considerations for consumer products, how are people exposed?

123
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,950
What are we concerned about? This can be categorized a whole bunch of different ways.

124
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:03,149
But here's one way of doing it that we have spray products, building materials, toys, food,

125
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:09,990
contact cleaning products, home maintenance, personal care and textiles will run through each these just briefly.

126
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:22,290
So Spray Products is kind of a broad category here that's more about the method of use rather than what it is actually used for, perhaps.

127
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:32,340
So this can include air freshener, spray paint spray, polyurethane foam, insulations, pesticides, hairspray, other things like that.

128
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,590
CNN Our I posted a few slides ago.

129
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:43,380
So if you think about things being sprayed, the exposure scenario might be quite different compared to other types of products, right?

130
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,650
Because it's it's purposely aerosolized as part of the use of the product.

131
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,200
So here's a list of potential chemicals of concern. None of these are exhaustive list.

132
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,880
But obviously, if you're spraying a pesticide, the pesticide active ingredient might be a concern.

133
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,650
Things that smell good. Organic solvents that might be used for cleaning products, metal components, equipment.

134
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,770
Inhalation is a big concern, but obviously if you're spraying a surface and then come into contact with that surface,

135
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,270
dermal ingestion could be important as well.

136
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,940
So I got asked a lot of questions early on in COVID because people were just spraying,

137
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,000
you know, chemicals everywhere to try to kill germs, which is like.

138
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,300
So a lot of questions on this.

139
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:43,960
And just going back to the the basics, the principles of exposure, assessment, mode of what's being applied, you know, was it being sprayed, wiped?

140
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,700
What is the active ingredients? And then what is the interaction with the people?

141
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,230
And then overall, what's the risk benefit look like?

142
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,460
So early on in COVID, it's like, you know, this thing can kill people.

143
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,310
We want to kill that. But at the same time, long term, we probably don't want to overexpose ourselves to certain types of chemicals.

144
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,440
Okay. Next category, building milk, materials and furniture.

145
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:21,019
This is a big one, especially a new construction, especially kind of like when Professor Watkins was here a couple weeks ago, new construction.

146
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:28,760
And, you know, over the past decades, construction has gotten more energy efficient, which basically means much tighter buildings.

147
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,270
And so not as much airflow. Not as much ventilation.

148
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,200
So that's where some of these can that can linger for much longer periods of time.

149
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,700
But so, you know, all kinds of different building materials. They had drywall issue, you know, ten or 15 years ago.

150
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,690
Imported drywall had certain chemicals that were toxic in them.

151
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,500
So there's wide variability depending on where the materials come from, how they're made, what they might.

152
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,290
You bet.

153
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:07,100
So the seas are a big concern as well as these other chemicals of gas and can be, you know, a short term thing to get a new piece of furniture.

154
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:13,610
You know, it smells for a little while. It goes away. However, things can off gas for quite a long time, depending on how they're used.

155
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,800
Temperature changes, things like that, semi volatile compounds.

156
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,860
Also, they're knocking off gas readily, like more volatile compounds.

157
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,500
So those can be an issue for quite, quite some time as well.

158
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:34,990
That's where you find a lot of flame retardants and phthalates and things like that or in the semi volatile range as well as pesticides.

159
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,470
Toys, obviously why we're concerned about toys, but they can be made for a lot of different things.

160
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,840
More recently, plasticizers have been a concern. So you people, you know,

161
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,450
teething objects include them in a soft plastic lot titles or have plasticizers

162
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,000
added because that makes plastics softer and so that can relate to direct exposure.

163
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,229
But other chemicals as well, and a lot of it depends on how it's used and things like that.

164
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:17,020
So this is where the Consumer Product Safety Commission has done some work and it does focus on specific items, pacifiers and other toys.

165
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:24,730
They've done some pretty intense studies trying to simulate how children might be exposed to these products, things like that.

166
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:37,280
Pretty interesting. Stuffed toys, food, contact material, plastics, containers, metal cans, coated paper or cardboard.

167
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,690
So some of the same types of chemicals of concern.

168
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,990
So here, you know, people think about that plastic wrap on your sandwich.

169
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,130
Plastic is not ideal, but there's other things as well, right?

170
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,980
So coated paper and cardboard.

171
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:04,600
What are we to be concerned with there? Wired Why would paper and cardboard be coated in a food contact application?

172
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,890
Yeah. Grease resistant mixture. What did they coated with to.

173
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,880
To get this? Yeah. Uh, historically, p best components.

174
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:21,890
Who knows what they're using these days? Probably. Other people that are not as easily measured.

175
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:31,430
So that's a concern. Metal cans. Historically, you know, metals were a concern and they started lining the cans with a coating that contained BPA.

176
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,380
So a lot of people's primary exposure to or source of exposure to BPA.

177
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,980
In the past couple of decades, it's probably been through canned foods.

178
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,450
So, yeah, the list is it goes on and on.

179
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:53,070
So food contact can be interesting as well because it can vary depending on the type of food it's in contact with in those conditions.

180
00:19:53,070 --> 00:20:04,820
So he might help with the migration as well as things like moisture or other things that are inherent to the type of food package.

181
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:13,340
So there's a lot there's a lot there. Cleaning and home maintenance product products.

182
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:21,220
This is a big list. You know, you have whole rows of of products at the store dedicated to this kind of thing.

183
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:27,790
So, you know, cleaners, different types of cleaners, disinfectants, like I mentioned earlier.

184
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,460
Polishes waxes, paints that he services, which is pest pesticides again.

185
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:42,050
Yeah. Knowing what you know about all these products, what we're dealing with here, does your household use precaution?

186
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,500
You're just going to dive right into the air?

187
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:56,290
Oh, no, I'm not. I try to get something that that says natural, which, you know, that can be a misleading term.

188
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,139
So there's a few a few of those types of products out there. I'm blanking on on brand names right now.

189
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,430
But, you know, try to do the best I can for a while.

190
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:13,460
We're making our own cleaner based on. Recipes we found but then got lazy.

191
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:20,600
So, you know, we try, but it's hard to navigate, you know, even for people who are educated and it's hard to navigate as a consumer for sure.

192
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,260
So there's a whole host of different chemicals that might be in any combination of these.

193
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,830
So the thing to think about here from an exposure scenario perspective is the cleaning products, the everyday stuff.

194
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,520
Those tend to be, you know, by now less toxic.

195
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:45,840
By and large. But you have to think about the frequency of exposure right in the mag and the duration.

196
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,330
That would lead to more magnitude, whereas things used for maintenance.

197
00:21:52,410 --> 00:22:02,760
Think of pesticide applications in the home. Varnishes, Lacquers paints, paint, strippers, things like that.

198
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,840
Those tend to have more toxic chemicals, but might be used more infrequently.

199
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:12,780
So then you have that toxicity variables higher, and so it changes the risk profile of it.

200
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,210
So it's an interesting set of products to think about.

201
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:26,940
And then the way it's used in its use of purpose is to determined to some degree how people are exposed as well.

202
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,100
Personal care products. So this is a long list of things as well.

203
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,060
But their social cues, etc. Here we have parabens, phthalates.

204
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,300
Other antimicrobials, fluxes, some heavy metals.

205
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,780
I just saw an article today about. Medals and certain types of skin creams.

206
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,160
Uh, dermal absorption, of course, is going to be a main concern.

207
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,630
But again, how the product is applied can determine whether inhalation or ingestion might also be of concern.

208
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,610
Some years ago, they were detecting the lead and a lot of different types of lipstick.

209
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:20,530
So there you have maybe not so much inhalation, but potentially a lot of ingestion just by the intended use.

210
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:31,210
So these can be kind of complicated when you get to thinking about the actual human exposure because you might have competing things going on.

211
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,040
So something that is applied to the skin.

212
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:42,160
Is it going to get through the skin before it evaporates or you're going to have evaporation and maybe more inhalation before the dermal absorption?

213
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,329
So you might have more for us to think about and then how that might look.

214
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,460
That time profile might change depending on some of the chemical properties as well.

215
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:06,980
Here's a partial list and just kind of probably fairly intuitive about different types of products would rather of exposure may be of

216
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:16,520
concern and you know timing the time profile as well can be important with whether it's something that you rinse off like a shampoo.

217
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,389
They also have you know, those leave-in shampoos would be a different exposure.

218
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,370
Profile lotion is a big one because it's meant to stay there for a long time.

219
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,069
So that gives the more time to it to penetrate.

220
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:35,270
So why again, as with all of these categories, we want to think about from an exposure mechanism point of view.

221
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,240
Textiles. This one gets overlooked a lot, I think, because they're just everywhere.

222
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,930
I mean, the clothes we wear, which is what a lot of people think of with textiles,

223
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:57,430
but you also have like furniture, covers, carpeting, a whole lot of different things that are included here.

224
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,270
So you have various dyes, PE, fats, again, where people are so used in textiles, the Scotchgard, right?

225
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:10,360
So people would use those. So that might be Gore-Tex because one of the brands that used.

226
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,510
Large amounts of PBS as well to protect from the elements from other small projects.

227
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,860
People detected formaldehyde in bed sheets. They're asking me, so pose a problem.

228
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,380
Well, let's calculate this out. You know, maybe.

229
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,530
So there's a lot to think about there.

230
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:42,750
But just the the amount of textiles is a big player here as far as population wide exposure.

231
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,680
And then, of course, the roads and pathways will depend on the individual scenario.

232
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,060
Anybody know what? Silver, nano, nano silver.

233
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,130
When that's used in textiles. Yeah.

234
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,040
It's an antimicrobial which is the advertises for fighting for.

235
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:18,270
I have a friend who's a surgeon is they use a lot of silver nano materials and surgical equipment as well to protect microbial property.

236
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,590
But again, we don't really know much about it from a toxicology perspective.

237
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,170
So here's kind of a more specialized concern, recycled materials.

238
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,810
So obviously, recycling is good and something we really need to figure out how to do more of.

239
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:42,720
But when things are recycled, it might be also reintroducing hazardous chemicals depending on how things are used.

240
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:51,420
So, you know, a big example would be e-waste, e-waste or the only electronics we use and get rid of way too quickly.

241
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:58,960
They end up somewhere that are processed, usually in ways that probably aren't using good occupational health and safety methods,

242
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,010
but then they might find their way back into another product.

243
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:08,140
And if it's put into another product or a component of that product that's not known to contain that chemical,

244
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,610
you can have a lot of unintended consequences related to exposure.

245
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,410
Same with, you know, recycling my pizza boxes.

246
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,820
You know, that had past chemicals and it gets recycled paper.

247
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:29,230
The new paper is used in we don't know where or how vinyl flooring as well know other types of chemicals.

248
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,230
When I get asked about a lot is, you know, the recycled tires on sports fields turf.

249
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,290
Playgrounds. Yeah.

250
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:49,050
So it's a big. The other recycled materials you guys think of that might be of concern chemically.

251
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:55,980
And I would say electronics, not necessarily like the electronic components, but like the plastic components often of like flame retardant.

252
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:05,159
TerraCycle Another thing that's a very good example because it gets warm and, you know, for that product safety even contains flame retardants.

253
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,230
But then, you know, if it's put into a different plastic, that might be a contact with food or something that.

254
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:20,510
Okay. So that's sort of trying to break down categorically how to think about this.

255
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,990
So let's move to how do we assess exposure.

256
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,470
So like we talked about in occupational settings and you can think of this as a near field versus far field form.

257
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,860
In this case, we're calling it an environmental mediated solution.

258
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,620
So the near-field is what I tend to think about a lot is the user of the product and the people around them.

259
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:47,000
What's the exposure there? But Professor Julia and others, they tend to think about it more from an environmental mediated.

260
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,200
So, you know, the 350 million people in the United States,

261
00:28:51,200 --> 00:29:00,500
how much of this product is being used and put out there and where does it go and how it might it get back into the population from indirect exposure?

262
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:07,040
So two different ways to think about this, to get at this.

263
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,590
You can take measurements that could be a direct monitoring chemical or at least tests for biomarkers.

264
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:18,110
So we talked quite a bit about the first and the third one. I'll talk a little bit about the second one in a minute.

265
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,160
Or we could do model like we've talked about what this could be.

266
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:31,850
So this falls into the different categories of modeling as the other environmental modeling we do for empirical, most mechanistic or probabilistic.

267
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,500
So this is from the reading that was assigned. I'm sure you all did it right.

268
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,290
Yeah. You guys got much else going on, right?

269
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:49,670
So this is Professor Julia was a coauthor on this again, thinking more on the near field in environmental mediated.

270
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,700
But here they just used a couple of here.

271
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:59,930
They're talking on an article such as like a couch cushion or something, and then thinking about the pathways and the route of exposure.

272
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:07,370
Here they're talking about appliances, which might be, you know, more environmental mediated, like a washer dryer, dishwasher,

273
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,960
things like that has a process and then has an effluent going out into the environment,

274
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,010
whereas the person using it, you know, they might be exposed to some of that.

275
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:23,640
That might be more environmentally mediated. But you could do this with any type of consumer product here listed.

276
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:30,259
How is it getting it? What are the pathways for the near field and where where the pathways that it could be adopt in

277
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,530
the environment and maybe become an exposure issue later without hurt throughout its lifecycle.

278
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,710
So, John, a lot a lot to think about. Okay.

279
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:50,110
So monetary food is directly one way to do it as just take the product,

280
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:56,590
send it to a lab or take it into your lab and measure how much of a chemical concern is in the product.

281
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,709
Right? So you can do this for various matrix types.

282
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:10,570
It can be complicated if it's a type of sample the labs aren't used to working with, you know, various food items, liquids that are easy.

283
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:19,060
But if you get into like stirring because solids and things like that, you have to kind of the protocol for getting that into a measurable form.

284
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,930
This can be costly, especially the method doesn't exist. Coming up with a method.

285
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:38,080
So that's why it's probably not done often. There are national programs for certain types of foods where they do this on a sampling basis, USDA.

286
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:47,090
But in general might be more specialized. Let's see.

287
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:55,340
So if you do this method, if you're talking about a food item. So I mentioned something like acrylamide acrylamide in potato chips.

288
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,790
Taking that kernel acrylamide content in a potato chip and coming up with an estimate for exposure is pretty easy, right?

289
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:09,530
Just think about how much potato chip does a person consume reasonably and then multiply the concentration and there you have a potential exposure.

290
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:15,080
But for things that are not strictly ingested, it gets much more complicated than you might imagine.

291
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,810
How does that content relate to what's getting into the pathway of of cancer and which route becomes much more complex?

292
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:33,440
So for that, you need a lot more information or assumptions, things like migration between the product and its surroundings.

293
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:41,660
How much contact between the product and the person? Various exposure factors like we've talked about social factors, hand in mouth,

294
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,720
for example, things like that where people spend their time and then the whole.

295
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:57,350
Dermal, as we've talked about, it can be very complicated as far as permutations or options and things like that, but other pathways as well.

296
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,080
Can you assume 100% is being absorbed if it's ingested, etc.?

297
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,990
So these are just some of the things you need to think about if you're going with the bulk.

298
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,380
If you're getting away from the product a little bit, you can do personal exposure monitoring.

299
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:21,160
But then if that's all you're doing, you don't know may not know exactly that that product is the only source of that chemical.

300
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:27,610
Right. You could have other sources. Same with indoor and our monitoring area of monitoring.

301
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,710
So a combination is usually the best way to go if it's feasible, but it's not always feasible.

302
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:46,040
So again, thinking about exposure related to a product similar kind of pathway exercise that we did way early in the semester,

303
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,889
we talked about, you know, hazardous waste sites, agricultural drift or something like that.

304
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,010
But you could do this as well with some sort of consumer product.

305
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,420
Then again, think about the various pathways and environmental media that might make its way

306
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,340
into in addition to direct application on to the person you're talking about,

307
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,669
personal care products. And then you have these triangles.

308
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:16,790
These grades are things that you might need to try to measure or might be able to glean from the scientific literature or from chemical properties.

309
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:26,470
What's known about chemicals, things like that. So we had both tests.

310
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,280
A chemical where these tests might hit you one step further if it's something that you don't know.

311
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,910
See, you measure cadmium in a toy,

312
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:44,200
and you don't know if that cadmium is going to stay in that toy or if it's going to migrate out through various usage.

313
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,730
So one way to to get the next step would be to do a chemical release test.

314
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:55,990
So this is taken a step further from the book test going under some sort of condition to see, you know,

315
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,470
if it's something that might be volatile or somebody voluntarily put in a chamber,

316
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,830
see how much is in the air in that chamber under various conditions.

317
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:13,300
Another common thing is to simmer, setting water or solvent to try to mimic, you know, if it got wet, is it going to release more of the the chemical.

318
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:19,330
White methods kind of like we talked about with surface sampling. But the surface here is the the product itself.

319
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,260
And then there's a lot of. Ways to test.

320
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:31,270
Transfer to food. So we talk about food properties and things like that can be important.

321
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:38,560
Temperature. You can test that with context. Say a cup for material used to make a cup of.

322
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:46,300
There's another project, a film led in ceramics that were used for coffee mugs.

323
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,650
So it's like this. And another one is the human skin.

324
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:59,950
So products that the human skin is direct contact with, how much of that chemical from the test would get to the skin transferred to the skin.

325
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:06,610
So for that, they used either real sweat or simulated sweat and also try to mimic like the stickiness of fingers.

326
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:12,219
So it gets kind of interesting to try to mimic the conditions of exposure to see

327
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,610
how much of the chemical might make its way through the product to the person.

328
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,820
But again, you can see how involved it might be just from one chemical in one scenario.

329
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,520
So sometimes it's not feasible to get it to this level of detail, but.

330
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:37,550
But that you might be able to. And then we have biomarkers since the third approach, which we talked about last time.

331
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:45,920
Again, one limitations of biomarkers, though, is you don't know where it's coming from source pathway unless you have other measurements.

332
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:54,320
So ideally, again, you'd have a bulk measurement, some sort of transfer measurement, and then perhaps a personal measurement and then a biomarker.

333
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,190
This is just an example. We did Puerto Rico study. We're looking at environmental phenols.

334
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:08,320
So that includes bisphenol A, similar phenols and parabens.

335
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,840
And here we found levels of carbon.

336
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,530
Who here has heard of trickle? Sam who here has heard of trickle carbon?

337
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,680
Okay, Woolworths. Usually more people have heard of this,

338
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:32,440
but it's an anti-microbial triclosan which was used in a lot of trans sandwich use and a lot of liquid soaps and toothpaste,

339
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,999
whereas trickle carbon is more in solid soaps bars.

340
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,530
And so anyway, we found levels of triple carbon in our population was like 30 times higher than in Heinz.

341
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,379
We talked about Heinz last time, the general population levels, and we're like, What's going on here?

342
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,040
That's really weird.

343
00:37:51,850 --> 00:38:00,790
So then we our questionnaires, we said, you know, we asked, what kind of products are you using in the previous 24 hours, what the samples collected?

344
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,590
And then we also asked about brands.

345
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:13,480
And in this paper, I didn't want to get sued, so we didn't name the brands, but we did find that certain popular brands were likely the culprit.

346
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:19,270
And luckily, because it is an antimicrobial, it has to be labeled on the product.

347
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,319
So we were able to trace that back to a certain brand so far.

348
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,610
So it's more commonly used down there. So.

349
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,190
That was an interesting little, little side project. Okay.

350
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:40,620
So that's measurement. We've got modeling and there's a lot of different models already developed out there.

351
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,980
So one way I've done it is kind of making up your own model based on what you know about what you have access to,

352
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:53,430
bulk sampling, whatever, some of the transfer mechanisms, dermal absorption and things like that.

353
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,650
Or you can enter it into one of these premade exposure models that links to the first two there.

354
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,990
I can find links to the other ones, but the first ones should each t.

355
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,780
It's more based on chemical properties.

356
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,669
It's called a compartmental queue gas model, which basically talks about the likelihood of that chemical ending up in certain compartments,

357
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,380
like, you know, in the dust, in the air, various sinks within that space.

358
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,590
Cons Expo is more about trying to get consumer exposures through various routes,

359
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,740
and there's things that have a strengths limitations as with anything.

360
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:37,709
But I believe there are a few but interested in looking into that. Then you have a few other ones exposed at frame.

361
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:43,290
One is more of a high throughput screening method or release.

362
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,480
So talking about properties of a product, what's the likelihood that organic chemicals release from it?

363
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:56,370
And then finally, this framework, again, this is more on the environmentally mediated or what they call intake fraction.

364
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:05,850
You can get something that professor is will is out with how much of that product that's used actually ends up back into people on a population level.

365
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,120
So that's just some examples of exposure models.

366
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,470
Like I said, some of these prepackaged ones might be useful, but you also want to have a critical guide to what it might be missing.

367
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,380
All right. Any questions on that? So let's switch gears slightly here.

368
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:31,320
Here's an emerging topic, microplastics. Take a minute to talk about.

369
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,800
Feel free to chime in if you guys have looked into this or some project on this.

370
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,420
But, you know, I've been thinking about this for a while.

371
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:52,330
This was the whole issue of National Geographic a few years ago, and I just thought the graphics were insane.

372
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:58,420
But then, you know, you can find these in anywhere, just that from 1952, 2015.

373
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,870
This is a slight increase in plastics production.

374
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,379
Right. So exponential. And this broke it down.

375
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,150
And I liked how they broke it down by different types of uses for the plastic.

376
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,340
So you have packaging and with that they relate it to.

377
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,120
The useful life, useful life output of the plastics or packaging.

378
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,660
It's a kind of like one and done a lot of times you use it, you throw it away.

379
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:36,069
That's not very good for for the planet. But look how how much of that is the biggest portion of plastic that is used in have consumer products more

380
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:44,290
generally might be a more long lasting plastic you over talking maybe your electronics and things textiles,

381
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:50,409
electrical transportation building and construction that stays around longer you get more used life you so

382
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:56,110
that's well easier to swallow than you know some of these other ones that are just make it and throw it away.

383
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,780
So obviously we have a lot of plastic. There's more plastic being generated than we can handle.

384
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,520
And the same as you had some of these cool pictures and just plastic everywhere.

385
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:13,030
This is sort of an artistic rendition, written rendition of what was taken out of a normal albatrosses stomach.

386
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:19,180
Here's the albatross. They fly around, you know, huge distances, try to get food when they can,

387
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:26,229
unfortunately walk and pick up plastic that can't be digested and and leads to their demise.

388
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:31,210
But just yet a lot of I can go on and on but I want.

389
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:38,260
But anyway how does that relate to chemical exposures? Let's bring it back to this concern of microplastics.

390
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,110
So this is defined as plastic pieces, less than five millimeters in diameter.

391
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:54,040
So this could be beads, fragments, fibers, etc. So some of this can be manufactured that way, could be small or it forms when it's been broken down,

392
00:42:54,250 --> 00:43:00,550
when it's exposed to the environment or processes. And this can be made up of a lot of different types of polymers.

393
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:10,300
So not all plastic is the same. You have different plastic formulations and if that wasn't bad enough, they're also now talking about Nanoplastics.

394
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,960
So less than one micrometer in diameter, putting in a shoe.

395
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,879
So this relates to, you know, think about fiber.

396
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,550
We talked about fibers earlier in the semester. With with asbestos, fiberglass, things like that.

397
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:33,500
You have to have the same thing with plastics here. They keep finding these everywhere.

398
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,810
So this is a partial list. And every week or so I see a new paper where they've measured in something else.

399
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:50,840
So we're likely being exposed. And they also have found that it can bind to pathogens and other versus narcotics.

400
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:57,090
So that might be another avenue that those can get into to prevent toxicity.

401
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,230
We don't know that much still about it.

402
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:06,139
Most studies so far have been done in small marine organisms because that's where they're finding a lot of microplastics.

403
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:17,010
So the plankton try to eat the microplastic and just totally gets caught and they die and they're the food source of other marine life.

404
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,130
And then so it has impacts on the food chain.

405
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:29,510
Studies of mammals are becoming greater in number but know liver function there's been there was a recent study on placenta

406
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:38,810
found in placenta and what's concerning and something we want to think about based on what we've learned in this class is,

407
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,600
you know, size, dependent manner. So kind of like we talk about aerosols and breathing.

408
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,460
Same thing, my same types of issues, my collaboration with micro nanoplastics and where they might be distributed throughout the body.

409
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,590
So it's something that we've got as well. Still no effort studies.

410
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:06,450
This is a graphic I like just because it talks about where kind of small text somebody with this later in

411
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:15,090
life put different sources of micro-plastics and kind of how they might travel through the environment.

412
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:29,080
So when we think about this. That's a link to a conversation article I wrote a few years ago and it is interesting.

413
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,310
But so some of the questions, you know, if we want to take this from.

414
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,510
We know what's out there, we might be exposed.

415
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:44,400
How do we study that with regards to health effects. So you know watch who's exposed, who has higher levels of exposure.

416
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,040
How are they being exposed? How can we estimate the exposure?

417
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:57,400
From a quantitative perspective or even from a epidemiology perspective of categorizing people on low exposure, this is a big one.

418
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:04,330
Again, relevant to things we talked about earlier in the class is that the actual size and shape of the microplastic that's making it toxic,

419
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:13,240
kind of like with some of the aerosols or is it the chemical composition of the of the plastic and then the attachment

420
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:20,229
concern and then some other questions of exposure assessment that we talked about is that cumulative exposure,

421
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:28,390
average exposure of people that might be. And yet so like I said, there's articles like this all the time.

422
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:33,940
They're usually poorly designed, very small studies where they find it varies.

423
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,320
So, you know, I'm not ready to design a study based on that biomarker yet.

424
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,380
Let's say volunteers, I don't know in the lab and it picks up.

425
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,680
Okay, I'll wait for a better biomarker. Okay.

426
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,790
So I mentioned different types of polymers.

427
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,590
There's some listing of the different some of the different types of polymers and what they're found in.

428
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:01,670
So you're talking about a wide range of different chemical makeup and things like that.

429
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,300
And a lot of them have additives. So here's an example of some additives that you might find in plastic.

430
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,520
So these are chemical classes of concern that, you know, might stem from plastics, but other things as well.

431
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:19,360
So this is kind of a Segway. Any questions or comments on microplastics?

432
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,240
They freak everybody out? Yeah. You may be concerned about microplastics.

433
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:34,290
You better not concerned about microplastics. Anybody waiting to see if they should be concerned about.

434
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,720
Her. All I do know is we will make too much plastic.

435
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:48,320
That's what. A better way to recycle it. All right, so phthalates are platinum.

436
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:56,140
I mention them as a plasticizer. So, like PDC, they'll add it to think about a PVC pipe for plumbing and very rigid.

437
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,700
But they also use PPC for, like, a child's pacifier, very soft.

438
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:08,670
And that's because they add plasticizers. And that means they're one of the most common types of the less used bicycles.

439
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,240
I mentioned polycarbonate. It's more rigid plastic and clear.

440
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:19,030
So eyeglasses, things like that, like flame retardants and antimicrobials.

441
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:24,760
So this part of the lecture, I just going to go through some of these main classes and talk about why we're

442
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,530
concerned about them and how we're exposed and how we might reduce exposure.

443
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:36,220
You guys are going to go kind of fast. So phthalates found in a lot of different things.

444
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,700
Ranging from a lot of those categories we talk about beginning you can find that so it's it's kind

445
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,540
of tough to get a grasp of and that kind of also informs how you might be able to measure it.

446
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:49,820
You know,

447
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:57,000
do you want to go with the overall exposure dose for the biomarker or are you concerned that you're concerned about the aspect of this thing?

448
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:01,560
Probably take a different approach to measuring because a biomarker is going to pick up all kinds of different sources.

449
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:13,530
Range of health effects of phthalates. So far, a lot of them are endocrine mediated because they're more anti energetic.

450
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,990
But we also found things dogs, their stress, adverse pregnancy outcomes, things like that.

451
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:26,520
Again, a lot of different types of several dozen different types of phthalates used for different things.

452
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,820
So it's it's kind of a. Alphabet soup.

453
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,399
They're trying to tease that apart. Another thing we're dealing with, so this is from just our Puerto Rico study.

454
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:45,790
Over a course of eight years or something, we do see a declining trend or fortunately in some of the more toxic balance.

455
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:50,120
So diet, flexibility. These ones are contemplative diet.

456
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:56,510
So that's one of the ones that's been shown to be a reproductive toxicant in many, many studies.

457
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,950
We are seeing it decline over time gradually. So that's good.

458
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:07,800
And so and BP. It's a bad actor.

459
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,940
Oh, no, not quite. But anyway, so.

460
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,330
So that's good. But then we see this one.

461
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:21,790
We just started measuring this terephthalate. Is it being used as a replacement for the diet?

462
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:26,280
Diet flexibility. The problem is we don't know.

463
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:32,820
There's probably toxicology studies on this one. So we have to track that and then try to start over again.

464
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:39,840
So this is you might see some people call this the Whac-A-Mole approach to chemical regulation.

465
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:48,780
This is in the in the trenches. So just keep keep figuring out what the reason it's done and try to save this.

466
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,090
So if somebody asked you, how can I reduce my exposure to phthalates, you say, well, it's very difficult.

467
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,330
Hopefully they come up with better laws to regulate it, so it's not used as much.

468
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,350
But beyond that, you know, you can try some of these things.

469
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,080
But again, there is so many different things that it's not always guaranteed to be super popular.

470
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:15,860
So. Any questions on? Comment.

471
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:22,550
Comment? Yeah, sure. Regarding your Whac-A-Mole, the road map gets more Whac-A-Mole.

472
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,889
It is a game like an arcade where the little critter pops up and you hammer it.

473
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:31,969
And I'm like, You know what? If we're here,

474
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,530
I'll team up with a chemists and try to predict what they might replace it with and then

475
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:42,080
do kind of an on target approach using using what you think they may replace it with,

476
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,060
like a database? Yeah, that would be great.

477
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:51,530
I'm not smart enough to know what they're going to use, but yeah, based on properties of a chemical and what they might have access to.

478
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:59,120
Yeah, maybe. And then, you know, a lot of the toxicology sites are very expensive.

479
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:06,590
So they do have high throughput. High throughput screening is becoming more common when we look at specific reactions and things or.

480
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:14,340
Point to structure, activity, relationships, things like that. So yeah, in that realm, there's hopefully there's people kind of working on that.

481
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:25,459
But yeah, you don't know why it's proprietary and we don't find out until we're back end like because unless it's a pesticide or a anti-microbial,

482
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,750
you don't have to label products.

483
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:36,200
So that's another reason this is so complicated and so hard as a consumer to reduce your exposure unless it specifically says belly free,

484
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:46,100
which we've measured phthalates in products, we will tell you, because they might be referring to one phthalate and not other phthalates.

485
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,860
Right. So that makes it difficult. So we don't know what's in proximity to.

486
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,800
It wasn't listed as pesticide. But yeah, that's a good idea.

487
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:04,569
I would just add a lot of like state policies or trying to move toward using like a class approach and banning

488
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:10,480
like the class of that size or class of like PBS or something to try to get around the one at a time.

489
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,520
Right. Right. This institution issue. Right.

490
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:24,650
Which hopefully would make on the design side a lot more care taken to not include one chemical within a class that's known to be.

491
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:36,510
Toxic. Yeah. And that's been suggested at the national level, but probably not anytime soon in the U.S. But other countries might go pull it off.

492
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:47,880
Best was already mentioned. Canned foods, polycarbonate thermal paper receipts.

493
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,130
I don't know. This became a big deal a few years ago, so I think a lot of companies switched out.

494
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,210
Again, I not too worried, but there are some studies measuring high levels and receipts and then yeah,

495
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,540
that director will contact some dental applications.

496
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,890
But a lot of studies have shown that that may not be a big source of exposure.

497
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,340
There might be more control groups.

498
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:20,040
So again, similar types of effects. Endocrine disruption, again, can be difficult because of labeling requirements.

499
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:28,950
They've taken BPA out of a lot of things. But guess what? They're now using BPA for BPA, US, things like that.

500
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,100
So, you know, it gets of.

501
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,070
Those are just some things people might want to try. Flame retardants.

502
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:47,830
We've mentioned a little bit throughout the course. These also are everywhere, and this includes a range of different chemical classes.

503
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:58,900
The PBDEs we've mentioned, there's also phosphate flame retardants and some others like tbe BPA brominated algae.

504
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:04,450
So they kind of combine great properties of multiple classes.

505
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:12,670
Health effects. Thyroid was a big one early on for a few years, and then thyroid is related to child neurodevelopment.

506
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:23,230
But then we also see reproductive immune effects and uh, so few kids, they saw this trend over time.

507
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:30,190
I showed last time, um, then people really started focusing on it, so then phased out.

508
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,060
So again, the U.S. I'm a pick on the U.S. again.

509
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,050
Um, they have a really hard time banning things. So even with PBS as well, it's a phase out.

510
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,530
It's, it's an agreement they reached with the manufacturers to face down.

511
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,559
So that takes a while. That means they don't have to actively go in and retrieve anything.

512
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,540
They kind of sell what they have and it's out there that they would have killed it.

513
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,830
So again, the replacement emission of phosphates, they're not as persistent environment.

514
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:04,420
They're being used more, but have their own potential health effects.

515
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:13,440
Some general guidance that people try and want to try to reduce their personal exposure.

516
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:20,190
Well, you know, some basic hygiene stuff. You know, different types of products.

517
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:24,990
And this might get at the news, but not the other ones that are being used more recently.

518
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:30,000
And some other guidance there.

519
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:38,230
Be fast. You guys are well versed in fast bowling at this point, but there's all kinds of.

520
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:46,120
Good science out there. The big one that's led to a lot of environmental contamination is the firefighting foam.

521
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:55,560
So they use it a lot of airports. Military bases, and a lot of it is from just running drills.

522
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,430
They weren't even putting out real fires. That's kind of a shame.

523
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,729
There's. Anybody from Michigan up by the armory around the Fort Smith Air Force Base.

524
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:15,230
That's where in Michigan, one of the hotspots that was first identified. I'm not from there, but I did the first round of research there.

525
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:20,870
Oh, okay. Yeah, we collected the samples. Yeah. They reached out to me very early on.

526
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,620
A guy from the state, he was very concerned, was getting no traction at the state.

527
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:29,570
So he's trying to get some of us to to do some work up there.

528
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:35,870
But, yeah, they had super high levels in the surrounding ponds and how to do it, no fish warning and all that.

529
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:45,200
Some of the highest levels still found in fish are from that area. So that was really triggered a lot of the Michigan action on people's.

530
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,660
Still being studied a lot. But again, a range of potential health effects.

531
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,459
Obviously the state of Michigan. Now they start testing it more.

532
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:03,720
So now they realize it's everywhere this year and never even has no fish advisory.

533
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:11,860
So yeah, all you got to do is limit your contact with carpet, furniture, cookware, phone, food, packaging, etc.

534
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,380
Right. Easier said than done. Right. So again, long term,

535
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,459
it's good to be able to have effective policy that draws upon the science rather

536
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,290
than trying to get individuals to be educated enough to know how to do this,

537
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:31,650
especially when things aren't related. You have water and fish potential as well.

538
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,510
Other wild game deer, things like that.

539
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,250
So. UV filters.

540
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:46,300
This is a tricky one. So some of Benzophenone three,

541
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:56,020
sometimes oxybenzone is in a lot of sunscreens and various makeups that have movie or lotions that advertise UV protection.

542
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:06,040
They usually have some sort of TV screen in there, and this is one of the more common ones, and it's been detected.

543
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,690
This one's not as well studied, but there are some indications of toxicity.

544
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,370
This is where it gets tricky because you don't want to tell people not to wear sunscreen.

545
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:20,230
Right. And then you don't know if some of those other sunscreens have a different active ingredient.

546
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,050
You have to really dig into the science on whether they're better for you.

547
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:29,680
So, you know, my best advice for people is to, you know, not go on the sun.

548
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:35,590
You don't have to wear shaded clothing, things like that.

549
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:43,450
But yeah, we really need more work on giving actual advice from people who know what they're talking about.

550
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:49,270
On how to protect yourself from UVA. Well, not adding that toxic chemicals yourself.

551
00:59:51,150 --> 01:00:00,240
What about mineral sunscreens? What kind of mineral are zinc oxide or treated on entertainment here?

552
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:06,210
Are those more of a sunblock? People don't like sunblock if it's like it's an actual physical barrier.

553
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:13,050
Well, everyone on the Face Beach movie. Yeah.

554
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:19,460
So again, my initial reaction is they probably would be better.

555
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,879
But again, I'd have to look into the what the toxic tax quality says.

556
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,840
I don't know that. So I'm not comfortable making that declaration for you.

557
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,350
You know, it's a service, but I don't know you.

558
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:43,010
Yeah. You mentioned anti microbial strength and carbon impairment.

559
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:50,330
So that figure I showed you from Puerto Rico, this is brand eight right here, pro-tax.

560
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:55,400
And what's ironic is the name of our cove where we started down there is Protect.

561
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:01,240
So it's actually a so-called protects that was the source of a lot of their carbon.

562
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:12,170
Fortunately for triclosan and type of carbon in the U.S., the FDA finally said, you can't use it in these products.

563
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,120
And it wasn't based on none of the official language talks about health effects it's based on.

564
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,170
They said the producers were unable to show efficacy,

565
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,870
that it was actually an effective additive to their product, but it wasn't based on health concerns.

566
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:36,019
There was one toothpaste that was still approved for critical Sam. So you have to check your your shelf when you're buying it.

567
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:43,300
And if it still doesn't run. We talked about makeup's obviously the dermal application there.

568
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:49,710
Here's a weird one. So a lot of trail mix. And one day I looked at the package.

569
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,200
This was a long time ago and it was from like a myer brand.

570
01:01:53,470 --> 01:02:00,340
Next I had a pair of it in the ingredient list because of because it is an antimicrobial has to be registered like a pesticide.

571
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:08,720
So that's the one thing we have working for us on these is the. So since then there is no permanent brand.

572
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:16,330
Next that I've seen lately. But you never know. They change their their supplier, so keep an eye out.

573
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:26,800
But it is used in food sometimes. As a preservative again range of a lot of potential and occurring mediated stuff.

574
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:35,440
So recent action, you should see us try to interpret carbon from our mind by monitoring of status and trends of population.

575
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,510
Why we should be seeing a decline than parabens. Again, you can actually look at the labels.

576
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:50,940
It'll tell you. I have a whole thing on pesticides and how at high time I could talk about pesticides for four days, but it won't.

577
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:59,919
Here's another DDT. Ladies knows what, knows what's good about it, but it's got a picture of a baby.

578
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,520
And DDT have probably seen pictures like this.

579
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,980
The beach there did the community spraying DDT,

580
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:14,380
but more recently that DDT is it used except in malaria areas and it's usually used in a much more controlled manner.

581
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:19,780
A lot of exposure studies have shown, you know, if used properly, it can be done effectively.

582
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:28,450
But nowadays we have different chemicals, you know, people just spraying them all willy nilly because environment storage must be fine, right?

583
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:34,629
Well, I don't know. So you go to the store. You know, it's could be Walmart, Home Depot or whatever.

584
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:40,000
You see this whole shelf of what is actually probably very toxic chemicals.

585
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:44,320
But you can buy it, you know, that you want and take it home to whoever you want with it.

586
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:51,190
Well, crazy. But pesticides in general, it's a very broad definition.

587
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:57,280
So that's why some of the antimicrobials you have to do has to go through this registration process and be labeled on the products.

588
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:03,130
But there's just so many different chemicals when somebody says pesticides.

589
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:07,960
It's a complicated question because it can be hundreds of different actual chemicals,

590
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:13,630
and they're usually broken down by some kind of categorization, usually by what it kills.

591
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,590
But some things kill everything.

592
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:27,670
And that's called a broad spectrum pesticide and can be there's some metal based ones, some arsenic based one, some that in the past have been used.

593
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:35,380
And usually they're added to something that might help its effectiveness against whatever is the target species that.

594
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:45,440
This is just showing how complicated of a picture is just to get a grasp of what the chemicals are.

595
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:50,150
So here is insecticides, herbicides, rodenticides, fungicides.

596
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,860
And then within the normal number of chemicals per grouping.

597
01:04:55,100 --> 01:05:03,950
And then they have classes of pesticides within that. So the organic warnings is what the DDT falls into in my works and some other ones.

598
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:07,940
Pyrethroids is one of the types we'll hear about next week.

599
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,980
Well, those are the most common insecticides probably used these days.

600
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:18,790
Organophosphates very controversial for the past 20 years because of this this one that I talk about.

601
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,629
But then you go, so there's 233 organophosphates.

602
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:28,250
And then within that you have their actual name. But then a lot of times they go by their treatment.

603
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:37,010
So it gets it gets confused. And sometimes they have more than one treatment and sometimes they have really scary sounding names like Buzz Kill.

604
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:43,010
Some of these are great sniper payload.

605
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:47,150
I don't know. But you get the picture. It's it's a lot of different chemicals.

606
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:51,890
Try to keep track of it. And sometimes they do.

607
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:58,249
BENNETT So, you know, again, a lot of times they don't actively go and take things off the shelf.

608
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:05,510
Here's when they were changing the rule. They had this adult forced change and got to buy it.

609
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:13,070
Now they're getting as good, a super good deal if you buy twice as much, actually cost you plenty more.

610
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:20,150
I don't know what that's about. All kinds of health effects.

611
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:26,510
That's probably where it fit. So what about how do we reduce exposure to pesticides?

612
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:34,820
This can become a problem again, potentially an environmental justice issue like, you know, who can afford to eat organic food all the time.

613
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:40,129
That's it's not easy to do. Minimize the application of pesticides at home.

614
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:43,370
That's easy for someone who doesn't have a really good problem to say. Right.

615
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:53,420
But if you're living in that, you're going to want to do something and then you know where it's being applied elsewhere.

616
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,670
Again, that's hard to do even as a trained person in this.

617
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,750
I don't know where they've sprayed pesticides. Things like that.

618
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:09,950
So a lot of push to get people to use item strategies, integrated pest management.

619
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:16,540
So this is just based on principles of trying to get at the source of why is that pests there,

620
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:24,260
how can we prevent that from occurring in the first place? So there's a lot depending on what you said here.

621
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,850
There's some basic principles to try to adhere to.

622
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,200
So, you know, mosquito season.

623
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,740
There's a lot of IPM strategies reduce standing water.

624
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:40,760
You know, don't go outside at certain times of day, things like that.

625
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:46,060
If it's weeds on crops, there's another set of strategies.

626
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:52,720
Municipalities as well hopefully adhere to this as well as like our university.

627
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,600
Hopefully they use things like centrifuges. So future research needs.

628
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,920
We just all wear protective gear all the time, right?

629
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:09,150
That's probably not feasible. So, you know, there's a lot of issues here, a lot of chemicals that happen.

630
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:12,790
So that goes all the way back to our original class period.

631
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,710
We talk about how many chemicals are out there. This is a big one.

632
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,330
Obviously, they keep replacing things, microplastics.

633
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:28,840
You're going to keep saying that into the future. Ultimately, when you get out in front of the screen, chemistry principles and design stage,

634
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:38,170
try to make chemicals and ingredients and products that are much more likely to not become a problem.

635
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:47,750
Some of these are tricky pesticides. You've filters the risk benefit builds and tricky in no justice.

636
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:53,259
So. That's the summary.

637
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,280
I'm not going to read them and instead go to resources.

638
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,559
So there's a lot of different resources out there. And I always like to talk about the phone apps.

639
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:09,880
I don't know, but I don't check these. I put these in the slides a while ago, but by my working group as a couple,

640
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:19,450
there's one where you can and they don't want where you can scan the barcode and it'll come up and tell you, you give me a score.

641
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:29,170
One of them does. Yeah, I think it should do, but it'll give it a score based on how healthy of a, you know, how bad the product might be.

642
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,000
So that can be useful for people.

643
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:41,560
Detox me is is a more general assignment spring institute again talking about different products and how to reduce exposure.

644
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,340
Good guide. This is another one where you can scan if it's still there.

645
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:53,470
Some of these come and go. I don't know. They get bought out by other companies and then turn into something else and it's as well.

646
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,670
So I don't know. It is just kind of a general.

647
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:05,140
You can find them. There's a lot of an author. It's just hard to know which ones are legitimate, which ones are maybe a little more sketchy.

648
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:11,260
But here you can scan the code, you know, bring up the product. And this is showing you the terms.

649
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:19,030
They think it's good for us, the lower score, if it's read something in there that they don't think it's good.

650
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:24,550
This is one. I don't know if this one's still current either, but you get the idea.

651
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:31,959
Similar type. So those aren't I'm not I'm not an investor in any of those companies.

652
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,140
And I don't have any thing to gain by showing you that. It's just there's a lot of those.

653
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,940
Any questions? All right.

654
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:45,750
Well, thanks for staying strong, my lectures and I'm looking forward to seeing your presentations next week.

655
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:52,930
And again, let me know if kids have questions today. Have a good rest of the week.
