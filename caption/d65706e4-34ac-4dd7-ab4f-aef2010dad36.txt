1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:07,103
Yeah, this is session again on Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:17,103
Just an fyi here

3
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:26,103
So, and my name is Joanna Kovacovitch. I work in the School of Public Health Instructional Services team. and so one of the big parts of my .

4
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:37,103
Is to support faculty. Support your Gsi and support what you're doing in the classroom with all of the tools that includes canvas.

5
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:41,103
And we have a lot of other tools you may have seen.

6
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:55,103
If you saw the email this morning, Yellow dig for interaction and discussion perusal for a sort of shared reading or shared viewing and discussing around a piece.

7
00:00:55,103 --> 00:01:03,103
Of course, content. We'll be talking about pull everywhere which in the live in class response engagement tool.

8
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:15,103
So anyway, we have a lot going on. One of my roles is to help support and get you all up and running with any of these tools that you might want to incorporate.

9
00:01:15,103 --> 00:01:23,103
Let me just say, for those on zoom I have enabled

10
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:28,103
We did So if you want to ask questions you're welcome to do so in the chat.

11
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:43,103
I have that visible that I can see any messages that come of the unmute your mic but that will get captured in the recording and I would say i'm gonna discourage the use of the zoom

12
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:53,103
race hand feature, just because, while i'm screen sharing that's a really difficult thing for me to see and I don't want to miss any of your questions

13
00:01:53,103 --> 00:02:05,103
Right. So if you are new to pinocchio and it just sort of heard that it's a thing we use in Sph. Panaco is licensed by the school of public health on a university wide tool and

14
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:17,103
it's really it I flexible video and audio recording tool also would be a video storage tool

15
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:28,103
And by flexible I mean, you can record any way you can record on a company, a desktop computer mornings from a mobile app.

16
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:48,103
There is a Web recorder now that's used Oh, actually that's outside of sph or maybe i'm doing something downstairs in the computer lab our sket don't manage those computers so of the software on there that we

17
00:02:48,103 --> 00:03:02,103
have in our classrooms. and then I wanna introduce the rep

18
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:10,103
Doesn't require as much hands on as what we're gonna do

19
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:15,103
So this is one of the things we suggest for classes.

20
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:34,103
That maybe record with zoom, and then but you want to keep those zoom recording longer than that 150 day deletion date of the universe

21
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:48,103
So that they're still encased in that canvas site, and those students would be able to access those for however long you want to designate

22
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:53,103
Like some sort of problem. Exam: they wanna go back and review that content.

23
00:03:53,103 --> 00:04:05,103
And if it was on zoom it's long ago

24
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:08,103
Jenny, will you let me know what the audio is going in and out for you?

25
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:14,103
I can switch microphones. Yeah, let me try a different one.

26
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:35,103
One moment.

27
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:39,103
I have a couple of different microphone setups here.

28
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:43,103
If you wanna let me know in the chat, if this is any better.

29
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:57,103
Oh, fantastic! Thank you So uploading existing video. If you go on site somewhere and record something with your mobile phone, you can then upload that to your course.

30
00:04:57,103 --> 00:05:06,103
We're gonna talk about student uploads We can also set up where students can also upload video content presentations.

31
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:13,103
Things like that. Panato also has some in video discussion and quiz questions.

32
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:29,103
If you want to, explore that at all So those would work well for, particularly if you have pre recorded content. and you want to, or even during your class recordings, you can indicate This is an item i'll have you go back

33
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:36,103
and use the discussion tab in Panopo to comment on

34
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:43,103
You can live Stream Panopo, so maybe in the case of you're having a guest lecture in your class.

35
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:52,103
But there's a couple of students who are out ill and they're not a to make it, and maybe you don't want to use zoom.

36
00:05:52,103 --> 00:06:02,103
The live stream is sort of a one way broadcast. They can kind of sit in and still listen in without the ability to speak back.

37
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:16,103
Share video chat that kind of thing. but it's an option, but also allows you to add auto-generated closed captions to anything you have anything You upload a record.

38
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:26,103
And then there's also the campus integration which factors heavily into the classroom recording that we're going to be talking about.

39
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:33,103
So all that say flexible video, audio

40
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:38,103
So I think we know why we record but i'll just touch on Covid.

41
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:42,103
As why we record we don't know where our all of our students are going to be on any given day.

42
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:49,103
If they test positive how long they're testing positive when they're able to return to class exposures quarantine.

43
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:56,103
We don't really know what the fall semester calls, but I also want to emphasize the support of student learning.

44
00:06:56,103 --> 00:07:07,103
So, even before Covid, we were using Panopo to record our classroom activities mainly for this purpose, and so slowly, we'll be able to kind of get back to this

45
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:21,103
More of this purpose fall 2021, the first semester we kind of came back from the pandemic to have in person classes 82 of our courses in sph utilized pinopto in some

46
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:28,103
way whether it was creating prem recorded content or recording their in classroom activities.

47
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:43,103
So it's heavily used in our school I also want to point out that in the winter semester instructional services, put out a survey to our students to asp students.

48
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,103
And we got 210 students to respond.

49
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:54,103
A 113 out of that 210 indicated that panopto was used in their course.

50
00:07:54,103 --> 00:08:03,103
In fact, it was the second most tool second, most use, tool behind zoom in our courses.

51
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:14,103
We then start up with that 113 to ask them, how often would they watch the recordings that were recorded in their class?

52
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:22,103
And all the time, and occasionally was a resounding majority.

53
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:28,103
The never is this slot right here. And then we also offered an option of like.

54
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:33,103
I would be interested in viewing recordings but my professors don't record.

55
00:08:33,103 --> 00:08:40,103
And so this is kind of the this is the pi slice that we really like to kind of bring in the fold of like.

56
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:46,103
Let's make it available and see if it helps with student learning.

57
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:52,103
We also ask them to prioritize Why, they watched the recordings.

58
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:58,103
And so, students said they would watch the recording first, because they missed class.

59
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:03,103
The second reason would be to get better understanding. to get that review.

60
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:11,103
I missed what they said on this slide I wasn't following or ahead of stick out to the bathroom, and I need to

61
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:18,103
I just need to review that a couple of times 3, for example, going back and reviewing.

62
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:26,103
In preparation for an exam. and then they're they're. Fourth reason was assigned viewing of some sort.

63
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:38,103
If I was providing videos that have been pre-recorded, asking them to watch things

64
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:44,103
I do want to make a quick note that you of Mit has a guide for recording classroom activities.

65
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:48,103
It was primarily designed around using zoom recording with zoom.

66
00:09:48,103 --> 00:10:01,103
When we were in our fully remote But I think it's still has some items that are can be helpful guides to us, such as some syllabus language that you can use about recording making your students aware and boundaries

67
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:13,103
around that And one thing they emphasize is sharing these recordings only with members of the class which Panopo is set up to do automatically because these recordings load into canvas.

68
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:22,103
They are restricted to the members of your course i'm gonna share these slides where you can access this link after the fact.

69
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:28,103
But it's on the safe computing that you missed that Edu paging.

70
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:35,103
She'd like to review or reference any of that syllabus language.

71
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:46,103
Alright. So let's look at how panopto works when you go into your canvas, sites for fall 2022.

72
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,103
If you do not have a menu item in your left hand.

73
00:10:50,103 --> 00:11:01,103
Course, menu for panopo recordings you're gonna have to manually turn it on, and you're gonna do that by going to the settings menu in your left hand.

74
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:15,103
Course, navigation, and then across the top you're going to go to the navigation tab and that first block.

75
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:32,103
That first list of items are things that are currently visible to you or your students, and the block of tools below that are all of the tools that canvas available or sph has available that are not enabled for you or your

76
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:40,103
students. So you just need to locate Panoo recordings in that really long list of tools.

77
00:11:40,103 --> 00:12:00,103
Click the 3 dots on the far right side of that and enable. that's going to place it in the top block of tools, and you can click and drag to rearrange it anywhere in that menu.

78
00:12:00,103 --> 00:12:17,103
You would like. Those are you can reorder those before you leave this tamp, though you want to scroll all the way to the bottom, and there's a save button at which point you should then see Pinocchio recordings in your course

79
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:22,103
navigation menu and then you're gonna click on it just to.

80
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:34,103
But that's going to generate a folder for you on the pinapto server a folder for your course

81
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:50,103
When you get to class, and these are in person classes we're talking about when you get to class you're gonna want to use the windows computer that's at the teacher's workstation because this computer is

82
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,103
already loaded with the Pinnaco desktop recorder.

83
00:12:54,103 --> 00:13:09,103
It has a video and microphone already connected. to it so it's ready, and then screen it's gonna panic is gonna capture the screen, which is where you you just play your course materials documents powerpoints or

84
00:13:09,103 --> 00:13:17,103
whatever Anne. Many of our classrooms have screens that offer.

85
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:27,103
Annotation. So this classroom i'm in 1655.

86
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:34,103
It has a tablet screen where you can actually draw and annotate on your slides.

87
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:39,103
Depending on what program you're using you can annotate Pdfs.

88
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:55,103
And what that does is it's gonna allow you to capture any work you do problems you work on instead of doing them on the board where your students who might be watching this later? won't may not be able to see that as

89
00:13:55,103 --> 00:14:00,103
well.

90
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:06,103
And then you are gonna have a quick reference guide in the classroom.

91
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:14,103
So let me check. I've got kind of a Stack of here it is helpful resources.

92
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:20,103
This says recording with panelo, quick reference, 1655.

93
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:24,103
So this is gonna walk you through the steps to launch the desktop recorder.

94
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:32,103
But on the back. we have updated it to make sure you get the recommended

95
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:40,103
Mainly the recommended microphone settings. So for for this zoom session I actually modified the recommended.

96
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:44,103
I deterred from the recommended, and we saw what happened.

97
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:58,103
We got sort of not great audio and I only did that because i'm trying to run pinocchio and zoom at the same time, which you will be doing in the classroom or I I don't recommend doing

98
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:08,103
that so that's a helpful reference particularly as your getting up and going, and a recording for the first time.

99
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:17,103
But that feels pretty good about staying set and so unlike an instructor who teaches before you has actually changed the settings.

100
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:30,103
It should stay pretty well, set I haven't seen issues with that in our classrooms.

101
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:37,103
My one recommendation would be to every time you launch Panocto to record your class meeting.

102
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:46,103
Launch it from your canvas site. the application is on the computer, and there's a shortcut on the desktop.

103
00:15:46,103 --> 00:15:57,103
But what we wanna prevent is the instructor That topic for you being logged in, and then your recordings are actually loading into their campus site instead of yours.

104
00:15:57,103 --> 00:16:06,103
So one way to make sure that these are all going into your account, and that you will see them in your class is to always launch from your canvas site.

105
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:24,103
So when you get into class you can wake the computer up log in and go to your canvas site first, and we're gonna walk through those steps

106
00:16:24,103 --> 00:16:34,103
I'll be gonna walk through those steps full let me let's see

107
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:37,103
I will touch briefly on the robot recorder pilot.

108
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:48,103
This would be an option in Sp classrooms, only where our it Park Department manages the computers.

109
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:57,103
This is a very much hands-off approach where you give us the time, date of your class.

110
00:16:57,103 --> 00:17:06,103
And we schedule automated start and stock. Those recordings are also gonna post directly to canvas.

111
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:12,103
A couple of things is you would not be able to use other audio video tools.

112
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:19,103
So say at the last minute on the day your classes meeting your guest speaker, can't come so you're having them over zoom.

113
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:31,103
We would need to know. So we can turn off the scheduled recording, because it's gonna try and use the same audio and video device as a computer.

114
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:36,103
And neither are gonna work. So when they can do is schedule them.

115
00:17:36,103 --> 00:17:42,103
And if you know you have guest speakers. coming in over zoom, it's really easy to say like Okay, don't record with Panopo on these dates.

116
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:50,103
Well, we could take those off and you can always manufacture the manual recording if something changes.

117
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:53,103
But the flexibility just gets a little more challenging.

118
00:17:53,103 --> 00:18:00,103
You may need to let us know if plans change and you can contact.

119
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:05,103
Let me know through sp dot instruction at you mish dot edu

120
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:12,103
I currently have it. we have it installed in the third floor.

121
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:16,103
What's your call 3 7, 5, 5 and as page one so if you teach in there?

122
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:20,103
That is actually ready to go. So I can set that up.

123
00:18:20,103 --> 00:18:23,103
Get those other classrooms you might be interested in

124
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:30,103
We could talk about getting that installed so i'm gonna jump ahead.

125
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:37,103
To how to when you get in the classroom launching the Pinocchio recording.

126
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:43,103
So i'm here i'm logged in to the canvas site.

127
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:55,103
That is the class that I'm meeting right now i'm gonna go to Panopo Recordings in my left hand Course menu

128
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:13,103
And here's my all my other previous recordings i'm gonna click the create button, and so here's my options, but not though, for windows that's what we're gonna use for this case and I mentioned

129
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:18,103
ohload media. this would be if I already created a video.

130
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:25,103
Or have a video file, I could upload that schedule a recording.

131
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:30,103
I think this is just showing, because i'm an admin so I have that ability.

132
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:40,103
But when you come into the classroom you're gonna use Panopo for windows, and again, you could always reference these steps on the quick reference guide in the classroom.

133
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:54,103
So we want panopto for windows. This should be launching automatically

134
00:19:54,103 --> 00:20:00,103
There it is open

135
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:04,103
You have to choose which folder it goes in or

136
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:10,103
So by default. it's going to select the folder of the canvas site.

137
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:14,103
You're in Are you talking about because I have multiple folders up here?

138
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:28,103
Yeah. So you won't have those by default This is a site I've been playing around with for a while, so I've kind of created little categories, If you did want to save into one of those

139
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:37,103
folders. You absolutely could, you know, if you had a folder of lectures, or and then a folder for labs things like that.

140
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:46,103
You could divide them up so and it's up here at the top.

141
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:53,103
Let me walk through that once more. so create canopto for windows.

142
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:58,103
I'm in a launch panopo and so the first time you see this?

143
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,103
It's going to give you this is the windows notification.

144
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:04,103
Are you sure you want a website opening a program on your computer? In this case?

145
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:10,103
The answer is, Yes, in fact, you can also just say yep do it every time.

146
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:16,103
Don't ask open connecto record

147
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:26,103
This is the pinnacle recorder i'm getting an error message, because by default, Panopa wants to use the meeting owl the 3 60.

148
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:34,103
Camera, but i'm currently using it for zoom so I I install the second camera

149
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:43,103
Which wouldn't this wouldn't typically be available that I saw the second camera, knowing that I needed to

150
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:49,103
So, for the most part, it's going to default to some regular settings.

151
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:59,103
And in this room it should be it would typically be the meeting out camera and the echo canceling speaker phone.

152
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:06,103
But i'm using both of those for zoom right now so i'm kind of got a demo

153
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:15,103
In most cases i'm ready to hit record right now because most of the defaults are set.

154
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:22,103
I would take a quick look at the reference guide, and make sure that the audio and video are set as they should be.

155
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:33,103
But for the most part it's going into the folder I want oops sorry the one I launched from it's by default.

156
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:43,103
It's naming itself the date and time which you can also modify It's grab the devices.

157
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:48,103
I need It's gonna capture my powerpoint and it's gonna capture my computer screen.

158
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:55,103
So that as I do different things during class it's gonna record it all.

159
00:22:55,103 --> 00:23:03,103
And i'm ready to hit record

160
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:14,103
Alright. So now I have confirmation that i'm recording, and i'm ready to go about my class.

161
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:24,103
I can pull up powerpoints and I know that's rolling

162
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:36,103
It's down here on the system tray it has the green almost recite like logo

163
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:49,103
Where I can stop it at the end of class, or pause it if we take a break

164
00:23:49,103 --> 00:24:04,103
But that's the quick and dirty of launch it from canvas just to make sure that it's going, and be your course site and hit record

165
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:12,103
So i'm gonna go ahead and hit stop it's gonna give you an opportunity to rename your session.

166
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:17,103
If you want. but again, as we know at the end of class, it's usually just like, I gotta get my stuff.

167
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:25,103
Then get out. get heard of the next thing or the next class is coming in, so I can just hit done.

168
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:36,103
These are what we didn't see because it went really fast is there was an upload step, and so it just look uploaded it.

169
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:41,103
And now i'm ready to close everything down

170
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:52,103
So here. This is my recording the top one and the list, and it says, processing.

171
00:24:52,103 --> 00:25:06,103
The processing is all done in the cloud so i'm ready to log out, and we so you see all of these other recordings here, right they always from winter semester.

172
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:14,103
You may see this in your class i'm hoping we can get them cleared out for fall.

173
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:18,103
But I do want to let you know that if I were to come in here and click view.

174
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:25,103
I wouldn't have access to view those so I just wanna put that out there that they're they're still restricted.

175
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:33,103
The access is restricted, based on these canvas sites

176
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:41,103
If you would like. you can absolutely come in here and hit the lead local.

177
00:25:41,103 --> 00:25:45,103
These are all showing because there's copies of this on this computer.

178
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:52,103
Hard drive right now. but at any time you could come in here every week and delete yours.

179
00:25:52,103 --> 00:26:00,103
But again, no one has access to those except the students in your office.

180
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:12,103
Any questions about that recording process

181
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:23,103
If i'm being really conscientious I can always hit the sign out button on my way out. that's gonna make sure that the next class that's coming in behind you doesn't get recorded to your class if they're

182
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:28,103
not following and checking their folder and launching from their own canvas site.

183
00:26:28,103 --> 00:26:44,103
But again, whatever you have time for if you ever find you're missing a recording or there's a recording in your class that doesn't belong there feel free to reach out to sp dot instruction, we can move those to

184
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:59,103
where they're supposed to be and that requires like administrative, where I can remove from one folder in place in another folder

185
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:06,103
Yes, so so the screen capture is whatever you see like.

186
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:14,103
I guess my question is, if you're using the presenter more than which screen is being captured.

187
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:21,103
So these screens are set up to be what you see up here is what's here.

188
00:27:21,103 --> 00:27:28,103
And so using presenter mode is very difficult.

189
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:33,103
With the way the screens are set up to they're basically just up here.

190
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:38,103
Image, one another

191
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:50,103
So let's go over to my record my classroom site and i'm just gonna refresh my browser

192
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:54,103
And so new recordings always appear at the top of the list.

193
00:27:54,103 --> 00:28:09,103
And because I didn't name any anything special it automatically made it the date and the time that I started because i'm the instructor. when I hover my mouse over the title of these I get several

194
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:17,103
menu items. I can modify some settings. I could modify the share.

195
00:28:17,103 --> 00:28:21,103
I can add it make some edit so we'll talk about that momentarily.

196
00:28:21,103 --> 00:28:27,103
I can see stats, so you could go through your lectures and see if anybody even watching these.

197
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:35,103
And I can do this on a recording by reporting level or up here at the whole course level.

198
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:41,103
I can see how, if anyone is actually reviewing these, and then

199
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:45,103
I can always delete so if you're doing any practice recordings.

200
00:28:45,103 --> 00:29:00,103
Know that you can always delete them so let's take a look and see when i'm a student, what this looks like

201
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:19,103
So now I have confirmation that i'm recording and I'm ready to go about my class I can pull a Powerpoint, and I know that's rolling so in the upper left corner is the video from the

202
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:25,103
webcam. In this case it was this one typically it would be the meeting.

203
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:38,103
All he in the center is my screen. If I had Powerpoints in addition, there would be an option here as well.

204
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:57,103
That would say like slides. The main difference or the different thing. I've always considered the biggest difference between recording your screen and recording powerpoints is that Panato is doing optical character recognition on your slides and

205
00:29:57,103 --> 00:30:01,103
So these chapter markers will get created based on your slide titles.

206
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:11,103
But i've noticed they've come along and they're doing optical, trying to do optical character recognition on the screen as well.

207
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:34,103
Even if i'm not doing powerpoints that it can scan. So right here, it grabbed this, even though this is playing in my browser and not in powerpoint on the computer

208
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:46,103
And that's basically kind of what students see again, because this is my recording, and i'm the instructor, I have options to download this adjust the settings.

209
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:51,103
The share the edit c analytics students won't see any of those things.

210
00:30:51,103 --> 00:31:11,103
We can talk about how you can make adjustments

211
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:15,103
I wanna touch briefly on Panopo capture.

212
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:22,103
This is the web based recorder that can be used If you're teaching in a classroom outside of Sp.

213
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:32,103
Or maybe, if you're at home doing some you know mini lecture snippets that you want students to watch before after class.

214
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:42,103
It's an easy way to record slide screen your webcam without having to go through the installation process of the desktop recorder.

215
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:57,103
Sometimes, if You're using an sph computer you may not have admin rights to install that. So if you run into any issues like that, the Web based capture tool is a great option, and that is here I go I can still go

216
00:31:57,103 --> 00:32:08,103
right to my canvas site, click the create button, and use panopo capture

217
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:21,103
So this is going to launch a in browser recorder. and the biggest thing you need to do is give your browser permission to your audio and video license.

218
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:27,103
That's probably the the biggest hurdle I would say to using This is all hitting.

219
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:39,103
Allow. Then I would be able to get which microphone. I want to record from Webcam. I wanna record from It's probably gonna grab whatever your laptop defaults are.

220
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:43,103
And then screens and apps is where you can have it.

221
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:52,103
Record your screen or you canvas site in a chrome tab or something specific.

222
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:57,103
This looks a little bit these options look a little bit like the zoom screen.

223
00:32:57,103 --> 00:33:04,103
Share option, or you can do student entire screen. and then the big red button hit record.

224
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:14,103
This is a great option. if you do. If you assign students to do recording, they can do a capture right on their computer without having to install anything.

225
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:20,103
So if there are, you know, doing Powerpoint recording generation.

226
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:36,103
This is a great option for them, so that opened up a new tab, so i'm just gonna go ahead and close that get back to

227
00:33:36,103 --> 00:33:43,103
So what are your So after class? as we talked about those recordings are going to load into your canvas site and be immediately visible to students.

228
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:55,103
So let's look at some other options. you could set up your connecto recordings folder to to Approve your recordings before they post.

229
00:33:55,103 --> 00:34:10,103
You know if you if there's anything you might want to cut out or maybe you don't want to release a recording for students to view. There is a way that you can hold, these let's look at that quickly, so I could set up

230
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:25,103
to where I need to approve all of my recordings before they're made visible to students, and I can do that at the folder level, by clicking this gear icon, and so i'm in my canvas site under

231
00:34:25,103 --> 00:34:28,103
the potato recordings, and on the right is the gear icon.

232
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:35,103
This is gonna allow me to customize how this folder works.

233
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:47,103
So this pop up has a menu on the left side, and I can go to settings

234
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:58,103
We have some sort of default settings that you're welcome to browse through the downloads are disabled by default.

235
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:08,103
So just to reinforce where that setting is the availability

236
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:22,103
And so here's where you could you could say all sessions, meaning all recordings that go in this folder are visible when approved by a publisher, meaning they're gonna load here, but not be visible to

237
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:46,103
your student there's going to be a published button next to each of your videos, or you could say never you could say i'm recording my sessions, but I only release them with certain around certain parameters but by

238
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,103
default. we have the set to immediately, so I just wanna make you aware of that.

239
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:55,103
And then sessions remain. You can put date restrictions.

240
00:35:55,103 --> 00:36:00,103
We have it set to remain forever. But you could close these off at the end of the semester.

241
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:16,103
If you'd like so depending how your course works the program

242
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:35,103
You can trim and edit just becomes important if after class. a student comes up, and you have a conversation here right by the microphone, and you realize, after that conversations over, that that was recording with Pinocchio. that's probably what

243
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:43,103
we see the most so let's go back to

244
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:57,103
The recording when I hover over that recording is an edit button

245
00:36:57,103 --> 00:37:04,103
This is gonna give me a timeline

246
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:10,103
So I have my my video. and notice I have these audio waveforms.

247
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:15,103
Oh, I really like these, because I know when i'm not talking, and when I am talking

248
00:37:15,103 --> 00:37:26,103
So what i'm trying to correct something it's really helpful when i'm in the editor it defaults into the scissor mode.

249
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:30,103
So one nice thing I can do is on both ends.

250
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:34,103
The front end, and the back end comes up with a grab.

251
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:41,103
Bar up Slider and my mouse turns into a 2 headed arrow.

252
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:56,103
I'm gonna go to the end and do the same thing. So then I can actually click and drag to tell that video where i'd like it to end.

253
00:37:56,103 --> 00:38:00,103
And then I put my mouse in the timeline.

254
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:15,103
I play it from Canada just to make sure that it's going into your course site. and then, if that's too much or not enough, I can continue to adjust by grabbing that handle and this great part when I save these

255
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:27,103
changes, that great part is going to become no longer visible to viewers

256
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:32,103
Maybe I take a break in the middle of my class and it's like 15 min, or something.

257
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:39,103
You know something extraordinary, and you don't want all the side conversations.

258
00:38:39,103 --> 00:38:46,103
So you would grab the ends to trim but in the edit part, and you probably would be able to find a break really easy cause.

259
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:52,103
Those late forms are gonna be huge because everybody's gonna be talking at the same time.

260
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:56,103
I can click my mouse anywhere and drag a selection.

261
00:38:56,103 --> 00:39:03,103
And now I have bars in the middle and that's gonna be my new edit.

262
00:39:03,103 --> 00:39:14,103
Non-grade out pieces are gonna be what plays to students

263
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:29,103
I'm gonna show you how to add captions because this is also done in the editor

264
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:48,103
So again I would click on the edit button on the recording from canvas, and once i'm in the editor, I would look at these menus over on the left hand side, and this one says, captions Unfortunately, adding these

265
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:58,103
captions is a manual step. have to come in and ask for them, you know, and like we're used to our zoom recordings just doing it for us.

266
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:11,103
The dropdown here says import countions, but if I click on it on that, Karen, it gives me an option to import automatic caption.

267
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:28,103
So if I click that it's gonna insert that automated transcript similar to weight, the way zoom doesn't automate and transcript, you can scan through and see if there's anything that needs to be changed

268
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:41,103
if you're using some terms it may highlight some things it's this it's under underlined recycle, and when I have my mouse over it it says low confidence where it's not sure it got

269
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:48,103
that one right? so I could listen to it. and pinocchio is newly added a find and replace.

270
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:53,103
So it's really bad about getting my name Kobekovich.

271
00:40:53,103 --> 00:41:01,103
But also it can a lot of you know technical terms epic terms. things like that hospital name Sph.

272
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:03,103
It doesn't know that we're using an Acronym.

273
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:08,103
So it's trying to figure out what we're saying so you could do

274
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:13,103
You can enter that in and actually do a replace all or check each entry.

275
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:17,103
I was doing a training session on a new peer review tool.

276
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:23,103
We have we're piloting called Critic and So it always interpreted as critics, C. R. I.

277
00:41:23,103 --> 00:41:31,103
T. I c have it go through and differentiate when I was using critic, which they spell with a K.

278
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:39,103
The tar, the pro versus when I was saying the word critical feedback, which would be with us.

279
00:41:39,103 --> 00:41:42,103
So going through and just checking those things totally up to you.

280
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:49,103
How much time you want to spend on that And again the similar to with Zoom.

281
00:41:49,103 --> 00:42:02,103
The translation of how well it knows what you're saying is going to depend on how good the microphone pickup is, how much you're enunciating it's gonna be potentially impeded if you're

282
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:16,103
wearing a mask in the classroom. so just be aware many of our classrooms offer a microphone option, which, if you choose to mask even if you don't choose to mask, I would highly recommend using the

283
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:30,103
microphone. just clip on microphone. It has a on and off switch right on the top, and there may even be notes here for it.

284
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:45,103
Not sure if it's not turning. on in this podium there are extra batteries or stashed and then, if you're not having any luck at all.

285
00:42:45,103 --> 00:42:52,103
So there's the phone number to call classroom support so just let you know

286
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:59,103
A lot of sort of resources. You can pull the other anytime.

287
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:19,103
I make changes edits here, adding captions here I haven't apply button at the top in the top right, which is just gonna save these changes and switch out what I have currently in canvas and update it with my changes so I

288
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:25,103
can close this tab

289
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:40,103
And notice that's doing a reprocess step to update it with my changes

290
00:43:40,103 --> 00:43:48,103
Alright any questions i'm just gonna keep going unless I see a hand or chat

291
00:43:48,103 --> 00:44:00,103
I wanted to

292
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:07,103
Show you I wanted to talk briefly about, cause I wanted to say do more with Panocto in the session.

293
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:12,103
The classroom recording. We know I do that you trained on that, but I want to show you a few things.

294
00:44:12,103 --> 00:44:23,103
Yeah, they're just out of border sorry I wanted to show you

295
00:44:23,103 --> 00:44:29,103
Things you might consider record a course tour when we do the canvas survey.

296
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:45,103
We do that every winter Semester and our students repeatedly say, can somebody please lock in the course menu, so that all the things are in the same order for every canvas site?

297
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:55,103
Or can all instructors just use this tool for sharing content, and each of those students has different preferences of what one they like.

298
00:44:55,103 --> 00:45:02,103
The best. So one way that you, as an instructor, can help ease this.

299
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:11,103
Oh, I have to look basically learn how to navigate each of my courses, and they're all different.

300
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:15,103
One way you can help with this is record a course tour.

301
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:29,103
Go into your canvas site. use the pinato capture, and just tell your students here's how I've laid out the course I've put all my materials you can be able to get the materials from the homepage on

302
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:33,103
the date organized by topic, or we're using modules in this course.

303
00:45:33,103 --> 00:45:50,103
Things like that, and I have a an example here that I wanna just play briefly, hello and welcome to healthcare introduction to public health. I'm gonna pause because i'm I don't think i'm

304
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:56,103
sharing. so So i'm gonna say this was done by one of our staff members.

305
00:45:56,103 --> 00:46:02,103
And you don't have to you don't even have to be on camera for this.

306
00:46:02,103 --> 00:46:07,103
You can just do a narrated screen and she's gonna jump into that.

307
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,103
I'll take a second my name is monica Morrison and I'm.

308
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:14,103
An instruction designer in the Instructional Services Department within School Public Health.

309
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:28,103
Here at the University of Michigan. the purpose. of This video is to provide you with a brief tour of the courses canvas site and demonstrate how to get started in this course, you don't have to do under

310
00:46:28,103 --> 00:46:34,103
campus site. You will land on the homepage here, as noted on the left side panel.

311
00:46:34,103 --> 00:46:48,103
One thing I want to note is for this she switched into student view and student view is an option in the top right corner of a lot of your canvas site.

312
00:46:48,103 --> 00:46:53,103
What that's gonna do is clean up the view and it's gonna look the way it looks for your students instead of for you.

313
00:46:53,103 --> 00:47:05,103
The instructor. So if I switch over I go to my homepage here's that student view button at the top

314
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:11,103
And so this long menu of options that I have, may not all be visible to my students.

315
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,103
So I just want to pause and say that that's a good tip.

316
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:24,103
I also wanna follow up to see I have a I have a script for this that I can share out in when I share the recording and resources.

317
00:47:24,103 --> 00:47:29,103
And we have a list of suggestions, including this reminder to use student view.

318
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:36,103
Take a moment to explore and read the course description, and then locate and read through the course syllabus.

319
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:42,103
It can be found here in the center left portion of the screen.

320
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:51,103
The syllabus will include all of the most important information about your course, such as your instructors and Gsi's content.

321
00:47:51,103 --> 00:47:56,103
And so basically what she's gonna do is just give them literally a course tour.

322
00:47:56,103 --> 00:48:02,103
So she did this in 4 min. going through some of the syllabus items.

323
00:48:02,103 --> 00:48:12,103
So if you want to see a little bit of time on that first day of class for other things, you can them to watch this in advance.

324
00:48:12,103 --> 00:48:19,103
And then, once you publish your course you could direct that.

325
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:21,103
You could send an announcement and direct them. hey?

326
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:30,103
I have a course tour under Panama recordings share a link if you'd like

327
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:35,103
But I wanna do hello and welcome to help in society.

328
00:48:35,103 --> 00:48:45,103
Introduction to public so media assignments one neat thing that I don't think many people know about is that canvas.

329
00:48:45,103 --> 00:48:50,103
I'm sorry Panopo has a what's called an assignment folder.

330
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:58,103
So in your canvas site under your pinnacle recordings.

331
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:04,103
You as the instructor, are the only one who can add things to this video list.

332
00:49:04,103 --> 00:49:16,103
When we create an assignment folder that now gives students created create permissions, and they get a create button to contribute something.

333
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:31,103
So I have an example here. it's got assignments but you can enable this by going to the settings gear at the folder level, and this overview tap.

334
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:44,103
The first one is an assignment, folder option, and I can say, create assignment, folder

335
00:49:44,103 --> 00:49:50,103
So by default. It grabs then, and the site name of my course.

336
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:53,103
So yours would be epid. Hbg: Biostat.

337
00:49:53,103 --> 00:50:04,103
Whatever you teach with assignments at the end of it.

338
00:50:04,103 --> 00:50:12,103
Okay. And now I have this folder here in the top list

339
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:26,103
And so when students come into this list they're now going to have a create button where they can use an octo for windows, or Mac, if they want to install try installing, software, they can use Panopo capture they can

340
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:32,103
upload a recording if they recorded it, using some other device.

341
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:35,103
And you also get to decide for these media assignments.

342
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:43,103
Can students see one another's or can only you see everyone's submission.

343
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:54,103
So if It's restricted to where I can only see what I contributed, I'm going to come with this page, and I have I'm gonna have one video, or maybe if you do a few media signments I have 2 So

344
00:50:54,103 --> 00:51:09,103
we've seen this used with like a podcast assignments we're soon for court podcast do some sort of video presentation upload

345
00:51:09,103 --> 00:51:18,103
And then you can also open it up later. in case they're supposed to review one another for a little peer feedback.

346
00:51:18,103 --> 00:51:30,103
You could have it up the initially set where they can't see one another's, and then later change it to where they can

347
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:32,103
So we talked about enabling that assignment folder.

348
00:51:32,103 --> 00:51:40,103
The student records or uploads and when they're they can embed this in any canvas text editor.

349
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:55,103
So if you're doing a do an introduction we'll we're gonna watch each other's do a recording of your 5 slide presentation, and we're gonna leave comments on one another's discussion post would work for

350
00:51:55,103 --> 00:52:03,103
that, or if you set up an assignment with a text edit submission, they'll be able to embed their recording there.

351
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:11,103
And submit it to you, thanks so much for coming so that's pretty much it.

352
00:52:11,103 --> 00:52:15,103
I just wanted to. make you aware of our other fall workshops.
