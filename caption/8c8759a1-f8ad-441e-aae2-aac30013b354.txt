1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,240
In this video, we're going to discuss food as an energy source.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,930
As we talked about before, there are two reasons why we need to eat food.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,406
One is to obtain central nutrients such as vitamins and minerals, some amino acids,

4
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:16,940
and some fatty acids, things that we can't make ourselves in our own.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,606
The second reason is for energy and

6
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:22,340
that energy is critical to maintain bodily function.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,240
How much energy do we need?

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,750
Well that varies depending on the person.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,429
In terms of total energy expenditure, it increases depending on a person's physical

10
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:36,240
activity and changes in their basal metabolic rate among other things.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,840
Their basal metabolic rate is dependent on their sex being higher in males.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,900
Their age being higher when you're younger and your size.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,140
It's higher as you have more fat free mass or lean mass on your body.

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,250
About 15 of energy expenditure is genetic.

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,440
Even after accounting for differences in sex, age and fat free mass.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,687
The United States Department of Agriculture recommends males in general

17
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:07,549
need about 2500 kilocalories per day of energy, whereas females, due to their

18
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:12,740
smaller size and lower fat free mass require about 2000 kilocalories per day.

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,561
But again, as you can imagine, it depends widely on your age,

20
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,040
sex, lifestyle and activity.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,764
You can go to this link here entering information similar to yours to see to

22
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:27,040
estimate what your total energy expenditure needs are.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,330
So what do we need this energy for?

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,692
For an average person,

25
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:35,740
about 60% of their total energy expenditure is their basal metabolic rate.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,570
Your basal metabolic rate isn't something you might think of normally when you think

27
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,183
of energy expenditure, but no matter if you're moving or sitting on the couch,

28
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:46,532
running a marathon or sitting in class, your heart needs to keep pumping,

29
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:48,110
your brain needs to keep working.

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,216
Your kidneys need to keep filtering and all of those things require energy.

31
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:54,169
When we think about energy expenditure,

32
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,423
usually the first thing people think of is their physical activity.

33
00:01:57,423 --> 00:02:00,353
And that can include both exercise as in the jog you went when

34
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,108
you got up this morning or your normal activity levels,

35
00:02:03,108 --> 00:02:08,240
including fidgeting around, walking around between classes and things like that.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,540
The fourth aspect of energy expenditure is a thing called diet-induced thermogenesis.

37
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,468
That's the energy that is expended during the digestion, absorption and

38
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:20,740
transport of foods during the digestive process.

39
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,240
So what does it mean to be in energy balance?

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,382
What that means is your energy intake and

41
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:28,033
your energy expenditure are equal to each other.

42
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:33,040
In that condition, generally a person is not gaining or losing anyway.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,836
If your energy intake exceeds your energy expenditure, you're in a state of positive

44
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:41,040
energy balance, which generally means that your rate will increase.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,089
If your energy intake is reduced and/or your energy expenditure is increased,

46
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,650
you're in a position of negative energy balance,

47
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,940
which is generally what would happen when you start to lose weight.

48
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,011
So what is the calorie?

49
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,540
And how is it determined?

50
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,944
Well fundamentally, if for nutritional purposes, a calorie is the energy that's

51
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:04,540
contained in a chemical bond that is then made available for a human to use.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,041
I'm showing you here to different chemical structures on the left is a triglycerides

53
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,040
and on the right is glucose.

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,040
As you can see, the triglyceride has a large number of carbon carbon bonds.

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,653
Carbon carbon bonds contain a lot of energy and

56
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:21,139
when they're broken down can release a lot of energy for use.

57
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,534
Glucose on the other hand, while it has quite a few carbon carbon bonds also has

58
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:29,397
quite a few carbon oxygen bonds, these have somewhat less energy and

59
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:32,620
therefore glucose has less energy than a triglyceride.

60
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,051
Even when you account for differences in mass.

61
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,942
What you're seeing here, where it says triglycerides,

62
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,243
your nine kilocalories program and glucose or

63
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:44,150
carbohydrates are four kilocalories program are known as Atwater's Rules.

64
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,799
So even though there's a lot of different types of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates

65
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,334
that we could possibly eat in general, lipids contain nine kilocalories per gram.

66
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,170
Proteins and carbohydrates contain four kilocalories per gram,

67
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,044
while fiber and alcohol contain two and seven kilocalories per gram respectively.

68
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:05,114
These Atwater's rules are used to convert amounts of

69
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:10,340
a macro nutrients into the energy content of the food.

70
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,124
So take a second and think this through.

71
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:16,412
How many grams of carbohydrates would a typical woman need to consume if they were

72
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:19,630
only consuming carbohydrates to maintain energy balance,

73
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:33,840
I'll give you a second to think about it.

74
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,370
So the solution to this would be if the average woman requires 2000 kilocalories

75
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:38,900
per day.

76
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,628
And you divide that by the Atwater number for carbohydrates,

77
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,740
which is four kilocalories per day.

78
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,540
That means that woman would need to consume 500 grams

79
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,740
of carbohydrates to get those 2000 kilocalories.

80
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,569
That would have this person if they were spending

81
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:56,840
2000 kilocalories per day in energy neutrality.

82
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,292
If the person was eating an all fat diet, it would be 2000 divided by nine,

83
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,940
which is now only 222 grams of fat.

84
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,506
That again,

85
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:09,640
is because of the higher energy content of fat relative to carbohydrates.

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,455
So I said before, it's not just the energy in the chemical bonds, but

87
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:14,530
it's the available energy in the chemical bonds.

88
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,790
So let's take a second and

89
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,640
think why would some of that energy not be available to you?

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,179
Well, one reason is we may not be able to absorb the macronutrients or

91
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,040
the food very efficiently.

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,640
And this could be for a number of reasons.

93
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,580
For example, fiber has a chemical structure that

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,990
our body is not able to break down in our digestive tract, and therefore not

95
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,540
all of the carbohydrate in fiber is able to be absorbed in our bodies.

96
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,340
Another example are non-caloric sweeteners.

97
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,227
These sweeteners have chemical energy in their bonds, but

98
00:05:45,227 --> 00:05:49,035
the transporters in our digestive system are not able to absorb that food out of

99
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:51,310
our gastrointestinal tract into our bodies.

100
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,807
So therefore, even though there is energy in that food,

101
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:57,740
it's not energy that we can use for metabolism.

102
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,995
Another reason why some of the energy might not be available is because some of

103
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:03,940
the energy may be used during the digestive process.

104
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,240
An example of this would be protein.

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,640
So dietary proteins contain peptide bonds which link amino acids together.

106
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,501
But during the digestive process, many or almost all of those peptide bonds

107
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,541
are broken down, so therefore the energy in the peptide bond is released during

108
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,042
the digestive process and it's released prior to the absorption and

109
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:25,640
therefore it's not available for use by the body.

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,640
The energy that's released in digestion is part of diet induced thermogenesis.

111
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,233
So in summary, we need to get energy from food and

112
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,040
we get that energy from macronutrients.

113
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,616
The amount of energy a person needs varies from person to person, but

114
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:44,040
it can be largely predicted by known equations.

115
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,440
Atwater's rules tell us how much energy is in each gram of each macronutrients.

116
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,874
And those rules are used to determine how to convert a macro nutrient content of

117
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:55,375
a food into the amount of energy in the food.

118
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,760
And then last all, the amount of energy in a food depends on both the type of macro

119
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,287
nutrient and how efficiently that macronutrients is absorbed by our body.
