00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,430
Welcome to this brief introduction of Canvas,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:15,480
the learning management system used at the University of Michigan. Access Canvas from canvas.it.umich.edu.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,630
It's also an option in the quick links menu on the university homepage.

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,740
Select the, U-M login option.

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:35,560
And log in with your University of Michigan uniqname and password, the same login information you use for your university email.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,320
The dashboard is the landing page when you log in to Canvas.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,470
It's comprised of an announcement bar, a global Canvas navigation menu.

8
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:57,590
Courses you're enrolled in, and a feed of activity happening in your courses, including a link to view a summary of your grades.

9
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,020
Let's go through each of these areas, beginning with the global Canvas navigation menu.

10
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,670
This menu is always visible along the left hand side when using canvas in a browser in the Canvas mobile app.

11
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,450
These items will appear along the bottom of the screen.

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:24,510
The account area pertains specifically to the individual logged in, you can see what email notifications Canvas will send to you.

13
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:32,730
We recommend leaving these here as is and making adjustments in specific courses, which we'll show later.

14
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:44,150
Upload a profile picture here in the profile area. In files, you can access any items you've uploaded to Canvas across various courses.

15
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,720
Settings is where you can set your preferred pronouns,

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:55,100
which will display next to your name in various locations within Canvas for instructors and classmates to see.

17
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:03,090
In the Canvas mobile app, account options are located from the menu in the upper left corner.

18
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,950
Dashboard will return you to this landing page and you can sample the different

19
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,910
display options available in a browser from the more menu on the right.

20
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,590
Courses will pop out a menu allowing you to jump to another course,

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,940
this can help you switch to a different course from other areas of Canvas without needing to return to the dashboard.

22
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:36,480
The All Courses list allows you to manage which courses appear on your dashboard by selecting the star next to them.

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:47,400
This will be especially helpful as the dashboard fills up after a couple of semesters and you can always return to this page to access past courses.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:56,760
You'll see a group's option in this menu if any of your instructors utilize the Canvas groups, feature the links in the pop out menu,

25
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:08,100
allow you to access a group workspace to share files and have discussions. The calendar will populate based on due dates set in each of your courses.

26
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:18,180
Use the calendar feed link to add items from this calendar into your Google calendar. Inbox is an email tool within Canvas.

27
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,810
By default, you'll receive a notification in your Umich email when you receive an inbox message.

28
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,240
A notification icon will also appear on this inbox menu.

29
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:39,090
Help is a great way to see the resources available to you, specific course related questions may need to be answered by your instructor,

30
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:48,120
but technical issues or questions about Canvas may be answered by contacting for help or visiting the Canvas student guide.

31
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:56,210
Well-Being is a quick link to explore campus wide resources and events centered around your well-being.

32
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,510
This link isn't displayed in the Canvas mobile app, so you might consider bookmarking

33
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,870
wellbeing.studentlife.umich.edu in your mobile browser.

34
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,280
This link will navigate to a webpage outside of Canvas. But right-clicking

35
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:22,110
on the icon will allow you to open the page in a new browser tab.

36
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:30,720
Let's return to the dashboard and look at a typical Canvas course. Each course has a left hand navigation menu,

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,400
although keep in mind that each instructor organizes their course differently and use different tools to share materials.

38
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,390
Let's look at some of these options.

39
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:52,630
Home is the course landing page, which will be customized by each instructor with links to the course syllabus and content links for each week.

40
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:59,110
On the far right, note that one of the options is to view course notifications here,

41
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:06,040
you can modify how frequently you receive notifications about this course.

42
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,990
We recommend leaving Announcements set to notify immediately.

43
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:19,210
In addition to receiving email notifications, this Announcements menu will display the course announcements posted by the instructor.

44
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,070
This is often the primary way instructors will post information and updates.

45
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:33,000
So you'll want to make sure you haven't missed any. Assignments are created for items that you will be submitting and may be graded on.

46
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,220
When you click on an assignment title, you'll see more details about the submission type, due date and assignment instructions.

47
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:49,150
You may also see a rubric, if this tool is being used or you may find rubric information in the assignment instructions.

48
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:57,550
You'll want to come to this page before the due date and use the Start Assignment button to begin the submission process.

49
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:05,810
In this example, I'm submitting a file upload, so I'll browse for and attach my paper.

50
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:12,880
Note the cues I have that show my submission successfully went through.

51
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,810
If you don't see a Start Assignment button on an assignment,

52
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:23,950
check that you haven't missed the due date, some assignments may be set to not allow late submissions.

53
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,930
Check also that the assignment does, in fact, require an online submission,

54
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,260
the best way to check this is in your syllabus or in the assignment instructions provided. From there,

55
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,440
you may want to consult your instructor.

56
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:47,050
Modules are another way that your course content may be organized modules are frequently organized by week and contain documents,

57
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,500
assignments, web links and other items that are pertinent to the class sessions.

58
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:03,050
As the semester goes on, you may find your course content at the bottom of this page and collapsing these modules may be helpful.

59
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,460
Files are another option that your instructor may use to share materials,

60
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:16,910
folders and documents are organized in alphabetical order, but can be sorted by name creation, date modification, date, etc.

61
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:26,240
There's also a search bar to help you find a document if you know the file name. Another course tool your classes may use is the Discussion area.

62
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,780
This serves as a discussion board that you may be asked to participate in, either voluntarily or for a grade.

63
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:41,230
You may also have the ability to create new discussion topics using the + Discussion button in the upper right.

64
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:48,450
If this is not visible, then you'll only have the ability to reply to posts started by the instructor.

65
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,100
Grades is where you can view what items have been submitted and graded.

66
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:03,630
Here are some common icons you might see in the Grades area. No submission, Submitted but not yet graded,

67
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:10,400
A hidden grade, meaning grades for this assignment, have not yet been released by the instructor.

68
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,750
This assignment has comments from your instructor or a designated reviewer and a rubric was used with this assignment.

69
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:24,380
Additionally, you may be receiving in-line feedback from your instructor on file upload assignments.

70
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:34,370
So let's look at how to view it. Notice that the assignment title is a link, this provides a summary of your submission details,

71
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,470
comments left by your instructor, the ability to open the rubric if one was used.

72
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:48,560
And the ability to view any notes left in line in your document using the View Feedback link.

73
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,950
You can also download a copy of your work with the annotations.

74
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:03,010
You may also have additional menu items such as Panopto Recording's if class sessions

75
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,530
are recorded for later viewing. Zoom for any online portions of the course.

76
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,350
My Learning Analytics, where you can see some reports of your course progress,

77
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:21,500
and we'd recommend you explore these areas as you become acquainted with your core sites.

78
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,450
Lastly, you'll be notified when teaching evaluations become available for your course.

79
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,900
And this menu will be one way to access them during the evaluation period.

80
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:40,520
As mentioned, use the Help button in the global navigation to see a list of help options for course related questions,

81
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,660
check with your instructor to learn more about a tool and Canvas.

82
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,250
Visit the Canvas guides for help with a technical issue.

83
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:57,267
