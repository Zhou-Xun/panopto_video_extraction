30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
if you're off for the school policy on the shelf.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so a little bit of personal history and

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
how we got your leader and expert for health care. ask

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
about some of your leadership role Blue Cross Blue Shield. government for for how did you

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
get started working in help here. what classes are experiences made you interested

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
in working in this field. what was your first job. oh my goodness. this is a funny

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
question like you guys are so far ahead of me I I think you know what public health was

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
until I got to the school you know. so I had no idea

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
when I was an undergraduate I majored in psychology and English and

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I really when I was gonna do so the way I got here is

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
because after I graduated from my undergraduate programs. I kind created of this

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
job and I'm from New York and so I was you know was trying to work all the

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
connections that I knew and I ended up getting the job in the family plan.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
women's reproductive health. I guess it was

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
happenstance that I there. and uh but I liked it was interesting and

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
we ended up insurance from the University of Michigan school of Public and

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so I was trying to figure out what I was going to do. you know thing next you know I kinda wanted to go to graduate school I

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
kind of knew I wanted to do it somewhere in the human service health area something like that

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and she said we oughta go to parochial schools really great. okay.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
so I I I it's really I had no idea what you're talking about I have no idea what's

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
right and they did have a cousin who is at the Harvard school of public else. uh and

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
uh he said you want to go to Michigan because this is the best program. okay that sounds like a good

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
plan too. so so I ended up applies in North Carolina Harvard in Michigan

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
uh and I came here and um was you know I

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
it was a great journey because I think for my first year here the soonest trying to figure out what exactly

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
is and back in the last day we had multiple departments

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
are still multiple times for the little more consolidation and so I ended up in the department that was cold health

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
planning and administration which it turned out this so you know what

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I know we're gonna talk about my life journey my career journey and it's all been just sure a lot on my part.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
nothing has been planned. um but said beloved wise that I ended up in this department

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
here which was the policy and it turns out and I can say that's retrospectively I really

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
don't think I would've know you this is the time then I'm really waiting my my words

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
when my passion are what I'm this is really well suited to policy. so

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I got here and you know and then my jury here continue to be

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
totally found you know I guess nothing claims. if you asked me that

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
what I was gonna do I would've told you I was going to go

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
to college and policy work I was gonna go to Washington DC and the policy in Washington. certainly wanted

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to go back east I never thought I'd say a

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
yesterday half. uh-huh. um but you know then I did my internship

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
in Washington actually in the office of family planning at HHS time

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and I hated. I did beauty watching the TV and Washington was

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
not like it is today. today would be even worse currently um

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
not just go to hearing for for many other reasons um and I think it is because

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
it feels entirely disconnected from she sure

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
it was all about and I felt like all of our work was

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
oriented towards one time or another congressman or you know inside

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I think they still say inside the beltway with everything about how structure Washington

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and I had just knows send us anything that we were doing real. so

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that's not sort of gave me a decision that what I really wanted to do I wanted to have policy

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
and he wanted to do something at the systemic level something that was brought them one on one

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
patients here. I knew I didn't wanna be a hospital administrator I knew I didn't wanna work with in the clinical

81
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
structure of health care. so if you really can just me that supplied forms

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
for policy in time. graders match for my interest in the field

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
would be the statement. so that's the sort of got me sort of on the path ways

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
of expressing worker who grows twenty

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
before stewardesses twirls

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
his organization recently. yeah I guess he asked me and

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
how would care you approaches. yeah yeah so I so I Blue Cross

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
uh and I did take a pause I actually was Blue Cross twice I was there for seven years after

89
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I graduated from graduate school and certificate they were hiring. you know if you gonna

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
stay for six months and the same there for seven years. that point uh and then I left

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
at a point and because I did wanna get it straight for about a time which works for this but you know the attorneys

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
office manager and I went back and I can tell you a little bit about what.

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and then I went to see so offensive in the early stage seven year

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
phase of my insurance Blue Cross. I went as a health planning handle much you know I went

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
there and it was it's interesting looking back on it now because I my first jobs very much focused

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
on you know how it was the early days when

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
people buy health insurance where including substance he's kind of

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
plans and particularly the fewer Japanese labor groups.

99
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
we're very interested in standing benefits to cover mental health and substance use services. and

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
so my first jobs were helping to decide you know what you to cover had it Blue Cross

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
contracted providers and then all over the seven years my there in the first phase

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
of my portfolio expanded to I was doing reimbursement policy how we pay providers

103
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
not just something she's all hospitals doctors et cetera and a little bit of planning

104
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
more generally and I became a director after so you know seven years I left

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
that I said to work for managed care and run operations for an HMO that was owned by the training

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
health care system and then for a variety of reasons we can talk about if you're interested but I ended up going

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
fast Blue Cross and when I went back and went back and the vice president had a strategic planning

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and ended my career they're running their traditional on the radio products and provider services

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and contracting with hospitals and physicians and the future slash student now for the

110
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
second thing. so that's what I do there and then

111
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you know if you said you talk a little bit about what I did say but I I ran

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
for governor present governor Granholm and I asked me if I can join her cabinets

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
or um what was then the second largest department for government I think is currently the largest

114
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
from the second largest after us. unfortunately the correction system. the prison

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
system at the time and that apartment. you know the difference for us going

116
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
okay. so public assistance. if can you black

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
foster care system. child support. so it included

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
at the time it included Medicare eligibility under the prior governor governor

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
anyway Medicaid policy has since split out into the department of community house under

120
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the current cap interaction Snider just come to get back together so is now the form of Health and Human Services

121
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
that would include everything about the policy processes and stuff

122
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I find it confusing if it was confusing it's a very large edges that I have thousand

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
employees a department now because it was supposed to is fourteen thousand employees and it is

124
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
life largest it is the largest department by far as the government council quarters just like

125
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to choose something else it's got all the medication. um

126
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
um. I also wanted to ask you about that too.

127
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
either yourself versus

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
health care solutions some of my friends and um

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
what's the issue student who you know for

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
specifically what times are different for you than they were for me

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
it was you know it's been alive and and the steel froze there a lot of time you know come

132
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
up through the ranks back in the day when it was acceptable for

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
people to smoke in your face in a business environment that would be unheard of today does

134
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
many things happen in life here are that are definitely unheard of today and you

135
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
know the thing um so it's you know you're only going out the women and then this

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
group will be going out into a different environment but I still think that there are gender leadership

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
many levels in health care and in front of society so you're silly

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
right. I was um I was the only woman in the season

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
when I could join the governor 's administration the governor governor and she was much more intentional

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
about kind of representing a diverse wealth you

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
know more reflective of the state of the whole different environment but in the corporate taxes

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and the factor. I was for almost all of my career the only woman

143
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
for the most senior year 's time and you know what

144
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I learned through that process. um and it was something I talk about when I teach my class

145
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
we we spend some time. I I actually have students in my class. read

146
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
an article that was in the Atlantic several years ago self-confidence caps. I don't know

147
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
if any if you have read it. you know Cheryl Stamberg from Facebook a while

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
back but article called vocals and me then a lot of people were you know

149
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
there a lot of book clubs and university around lean in and around the conference gap and things like that.

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
uh in a particular like for a particular book but I do like a conference cap because I can find

151
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
it even today still be ways in terms of how women

152
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
often react in the workplace and example is that I think women

153
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
uh often feel or at least percent the research shows that they feel this

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
idea for sponsors much greater rates and into imposter

155
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
syndrome mean they get into jobs and they think oh really I'm not qualified for the job and see

156
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
in that way you know they're often much more differential they're much more likely to second-guess

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
whether their contributions. certain topic life you then

158
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
then I has a so you know early in my career

159
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
you know I was not working. I mean I personally never intended for us to six much as I said so it wasn't like

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was trying to climb the corporate ladder this was it was all happenstance and I think it's

161
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
part happens because I really do care whether state or residence so I just wanted to do my thing

162
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
but I think um because I didn't care process the stay there. I didn't have a lot of

163
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
rest and they have a life on the line and so I really just wanted to do. I wanted

164
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
to do price that I thought were interesting and I wanted to you know I might have a little

165
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
in my personalities and I feel little control controlling. so I need my my number one of the some of these brush

166
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
come out a certain way the way I thought they should come out right so. so I might have any meetings been

167
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
somewhat healthy. I and you know but I always knew my stuff.

168
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
so I I I did and I you know I I got I think the research sort of affairs assess. I probably work

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
a lot harder than some other states and I knew my materials and I wasn't

170
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
sure and so I I ended up screwing a lot of

171
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
people come to make the first things on the news. so I I got a lot of opportunities. I will say

172
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that in the C sweetie. uh and I I think if you ask any of my male colleagues

173
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the in house and they were reflected about it. I think it hurt. I I had to

174
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
really uh and then they gave each other. I mean I really had to make my case

175
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
for the positions and the approach is that I thought were important

176
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and I I am absolutely certain if respect for me absolute certainty that you

177
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
know they would tell you that they said they still time is valuable contribution. um but

178
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I did not have the same kind of formal fresh release that they had

179
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and so I always felt like I had no more prepared and I had

180
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
to be intentional so uh so

181
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
yeah many times students have read for

182
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
else how complex system is broken.

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
my question is just this way.

184
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't what just a few revisions to of all fears you know it's

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
so different from other places like you so I I told al

186
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
when you shared some of these questions with me. I I do it whole three hour lecture on that one particular question.

187
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I thought doing if I mean it's a lot of my challenge right here. um but let

188
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
me start with just a couple of comments and I'm happy and if you wanna

189
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
go deeper into the for some very important questions. it is a very relevant questions

190
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to the current debate about Medicare for all and Bernie 's approach versus other approaches

191
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
is a series of questions. I and so you know something personal limit service and we don't have

192
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
health care in this country. we have a non- system in the states in the system is an entirely

193
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
fragmented haphazard structures attached to me.

194
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
yes financing for for health. care it is entirely different in every other developed

195
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
countries in the world with all of which have an absolute system that had some

196
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
social levels since off at some public level testing

197
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
for us and there's a reason for that and and the reason it has very much to do

198
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
with how we it has to do with us if the people in country the

199
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
you know very much do with the foundation country so

200
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I think the easiest way I had to go through this issue is status conference.

201
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
if you had to describe kind of what might be fewer than American

202
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
workers come out. give you we're

203
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
was what it was worth

204
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
for your dog you know of close when even that I

205
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
um kinda like that nobody else might you know come on some repair industry

206
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
majors. let me have life liberty lately but keep

207
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
in mind you know they put limits and anybody here anybody can they didn't

208
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
know anybody here know what it is in Canada. real conservatives and

209
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you know that uh-huh. I exactly so ours

210
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
would be like living and their equivalent in Canada

211
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
border. we to sort of pick up. so just think about

212
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that. what's the second page in terms of the different outlook

213
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that we have as a people you know our country we are very much about the individuals in

214
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
this country. we're very much about this idea

215
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
that we quote unquote free herself. Fire whether this is true or

216
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
not. and we can give you. I can give you lots of the campus lesson truth whether it's true or not.

217
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
we're very much about the individual responsibility personal taxes

218
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
specialist Frank one is well known for this phrase

219
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
we can create rags to riches he literally did that you literally choke racks

220
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and use them creative printing press a favor and you can watch

221
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
TV she typifies this American views that is all about

222
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
our own industry and own our effort to create success and that

223
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
is why prescriptive actually over. if you look at every other country in the world

224
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
weather counter that with order and good government is there for underlying governmental

225
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
philosophy or not. that's framework the. it's very much about community

226
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
areas. just very much about protection of the community at large

227
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and not about individualism. so what is the reason

228
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
we have the system we have in America is because I'm like every other country in the world have we not been to the most

229
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
fundamental question about what we believe about health is health care and Marcus

230
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Cooper versus every other country in the world answer and their questions and their answers.

231
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
we have not answer their questions. that is the foundation of the debate really affordable care. it is the

232
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
foundation actually is the debate between the republican and the Democrats on

233
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
what the healthcare system should look like not everybody's very honest about what the debate is concerned they don't usually

234
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
freeze if they do not they don't wanna read something that's actually right many

235
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
many people who say they believe that everybody should have healthcare safety and health insurance

236
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
which is a whole different thing but that's what they say they believe everyone should have it but if you actually

237
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
look at what they mean by that they need and they should have this difference between

238
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
having it and having access access to it means I could buy it.

239
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
if I the money I could foster. I and so there's a lot of these words that are out there but

240
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
the reality is in this I I think it's got to requesting you know later but the reality is we don't have a philosophical

241
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
foundation that is similar to what it is and I mean we

242
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
can talk if you want questions you wanna talk questions about the before plan the burning plan or whatever. um.

243
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:02,000
we Louisville. okay. we were at

244
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
fault here

245
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
to divert a lot of movies working with services in the fall. so

246
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that's great. all the best places similarly you know that there is

247
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
group of college career. okay. 's just laughing about this

248
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
question with my friend and colleague Daniel and who has a the foundation that's

249
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
in charge of choosing wisely camp and we're saying you know we're been around a long time right so

250
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
this is when we graduated from public else with all that systems and we haven't all the time. well that said

251
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
you will have lifelong careers that are really challenging and there's

252
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
no easy answers to the questions. so you know what's what's funny on your question about what works

253
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
well in the US was fascinating to me I'd like to US this is another difference between

254
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
US and other countries every country in the world 's most of else can still come to the US study health

255
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
care system because they do think they can we do think work free. I mean they just cannot understand how we

256
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
have a financing system we do but they also think that we can become anything from us. so if we do cross country

257
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
comparisons. we can see that a great Britain Canada Germany.

258
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
and most of the countries in the world. have a synopsis check some certain techniques that we have a job

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that they're they're using ways of emission quality. they're using um reimbursement tools

260
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
that we use ways we pay hospitals and use diagnostic related group tools that's something

261
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
that we developed here in America they come to study a few schools and so you know it's not

262
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
that we don't have innovation and some good ideas here we have just incredible and the quality you know

263
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
fun. incredible inequities in any qualities and if you have a lot of money.

264
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
we have a great help. you know our our our our house comes in our results are generally worse

265
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
than most other than most of the countries on the population level but if you are an individual

266
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
with instance and you have the means you'll quit health insurance and got you money you're

267
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
gonna go after one here without my twenty year. so it's very

268
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
unaffordable to system but there's a lot of care that is fine quality and there are some creative innovations

269
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
that have been adopted by others. we never go to any other countries. it depends.

270
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
we think we know everything and you know we had we had and

271
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Allen I remember this but we had a guy who was at the he was

272
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the centers from Medicare and Medicaid services director who can never get confirmed

273
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
by Congress because he has written you think come from Harvard he'd written an academic

274
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
paper that get set up on the thing about for the solstice and he was accused

275
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
of supporting rationing of health. so he could never get confirmed by Congress

276
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
because they told him he supported things like that panel. I just love.

277
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
that's a great thing. if it's crazy. anyway you know they didn't look through the affordable

278
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
care act where they made up and very definitely

279
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
yes but there was this whole thing that went on when the affordable care was passed

280
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
where people were accused or they ICS from one of the five presidential candidates at

281
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
the time Palin who went around and said that they the idea behind for care to kill off all the senior people

282
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
you know seems you know they're gonna have done fast because there was a piece in there for the pure

283
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
uh that was designed to help people who are in end of life or dying to get counseling

284
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
from physicians it was gonna pay for that. so that turned into a whole

285
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
smear event and that's really do think it's kind of bad political times right now believe me we had many

286
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
others absolutely. just like to keep it in perspective. um

287
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
the focal position. so if you

288
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
go to the places and having have some

289
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
issues we live here and compassionate than most people want that

290
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and their families one of him is life anyway it's awful. so enjoy why I like the

291
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
study falls ago looking at how physicians the circumstances

292
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
are and which position you know compared to other people and

293
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
the bad with your some positions on your home around

294
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
about it that's not true that's right and

295
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:40,000
the people who are suitable for knowledgeable the referral services

296
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and the rest of

297
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
so um let over the top class of else would you tell if

298
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
your system the whole question. if your ass later. um

299
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
or TV with our special microphones human tools

300
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and be ready to keep with the microphones he heard anybody have any

301
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:16,000
specific questions about US health care system.

302
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
yeah let me just repeat

303
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
what what do you think is the greatest in addition to in current cultures.

304
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
yeah you know it's hard to say what is the greatest because we have so many uh-huh.

305
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
but I'll give you a few examples right and uh and some of it is also comparisons to other countries

306
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
right so so one of absolute inefficiency in the sort of underpins the idea behind where

307
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Bernie and Elizabeth Warren are it's because we have these multiplicity

308
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
of ten years because we're not a single country because we don't have

309
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
universal coverage. we have a tremendous amount of administrative costs in the system that doesn't answer

310
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
now right to consume itself. I think the estimates are something about twenty even twenty five to twenty

311
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
five percent of our spending the hospitals. it's for administration not for medical care

312
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
not for patient care and it's in large part because we have so much complexity

313
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
of the system if you go to go up to Canada. and I highly encourage you all to do this

314
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
if you go to Kennedy and you go into any of their medical care providers and you have to see the billing

315
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
office in the hospital. you'll see one room with a couple of people right you

316
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
see you got to see building a opposite one of our hospitals. you'll see a

317
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
muddy my suicide over in India or the Philippines or somewhere else but you will see many

318
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
people site off with the big eight hundred call center number trying to figure things out right and collection

319
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
agencies and all sorts of things that they don't have you know the country so the minutes right across the system

320
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
is without a doubt. a huge inefficiency because it's just a finance value

321
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
to medical care but there are there are many other inefficiencies which have more to do

322
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
with this idea that we we don't know a tremendous amount about what

323
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
works in medical care. right. you might disagree with us but there are a lot of things that we do a

324
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
medical care that we do without a lot of evidence behind and so I guess there is

325
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
been they're been really solid estimates say between twenty five and thirty percent of our spending is

326
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
for medical care if it doesn't pan sell in some cases harmful

327
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and um you know so how how you eliminate that is much more costly.

328
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
we have a finance certainly in this country more so than other countries

329
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
doing more is better. right. we we people go in to see the doctor

330
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
you got a virus you know walk you know to the doctor says you have a virus this is gonna take time.

331
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
you know that it doesn't always feel great to us as patients or the doctors talking to me so

332
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
we that's how we got a tour and about it. nice place to live in a lot of enigmatic resistance issues

333
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
now because people are holders prescribed and about the things we don't need an address for.

334
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
so there's a lot of inefficiency on the delivery. side I clearly inefficiencies

335
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
on the on the administrative stuff. one and like well I I

336
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
go through many practices and actually

337
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
some forms. if you if you could go down

338
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
but I cast my God when I was in medical school

339
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
gastric ulcers full stress and spicy food

340
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
's troubles today. you look back

341
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
if I were to go and out just really proposes the nineteen eighties. we got left

342
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and then in about two dozen

343
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
groups there are a lot of things like that not as dramatic as a lot of any other questions

344
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
about the current US health system fact there.

345
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
hi. I like

346
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,000
to play twenties

347
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
but I said what's the second first lady is for the contents of

348
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
the universal health care right you do this now I think if

349
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
we were to get that later. but yes

350
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
so much find to universal healthcare for seconds um I think what do

351
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you mean what most people mean when they talk about universal health care is everybody having access to

352
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
insurance from the humane which is different than having access to care

353
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and there's a big issue right now we could talk about it was just looking at some data

354
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
for example in the middle health care system. uh you know one non- system in this country

355
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
where lots of people because of no health parity lost at the federal level benefits

356
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
for mental health care but they can't find any practitioners to

357
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and that's and and or there are a lot of other administrative barriers. just to keep

358
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
the cost of healthcare down that make it hard for people to access care so if what you mean should

359
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
everybody in this country have a script benefits coverage helps um

360
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
you know financial again like in other countries where if you social responsibility not a market responsibility.

361
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I believe yes I believe people should have as it part of the social contract

362
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
have some basic health care. what that is we can talk about how far it goes and what it should cover

363
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
that's a different topic. I believe that just like I believe we actually should have a

364
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
basic income I believe version of basic else. I think there's a whole range. it's been very interesting

365
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
to me that we're having that huge debate about Medicare. about some medical care and coverage

366
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
for medical care we do wanna put base the about food and housing right. are these also

367
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
fundamentalist we don't really I mean entry asked I have a debate about a universal basic income but we're

368
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
not really seriously talking here about a universal basic. there's a lot of human

369
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
services needs that I think should be bundled together and I'm not sure what makes health care different

370
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
from stuff. so I believe all of those things should be part of the complex.

371
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
how realistic is it to get there. um. so that's what I said earlier about

372
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
the difference in philosophy between America and other countries.

373
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I and I mean we're gonna go deeper I think and you your questions on this and I don't wanna go

374
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
too far into it before I'll just asked me this question but I think it is.

375
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
we have not had a debate in the country about what we believe and what value

376
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
systems and that is why Trumpcare has been continually controversial

377
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
uh and why there are groups trying undermine to the affordable care act because I had a

378
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
fundamental score level. they don't believe we should have universal coverage

379
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
and inch he'll really have that debate and views based happened in other countries

380
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
triggered by the areas of that we have never tackled because

381
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
because you had pick to my car because the reason why we got the system we got which happen incrementally

382
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
over many years with the many different triggers funding other countries. there was a trigger

383
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
that got sent to universal coverage something something at the federal level

384
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
that united people around this idea running for. we have not gone there in the country

385
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and I think until we get there. if we ever get. I don't think

386
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
so I I could be so but I am a pragmatist part. so it's why

387
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
you know I tell people I'm doing a town home at one of our congressmen on

388
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Saturday and we'll talk about this there with consumer you know the the carrier got a lot of problems

389
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
but it's a whole lot better than what we had before and so I'm a pragmatist on the switch we've gotta make

390
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
progress but the way we make progress in the US is incrementally not generally with the big

391
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:25,000
bang change for

392
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
cute. okay.

393
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
so just kind of a use question. but as far as school

394
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
goes. you think it would be possible to anybody controls.

395
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
changes or if you're waiting

396
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
like Medicare. they paid to play no part.

397
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
yeah. are you ready for that. okay.

398
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
okay mark my words. zero chance we will have Medicare for all of this country. okay.

399
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
a chance sorry. I really need to do this but you know honestly and I I has a special cruise

400
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
for so long I think it's been trusting for having discussion the. I think it is fantastic work

401
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
laying out these alternative. I wish we had care for all believe me I do wish

402
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
every other system in the country and the world is better than ours because they don't exist

403
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
but health care is one six of

404
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
the economy. once the way US.

405
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
anybody here but history or political science majors. anyway that class your in political

406
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
science or history. okay come on the specifics that we it's in

407
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
high school they don't I got spare were few interested in health

408
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
care and you're interest in health care policy. please go take a class and politics policies. something

409
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
about how the American political system works you cannot disentangle politics house right.

410
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
we are the interest group for a system. we're not a representative to my democracy.

411
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
speak with you know me I mean only just look at the presidential election twenty six we have

412
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
we do not we are not a pure democracy where of representative democracy

413
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
right representative democracy and how does the system work who has the most influence

414
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
in the system with an individual notice anything something

415
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
or corporation money money who who who rules the system

416
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
it's money rights movement of money it's not the people are in poverty. I work really

417
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
hard to have a really long time to get people in poverty. good basic

418
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
benefits. believe me they don't have the money and they don't have the boat. so

419
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
yeah. decisions. why do we have prescription drug cost way the we have them

420
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
because the manufacturers are the single biggest lobby in Washington DC by far

421
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
the single thing topic we talk a lot about oh we're gonna have controls

422
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
for script drug card we talk a lot about how we're going to fix problems up

423
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
to high co-pays. that's a lot easier than Medicare for all

424
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
a lot of careful. have we gotten this not even close lot of matter but

425
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
not if it's because money drives system right. if you go back

426
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
to look at what happens in the passage of the affordable care act in two

427
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
thousand nine. the idea of a public option which is the Medicare.

428
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
you know so someone come up with on the table. he couldn't get out

429
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Congress but the Democrats. you know it was all Democratic

430
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
in the first phase of the debate about the affordable care act. it was democratic

431
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
congress and the democratic friends. they could not pass

432
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
the public option contacts in parents. um

433
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
like feel I've been super pessimistic this group I feel like I'm depressing you all but if they do it is important and

434
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't mean for you to stop fighting for these things because it's really important dialogue can move out so I don't

435
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
wanna force customers to come by but it is

436
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
possible things have changed now. enough to make additional progress

437
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
but I don't think it's gonna I I think there is absolutely no way the interest

438
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
groups would allow Medicare for all to come out no matter whether we

439
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
had all Democrats in Center Houston presidency or not.

440
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
so sorry which I do think we can progress make and the therefore that's

441
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
why at the care fact let's not sell that short it was a huge achievement.

442
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
we've been trying to get health care reform in this country for a hundred years. we got we had

443
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
two big moments in the history of health care insurance in the country. I think sixty five when we got

444
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Medicare Medicaid which was huge but possibly a mistake. if your goal with

445
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,000
in the second with the for the care. hundred years to get there

446
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
rates that we got there let's not so sure what a big achievement that was in

447
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
my view. we have opportunities to build on for it the character make it better. but

448
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
if we're not gonna throw out the insurance companies. we're not gonna throw out

449
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and we can talk more but you're gonna have to be later more I think about Medicare fraud and I do want you to understand

450
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the trade-offs that would be involved in Medicare from why it would be hard left

451
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and class can assess. I

452
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
to say. if Medicare for all. what do you see the

453
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
location consequences well we know

454
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
already that the affordable care act has improved equity. nice because the people that have benefited

455
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
the most from the affordable care act particular the people in the states. mean I

456
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
improved equity. but we so have huge problems like that. my meeting place. um you know the if people in states

457
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
where we've expanded Medicaid. so they have positively affected the

458
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
most the lowest income people in our state and has it improved and then we have some really good date on

459
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
this has reduced income inequality as result of their ability to have health insurance

460
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
coverage. so anything that moved us down the path where there

461
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
are fewer bankruptcies where people have lower co-pays and deductibles where health care is more affordable for

462
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
people so it doesn't take such a big chunk out of their income his movement for improved

463
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
taxes is not sufficient but it does have and

464
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
of course one of the problems with the affordable care act is the Supreme Court decision twenty twelve

465
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,000
which moves the Medicaid expansion options rather than as an additional five a lost

466
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
a requirement means we've actually increased equity between the space

467
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
right. so if you compare Michigan today in Michigan. today we have about

468
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
six percent of our population are uninsured compared to Texas. we're more than twenty percent

469
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
of the population I think it's under sure. I mean they had and most of those were uninsured in Texas

470
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
are black and brown and for people. um

471
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
you know equities are huge between the states right because so it's approved equities

472
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
some degree but not nearly enough and Medicare fraud would be

473
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:53,000
the same depending on what it looks like it would improve it but it's not gonna fix the problem

474
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
we solicited some questions from you with three hours or so

475
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
many issues any questions or one of those here. um some the of work with your

476
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
freeze quality your for France so uh so

477
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
whole whole variety of things and I just actually been talking about how to describe

478
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
work in a way that I I think is most useful and it very much along these lines

479
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
that you're asking about in terms of the equity and how you change the system with like where we're totally

480
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
within the current system which we're trying to do a lot to maintain Medicaid and maintain the Medicaid expansion which

481
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I think is um but how do we address something 's equity issues. so that

482
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
was the watchword right now and um it's it's stuff that's changed because we went from

483
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
a talking about issues that I think are so fundamentally important that are so happy to hear to having

484
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
these issues to me know being wise words I'm really stressed with their

485
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
buzzwords but this whole concept of social determinants of health and

486
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the idea of working on underlying poverty related issues to address

487
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
issues. I and this concept of integration is really fun.

488
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
so um you know and and just it was and then come back to

489
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
a specific project that we're working on. so when I when you know I told the governor asked me

490
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
to join her cabinet and uh and actually didn't even know what the department did

491
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
when I said yeah it's nice you know another one of those things and

492
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
she's the way she described it to me she was she said would you be willing to take a pause

493
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
from your public else from your health care and come join this cabinet which is I described

494
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
to you know deals with family programs and at the time that's exactly what I thought it was doing I was positive my health

495
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
care career. I was gonna go to work on the cabinet on these you know

496
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
positive related issues well. I should be expelled or maybe my diploma

497
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
should be revoked for school public house because you know what is more fundamental to house

498
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
property right I mean I I don't you know spent too many years with that mindset that was one of the houses

499
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
the medical care system medical care is a small percentage of stories talked about

500
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
the impact on health. it's much more about all these other environmental issues and

501
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
you know social issues and all of the other structures in

502
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
which is living and um grew up and so working on for poverty this

503
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
is the fourth of else to speak for if we can reduce inequities if we can reduce disparities.

504
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
if we can improve education for

505
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
our poorest children. um actually me to has the biggest impact

506
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
on the house and so what's exciting to me that where we are right now um is

507
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that there is more interest and understanding of that fundamental point and so one of the projects

508
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
for example that we're working on the chart. I a project like I funded us through

509
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovations finding the same thing with snow and steak innovation model

510
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
and we are trying to work with people who show up frequently

511
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
in the emergency department. once a month. frankly some of the people are working with shop once a

512
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
week. uh and emergency department but they generally show us they're not because these are people

513
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
who has you know serious forms of cancer or other medical diagnoses but

514
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
because these are people who are struggling with a whole range of human services many of them are substance abusers.

515
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
many of them have serious mental health issues. many of them are homeless for food

516
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
and so what we are trying to do is to connect those individuals

517
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
with organizations that can help them with their core underlying issue. so

518
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
we have put together an initiative that it includes community health workers working

519
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
with the agencies. we're doing this right here in two counties. agencies that

520
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
provide support of how people are homeless sweetie no health agencies substance

521
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
use programs. we're trying to connect them to those programs account manager in those programs

522
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
to help some address their core underlying issue with the goal of reducing

523
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
the downstream effects for the end up in the emergency department.

524
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
so if projects and if you have a good name for it we're actually from name the of the moment

525
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
this is my call the states in metric which doesn't take with descriptive but is an exciting

526
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
exciting projects that we've been engaged in for the past couple of years and hope to be

527
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
able to think we're doing a whole range of other projects kind of witnessed integration

528
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
integrating human services and health. we were doing from crazy for the foundation across

529
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
the country. I'm trying to help organizations with that product sector

530
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
integration work which is exciting relative the redesigned a long term care strategy.

531
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
um state Medicaid programs are the full repairs for long term care of the

532
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
country. others out of pocket and so we're trying to help them

533
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
think about us with an aging population how to redo that we're working with a lot of who you know health agencies

534
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
to figure out their trajectories going forward and how they can work better with managed care organizations

535
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
some of this information. so um we do a lot of work you know

536
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
seem of integration among others.

537
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
okay uh the father to a lobster. um it's

538
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
been in place for a number of years. one of the some of the strings for success is

539
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
a lot of there was some sort of friend. so yeah I

540
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
mean I think the strikes by some of the efforts that have been underway for the past several

541
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
years to undermine minus uh the states are really pretty clear. so. so

542
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
he's twenty sixteen. uh it's a roadside but in twenty fifteen at the end

543
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
of the Obama administration we have the lowest rate on insurance in the country have so

544
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
so we do know that for the care act has been effective in getting coverage

545
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
to lots of people lots of people who didn't before the portable carrier has been

546
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
affective. I in in getting you all to be able to have

547
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
coverage so you know enabling here keep to the excuse on their coverage

548
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
up until eight twenty five that didn't happen until the affordable care act so

549
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
expanded the access to health insurance company stuff.

550
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
we're part of a character. um we had done many things beyond on the coverage standpoint which are

551
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
really fun this is a description of this work that we're currently engaging on immigration is funded by the affordable

552
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
care act. calorie count. when you go to whatever get

553
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you know wherever you go to get a job or just do whatever they don't have those calorie helps us because

554
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
they were look at myself that didn't exist and what the requirements before we prevent

555
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
us a hundred percent coverage for a certain preventive exam. is because of the affordable

556
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
care um improves coverage for degree for seniors

557
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
for drugs because for the character 's mental health parity for people

558
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:25,000
with negative coverage is because of the fourth care and stronger help they'll charities because

559
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
there been investments in the workforce because of the affordable care act. there has been improvements

560
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
in investments in quality affairs because of the forces here in the form of characters currently

561
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
interwoven into and try system which is why there's a lot of food and taxes

562
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
that could invalidate the entire affordable care act is so frightening

563
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
to so many people because it is it's actually phenomenal to think about

564
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
all of the different ways for the characters shifter healthcare system not just the things people think

565
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
about with the individual insurance and mandate Medicaid expansion that's what people

566
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
but the act is much much more many many things on

567
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
the other week and this time those are also the affordable care act

568
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
did a good job of making healthcare more more affordable

569
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
but not enough affordable for for enough people so even though more people have coverage.

570
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
they still many people still have very high deductible co-pays and they still can't afford

571
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
care so health care still too expensive if I look you know I guess not.

572
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I mean the rate of increase in health care spending moderated with

573
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
the limitations are for the character with what the cost effectiveness and much the base but is moderated

574
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
around the same time but still health care is too expensive and if you are diabetic

575
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
insulin dependent you know very well um the how prices for prescription drugs and things like

576
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
that it increased to the point where people are again going to Canada to get their prescription drugs because

577
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
they can't force them out of pocket co-pays deductibles and you have to pay. so therefore the character

578
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
office for. if you are not eligible so eighty five percent of out of

579
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
the people who are getting coverage. uh and the health insurance marketplace bike covers themselves

580
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
getting it with a tax credit from the federal government. but if you are not eligible for that tax credit

581
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
then seniors premiums. the cost of health care if it's way too high and those people and trusting for now

582
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
coverage and so just hi Cordova carried intentionally left

583
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
out a undocumented immigrants. uh and of course the current instruction

584
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
is trying to make it much much harder for documented legal immigrants to get

585
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
coverage as well. so I can fix up on for the character was never intended to be universal coverage.

586
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
let's be clear about that. always from when it was passed due it it always assumed to be about

587
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
five percent of the population who would not have coverage and that's because there are certain people exempted from the masses and

588
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
certain people like immigrants words intentionally like that. so it didn't

589
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
stick it needed to you know fix the problem of too many people

590
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and the affordable care act much as people described as socialized medicine

591
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
that's absolutely absolutely ridiculous it is by no means um and

592
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it's been fixed but it's fragmentation the healthcare system that we were talking about earlier in terms of the ministry to come.

593
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
we still have what it always did was feeling the get incremental loss really sealed

594
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
in the gaps still a lot. but it didn't change the fundamental

595
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
system right. it expanded Medicare and he is provided to pass

596
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
for people to buy insurance themselves. um even if they pretty interested and make

597
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
it someone more affordable in fields on the existing fragmented non- system of care

598
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
to do anything at six and so out of the problems this

599
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
masterful.

600
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,000
okay. um in recent years ago the number of changes to Obamacare

601
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:16,000
including appeals and

602
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
we do work performance for savings citizens to receive Medicaid in

603
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
the effect of these changes with the for health care system. okay. um

604
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
so very very different questions I mean start with the Medicaid work requirements. question first of all because that

605
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
is a fish saddle in the court for some moments. so we only have experience actually Medicaid

606
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
for for parents and once today only going into fashion one state every

607
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
stop so far. we'll seen the skins on the cost. waiting

608
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
anything now for a lawsuit against Michigan Michigan South work requirements. but every other state

609
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
has either pause to work than and I legal action against the state before

610
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the work went into effect so we don't have expensive what famous Arkansas. with the

611
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
work requirement be going into the and facts in that state thousands of people lost

612
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and most of it it when was for the time it's just no longer in effect because it's in the courts

613
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
um. but for the for the reason that people lost coverage wasn't so much because people

614
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
weren't working. it was because I think people work just possible and they had such a hard time.

615
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
uh you know in the way Arkansas implemented and it was all online if you're in a rural area and you

616
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
know ask us for bad. you can't fill out the forms I mean some people are losing coverage. not

617
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
because they wanna comply with it because they just didn't want to do the paperwork

618
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and we know frankly from people who are Medicaid people in are who poverty and

619
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
if you've never been part of New York never spending time with people in poverty I say that's a state legislators

620
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
and others all the time spent some time with people and lives it's. really

621
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
easy to bring a middle class values middle class experience and be really super judgmental

622
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
people who grow up in chaotic difficult environments don't have access

623
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
to informal supports that many of us take for granted and so any barriers

624
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
for people who are popping any barriers. any additional paperwork any additional food

625
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
people have to go through automatically feeds the people just want to

626
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
understand the majority of the two or

627
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
single small children and disabled and

628
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
so you don't have large for the charts

629
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
people body single moms would be considered able to find the toll

630
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
road they put on security should feel secure for children and just

631
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
generally not like some women and men in Michigan for example where the crime

632
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
is going to affect only found for six months for sorry face sex with able

633
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,000
to select the mom or not. so and

634
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
with the Medicare expansion. also petty single without

635
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
children or single women that have children now eligible. so there you know the demographic

636
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
are changes still it's predominantly women in terms of not surprised been

637
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
but still the demographics are changing the bigger issue with Medicaid some for people and they

638
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
get workers or if they're working the wage jobs for the health insurance for the

639
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
working part time jobs aren't accessible they don't have the education and training.

640
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,000
you don't have to transportation. so so we this the real problem

641
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
with the Medicare work permits both in terms of coverage if you believe in universal coverage. need I to play phone

642
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,000
is in Michigan. the guy who is most responsible for Medicaid were the parents

643
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and they're sure if he gets very clear about this health care the privilege not arrive. people should

644
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
have to work together. you if does not believe that universal coverage is about.

645
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
he believe it is. for you should only got a few works

646
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
what we know and look safer who runs the particular center here and I am one of our

647
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
college to trainer and Paris he wrote an op-ed because we look this is social work because works been

648
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,000
required for public assistance programs for food assistance and things like that. work requirements

649
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,000
don't work to increase workforce. patience so if

650
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
the school is truly what people say as opposed to what people really believe. if the goal is

651
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
to know you people participation the workforce work with my system. it's

652
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
not the people need us there. you need help. thanks. uh

653
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't really think that I think for most people want work across the goal is to reduce the number of people

654
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
who are delusional stuff and so that so

655
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
work requirements. um you know the data we have so far as they will actually reduce the number

656
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
of shares but this is big question ends in the courts right now because

657
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Medicaid doesn't say anything about so the way the department of health and human services tried

658
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
to justify the work requirements for Medicaid to was say will it make you healthier because

659
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
work is a good thing and if you're working you're gonna be healthy and there's nothing in

660
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,000
the Medicaid law that says us to go with Medicaid goal and Medicaid market to provide coverage

661
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
and so the work to be challenged on what the what Congress is intended for

662
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
kinetic Medicaid. the other point that we know from some

663
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
of the research here actually is that is a question of cost fact of

664
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
um do you get healthier because you're working and then you got health insurance or

665
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
do you get health care coverage get your medical issues dealt with and then you can and some of

666
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
the things that we have seems to be more along long but louder than the form or another where

667
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
that it's a prerequisite that helps scars to be able to get work not

668
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
right so there's lots to talk about and I can work from the remote part of the management

669
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
individual minutes so that's a different story. a lot of people for Texas

670
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
and time will tell us when lotta people predicted that with the elimination nothing individual

671
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:23,000
mandate some requirements that people have health insurance coverage that would see a big uh a lot of

672
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
people dropping coverage and the people who are uninsured we have not seen.

673
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
we have seen the rate of uninsured go unclear

674
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,000
whether it's due to the individual mandate Los Angeles to is it which just

675
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
went into effect this year. so we don't have a lot of time with over the experience it's the people

676
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
talk about it for a while but it's just been into effect this. year so we don't know yet

677
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,000
whether healthy and issue that is there are a lot of reasons for people to get health insurance

678
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
coverage if and they're getting subsidies and if they're good and it's easy for them to get it

679
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
under some recent people will continue to go to overtime the predictions are that

680
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,000
without the individual mandate people. prices keep going up before we start tracking

681
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
individual six or seven hundred dollars.

682
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,000
but so in the very first year it was six hundred ninety five dollars a year and individual

683
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
or one percent of income goes up. what else time. so but it was small and efficiently

684
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
right relative to the relative cost of not sure how much right so. so it wasn't enough

685
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
to offset the you're course paying the penalty getting up for it falsifying health insurance

686
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,000
get um

687
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
okay well you know you if questions sort of coverage.

688
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:56,000
introduced to be in the news and it's likely be to central to work for the jewelers.

689
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
you do what think about the various options discussed today. about the public option too long

690
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
me to single-payer a football. if you could use

691
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
the pool. hopefully fact some of the drugstore. yeah I have some

692
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
friends but let me talk a little bit more about the anybody watch that kind I'm of today punishment. if you if

693
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
did. so how much time do they spend talking about health care last night.

694
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
small thing and it was about other things for reflective rates and things like that. if you watch

695
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
any of the earlier debates how much time they spend on health care. I guess last night.

696
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
so they learn something. I hopefully something the Medicare for all the basics

697
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
and not wanna move consumers care it's a fairy

698
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
very technical face and I'm trying to the debate in Detroit I just that's really drug crazy because

699
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
it's the base with again the phase ninety percent of the audience in

700
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
the fox theater in Detroit during the democrats they had no clue what they were talking to who's

701
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
this is very much a technical within the party about the best way to get to universal

702
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:13,000
coverage. my friends all the parties. there's a very big buys between what the Republicans

703
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:19,000
and the Republican study group just came out with a new proposal for health care reform quote. uh

704
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
and um just a big difference between what the Republicans official positions

705
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
on health care is what this Democratic official position on health by everybody on

706
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
the Democratic side. police least university in universal coverage. we said health insurance.

707
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
so she's good. they have different technical ways to get there and I got my view

708
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
it's very pragmatic of what's politically feasible. I want to improve what we have. I don't wanna

709
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
make the perfect the enemy of the good stuff where I can. so there

710
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
are several all fine on the side of the question what the Republicans want to do. if

711
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
you read the remote is that a group probably just came out a few weeks ago because they want to essentially

712
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
take apart the affordable care act. you know go to block grants which we can talk about that is for Medicaid.

713
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I get rid of all the protections for pre-existing conditions. I can increase get rid of the tax

714
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
credits entirely and you have high risk pools and things like that. talk about what those things are that

715
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
is a fundamental decisions of health care which will increase the people around

716
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
the short increase income inequality increasing not decreasing. I

717
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,000
am a health care less affordable. so there's a very big divide between those two.

718
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
what consumers care about. it's really not Medicare for all versus

719
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Medicare for those to choose versus for Medicare for all this

720
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
we call it for ACA to point you know whatever if that's all they care they care about wire

721
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:54,000
my prescription drug costs too high wide awake to Michael paces I suppose why can I pay my friend

722
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
my why is health care so much money that it's what they and

723
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
this debate about whether we pay for health care through the tax system or whether we pay for health care

724
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
through premiums or whether we pay for for instance that is not where most consumers and

725
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and if you have an opportunity to go to any of these town halls I just love going

726
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
with our congresspeople to do town halls to hear on health care. listen to what people

727
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
say what the questions are asking asking why do we have to go to Canada financial has

728
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
nothing to do with Medicare for all ETA to play all Democrats a great government should be able to

729
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:37,000
negotiate prices. we can talk about how feasible that is what they all agree on that.

730
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
so we have to address the more fun. wire price

731
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
markup isn't effective so why does help yourself on the affordable in this country

732
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
and should we be able to make it more affordable. that's coming up the before question not advertising any details

733
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
except a little bit around. how do you change the picture

734
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
with employers still most people guess how cumbersome. I don't know

735
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
why employers offer coverage. yeah I mean that's equally American sort

736
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
of received weekly American in terms of why we have had again

737
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
for the first three hour lecture but I'm happy to tell you that one

738
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
piece of a slider we have uh in employer sponsored health clubs there's a lot of review live players of coverage

739
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I will back to seventeen ninety. because the start of fast but the time when it's where the funds

740
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
are covered really step out of in the country during World War II. um when

741
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
we had wage and price controls established so employers couldn't

742
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
raise the wages they need to work force. we couldn't raise wages to attract

743
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
in the workforce but they put a ad and that is really one health benefits through

744
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
employment got more deeply embedded in the sky and

745
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
necklaces for this country. roll something big

746
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:07,000
was happening from Houston in World War II is a big motivator not the way it's

747
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:15,000
not exactly what happened to you know but it is held Great Britain because the world.

748
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
some start

749
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:33,000
they're looking to you for

750
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
questions about affordable

751
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
care 's system. Bernie versus something

752
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:56,000
me food. uh-huh. any of them.

753
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
uh I don't think there's anything specific on native Americans and the affordable

754
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
care at all that

755
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
good of a paper you're doing uh-huh

756
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,000
uh-huh uh-huh I got the other. uh-huh

757
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
uh-huh what do better. my other right uh-huh uh-huh

758
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
uh-huh uh-huh I mean I not enough is really bad. don't know specifically

759
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,000
um but there was a lot of things done on the state of Americans actually the same of them are some interesting things

760
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:45,000
and I think in a real sense for us.

761
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I mean everything was clear now when you can when you watch the debates don't know exactly what they're talking about

762
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:00,000
going into all the course

763
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:08,000
from earlier today when

764
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
those single mothers or

765
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Missus you know

766
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
like come here yeah you know I was one of the big debates I mean I that's one of the issues and actually one

767
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
of the one of the weird things about the Medicaid work in terms pieces medicated

768
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
for fear of it in front funding any work support whatsoever and child

769
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
care is a work right hand so they're gonna be a few requirements placed on people

770
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
's without any help whether it's a very critical issue which is child care when

771
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
welfare was reformed sensuously fund. I don't really like that weird. anyway when welfare was changed in the

772
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
country in nineteen ninety two which also requires work in order to get cash

773
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
assistance. I believe that there was funding provided for child. I was in

774
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I mean in Michigan that just out of state but a few years ago.

775
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
we were paying basically two dollars and you also got to know

776
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,000
how much out here. good job here really cost by believers of my cost dollars an hour. and so most of our kids

777
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:24,000
who are in poverty are getting childcare paid for and the childcare is been delivered by a relative and

778
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
and the relative is often times and you live in in Kenya and we know

779
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
from all the brain research that the first three years of life are the most critical for

780
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
children in terms of a five percent of their branches qualify to for you.

781
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,000
so having a really quality child care that's really is it's really very important and

782
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Medicaid workarounds provides nothing questions

783
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:02,000
over

784
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
your head like the right

785
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
now. so it was too low but we we know what to do to lower position drug prices and this comes back to

786
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
put the question a few facilities a lot more difficult right so if any if you are interested in the topic

787
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
and you end up watching any congressional hearings on if you will you will see a lot of scene you'll get a letter

788
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,000
saying to New York because there's a lot of obfuscation about what's happening with us because

789
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
it's if you look at how much money is made and who makes that money is for one of the

790
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
most complex project. talk about waste and inefficiency in the system it's in scoop the drugs

791
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:45,000
it's unbelievable supply chain but the people make the most money for for discussion drugs and the manufacturers

792
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
the manufacturer say that they are spending all this money on research and development.

793
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
that's why prices are so high. um there is a little bit of

794
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:01,000
elements there but for the most part that's poppycock because what we're seeing right now is the pools

795
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
guard drugs where they've been on the market for years. many

796
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
of them the research was actually done with federal funding. uh and they are still bumping

797
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,000
up prices for absolutely no reason so I need you a carry around in a beep and

798
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
you know did you go through the specific price increase for the happy pen has to remember how much it went the for if

799
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
you had a pay six

800
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
hundred dollars and went from a hundred fifty eight to six hundred and just like a year to for the

801
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
generic drugs and is not under pressure and the drug itself cost about two dollars

802
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,000
to make. so what was patented with the drug supply

803
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:48,000
pants right that was what counted was and it was owned by a company that had a patent

804
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
and where they had no competitors where they were anticipating competitors were gonna come into the market.

805
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
so in anticipation really they were trying to get as much money as they possibly could. the

806
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
last years about patents. they [INAUDIBLE] up the prices with no controls how does

807
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,000
every other country control the cost of drugs or why they're cost lower control prices.

808
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,000
so we don't control price. we left this kind of egregious pricing freeze for

809
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
an old line generic drugs a happen with absolutely no no second

810
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
guessing the patrols we don't even like to Medicare negotiate directly for prices

811
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and Medicaid is required to cover every every after two truck so there's very

812
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
few limits on what those changes are pretty clear right we need to have

813
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
some mechanisms especially for these old card generics to control the price of

814
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
drugs whether we'll get there or not. I got the single biggest lobby in Washington for this

815
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
final prescription drugs. our first step would be

816
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
to make them choice. why they increase their prices under fifty percent. we shame them.

817
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,000
you know what that actually was from the ministrations tried to increase price transparency

818
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
a pharmaceutical manufacturer 's went to court and they gotta stay on any public 's a

819
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
unique if a nation up their. so it's gonna be a uh-huh um but

820
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I I think it's somewhat doable. if we take it in small stuff.

821
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:27,000
um. 's.

822
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:38,000
over the estimate I mean Americans again I

823
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,000
the Indian health service. their separate fax.

824
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and I you know really I have to go back and look at anything in report repairs any

825
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
effect on the news health service. a. I really don't remember I don't remember anything

826
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
begins in there that focus on that goes back much further.

827
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
okay

828
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
thank you.

829
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,000
not my uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um

830
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
think I we are fighting for maybe more more questions

831
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,000
video. yeah. so what is the main reason

832
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,000
why

833
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,000
does you know I mean I think that's a really important question why do they wanna review what they say publicly

834
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
versus what's the real reason that they wanna feel it so I kinda comes back to

835
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
the score philosophy having universal coverage was never part of the Republicans it's and

836
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
never been goals or something you know policy which is

837
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
a whole lot of they wanna refill it it's a political issue

838
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
there are some believers some some people who are just true believers that is too much government involvement

839
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:16,000
in health care. again this is issue of marketplace versus social good that's there's too

840
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
much government regulations and they're simply opposed to the idea of government stepping in and

841
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
having any sort of regulations on health care. there are some

842
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
you know Paul Ryan when he was the speaker of the house. he wanted to totally convert Medicare

843
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
or to premium support program which means getting rid of all the protections in terms of

844
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
benefits and is giving people a lot of money and you go buy health insurance yourself and that's all you got

845
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
do so there's a philosophical divide I believe is legitimate. if people described

846
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,000
it is a philosophical side the problem is they don't want to say that's what the real issues. I also

847
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,000
say that it's not we need to have more market forces and the affordable care

848
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
excuse the marketplace. it's really that's why they have so much difficulty with the feeling of replacing

849
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
it because they're more talking points were that we need more

850
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
market forces in the plant before the character was actually written by Republicans

851
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
back in the mid nineties to be a marketplace finance and then adopted by the Democrats leaders

852
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,000
to try to get by for support the so it's very hard for them to come up with an alternative plan

853
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
that is based on their talking points because they're talking points to represent the real

854
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
solutions really a political viewpoint of what the government should

855
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
do. so my last comments before a break because I think it's just fascinating and again my tell

856
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
you all take policy class and it's just a technical process.

857
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
when they Republicans for starters. they were posted for the car because were some people every

858
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
thing about it right so there's a lot of politics around and if they wanted to just

859
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
say we've just for a few it and just go back to what we have before to just feel about the Martha Stewart thing.

860
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
um but they were advised by consultants that that was really bad for reasons

861
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
like that I wouldn't go over very well politically until the consultant status of them and we had some documentation

862
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,000
is in some senses that you describe it somewhat different. why don't you describe it as

863
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,000
we wanna repeal and replace it with something set up. so it was all the

864
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
repeal and replace with all the marks. they never had any intentions replace they always

865
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:37,980
only had. so here we go
