1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:11,060
So. And you would go, okay.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,950
Right here. All right. So question one.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:26,930
And this had to do with the commensal bacteria. And the question is, what are two ways and commensal bacteria prevent infection with pathogens?

4
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,569
So and again, I had this open note, open book in the book.

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,660
Chapter of the book is there in case it's a great resource.

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,590
It's long, but you can do search and you can find answers very quickly in that book chapter.

7
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:50,930
So what were the two things that the commensal bacteria do for you to prevent you getting infected from a pathogen?

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,560
We talked about one of those in class in the Vitamin eight paper. Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:08,320
Yeah. In the vitamin peepers. Those, like, conventional mice had a higher expression in the resistant brown.

10
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:17,320
Yeah. The antimicrobial peptide. If you were to decontaminate your skin with something that kills everything, you know,

11
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,430
alcohol or just some type of antimicrobial agent, you would dismantle that function.

12
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:32,020
Okay, so you hear a lot of talk nowadays about when you have an infection or a cut.

13
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,629
The first thing you should do is wash your hands or whatever the is with soap and water.

14
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:46,150
Right. Because if you if you can completely decontaminate that area, there's the potential for, you know,

15
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:52,690
infection by while you're not getting the antimicrobial response that could occur and so on.

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,920
What's the other thing that the commensal bacteria do?

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,660
They compete for nutrients with the pathogen? Yes. Yeah.

18
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,910
So they can outcompete the pathogens.

19
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:18,910
And this is why you have a I help you try to have a healthy skin microbiota and that those are the two main things that I was looking for.

20
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:28,660
Okay. So there are drugs that are used to treat allergy.

21
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:37,210
And in this particular one, this particular drug, reduced mast cells to granulation.

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:46,600
We talked about what mast cells do in particular. So that was the only thing that you mentioned about what mast cells do in terms of host events.

23
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,770
And so what's the correct answer if some some of you missed this one?

24
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:59,410
It's in all infections. Is the bacterial infections is that viral infections are helminth infections, which are parasitic infections?

25
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,729
Oh, yeah. And how much of this is a worm?

26
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:16,030
It's a parasite that can live in you. And then if you suppress the mast cells, you can you would be more susceptible to these types of infections.

27
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,510
So number three, which of the following events do not occur during inflammation?

28
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,760
Everybody I think got this one right. Cytokines, secretion, chemokine, secretion.

29
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,300
Recruitment of innate immune cells or constriction of blood vessels.

30
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,920
Right. There's usually a dilation. Right. That's part of the the cardinal signs of of inflammation.

31
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:52,360
And then question number four Which of the following cell types is an important link between the innate and the adaptive immune response?

32
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,570
Said Neutrophils A B cell, a dendritic cell or a T cell.

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:08,570
Dendritic cell is a dendritic cell. Right. So remember the illustration you had the infection, the recruitment of immune cells,

34
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,200
and then one cell type, the dendritic cell grabbed on to that bacteria,

35
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:23,180
antigens from that bacteria, and it went into the associated lymph nodes and presented the antigen to the T cells in B cells.

36
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,429
In the very last I'm sorry, two questions.

37
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,430
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

38
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:40,760
So this was a matching question. Everybody got this right in terms of what macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells and mast cells do.

39
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,980
And, you know, so that that map of the macrophage can phagocytosis.

40
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,890
It has bactericidal mechanisms in it and it can present antigens.

41
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,660
Neutrophils don't present antigens, they do with everything the macrophage does.

42
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:08,780
So they can kill things and they can phagocytosis, pathogens.

43
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,650
The natural killer cells is the cell type that kills virus infected cells and tumor cells,

44
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,390
and the mass cell releases its granules, histamine and that and other types of active agents within the granules.

45
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:36,060
So everybody got that one correct. The question number six, the innate immune response is specific to a particular pathogen and immunologic memory.

46
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,499
True or false? And this was false.

47
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:49,470
And everybody got that right. It's the adaptive immune system that provides memory and specific that is specific to a particular pathogen.

48
00:05:51,060 --> 00:06:00,709
Question seven. Epithelial surfaces provide the first line of defense against infection by the use of several types of mechanisms.

49
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:11,750
One of the chemical mechanisms used by the epithelial cells is and the key here is chemical, and that would be the correct answer.

50
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,680
Here was the antimicrobial peptides by the epithelial cells,

51
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,690
and that was what was in the table that you saw with the different mechanisms that the different lines of host events perform.

52
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,800
So that was the answer here and then.

53
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,429
And any questions about this, this one? Okay.

54
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,500
Set clear for questioning, Mike.

55
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,380
Mucosal surfaces and external epithelium are major sites of pathogenic infection.

56
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,770
Mucosal surfaces are found in tissues of the GI tract.

57
00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:00,450
The reproductive tract in the mouth and respiratory tract of the mouth and the respiratory tract are roots of virus, but not bacterial infections.

58
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,190
The gastrointestinal tract is the root for bacterial but not virus infections.

59
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:13,040
And that's everybody got that right. It's false. And then the very last one.

60
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:24,720
This is a lot of people missed this one. So this had to do with the innate immune response to infection.

61
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,740
So you had antibodies and you have complement proteins and you have phagocytic cells

62
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:42,950
and they can clear or ingest bacteria and viruses and worms and even protozoans.

63
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:51,970
But the difference between the virus and the virus infected cell is that the virus infected cells, the virus is inside the cell.

64
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:04,910
So when it's inside the cell, none of these mechanisms will work to help that cell or help clear that virus in the cell because it's protective.

65
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,890
It's hiding inside the cell. And that's why this one was the answer here.

66
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,510
Okay, everybody. Everybody sees that. All right, cool.

67
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:27,740
All right. So let's go on to. September.

68
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:37,330
Which is. I did it again.

69
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:50,680
Twice. So I came across this paper a year ago and I thought it was fascinating.

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
Did you did you all think this is an interesting paper? Yeah.

71
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,410
We all hear these messages about you should fruit and vegetables. Why?

72
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,780
Well, we have just associations with this. Actually look for a causal relationship.

73
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,150
So the title of the paper,

74
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:16,180
Dietary Fruit and Vegetable Supplementation suppresses diet induced after sclerosis and LDL knockout mice early on that receptor knockout mice.

75
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:27,380
So here's some background about heart disease. It is still the leading cause of death in the US, about over 600,000 cases per year.

76
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,360
It would be a lot higher if it weren't for statin drugs.

77
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:42,650
Stafford Drugs have prevented a lot of cardiovascular atherosclerotic deaths.

78
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:50,270
So keep that in mind. But this illustration kind of goes over the process that occurs.

79
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:59,510
And so the plaque that forms in the arterial wall is the problem here.

80
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,330
And it's initiated by lipids, oxidized lipids in particular.

81
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,720
So the very first little caption here is the arterial wall.

82
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:20,270
And the first thing that you see here at the end of the little cells in there are different layers of cells here.

83
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,410
There's the intimate layer. There's the media layer. Intimate layer.

84
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:37,250
You have some muscle cells, you might have some fibroblasts, but but mostly smooth muscle cells here in this healthy, normal, young arterial wall.

85
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:53,090
When you have the presence of oxidized lipids, which are showing the bomb cell formation here,

86
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,930
it's the oxidized lipids that can initiate these responses.

87
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:11,330
So the oxidized lipids, the LDL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, especially the really dense LDL cholesterol, can get into the arterial wall.

88
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,239
And I don't show a picture of it here.

89
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:23,390
But when you look at coronary arteries and you look at where this occurs, it usually occurs around the branches of the artery.

90
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:35,600
So the flow of the LDL, LDL cholesterol follows the pattern of the flow and it embeds the low density lipoproteins.

91
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:44,750
They they embed themselves within the arterial wall and they initiate this process.

92
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:54,620
So you have these oxidized lipids and the LDL cholesterol and the LDL cholesterol initiates this inflammatory response.

93
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,129
So you have a lot of things going on here in the arterial wall.

94
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:08,300
You have the initial insult is the oxidized LDL,

95
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:19,520
which activates the local immune response that recruits monocytes from the blood and they're recruited into this space.

96
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,760
And those cells differentiate into macrophages.

97
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:33,020
And when they see the oxidized surface of the lipids and the LDL cholesterol, they gobble them up and they become foam cells.

98
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:39,050
And the foam cells can accumulate and contribute to a greater inflammation.

99
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,970
They can recruit t cells, which is shown here into this into the wall.

100
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,680
And you have this really complex immunologic environment.

101
00:12:52,700 --> 00:13:03,560
So. As the process develops here, you start to see a narrowing of the movement in the artery.

102
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:12,440
And what's happening here is the smooth muscle cells within that artery are increasing in number.

103
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,260
So you have more of these and then you have college and build up.

104
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:28,100
So this is a structural protein that's formed by the fiberglass, and so the fiberglass become activated by this proinflammatory environment.

105
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,350
So the foam cells are producing pro-inflammatory mediators.

106
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,300
Here's a cholesterol crystal that you can see embedded within the arterial wall.

107
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,920
And then that macrophages within the arterial wall can die.

108
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,220
And that causes a lot of problems.

109
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:58,820
And to make matters worse, you actually can see some micro vasculature forming within these arterial lesions shown here.

110
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:06,920
That's feeding the cells, the immune cells and the smooth muscle cells to get them to proliferate.

111
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:21,350
And over time, the arterial wall expands and it can actually completely occlude the artery, especially the smaller ones.

112
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,070
And here's an example of what can happen as a consequence of this building up.

113
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:38,660
So you formed this lipid core because you have a lot of these phone cells that have accumulated and you have these cholesterol crystals.

114
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:47,540
So this area swells inside this arterial lesion and it becomes weak and it can rupture.

115
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:57,200
So this is an injured arterial wall that has ruptured.

116
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:05,630
And you have this fibrous cap here with platelet aggregation forming a thrombus

117
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:12,920
which can go down into the arterial tree and block the smaller arterials,

118
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:21,920
causing a myocardial infarction. And so this is just an overall summary of the atherosclerotic process.

119
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,360
If you've heard this before, right? Everybody has seen this before.

120
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:39,970
Okay. So the first question is describe atherosclerosis, a multifactorial disease.

121
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,510
Who wants to answer this question? They mention a bunch of triggers and risk factors here.

122
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,210
Go ahead, Abby. Some of the risk factors for people like.

123
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,580
Diabetes, high blood pressure. Iron.

124
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:26,050
Yes. Smoking atherosclerotic disease becomes more common with obesity, physical inactivity, high saturated fat.

125
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:32,349
So high blood pressure, triglycerides, we have more lipid around.

126
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:39,190
Right. And in some cases with obesity, you don't have to have obesity to have heart disease.

127
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,690
In some cases, obesity still induces the injury.

128
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:50,680
Right. It's the when you overload the adipocytes that can't take up all of that lipid, it has to go somewhere.

129
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,239
It goes in the liver or it goes in the blood. And that's why you see a higher risk.

130
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,319
That's why this is a risk factor for this condition. Smoking.

131
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:12,130
What smoking does is it oxidizes the LDL cholesterol and that makes it taken up more avidly by the monocytes that are in the arterial wall.

132
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:21,550
Diabetes, you have elevated glucose, have elevated blood lipids, and now that's what contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion.

133
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:29,500
Physical inactivity contributes to a lot of these issues.

134
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:38,440
The heart isn't conditioned as well to handle less blood flow as a consequence of being less physically fit.

135
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:45,700
And then if you have a diet that's high in saturated fat, this can contribute to this condition.

136
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,900
And we'll talk a bit about how they formulated the diet here to induce these changes in the mice.

137
00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:05,590
So how other things, pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor, alpha, oxidative stress.

138
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,340
So these are things like levels of reactive oxygen species.

139
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:20,860
You can have damage to biomolecules, lipid peroxidation DNA and RNA damage.

140
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:33,310
Antioxidant molecules are upregulated. You have dyslipidemia, elevated blood levels, total cholesterol, lower HDL cholesterol.

141
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:46,330
So for men and women, it's a little bit different because men have lower levels of HDL cholesterol than women and then help LDL cholesterol here.

142
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:55,900
It limits the thresholds you want to be low. So triglycerides also an important contributing factor.

143
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,980
So these are these are many of the factors that contribute to this process of atherosclerosis.

144
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:11,720
All right. Then they talk a bit about Snaffled and how it's related to cardiovascular disease.

145
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:19,220
Does anybody want to here's a cartoon. Anybody want to talk about how this these two are related?

146
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,420
Yeah. This is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

147
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,990
Yes. It's characterized by headaches.

148
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:34,330
Ptosis. Yes, excess fat in the liver, not related to alcohol consumption.

149
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,060
And that can develop into hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and.

150
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,040
Then the liver and then has similar risk factors to cardiovascular disease.

151
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:52,070
And that kind of synthesis itself is also a risk factor for after a services.

152
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,180
Yeah, very good. So here's the liver.

153
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:09,260
Liver contributing to this. Um, so you have, um, pi one here at the top and that is a clotting factor that enhances thrombus formation.

154
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,570
So when you have more lipid fat, this is produced at higher quantities.

155
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:25,190
You have the liver producing pro-inflammatory cytokines that get into the systemic circulation, producing this low grade inflammation.

156
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:33,410
If you were to measure the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, they would be very low, but they'd be above baseline.

157
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,250
If you were to measure pro-inflammatory cytokines at the site of infection, they'd would be much, much higher.

158
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,820
But this low grade state of inflammation is supposed to be.

159
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:51,410
This is thought to contribute to lots of different kinds of diseases, including cardiovascular disease.

160
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,970
And then this particular figure refers to a hepatic kind, that to an A,

161
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,730
and this is thought to contribute to this process of cardiovascular disease as well.

162
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:12,080
And then you can have an issue here with insulin resistance.

163
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:23,090
So when there's is insulin resistance in the liver, this can lead to greater glucose output raising.

164
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,630
Glucose levels and this will affect lipid levels.

165
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,290
And you have here elevated levels of very low density cholesterol.

166
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:48,950
And you have these bone cells now within the arterial wall that take up the oxidized lipids and very low density

167
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:58,460
cholesterol and contributing to the platform reaction in an arm and heart in an artery that feeds the heart muscle.

168
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,550
Okay. So that's how these two are related.

169
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:14,950
All right. And then the authors talk about the American Heart Association's recommendations regarding dietary fruit and vegetable intake.

170
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,550
So what are the recommendations?

171
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,040
How many fruits and vegetables could servings of fruits and vegetables should you consume every day?

172
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,630
Fortified. 4 to 5 fruits and veggies total or of each of each.

173
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,610
Right. So it's kind of 8 to 9 or nine. Right. So what's a serving?

174
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:52,220
Well, a medium fruit, medium size apple. That's one serving half a cup of whole fruit, a quarter cup of dried fruit, doesn't it?

175
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,990
But different examples of a serving.

176
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:04,670
Okay, for vegetables, you get a cup of leafy vegetables or half a cup of raw frozen canned vegetables or canned vegetables.

177
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,700
Examples of what a serving would look like or would you would consume.

178
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,330
So that's nine servings of fruits and vegetables every day.

179
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,530
Do most people do that? No. Most people don't do that.

180
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,270
Most people don't get enough. And it's expensive.

181
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,879
The back to back get fresh fruits and vegetables. And that's part of the problem.

182
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,900
Like people don't get enough.

183
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:42,169
And the other part is people don't like fruits and vegetables very much and are replacing them with all kinds of other calories.

184
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:51,430
And that's that's a problem. So these are the recommendations.

185
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:58,870
And by the time you get to adulthood, you hear about these all the time.

186
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,210
But what's the evidence that supports the recommendation?

187
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:16,160
Yeah. And I think in the paper it said that there were observational studies that increased fruit and

188
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:21,770
vegetable consumption to improve dyslipidemia and the consumption of fruits and veggies artificially.

189
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:28,810
To your first friends. Oxidative stress. However, those are observational studies and are not.

190
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,590
Yeah. Yes. So you have a population, right?

191
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:42,909
And you pick people. All right. Let's look at fruit and vegetable consumption based on individual reported intakes.

192
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,300
Right. So people are reporting their dietary intake, which can be biased.

193
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:53,170
And you get, um, um, like, like you said, um, associations,

194
00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:01,930
they're inversely associated with biomarkers and oxidative stress and there's a lack of intervention studies to prove or there's been,

195
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,380
there have been intervention studies that show that it can improve dyslipidemia.

196
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:19,430
And some of the studies look like this. So this is from the Nurses Health Study and the health professionals follow up study.

197
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:29,250
So these are cohorts of health care professionals that have been followed for a year.

198
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:39,020
So this is a longitudinal study and they're collecting all kinds of information about health outcomes in these individuals and their dietary intake.

199
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:46,700
And on the X axis in this particular figure, we have fruit and vegetable intake, servings per day.

200
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,080
And then on the Y axis, you have relative risk for coronary heart disease.

201
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,180
And as you said, the that's the fruit and vegetable intake increases.

202
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,070
This is associated with a lower coronary heart disease.

203
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:07,610
Now, what are concerned? What are some. So these are people 34 to 59 years of age.

204
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:15,140
So this is there were 84,000 women and about 42,000 men in this study, middle aged, elderly.

205
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,840
So the women were followed up for 14 years and the men were followed up for eight years.

206
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,660
Okay. So what are some confounding factors associated with this?

207
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:36,090
Yeah. And that. While there is way more women than men in this study.

208
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:44,350
And then also the difference. How long they were followed because like the freshmen for eight years,

209
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:55,540
like even developed CB like way later in life and if those weren't captured in the data collection and that's probably a very confounding variable.

210
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,180
Also the fact that these people were health professionals who are probably very

211
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,230
health literate and know the pros and cons of eating fruits and vegetables,

212
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,310
they're probably more likely to eat healthier in general.

213
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:15,600
Yeah. You know, Abby, I also think that the age ranges are similar.

214
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,879
Like, they overlap, but they're not the same. Like, why didn't they include men in their thirties?

215
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,870
Or why did they not include any women over the age of 59?

216
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,820
And then also, I'm curious as to why they didn't include anyone in their twenties.

217
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,980
Yeah, that's why they had they have the data.

218
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,250
But this data worked. Let's just say that.

219
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:48,850
So this is the kind of data that you get and this is the kind of evidence that was provided to make these types of recommendations.

220
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,800
Okay. Based on these epi studies.

221
00:27:51,640 --> 00:28:01,120
So, like you said, these are health care professionals and they're aware of the benefits of fruits and vegetables in their diet.

222
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,600
And they're also aware that smoking is a risk factor for sclerosis.

223
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,069
Right. They're also aware that exercise is important.

224
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,090
So these are two two things that these individuals will be aware of.

225
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:23,770
And the prevalence of these factors might be influenced by their occupation.

226
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:35,350
Right. So this is this is associated evidence we need we would the best thing to have in terms of evidence is casual evidence,

227
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:43,960
where you can look at an intervention and look at outcomes later on and see if there's a benefit or not.

228
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,199
So. So what was the hypothesis in the paper?

229
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,980
And how could this research support the American Heart Association's dietary recommendations for fruit and vegetable consumption?

230
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:09,180
Go ahead. They have said that the increased fruit and vegetable consumption a way to either

231
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:19,980
prevent or so that upper classes by decreasing that dysbiosis and different things.

232
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:32,790
Yeah. Very good. And so they wanted to explore some of these underlying mechanisms as well in terms of whether or not that the intervention had a,

233
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:41,610
an impact on preventing atherosclerosis, preventing the pathologies, and then, um,

234
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:49,920
um, exploring these underlying effects which we've had to do with the microbiota.

235
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:58,170
So describe this study design. So why, why LDL receptor knockout mice?

236
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,540
Go ahead. And if so, my sir shouldn't do this of the receptor.

237
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,520
They're more susceptible to this.

238
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,090
Like, it's just like a mouse model to induce that.

239
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,420
First of all, just. Yeah.

240
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:24,440
So if you were to follow mice on a high cholesterol diet without this mutation, would you find that lesion formation that they observed in the study?

241
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:35,960
Probably not. No. So there are people who have LDL receptor mutations and they have really high cholesterol levels.

242
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,340
And they're really they may have a higher prevalence or incidence, I should say, of coronary artery disease.

243
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:52,750
So this is kind of like a model for that. So they're fed atherosclerosis diet.

244
00:30:54,130 --> 00:31:00,880
So they have 20% calcium fat, which does not sound like a low fat diet to you, though.

245
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,330
So the recommendation is less than 30% of your calories from diet, from your diet in terms of fat.

246
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,700
So if it's less than 30, it's considered a kind of a lower fat diet, 27%.

247
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:19,420
But mice, the chow that you feed mice, it's about 10% or a little bit higher, maybe 13%.

248
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,070
So that's twice as much as what they normally would get in their regular chow.

249
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:33,400
And then they add a half a gram of cholesterol per kilogram of diet.

250
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:42,999
Okay. That's a lot. And the way I make with this, this is kilogram of diet.

251
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,780
And I, I expressed some data here in terms of this is some kilogram of diet.

252
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,900
I looked at it as a kilogram in relation to the weight of the person consuming your diet.

253
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:10,280
Which isn't quite the same thing. But anyhow, if you were to look at the amount of cholesterol that a human would take in based on their body weight,

254
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:23,450
and it's not the same thing, but this might be equivalent to a 70 kilograms human consuming 38 grams of cholesterol, and that's a lot.

255
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:34,820
So I looked at foods that are particularly high in cholesterol, and the food that I found that was highest in cholesterol was chicken livers.

256
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,870
Now, people don't eat chicken livers very often nowadays, but it was a delicacy.

257
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:52,910
At one time, people would read it and frighten people what he did, and it has about 630 milligrams of cholesterol per three and a half ounce serving.

258
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:03,209
And if you had 60 servings of this, you would be getting about 38 grams of cholesterol in your diet.

259
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,320
So that's a lot. Okay. So that's an awful lot of cholesterol that these mice are consuming.

260
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,050
Don't the chicken liver have like every micronutrient in it, though?

261
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,790
Yes. Yeah. It is a rich source of micronutrients.

262
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,090
Yes, definitely. But that's the downside. It's a lot of cholesterol.

263
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,830
So we're told to not worry about dietary cholesterol, but that's a lot of cholesterol.

264
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:43,130
Okay. So they looked at these lesions in the mice.

265
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:55,490
And in this diagram you're looking at these girl onyx sclerotic plaques that form in the LDL receptor knockout mice.

266
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:06,020
So the figure that I see out here is from a heart that's been taken out of the mouse and they have the aortic arch here.

267
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:13,040
And you can see here and some of the blood, the arteries coming off the aortic arch, there's this whiteness here.

268
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,940
And what that indicates is time buildup.

269
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:24,770
So atherosclerotic plaque is the white area.

270
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:30,740
And then what they did for the paper is that they took the aorta.

271
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:40,840
Now, this is the the whole thing. This is from the heart all the way down the descending aorta, all the way down to the body of the animal.

272
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:50,120
And they took that whole vessel and they perfused it and got all the blood out, and then they stained it for lipids.

273
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,520
And this red stain here is that oil red staining.

274
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:04,430
And what that does, anything that has the lipid rich will take up this red stain.

275
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:13,200
So that's how they quantitate it. The plaque buildup inside the arteries.

276
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:31,720
So here's the study design. So they had, um, fruit and vegetable supplementation and they had three different groups.

277
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,630
So they had all that. All the mice were male LDL receptor knockout mice, 12 per group.

278
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:50,500
They had a control mice on A4, sporadic diet in mice and apple sporadic pathogenic died with 15% weight for weight, fruits and vegetables.

279
00:35:51,340 --> 00:36:00,100
So the control diet was 10% fat and the other two conditions had the same amount of fat and about 20%, 27%.

280
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:09,220
And they fed them this diet and they measured their body weight weekly.

281
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,610
And after 18 weeks of being on the diet, they did a glucose tolerance test.

282
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,840
And then the determination in the study, they euthanized the mice.

283
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:29,920
They collected a fecal sample for the microbiota data, and they collected tissues,

284
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:37,690
blood and liver samples for some of the fatty liver disease endpoints.

285
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,100
So the next question has to do with a fruit and vegetable diet.

286
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,680
What was the purpose of the fruit and vegetable preparation and how is it relevant to human nutrition?

287
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:58,000
Go ahead, Abby. The only person to mention the pattern is the best way to remember.

288
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,940
I think it diet. Right.

289
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:15,960
It was calculated in proportion to the types of fruits and vegetables consumed in the US, which was equivalent to about 89 servings for humans.

290
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:24,390
And then they show you what the mixture was. And and so they got all of these things that ground them up.

291
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:28,499
And here's the percentage within this fruit and vegetable mixture.

292
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,940
And then they tried it and they use this as that.

293
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,970
The supplement. Okay.

294
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,389
And then so what is that?

295
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:48,160
What are the key differences in the diets? Let's look at, first of all, the polyphenols.

296
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,200
Yes. 18 minutes.

297
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:06,800
Yeah. How about antioxidants? And but Minister, in comparison to that continue today.

298
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:18,940
Yeah, huge difference. So when you look at the different levels of different types of polyphenols, they didn't measure these.

299
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:31,450
But this is what what could be calculated from the fruit and vegetable powder based on what they could find in the USDA database.

300
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:38,950
So all kinds of different polyphenols within the fruit and vegetable supplement or powder.

301
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,360
So this is a table that shows you what the macronutrient composition was.

302
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,530
What's the what's the big difference are? What big differences are here?

303
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:11,860
The proteins are not the same. The fruit and vegetable content is, you know, the big difference, right?

304
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,940
What else is different? And so you can say that it's not a huge difference.

305
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,390
Not a huge difference. Yeah, but the fibers pretty similar.

306
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,930
Right. So they're controlling for fiber.

307
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,140
So we know. How is that relevant to the microbiota data that they collected?

308
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,970
What is the microbiota due to fiber in your diet?

309
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,280
They can ferment. Those good. Yeah.

310
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:54,070
There's fermentation that goes on. So there's not a whole lot of difference here in terms of Cybele or insoluble fiber.

311
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,740
There's something else going on besides fiber.

312
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,940
And when you look at changes at the microbiota populations later.

313
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,230
So, um, the energy density is a little bit different.

314
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:22,850
That is different. And when you, when you enrich a diet for one macronutrient, it has to be made up somewhere else.

315
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:28,430
So there's a bit less carbohydrate in the after genic diet.

316
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,960
Okay. So those are the the differences in macronutrient content.

317
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:45,340
So let's look at the results from Figure one. What effect did the different diets have on body weight and body weight gain?

318
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:57,790
Yeah. Um, there was. It seems like in all three of the diets, the mice had very similar weight gain, which I assumed was helpful.

319
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,310
Yeah, no real difference.

320
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:08,830
So they want in this study, which was different than the previous one, which they mentioned in discussion, they wanted to just focus in on,

321
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:20,430
um, they wanted to, um, not have to, to take into account other effects that might influence these results.

322
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,550
And the other paper they used a higher fat diet and that had a number of complications there.

323
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,770
Just want to focus on what is this supplement do let's make it diet conditioned.

324
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,840
It doesn't affect the weight gain of the animals.

325
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:43,720
So what were the key differences mentioned in this supplemental figure?

326
00:41:48,730 --> 00:42:01,330
Go ahead. There's been talk about how wasteful. I teach diet at a higher liver rate to body weight ratio and higher liver tools.

327
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:08,620
And I control mice. But that was essentially negated when the fruit and vegetable consumption was added on.

328
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,760
Yeah, I thought that was really cool. Wow.

329
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,540
They're consuming the same amount of fat.

330
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:25,030
The terms of these two different diets in an effort to establish more lipid.

331
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,310
More lipid ends up in the liver. That makes sense. But this isn't really cool.

332
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:36,490
Do significantly reduce the weight on the body weight.

333
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,240
So what do they show in this particular figure?

334
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,990
I think that the demise of the stereotype war.

335
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:09,710
More plaque buildup in their aorta and their aorta, and then they also have a greater amount of fat in their liver as well.

336
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:16,410
Yeah. In comparison to. So they had the visual here in Athens.

337
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:29,240
And indeed, this is the quantitation. So it's not often that you can see differences and these kinds of end points with a nice visual like this.

338
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,130
So this is fantastic. So here's the order.

339
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:44,420
And it's this brightly colored area here on the arterial tree and the animals that are clearly showing greater staining.

340
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:55,640
And they can quantitate this. So they can take this image and they can count the number of pixels that are pink and compare that

341
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:02,030
with the number of pink pixels in the control and of a photogenic diet of the fruits and vegetables.

342
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:10,549
Yeah, anything because the stage first, the fruits and veggies they have like the full serving size of fruits and veggies.

343
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:22,260
Very good. And so for a day I wonder if they saw any or like if they did anything or something I from a day survey that had any sort of difference.

344
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,140
That's interesting. Yes. Because the differences are so big, you know, that's a possibility.

345
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:30,050
I mean, there could be a follow up study to this.

346
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:41,540
So this is a big difference what happens if you get less than 15% in terms of the use of the supplement and then the liver, they looked at steatosis.

347
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:57,050
So this is steatosis area. So they're looking at the percent of an area that has these huge vacuoles here that are filled with lipid.

348
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:05,090
So when you can't handle lipid, you can't store it safely in adipocytes, it's going to go somewhere else.

349
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,080
And one of the places where it goes is in your liver. And that's what's shown here.

350
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:16,040
And no difference in fat intake. It was a difference in fruit and vegetable intake that caused this.

351
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:26,830
Um, um, lack of fat from accumulating liver examples, which is fascinating.

352
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:37,510
So another way to do this is to take the whole liver out and grind it up and just measure total lipids.

353
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,330
That's another way to do this, and that's thought to be more objective than this, you know?

354
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:52,420
So here they took a piece of the liver. And you think that you hope that they took the same section of the liver each time.

355
00:45:52,930 --> 00:46:02,530
So a liver in a mouse is a pretty big organ and different portions of the liver will have different degrees of steatosis.

356
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:14,200
So you have to take the same site of the liver from each mouse, um, to assure that you're not introducing bias into this endpoint.

357
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:22,359
So if you take a load of the liver in different locations, in the different treatment groups,

358
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,090
or even within the treatment groups, that can bias this information.

359
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:30,490
The error bars are pretty tight here, which tells me that, you know, this is a pretty consistent finding.

360
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:43,630
All right. So figure three The data suggests that fruit and vegetable supplementation had a powerful effect on serum lipids.

361
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:54,590
What were the differences between the groups? Right.

362
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:04,620
And then they that the atherosclerotic diet and higher serum levels except for LDL.

363
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:16,810
Yeah. So there was a trend for the total cholesterol to be higher, which kind of surprised me.

364
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:24,010
The serum triglycerides are different, but not the serum cholesterol.

365
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:36,730
The big difference is the cholesterol levels. Right. And then the HDL cholesterol were lower in the in the first product and without the supplement.

366
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:43,300
And then HDL, LDL levels were where there was a trend for them to be higher.

367
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:53,120
But that wasn't significant because there's no better support for that. So what else do you notice about these values?

368
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,220
So let's go through the rest. Here's the very low density lipoprotein for higher.

369
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:07,170
The ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol is higher than the diet with fruit and vegetables.

370
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:15,980
And then the non HDL cholesterol, the HDL cholesterol is higher with after a strike like this one with the supplement.

371
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:28,310
And then this is the LDL to HDL ratio. So the levels of lipids in these animals are really high in their blood.

372
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,920
So for a human,

373
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:43,040
you you try people are encouraged to keep their blood lipids below 200 for total cholesterol and less than 150 for their triglycerides,

374
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:52,910
less than 100 for their LDL cholesterol and above 40 for men and 50 for women for HDL cholesterol.

375
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:00,580
The lipid levels in these mice, let's say 150 for humans, this is a controlled diet.

376
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:06,110
They're there around 300. And that's because these are LDL receptor knockout mice.

377
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:17,210
So that's why these numbers are so high. And if you had a human who had a polymorphism in these HDL, the yeah.

378
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:24,740
These LDL receptors, you would see an elevated lipid profile.

379
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:41,680
So the next thing that they looked at was the effect of the supplementation on hepatic TNF and fatty acid synthase.

380
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,570
And here's the data. How would you interpret the results in FIG. four?

381
00:49:54,100 --> 00:50:03,670
So you've got serum Tina Pantene Serum TNF RNA and then liver fatty acid synthase RNA.

382
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,890
Go ahead. You go so apologetic.

383
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:14,710
Diet can elevate the expression or an expression level of as often.

384
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:21,740
Oh, that's an. True and also the level of the chain of operating system.

385
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:26,930
But the food food that fruit and vegetable supplementation can.

386
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,590
Yes. There's less to. Go ahead. Abby, you want to add?

387
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:44,090
Oh, no. I was going to ask a question like, why is the liver an alpha?

388
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:50,270
But also for the 80% for the baby die at the highest?

389
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:57,140
Yeah. So it's not statistically significant, but there's a trend for it to be higher.

390
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,630
I don't remember much of much comment on this.

391
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:12,320
It didn't stand out to me. So serum TANF is not the same as the control, but not in the liver.

392
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:22,460
So that's interesting. That's the total picograms per milligram of protein.

393
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:27,110
When you look at the RNA, it follows what you see in the serum.

394
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,930
So the RNA is the message for the protein.

395
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:41,560
And so what is important here is it's the actual protein level that's important that

396
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:47,750
the message might not show you real differences that are physiologically meaningful.

397
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:55,790
It's a it's the message. It's not the protein, in their words. So exactly why that's higher, I don't know that, but that's an interesting finding.

398
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:04,670
But when you look at I would have loved to have seen a similar type of graph looking at fatty acid synthase.

399
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,200
So it follows the same trans fatty acid synthase does what?

400
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,440
So fatty acids synthase actually produces lipids within the liver, right.

401
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:24,620
And they're stored within the liver or they're taken away from the liver through the lipoproteins.

402
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:35,929
So the the fruit and vegetable supplement reduce that which is really cool and exciting, you know, in terms of, okay, if you follow this diet,

403
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:46,520
you can you can reduce your inflammatory cascades systemically and perhaps liver that can show,

404
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:52,580
but you can it appears that you can reduce the fatty acid synthase the liver.

405
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:07,330
So they talk about associations now about the diet and they looked at a bunch of different associations or potential interactions.

406
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,520
So here they're looking at correlations between atherosclerotic lesions, serum lipids and paddock's ketosis.

407
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,940
And did you follow how to read this graph? It's kind of kind of complicated.

408
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:32,530
You had to blow it up. So the stars and the more dense colors indicate a greater degree of significance.

409
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:40,210
So the more stars, the greater the difference. And so they're looking at here positive and negative correlations.

410
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:50,950
So if the numbers in the positive direction, so you have relative liver weight and liver steatosis, they're positively correlated.

411
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,620
So the more your liver weighs, the more psychosis occurs there.

412
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:04,660
Okay. So that's what's shown here in red. So as you go down the graph, so here's plaque area.

413
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:16,540
So the level of plaque is positively or that's positively correlated with, um, HDL cholesterol,

414
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:22,510
total triglycerides and this other value non HDL go inside of HDL cholesterol,

415
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,930
but negatively associated with that's shown in green here the serum HDL levels.

416
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:34,120
Okay, so the green is a negative association, the red is a positive association.

417
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:47,880
The stars indicate the level of significance. And so basically anything that's dark red here indicates a positive association for cholesterol.

418
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,980
Triglycerides are highly correlated with serum cholesterol.

419
00:54:54,780 --> 00:55:06,930
Here's HDL negatively associated with total serum triglycerides and and so on in terms of the cholesterol levels in some of these other endpoints.

420
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:16,080
So here's liver and F RNA associated with the fatty acid synthase.

421
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:29,370
Um, no, no association with serum TANF and the fatty acid synthase in the liver though.

422
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:39,450
So that that, you know, some of these associations are interesting, but some of them make sense and some of them were a bit surprising.

423
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:53,979
All right. Then they switched over to that gut microbiota and which you could have had a paper just on what

424
00:55:53,980 --> 00:56:00,040
changed in the microbiota separately from everything else that they've they've collected here.

425
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:09,220
So this was a huge study. The amount of data that they had to pore through for this study was extensive.

426
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:17,170
So what was the effect of their fruit and vegetable supplementation on the gut microbiota microbial communities?

427
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:21,420
So describe the data shown that the Shannon Simpson indices.

428
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:35,310
You raised your hand. I said that the additional intervention was creating greater spread of diversity and diversity, but also.

429
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,270
And but I don't know why that's different between ten and 16.

430
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:51,510
So there are two different indices for microbial diversity and they're both significantly different than the, the other two groups.

431
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:59,880
Um, and then when you do, excuse me, when you look at the principal component analysis,

432
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,110
you're basically looking at, okay, with all of these microbial communities.

433
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:11,100
Um, what, what's, what groups are similar and what groups and how are they different from one another?

434
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:19,170
So you look for clusters, you look for these are individual mice here in green and then blue and red.

435
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:26,070
And the point of this is to show you that using this principal component analysis,

436
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:34,200
that the microbial communities in the control and after gene expression,

437
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:46,290
the supplement were more similar than um, um the animals that were fed the diet with the after genic diet, the fruit and vegetable diet.

438
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:57,780
So more differences, um, because of the fruit and vegetable supplementation, whereas the control and the effort and ignite were more similar.

439
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:02,550
And they looked at all kinds of different ways to express the data.

440
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:07,620
So here's the phylum level. Big difference.

441
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,330
And Bernanke's here with the fruit and vegetable supplementation.

442
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:15,960
Huge difference here. And then there are some other subtle differences in Bacteroidetes.

443
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:27,770
And down here, um, this other type of species, which is very different, this very, very coming microbial.

444
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:33,750
I don't know if I'm pronouncing that properly, but there was a big difference in that type of relative abundance.

445
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:42,850
And then they looked at other differences.

446
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:48,820
So they're looking at here relative abundance of different types of bacteria.

447
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:54,370
Um, based on their class, their order, their family and their genus.

448
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:01,840
And the point of these graphs list, again, to show you that there were huge differences in the microbial communities.

449
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:11,800
And again, you can see the differences shown here.

450
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:21,800
Um, and when we look at class, when we look at the different order of the microbes family and genus, um,

451
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:27,190
big differences and then they try to correlate these differences in the microbiome microbial

452
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:32,470
communities with the differences that they found and some of the endpoints that they measure.

453
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,379
So this is really a causal relationship.

454
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:45,010
This is more of an association and showing cause and effect.

455
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:54,430
Relationships with microbiota and physiologic outcomes is is very difficult because there's a lot of things that are moving here.

456
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,240
Right. This is really difficult to control.

457
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:07,930
So in this study, the best they can do is just so associations between a particular organism class and all of these different endpoints.

458
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,490
And so if there was a positive correlation, it was more blue.

459
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:18,760
If there was a negative correlation, it was more red. And that's what they're doing in this particular figure.

460
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:26,380
So they had all of the endpoints that they took body weight, liver weight and for sporadic lesions and so on.

461
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:35,150
And they were correlating that with these different measurements here, the different types of bacteria that they found within the animals.

462
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:42,610
And they tried to determine whether or not the changes in the bacteria were

463
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:47,140
related to the changes in some of the physiologic endpoints that they measured.

464
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,730
And they went on to further look at this.

465
01:00:53,730 --> 01:01:04,440
And in this case, you're looking at the tax abundance of gut microbiota in and so the mice fed the after sporadic

466
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,500
diet plus the supplement compared to those who were just fed the after scrolling diet.

467
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:20,459
And then they gave you here the statistical differences and the the types of organisms that they found by phylum,

468
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:28,770
class, order, family, genus and species. So a very detailed characterization of the microbiota.

469
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:43,510
So they referred to this reference 22 a number of times in the discussion.

470
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,950
So what's the difference between this study and the previous study that they mentioned?

471
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:05,380
Yeah. That's a current study. Go ahead. One part of the other study was that they only had two different types of diets, the high fat and the normal.

472
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:12,440
That diet challenged both of them where they're not challenged, but both of them created vegetable supplementation.

473
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,260
Right. And here you had. Yes.

474
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:24,980
And that that's what you mentioned. And the primary outcomes were different, too.

475
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,260
So you had atherosclerosis in the current study versus.

476
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:39,040
Um. A paddock, steatosis and adipose inflammation were there and actually sampling the adipose tissue

477
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:44,259
for inflammatory mediators that could have been affected by a lot of different things.

478
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:50,319
So this current study was much more controlled for things that they could control,

479
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,120
looking at what just happens with the supplemental fruit and vegetable supplementation.

480
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:06,940
So these are the kinds. It's the underlying mechanism of action for the food industrial effect differs.

481
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,720
So how did that fruit vegetable supplement reduce atherosclerotic lesions in the mice?

482
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,700
Fed the photogenic diet? The last question is.

483
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:37,280
Do we know? What is it in the fruit and vegetables supplement that prevented those plaques from forming in the mice?

484
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:48,670
Try the supplementation could lower the serum vote.

485
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,950
The. Expression level.

486
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,640
So maybe you can just so we can also reduce that.

487
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:01,770
Yeah.

488
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:16,840
So if you lower the lipids, you lower the fatty acid synthesis in the liver, which lowers the number of ptosis and thus potentially reduce the TNF.

489
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,270
And this all of these things affected the gut microbiota.

490
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:30,520
So in this manner, the microbiome all by itself may have infected lipid metabolism through many different mechanisms.

491
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:42,519
But one of the things that I don't mention here is we really don't know what what was

492
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,860
present in the fruit and vegetable supplement that was responsible for these effects.

493
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:52,960
We have associations. In other words, the flavonoids were different.

494
01:04:53,210 --> 01:05:05,020
Right. And that was way back here. Here.

495
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:19,680
Was the total polyphenol source. The main difference with the two different diets.

496
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,120
And there was also a big difference in micronutrients.

497
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:32,800
So if you wanted to follow up on this and figure out exactly what it was, how would you how would you control for these two different things?

498
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:46,400
You had the same set up controls. You got the LDL, LDL receptor knockout mice, all the mice in that background,

499
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:52,610
you had the pathogenic diet and the pathogenic diet plus fruit and vegetables.

500
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,430
How would you isolate these two things to see which was responsible for the effects?

501
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:07,480
Go ahead. They can just add this polyphenols or micronutrients instead of this fruit.

502
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:18,360
Yeah. That's the way to do it. Okay, so you just get polyphenols and you add it to the pathogenic guy to see if that has an effect.

503
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:24,630
Or you can get that antioxidant micronutrients and put those in and see if that's the effect.

504
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:29,970
It's mechanistic and interesting.

505
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,140
Uh, it answers the question.

506
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:42,240
But in terms of the practice, you know, it's that you want that that fruit and vegetable content to be increased in everybody's diet.

507
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,450
And that's kind of the practical outcome of this study.

508
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:54,540
So the recommendation is valid and this study is it's just one study,

509
01:06:54,540 --> 01:07:03,570
but it supports the notion that increasing fruit vegetable intake can reduce the risk of disease.

510
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,520
Okay. So I thought this paper was awesome.

511
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:08,910
I love this paper.

512
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:18,150
This is really cool because it backs up a recommendation we've been hearing about not only here in the School of Public Health, but most of our lives.

513
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:22,140
So this is a really cool study.

514
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:30,330
So how are you doing with choosing a paper for your.

515
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:34,670
The first thing that's kind of come to you is the graphical abstract.

516
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:39,730
If you found anything. No, nothing interesting.

517
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:47,210
So what I like to do is to build, like, a little library within the canvas site so you can see papers.

518
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:52,790
And I may have done that. I may have some of those already.

519
01:07:54,110 --> 01:08:13,480
Let's see. She has other news sources.

520
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:20,900
We don't have it here. So I thought I'd put it. I thought I'd put some examples here that.

521
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,470
See. You know, we don't.

522
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:34,080
All right. A sample.

523
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:41,889
That's just 20 seconds ago. All right. Let me put up some I have a whole bunch of these so that I can put up and I'll put it on the front page.

524
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:47,080
So you can see here some examples of categories you might be interested in seeing, because I come across these all the time.

525
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,880
There was something else that I remember putting in here that had to do with.

526
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:03,260
The previous example wasn't there.

527
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:08,030
I'll have to put it in the front page. If I can't find it. That means you're not finding it either.

528
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:26,150
Here it is. So in this particular paper, this is a review paper on the influence of nutritional factors on immunologic outcomes.

529
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:34,220
So there's a lot of different papers in here that you might be interested.

530
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:37,070
Let's say you're interested in vitamin C and what it does.

531
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:47,120
Well, here here's a kind of a summary of all the things that they found about vitamin D and some kind of an immune response for vitamin C.

532
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:54,860
So here's some more here. And I can I've actually have collected a lot of these papers and I can post them as well.

533
01:09:55,910 --> 01:10:04,100
So if you look up here, you can see vitamin D, an innate immunity and adaptive immunity.

534
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,820
Vitamin Mino Article Outcomes Impact in Health and disease.

535
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:15,920
And these studies, the one impact in health and disease where the outcome is measured here.

536
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:26,870
Some of the papers, as I'm sure you've seen, can be very mechanistic and difficult to understand, and maybe you want to focus on the practical things.

537
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:34,940
You can find some of these studies as an area that you might want to focus on.

538
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:39,050
Okay. All right.

539
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,740
So we've come to the end of our time today.

540
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:57,300
The next subject we're going to be talking about is there's no there's some reading here that you're going to find interesting.

541
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,500
And we're going to we're going to talk about celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.

542
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,479
I don't have any questions.

543
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:12,390
So this is just a lecture and celiac disease and gluten sensitivity is it's a it's it's awful, but it's fascinating in terms of what happens.

544
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,810
It's a combination of an allergic response and an autoimmune response that occurs in the gut.

545
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:26,010
And people who have celiac disease are different than people who have gluten sensitivity.

546
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,250
And the lecture will explore mechanisms that might explain this.

547
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,960
So I will see you all on Thursday when we talk about this.

548
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:44,770
Okay. All right. Yeah.
