1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,660
Yeah. All right. Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,390
I hope you guys are all doing well. Welcome back to our jazz course.

3
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,119
All right.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,650
We're going to continue on from where we left off last time we were exploring cancer data, lung cancer data for Michigan, the United States.

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:54,570
We're going to continue those activities today and learn a little bit more about how to maybe make your maps look a little bit more,

6
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,870
you know, visually appealing.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,790
Because right now, I think you're just kind of getting used to the software, exploring the software in some certain features.

8
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,490
But we're going to build on that work today.

9
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,390
I know we ended last time with this lab activity where you pretending to be a cancer control planner for a stake?

10
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,189
We're going to start with that today.

11
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:28,440
But before we get there, I want to just review a few things we talked about last time to see what your guys's thoughts are and just recap.

12
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:40,830
Okay. We talked about where geospatial data comes from and can somebody talk about where the different variety of places that we get geospatial data,

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,879
maybe health data, but also non-health data, kind of the the the raw geospatial data.

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,550
Where does all that stuff come from? Yeah, you can collect it.

15
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,850
So he collected yourself. Exactly. You can go out and use your smartphone.

16
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,100
There are many, many apps in the smartphone that can collect spatial data.

17
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,930
What else? Yeah, but it's great.

18
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:16,440
Yeah, that's going to the raw cartographic data comes from aerial photography, remote sensing.

19
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,840
And then what happens with that kind of aerial photography, remote sensing type of information?

20
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,300
How does that turn into maps that we see and use on a day to day basis?

21
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,560
Yeah. It's processed in CAD. The computer.

22
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,640
Computer aided design. That's right. That data is processed using a CAD software, kind of a design software.

23
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,250
That software is used for engineering, architecture, those types of things, and is also used for making maps.

24
00:02:52,060 --> 00:03:02,410
So we turn these photography of remote sensing information into lines and points and so forth that we see as maps in most cases.

25
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,770
What are some examples of spatial health data that you could find out there?

26
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,580
Yeah. You know, like birth and death rates. Great.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,959
You can get vital records, so you can get death records.

28
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:31,530
Birth records. And those records are usually geo coded, meaning the addresses are in there and they could turn them into points on a map.

29
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,570
What else? Your information about health care services.

30
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,530
Health care services like my husband. You can see where they're located.

31
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,169
Great. Yeah. So a lot of health care organizations will have spatial data, right?

32
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,430
So that actually the organization itself will have an address.

33
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,360
They'll have patient records, which includes addresses.

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,570
So those are spatial data that are health related that you could bring into a genius.

35
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:23,150
What are some other examples? Okay.

36
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:35,389
We talked about census data, which is one of the key places where we get public health information that is spatial and it goes down to addresses.

37
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:40,280
But also they're organized into these geographic hierarchies we will talk about today.

38
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:49,490
Surveillance data like cancer surveillance data, infectious disease surveillance data, behavioral surveillance data,

39
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:57,410
health care quality data, all those kinds of data nowadays have some geographic component to it.

40
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,760
So part of doing guesswork is bringing all that information together in one place and making sense of it.

41
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,790
Okay, now what are some differences between vector data and raster data?

42
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,190
So these are two data formats that are available in GISS.

43
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,570
What's the the basic difference between those two things?

44
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:32,690
Yeah. So like vector data uses like points and lines to kind of display that information versus like raster use like depending on pixels.

45
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:41,780
Yeah. So exactly vector data points, lines and polygons and Cartesian kind of system with x, y, z,

46
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:52,310
coordinates and raster data is a photograph, an image where each pixel is used to create geographic features on a map.

47
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,850
Right? The series of pixels is a line. One pixel is a point, a series of pixels can be areas.

48
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:06,140
So that's a basic difference between those two. And we'll be using vector data in this class 99% of the time.

49
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,059
We talked about this some gas lingo and we talked about features and attributes.

50
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,880
So what is features and what is it? What are our attributes in this kind of plural?

51
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,080
Yeah. Features like a real a real world representation of that group.

52
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,870
Can you give some examples? Last week you said like a house or a river or any of those things.

53
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,190
Great, great. Now, what's an attribute?

54
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,850
Yeah. Information that's attached to a certain feature like elevation or.

55
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,240
Great. Yeah. So if it's a house, it could be when the house was built.

56
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:06,540
Could be information or who lives there. Could be attribute data or the size of, you know, square footage of the house.

57
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,260
Correct. And we have something called a feature class versus a feature.

58
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,260
What's the difference between feature and feature class? Yeah.

59
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,410
It's like another category of features.

60
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:31,140
And your group in particular characters. Can you give an example of what a featured feature in a feature class might be?

61
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,600
The life of the streamer would be a feature.

62
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,050
And then rivers. He is great, you know.

63
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:53,840
So feature is a singular representation of a real world object on a map in a feature class is all of those representations of that category on a map.

64
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:00,920
So in they will all have the same geographic kind of and it could be either a point.

65
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,740
So they'll be all points, they could be all lines or all polygon.

66
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,900
So Rivers would be a feature class of line data.

67
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:17,239
Okay, great. We used a couple of things in our chats per last time.

68
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,709
We used, you know, map layouts, maps and layout layouts.

69
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,560
Sorry. So what is the difference between maps and layouts?

70
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,930
If you remember, there was this in the central window in art years pro, you can look at the map view versus a layout view.

71
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,850
So what's the difference between those two views in our view is from.

72
00:08:51,320 --> 00:09:02,959
Yeah. I think I have a picture of the map that you could export and, like, share more easily with like, file that isn't that great.

73
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:13,520
So the layout view is used to create some kind of a something you can disseminate to other people or put in a report.

74
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:23,149
So the map view is where you explore the map, where we may do spatial analysis and so forth, but you can't really share the map view with people.

75
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:31,940
You have to create a layout view and add different elements to a layout like title legend, you know, North Arrow,

76
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,170
other kinds of information that you could turn into an image and then put into

77
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,270
your paper or a PowerPoint slide or share with your friends and colleagues.

78
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,370
But in the map, you can't really share that unless you share the whole project with somebody and they

79
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,770
know how to use opportunities to kind of manipulate it and use the map view property.

80
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,070
Excellent. We talked about this briefly. We talked about map frames.

81
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:09,950
So you have a layout. And the way you put a map on that layout view is you create a map frame that is linked to the map that you're working on.

82
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,020
So why might you have more than one map frame and layout view?

83
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:33,730
All right. You repeat the first time. Yeah. So when we work with layouts and if you remember, we created a map frame with the first step you take.

84
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,510
And that linked to a map view that your look you had looked at in the map view part

85
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:47,410
of your Argus program and you could put more than one map frame on the layout.

86
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,230
So why would you want to do something like that? Yeah.

87
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,620
I remember when we were doing it, we had our original one was like the entire U.S.

88
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,020
One But then we wanted to, like, focus on, like you wanted to zoom in and just have Michigan.

89
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:09,010
You can have both of them so people can like see the, the map, the original map, but like maybe then see a subset of that map zoomed in.

90
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,400
Perfect. But like, yeah, have that context. Great.

91
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:20,560
You can use it for context or let's say you wanted to talk about all the, you know, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio.

92
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,240
You can create a map frame for each of those separately and display that on one layout.

93
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,340
Great. All right. Excellent. So this is an example of having multiple map frames in one layout.

94
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,880
This is a paper that we're working on right now about the prevalence of tobacco use and reproductive

95
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,400
age women in India specifically worrying about pregnant women and their consumption patterns.

96
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,250
And so this this shows three different map frames in one layer.

97
00:11:52,030 --> 00:12:02,169
Okay. One is talking about the percentage of tobacco consumption per population size in reproductive age,

98
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:11,140
women percentage in currently pregnant women and then secondhand smoke exposure in the home and currently pregnant women.

99
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,560
So you can, you know, depict different parts of a specific area or you can pick different data.

100
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:25,960
So last time we had data on lung cancer mortality and female headed households and you superimposed them,

101
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,980
but you can also show them separately in two different layouts in a map. Okay.

102
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:37,060
So then so the live view is very, very customizable and we just kind of scratched the surface of how to kind of work with those.

103
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,579
Excellent. All right.

104
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:52,840
So today we are going to start off with the starting and completing lab activity six, where you pretend to be a cancer control planner for state.

105
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:01,330
And then we'll work with something called query and creating a new layer based on a selected feature.

106
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:08,469
Then we'll learn about something called symbology in ArcGIS Pro, and after you do that,

107
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:16,360
you will redo Lab Activity six to kind of enhance the map that you made based on what we learn in seven, eight and nine.

108
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,520
Okay, lab activities, seven, eight and nine.

109
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,979
And then you will discuss what you did and what you learned about lung cancer mortality in your state with some of your peers.

110
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,550
And we'll report back and then we'll talk a little bit about assignments one and two, which are due in about three weeks, 3 to 4 weeks.

111
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,049
We'll do the student led discussions after that and then we'll do a little bit

112
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,060
of a lecture section where I will talk about the key steps in using this data.

113
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:53,560
And if we have time, we will do lab activity ten and 11, where we will download state cancer data of our own.

114
00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:00,610
I am giving you data and it's all data. So now you'll go to the surveillance website and get that data,

115
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,660
and we'll also learn how to create your databases so you can learn about how to

116
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,550
bring data into gas by the end of this class or the beginning of next class.

117
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:18,429
All right. So what I'd like you guys to do now is turn on your jazz pro software guru modules in canvas

118
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,460
and get to the lab folder and put it in your seed drive like you've done every week.

119
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,960
And then start doing lab activity six on your own.

120
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:37,420
Okay. And Lab Activity six is based on the prior activities we did in class last week where we were exploring the data.

121
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:46,089
Okay. So what you have to do is you're pretending you're that your project director of a CDC funded

122
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,630
comprehensive cancer control plan for a taste state of your choosing something different than Michigan.

123
00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:01,840
Okay. And what each state does is that you develop a comprehensive cancer control plan, a strategic plan,

124
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:10,750
and that plan involves all the different cancer sites, sites meaning where in the body the cancer would affect the person.

125
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:20,050
So, you know, what you're going to do is work on the lung cancer prevention and control program, piece of it all.

126
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:27,010
So what you're doing is trying to develop a presentation for a meeting with your lung cancer advisory committee.

127
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:34,629
So each state has cancer advisory committees from that work with the state government and they have a breast cancer advisory committee,

128
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,460
lung cancer, cervical cancer, etc. Okay.

129
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,830
So the committee is interested in the relationship between socioeconomic status and lung cancer mortality in your state.

130
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,260
So we'd like you to work with those data group and to prepare for the meeting.

131
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:58,050
Use that. We were working on entire labs to create a map using layouts, an artist program.

132
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:06,770
So you're going to work with the lung cancer mortality EPR text file in the projects folder in the in the lab folder.

133
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:14,570
Right. And you're going to create layouts in a table indicating the high need counts.

134
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:23,569
Okay. So, Heidi, counties could be defined as those that have the highest lung cancer mortality rates overall or by gender or by race,

135
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:30,260
whichever you think is important. And also thinking about the linking socio economic status at the county level.

136
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,870
All right. So use the the I guess the word features is not a good one.

137
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,700
We use the tools that we talked about last time to do this activity.

138
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:49,400
Just to give you a little bit more information about the variables that you're working with in the lung cancer data.

139
00:16:50,100 --> 00:17:03,380
Right. We talked about the third lung cancer death rates and counts in there by race and ethnicity and maybe not ethnicity, but race and gender.

140
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:13,160
So the way that the variable teams are kind of organized are the first letter is a rate, so it's higher or it could be killed.

141
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,390
If you see, the second letter indicates the race.

142
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,510
White or black. W for white. B for black.

143
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,410
Third letter is MRF, male or female.

144
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,660
And the last five characters are the year.

145
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:37,070
So for example, this variable r w M0 zero underscore zero four contains the rates for white males from zero 2000 to 2004.

146
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,880
So work with that data for the next level.

147
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:47,930
I think about 20 minutes because it'll take you some time to explore and create a map layout and then save it as a PDF file.

148
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:56,149
Okay. Once you once you make a layout that you like will be perfect, but do the best you can and then export it.

149
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:03,770
And that's that that's the end of that activity. I mean, I will come around and get you guys going if you need any help.

150
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,469
What I would do is open the apex file and open the lab activity.

151
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:20,180
Four or five and six I think is three, four and five and use those to help you get going with the lab activity six.

152
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:36,330
So lab activity three talks about exploring the data in the lab activity for talks about results in lag up to five about sharing your layout,

153
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:45,620
meaning turning it into a PDA. So you're using basically those activities, but working on it for another state in the United States of America.

154
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:56,480
Right. So we'll do this for about 20 minutes and I'll be here to help if ever need you with us.

155
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they don't want a search bar, and I'm like, stop it.

156
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,830
Just, like, doesn't work. Yeah. So you can't get to the articles.

157
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,309
You want to try this one because you can also share.

158
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:25,760
And so the first thing that we are though, as you look at this, if you have a hard time, just you can work in pairs if you try this one.

159
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:32,620
Oh, that's too bad. Maybe restart your machine just so that I.

160
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,680
That it's going to be. Yeah.

161
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:42,480
Okay. Is that second?

162
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,800
Oh, yeah. Okay.

163
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,910
Their. And use them.

164
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:28,670
Issued the following. I'm just here.

165
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:34,670
Yeah. Is it?

166
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:22,150
I. Some.

167
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:54,460
So. So.

168
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:03,010
You know.

169
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,520
And so. And so did you.

170
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,240
Okay. Okay. So digitally just delete the files and then.

171
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,060
Yeah. So you just click on the thing you do is doing the last one.

172
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,200
Just because I just like to ask you this.

173
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:30,100
It's like going to your knees like, I don't know, do not know.

174
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,700
I won't be shy, but raise your hand if you're getting something with a guy.

175
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:54,200
So then when you think you know, when you open up there at beginning and then you're find and you.

176
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,150
And. Yeah, yeah. Let her into the dark.

177
00:23:59,690 --> 00:25:21,870
Okay. Maybe it'll work again. County.

178
00:25:45,040 --> 00:26:08,480
I mean. I think that is because anyone can put resources on something.

179
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,790
Well, yeah. First of all, no matter what your discount is.

180
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:20,090
So you're going to Florida? Yeah. It's going to clean up.

181
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,450
A three year plan for the turnaround tourism.

182
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,850
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Any time.

183
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,370
I like existing over here in New Jersey and I skip in.

184
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,810
But it doesn't have to be a double click on the.

185
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,310
You got it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think.

186
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:01,500
Click on this link in New York for this. Or you could just drag and drop back to this.

187
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,160
I just want to drag and drop this for.

188
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:23,890
It's hard to get through to the same thing, but I think it's hard for them to repeat themselves.

189
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:42,120
I feel like it's very different from what I would probably do is that it's broken and you're doing a real 340 open and the commissioner.

190
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,220
Surprised to hear that the content was the content.

191
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,890
All right. Let's listen.

192
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:19,180
Okay. Okay. I hope you got more insight.

193
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:40,220
Yeah. Appreciate patient is.

194
00:28:47,090 --> 00:29:03,020
Was good. No, I mean, that must have been what you're supposed to do is pick a state in which they relate to them and learn more about them.

195
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,840
So which is first, that is.

196
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:21,210
So. So this is from his own well-being.

197
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,570
So. It's a crazy project.

198
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:33,110
This is from the last two years. So let's do this.

199
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,290
It's. Even President.

200
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,940
Yeah. It was in a theater. And this community has been underfunded.

201
00:29:54,310 --> 00:30:02,430
So now we're familiar with marijuana. As a defense attorney general.

202
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,740
All right. Let's just look inside of.

203
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:16,560
Oh. Learn how to give it to that person.

204
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,360
I would not do that. It is something that.

205
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,650
Does the system go back to the same?

206
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:56,910
You know. In 20.

207
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:24,700
I'm not thinking. What's that?

208
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,950
Yes. He worked with the CIA from Florida?

209
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,300
I think so. You just click on it?

210
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:52,710
Yeah. But it shows you all the counter that you should know that this is just the beginning.

211
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,650
If you click on this link.

212
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:11,540
That's really important to do that and to do it today. Don't you think that they know that you want to explore the world?

213
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,920
And what are you and why is my mouth doing everything?

214
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,500
And there has to be.

215
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:49,450
You know, and from your lack of activity. In 35 years to the day.

216
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:55,640
The five pioneering companies. And.

217
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,560
You know, everything that happened to me in his life.

218
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,780
I mean, there's no reason why all of these things.

219
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,530
Let's try to find a way to do with our.

220
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:29,460
Yeah. So. Year and.

221
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:35,700
Sir. Please enjoy your service. You can look at.

222
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:44,430
I'm on the ground in Milwaukee is in search.

223
00:33:49,110 --> 00:34:06,030
These are some of the most. I say this to you, right?

224
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,060
And I just look at them usually.

225
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,810
No, no, that's cool.

226
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:46,070
So what you do is explored the decision system as soon as you get more money for the major leagues.

227
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,080
And then we've just stayed and haven't done anything.

228
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,090
I wasn't the nicest guy before the L.A. Times.

229
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Now, looking at his life, I think you might that you're like, Oh, yeah, I forgot to click on that information.

230
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:13,720
I don't remember how I think I conflated State and then he wouldn't let me come through with it.

231
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,830
I guess it's like, okay, you can put the.

232
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,880
Yeah. I was in. Now for the tape.

233
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,680
This is the difficulty I had on lipstick.

234
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:40,620
I like the. Oh, you know, I have this in the.

235
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,559
And I had I had at least one.

236
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,290
So I was like, it's gender neutral. Oh, yeah.

237
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,260
But I knew I'm gonna need that.

238
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:10,610
You YouTube video. That person that I just mentioned, regardless when I was writing, I did, you know, how do you have a table?

239
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:22,060
You have to write clipping inserts. And I think it's actually it's okay, you know, for you know, for people in the middle of nowhere.

240
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:32,020
So, I mean, freezing it I just decided that I don't like it in the and.

241
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:42,200
Can you imagine? Resulting in regret. All right.

242
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm not sure folks are stuck, but I'm just going to walk through a couple of steps here.

243
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,000
Okay. If you want to listen, that would be great.

244
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,940
So let's say I'm interested in California. All right.

245
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,830
So one thing we did last time was recorded a bookmark for California, right?

246
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,270
Because they knew bookmark California because I've zoomed into California.

247
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:16,010
But that'll help you when you make your layout you because you can go and zoom into the California extent.

248
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,050
The other thing I say, I want to explore what are the high rate counties in California for lung cancer mortality in white men?

249
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:31,310
Okay. So one thing you want to make sure is you got states of these selected and are selectable.

250
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:40,549
Okay. And also under the list of layers drawn in order to select states can include them later.

251
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:45,290
But right now you can decide them and you can just click on the higher rate counties.

252
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,830
So that's Del Norte County and I can see, well, what's the rate in white men here?

253
00:37:54,350 --> 00:38:00,800
So you are W.M., it's 98.9.

254
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:09,470
Okay. So in that same county, you can get the rate for white females, which is 44, it's half the rate.

255
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,540
And you can see the rate for black men, there is zero.

256
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:22,550
There is no there is no lung cancer deaths in black men, likely because there are very few black people living in that county.

257
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,650
Okay. And is a rate for black females. Okay.

258
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:35,120
So you can get the gender difference in the race difference in lung cancer mortality just by looking at that data.

259
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:45,500
Yes. So as I say in this table, is it possible to create like map layers or black female variants?

260
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:52,160
And this just shows that there is and we're going to talk about that today.

261
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,620
So what you need to do is you would need to create a new symbology.

262
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:05,930
Okay. So right now, symbology means the way the data are are illustrated in the map, visualizing the map.

263
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,140
So right now it's pointing to our wm00 underscore zero form.

264
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,910
You can point to another variable.

265
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,979
Okay. You can point to a different variable when you go to symbology.

266
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,230
And we'll work on that today. But right now,

267
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:39,440
I think what I would like you to do is just go in and explore the data using tables and and just the info feature by clicking on top of it.

268
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:50,780
All right. Make a list of counties that are high rate and then also counties that are high rate in female headed households.

269
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,220
You can look at the the race and ethnic data separately.

270
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,430
Gender data separately, just by looking at the table.

271
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,110
And then we'll stop there, because that's only as far as you can go with the information I've given you.

272
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,000
And then the rest of the class today, we'll try to get a little bit more deeper into the work.

273
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:15,980
Okay. And then after you explore the data bit, you can create a layout.

274
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:24,320
Okay. You can say I want to turn on both female headed household and lung cancer mortality,

275
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:30,650
and I'm going to create a new layout by going to insert and create a new layout,

276
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:40,550
its letter size, and add a map frame for California, and you can create a map frame for California.

277
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,879
It might be not correct. So like the positioning.

278
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,750
Right. Is a little too far away. So you can see, how do I do this again?

279
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:01,090
You can activate the map frame, right click and activate and zoom in a bit.

280
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,060
So I'm a little bit more zoomed in to California.

281
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:10,910
Okay. If that's not working, you can create a little box around California.

282
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:22,190
Right. You can even turn on the states so you can see California border better and just use that as your layout and you can add the title,

283
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:27,410
The Legend, Northborough, all that stuff on this layout and then print it out.

284
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,410
So you have a table that you've kind of handwritten or you can use in Excel to give high.

285
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,590
Three counties for lung cancer mortality and ISIS.

286
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:49,160
And you have a layout that you're creating that you can make a PDF, so you're just exercising some of the little skills we learned so far.

287
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,740
And then we'll work on making these maps even better as we move through today's class.

288
00:41:55,370 --> 00:42:00,800
How do you really activate the map so that you can once you've scaled it, you can stop?

289
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:07,330
Yeah, that's funny. You've got to go to layout. Okay. And then there's a close activation button.

290
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,810
Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. And that's because.

291
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,229
You probably figure I like. I wish I could do this just like you asked to the back.

292
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,680
Do you know? How do I do? The different variables?

293
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,000
So think about that as you work on this. What else do you want to do?

294
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,980
And we'll sort that out as we go through today's lecture and future lectures.

295
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:49,080
England has never made. The other thing that you can try to do is use a select tool, right?

296
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:56,480
This is select and you can highlight all the the higher rate counties in your state.

297
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,540
Here in California, we only have three that are dark gray.

298
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,900
And then you can go to the attribute table, the lung cancer mortality.

299
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,800
I think. And when we view the selected.

300
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:46,980
It's kind of hanging up here. Frankly, I'm doing a lot.

301
00:44:49,010 --> 00:45:05,550
There will be. Not only view the selected features so you can get the county names right and you can look at the data by different variables.

302
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,150
Can you convert that into like a table, a table frame?

303
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,170
You can create charts and tables.

304
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:21,870
If you right click on that, you can go chart. So you can say, I could turn a histogram or something like that.

305
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:37,190
You have to cruise, select a variable. So note all those things down, because I guess these are not just the selected features.

306
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,830
It's all the features. Okay. Yeah.

307
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,450
So the selected features are right here in the in the distribution.

308
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:56,840
You can export this table if you needed to, but you're just exploring.

309
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:01,050
Okay. So getting used to some of the tools we talked about.

310
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:27,330
When it comes to. Because we didn't go to this.

311
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:33,200
Instead, you want to follow my own schedule and you select the.

312
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,210
But this is for the whole country.

313
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:51,440
Okay. Does anybody stop to question?

314
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,880
I'm sorry. You're coming.

315
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,870
You know, I think it's very possible.

316
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,290
Unfortunately, we've had to use another half to do that.

317
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:25,080
Well, yeah. So, you know, that's why it's a.

318
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,440
Yeah. And I just. And then a new copy like this just in the piece that.

319
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,890
But would you do that like this? Like just having it like this and then placing it as a train and.

320
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:53,590
All. Things. I was wondering if I. You should be able to turn the.

321
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:09,220
Is one. That's what I do.

322
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:21,480
And I would say a lot of great questions.

323
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:28,110
You know, and then they tend to select their.

324
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,880
This word is used to learn it in time.

325
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,530
Okay, perfect time.

326
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:48,219
I do it. All right. I know, I. All right.

327
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,960
So, what is your name? Sorry, I'm in system.

328
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,270
I'm not going to vote. Matt and Javon. There is a nice trick that I didn't realize you could do.

329
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,760
Let's say I select my three high counties here.

330
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,920
And you create your attribute check out your attribute table.

331
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:25,970
And you just look at the selected counties. You can copy this table and paste it into Excel to create a table in Excel.

332
00:50:27,830 --> 00:51:02,410
Okay. Okay.

333
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,010
So your old table is here. We can delete some of the.

334
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:12,440
The things you don't want like this data.

335
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:15,950
So let's see. You only care about.

336
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:30,040
That's true. Okay.

337
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,740
So that's the rate in the way for men and women. See you.

338
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,740
Have a nice table of this information.

339
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,640
All right. He could do the same thing with the SARS data if you want to.

340
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,630
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

341
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,900
He said, You don't want to do this. She says,

342
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:16,129
female I to do like 190 but just sure that like whatever you need because my lady

343
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:25,210
said it doesn't need you see it doesn't taste like one afternoon doesn't it?

344
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,100
Yeah. It's right here. I really don't think there's anything wrong with that.

345
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:56,510
Somebody at the other end of the world.

346
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,450
All right. You guys need more time. Raise your hand if you want more time.

347
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,630
Okay. Let's do this for two or three more minutes and then we'll wrap up and move on.

348
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:18,570
Yeah. Yeah. The.

349
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:53,450
And then you. It looks.

350
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:05,850
Aware there are other options here and there.

351
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:10,960
We didn't talk about these in class yet, and we probably won't.

352
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:15,680
But you can explore these options. It's like you created a map frame, right?

353
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:26,120
You can create chart frames and table frames so you can actually enter the table without going into Excel and creating an Excel table.

354
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,410
Okay. It takes a little work.

355
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:41,580
This is just number one.

356
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:46,290
I don't know, because a lot of the people that I know.

357
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,110
You're having a hard time pulling at the table. Yes, I have.

358
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:58,030
I wonder why there's nothing in the kitchen table.

359
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:09,970
Yeah, go in there. And there's a very thin individual, and they're like, How you doing?

360
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,030
What you're doing? And it's very. I'll just have to listen, do it.

361
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:22,720
And then you just highlight it for the example.

362
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,650
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think you can look.

363
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:47,670
So. I mean, I think the tried and true candidate for change and I'm not sure what happens next is the bottom.

364
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:58,890
It's right here. So, you know, the guy was really bad for all of this.

365
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:07,610
I know. I think I think you can put it there.

366
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:23,870
My colleagues and I tried to do that until, you know, I'm not sure what was the thing that's confused a little bit like that.

367
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:31,140
1000 and then try again. Yeah. I don't think it's showing up right.

368
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:39,520
I don't know. I don't think anybody would. Works.

369
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,300
We don't need to put something like that. It's just like a funny thing.

370
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:59,800
Yeah, we know all this stuff, and it's still.

371
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,550
Still major. Oh, you know what?

372
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:09,979
Just different talk. And you know what's crazy?

373
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:16,100
You know, my dad in one town was 543.

374
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:28,100
Yeah, well, you would say. Are you in Oklahoma? Well, it hasn't been, you know, because I was there all my life.

375
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:33,670
Oh, man, this is actually higher in this south, you know?

376
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:40,600
So. Yeah. Yeah. Because evidently. Oh, you can hear my voice in black.

377
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,940
Yeah. Yeah, I. I think you're, like, white and.

378
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:57,810
You have zero windows now that you really could actually like the data?

379
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:05,070
Well, I think that depends on where you lived 200 years ago.

380
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,890
It's the middle name of the analysis.

381
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,730
Well, let's let's wrap it up, because you're going to work on this activity and refining a little bit as we move forward.

382
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:38,120
Okay. So. I see you keep working with whatever well you're doing right now.

383
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:43,880
Keep the file open and don't open a save that you can save it.

384
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:50,270
But don't if you save it, save it is a different name, actually.

385
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:58,040
If you say save as you could put your name at the end and I think we can continue working with the same file.

386
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:06,380
So what probably you noticed is, well, I have all these other states that I don't care about, like I'm working on California here,

387
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:12,590
but I have got Nevada and Oregon and all these neighboring states, in my view, and I don't really need that information.

388
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,950
It's confusing and it's too much. Right.

389
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:25,190
So we'll learn now is to extract out just certain counties and make a layer out of those.

390
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:31,250
And so you can then make a layout just for that county or those sets of counties.

391
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:38,540
Okay. So we'll work on that with lab activities seven and eight. So lab activity seven talks about some tool called query.

392
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:46,130
All right. So a query is a way to query the data.

393
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:55,130
So here I can do a query on the lung cancer mortality layer.

394
00:59:55,250 --> 01:00:07,040
I'm on point number three and lab activity seven. So you can right click on that, go to properties and select definition query.

395
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:18,590
And then it says here there are no definition queries defined, so you want to create a new one and where what are you going to query?

396
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:22,040
So what field you want to look at in this layer?

397
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,260
We are interested in, let's say state abbreviation.

398
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:34,090
Okay. Because there's a variable for each county that tells us which state that county belongs to.

399
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:41,630
And I would like to look at just that. In this case, I'm the one working on California, so I'll just do California counties.

400
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:46,940
So let's see. Can push, apply and.

401
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:53,390
Okay, okay. So now all the other counties in the country disappear.

402
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:03,140
Okay. So if I go to lay out now, all the other counties are gone.

403
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:10,490
So that makes it a little easier and cleaner for your, you know, yourself and your audience.

404
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:17,010
Okay. Just.

405
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:33,710
And so step number four, just make sure that you turn off all the other layers in the in the, you know, unless you may have too much.

406
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:43,280
If you have whoops, I just closed that. Then I took in their number five.

407
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:53,810
You insert a new layout because I had already done that and I'm going to add a map frame to this layout.

408
01:01:54,650 --> 01:02:06,470
So under layout insert, I mean new layout and then under layout where my map frames.

409
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,160
So in fairness, insert tab.

410
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:21,220
Sorry. I would select the California stand and draw that.

411
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:29,030
I make sure I go to maps. Turn that off and you can activate that out.

412
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:33,070
You can move it around. So it's in the middle and looks nice.

413
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:49,080
And if you go back to the I'm on number seven now, sorry, I can go back to the the layer and go to properties.

414
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:55,080
This is lung cancer mortality rate. You can remove the definition query.

415
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,930
Yes. And. Okay. And then it goes back to what it was before.

416
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:07,330
Okay. You know, there's another way to to kind of work with this.

417
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:14,650
Yeah. Is there a way to get the percentage, you know, how to pass Photoshop without creating the rest of the math?

418
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:18,760
Let's just have it show up on one state you're interested in.

419
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,780
Yeah, he would do the same procedure as we just did now.

420
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:27,520
Right. But we're going to do it at a slightly different way now.

421
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:36,190
Lab activity eight is it talks about how do you create a new layer of data based on a selected number of features?

422
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:43,990
Okay. So let's say you select all the counties in California and then you make a new

423
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:48,220
layer for just the California counties and no other counties in the state.

424
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:53,950
Okay. I'm going to actually follow the lab activities. I'm going to switch over to Michigan.

425
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,750
Okay. Because we were working on Michigan in the lab activities. And I don't want to confuse people.

426
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:11,560
All right. So continue working on with this fold file, the purex file and under maps, go to your map view.

427
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,140
I'm going to just go to the full extent here.

428
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,860
You could see everything in the whole country.

429
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,180
Okay, so under map, there's something called select by attribute.

430
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:31,660
This is going to be very useful as we move forward in class.

431
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:43,480
So when you when you go to that tool that selects all features in the layer based on their characteristics or their attributes.

432
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,790
So the input in or the layer here is the lung cancer mortality layer.

433
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,710
We're making a musical selection in what we want to select.

434
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,870
We want to select all the counties in Michigan.

435
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:10,240
Okay. So you put to let this state abbreviation variable is equal to am I and push.

436
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:21,759
Okay. So all the Michigan counties are selected and the next step is you want to create a new layer based on the selection.

437
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,680
So I'm under number three.

438
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:34,960
Okay. So right click on the lung cancer mortality layer and go to selection.

439
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:45,190
And then the bottom half there's a pink something called match make layer for selected features.

440
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:54,300
So once you did that, a new layer popped up on top of this, select the old layer.

441
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:59,970
Okay, so this is the data for the new layer right here.

442
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:05,490
And it's it puts it on top and it adds the word selection to the end.

443
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:11,580
So what you can rename the one way to rename it is right click, go to properties,

444
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:21,240
go to General and you can remain the layer here or you can rename it and right directly in the drawing order.

445
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:25,760
I could put my in the front finish and.

446
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:38,690
Okay. You can drag groups, you can select.

447
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:47,110
Explore what kind of. Round it and zoom into the Michigan where.

448
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:57,559
You know, if you can look at a histogram of the data in Michigan,

449
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:05,840
only if you read charts and histograms in the lung cancer mortality or at the bottom it would do it for the whole country.

450
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,080
And that's not very helpful for this exercise lab activity.

451
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:09,650
Six Right.

452
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:19,640
So you want to really look at what's going on in your state so you can right click on the new layer which enabled Michigan lung cancer mortality.

453
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:23,840
Go to charts three chart, go to histogram.

454
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:32,110
And then a new pane will pop up a chart pane on the right hand side.

455
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:40,930
And the variable you are interested in might be our wm00 underscore zero four.

456
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:48,340
So that's the histogram for low density white men in the state.

457
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,690
You can show the normal distribution here if you like.

458
01:07:54,340 --> 01:08:01,780
Right now there are ten nine bins, but you can increase the number of bins, meaning the number of bars.

459
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:10,000
You can go up to 15 to get a better idea of of the distribution.

460
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:14,230
And here you can see that the distribution is a bit skewed to the right.

461
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:22,390
There is an extreme county here, and you can click on that and it will highlight which one it is.

462
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:29,960
Right. You can click on. Different bars that the average bars has here.

463
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:35,180
These are the average counties. The lowest rate counties are on the left.

464
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,720
So you click on that and select those. Okay.

465
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,300
It's a little better way to explore the data.

466
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:50,690
It gives you the minimum maximum in all kinds of summary statistics for the counties in the state for this specific variable.

467
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:56,660
You can do the same thing for, you know, for females.

468
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:05,610
Right. So the distribution looks quite different for females.

469
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:13,470
And you can see this in the high rate counties for females. And so forth.

470
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:34,380
You can also export this chart as he wanted to use it for a presentation or add it to a map that you're making.

471
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:47,280
You can click export and export it as a graphic name, but we're not going to finish the activity here.

472
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,610
All right. And then somebody asked, well, how would I view a different variable in the map?

473
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:59,280
I'm just looking at lung cancer mortality for males. I want to look at other variables.

474
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:04,949
I'm going to clear my selection. If you have anything selected. Go up here and push.

475
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:11,940
Clear. Okay. So, lab activity nine talks a little bit about what symbology is.

476
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:17,460
How do you work with symbology? So click on the link.

477
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,560
My lung cancer mortality mirrored the one we created for Michigan.

478
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:33,150
And right click on it and go to symbology. It's right towards the second half of that list.

479
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:39,460
Yeah. So a symbology painted pop up on the right hand side.

480
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:44,650
And I said, well, no, I'm I'm interested in what happens in black men and not white men.

481
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:55,600
So you can change the variable. The field hour be zero zero underscore for.

482
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:01,770
This is the rates. This is what's happening in men. Okay.

483
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:07,800
But let's go back to switch back to white men because they kind of went off track here.

484
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:25,110
And I guess one thing to note is this kind of symbology is called graduated colors, meaning it changes the color based on the value in that field.

485
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:39,570
Okay. There are other options. You can use graduated symbols, which is what the percentage female headed household is is displaying.

486
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:45,240
So it would be a symbol that changes size based on the variable.

487
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:52,049
Okay. So here, if you change it to a symbol, it will turn into whatever the default is.

488
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:57,780
Which are these yellow circles? You want to go back and choose graduated colors.

489
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:06,430
Okay. Of course it uses the default mode and all the bins have changed, actually.

490
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,180
Well, look, the field is area. Sorry.

491
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:18,610
I don't know why that changed. Ah, w m there we go.

492
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:26,560
Okay. After the in the method, method is the way it decides where to put the cutoffs.

493
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,150
Okay. And there are different options.

494
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:33,610
This is the natural breaks option.

495
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:45,970
You can create manual breaks for manual intervals, meaning you can go to the histogram and change the intervals manually.

496
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:55,680
You can select one tiles and it will grouped them by percentiles.

497
01:12:55,690 --> 01:13:04,690
Right. The first, second, third and fourth quartiles, you can do equal interval,

498
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:15,700
which looks at the distribution of the values and makes an interval of equal values and not equal number of people, which is what Quintiles does.

499
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:21,190
And so forth. You can choose a color ran under color scheme.

500
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,860
There are many different options here.

501
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:39,730
I have provided the link in the lab slide for something called Color Board, which is, I think, very helpful if you want to identify color scheme.

502
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,470
That is colorblind, friendly.

503
01:13:49,060 --> 01:14:00,879
Okay. And this becomes important for making more inclusive maps and so forth so that it talks about, you know, what type of data are you looking at?

504
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,330
Is a qualitative data. Is it diverging from a middle point?

505
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:07,840
Is a sequential. We're looking at sequential data higher.

506
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,580
The the number the the the worst outcome here.

507
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:22,150
And if you look at color schemes that might be colorblind friendly here, if you're more multi-hued single hue.

508
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:25,750
So if you click on the colorblind, see,

509
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:35,080
these are all colorblind seats and you can see what you like here and then choose a similar color room in the in the in our GIS probe.

510
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:47,520
I thought they were going to integrate our jazz fur with colorblind friendly colors, but I'm not sure we've done that yet.

511
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:56,900
Okay, so what I'd like you to do is just explore the different, you know,

512
01:14:57,090 --> 01:15:05,190
methods of interval for your data, explore different variables that you could symbolize.

513
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:11,850
You can even explore the female head in a household variable.

514
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:21,370
Unfortunately, we didn't select a female head of household later in.

515
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,450
And that's that's what we're going to do with the numbers. Step number three.

516
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:36,930
So how about we do that right now and let's do the same thing we did with lung cancer mortality.

517
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:47,219
We'll do that with the female head of household variable. So you can right click no, you can to select by attribute I'm sorry and change the input.

518
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:50,610
Roe 2% female head of household.

519
01:15:53,360 --> 01:16:08,689
Select Underwear, select the field select state name because there's no abbreviation variable in that table is equal to Michigan State and push.

520
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:16,969
Okay, so only Michigan is selected and then you can right click on the percentage female head

521
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:24,920
of household layer and go to selection and make a layer from the selected features.

522
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:31,310
So it makes a new layer on top. You can select the previous layer.

523
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:35,470
So you just see the Michigan data, okay?

524
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:48,530
And you can put the also turn on to the lung cancer mortality data and you can see them on a single map.

525
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:54,740
Let's say you wanted to symbolize the percentage female head of the household data.

526
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:06,660
Okay. Okay. Let's rename this first. Actually, the good properties.

527
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:21,390
But am I in front for Michigan? And you can do the symbology for the top layer.

528
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:30,770
And it gives you the symbology pane with the female head of household feel.

529
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:36,800
And it gives you. Now, what does normalization mean here?

530
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:44,060
All it is saying is that female head of household f f sorry, f age child.

531
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:48,860
It's the count of households that are female headed in the county.

532
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:54,770
So you want to divide that by the number of households. So that's what normalization does.

533
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:58,850
It divides by another variables or dividing by households.

534
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:04,070
So what you see is the rate of female headed households in that country.

535
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:10,310
This is using manual breaks. There are four different break points.

536
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:17,240
The size and symbol can be adjusted in the minimum and the maximum size.

537
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:24,640
Let's change the method to equal interval. Okay.

538
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:31,979
It lists use three intervals.

539
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,790
So low. Middle high. Okay. And.

540
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:43,530
So you can change this background.

541
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:50,060
Properties. It is no color, right? It's already no color.

542
01:18:50,060 --> 01:19:01,200
So we're okay. The other thing you can also do is in their labels, you can change these labels a little bit.

543
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:07,690
Okay. Let's say this is a you know, you can say this is 3% looks.

544
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:15,660
To 5.3%.

545
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:29,700
So this is 5.9% to 8.8%.

546
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:37,980
So you can change the labels here instead of using these decimal points, which are hard for people to interpret.

547
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:46,500
You could change that if you like, because when you put a legend, it will be looking at the labels, not the values.

548
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:55,080
And so this is 8.8% to 11.7%.

549
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:16,380
All right. So once you kind of work with that, you can save this file and go to projects, right.

550
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:27,000
And save and as you can call it, lung cancer mortality, PR X underscore your name and save.

551
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:36,450
So what I would like you to do now is see what time is it?

552
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,520
We've been here for about an hour and a half.

553
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:50,730
How about you take a few minutes to redo lab activity six, but to, you know, make your map layout much more a cleaner map with just your state.

554
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:56,610
Okay. So right now we worked with Michigan and we learned a little bit of symbology.

555
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:05,610
So maybe you want to try to visualize a different variable, not for black white men, but do it for black men or whatever else is important to you.

556
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:16,110
And, you know, create the layout again using using the new so that new layers that you created for your state.

557
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:45,390
So this is like this is an example map you could create based on what we talked about today.

558
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:53,760
Okay. And last week, both of them.

559
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,390
But. Yes, that.

560
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:19,950
I know. People in.

561
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:33,750
So I think just to break down the steps a little bit, to redo lab activity six.

562
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:41,580
Yeah, create a new layer for your state for the lung cancer mortality data and the female head of household data.

563
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:49,830
Okay. Change the symbology to your liking, pointing to a variable that you are more interested in,

564
01:22:50,430 --> 01:23:01,100
or maybe have a couple of different variables you symbolize. Add Title Legend, North Arrow Scale Bar and export as a PDF.

565
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:31,790
Starting from scratch. 40.

566
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:22,180
In the weeks leading. But we didn't prepare for it.

567
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:26,930
And I went through something.

568
01:24:45,060 --> 01:25:26,490
Time. Yeah.

569
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:34,960
Oh, yeah. That's what I think is pretty cool.

570
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:47,910
I like all the crowds. I think I used to be pretty quiet here.

571
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:54,560
I think some of them would feel confused about all the uranium because it's okay.

572
01:25:54,700 --> 01:26:03,520
So I did this very fast and I did, but this is way too premature, so I don't know how to do it.

573
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:08,020
We're just the states and there's no other counties, and I think it was perfect.

574
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,710
So I did it. Time to do a little bit different.

575
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:18,610
One that's close to if you leave the query, you think you go, yeah, it's very.

576
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:28,489
No, they canceled. Yeah, there was a year because it was just like.

577
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:32,940
Yes. Okay. You think so?

578
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:39,560
Oh, yeah. All right. So I think what you want to do is do it slightly differently.

579
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:44,690
Instead of using query, you select by attribute this to go to.

580
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:57,260
Um, you can here in Leon here a little map this map view Google maps and clear selection

581
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:05,420
first so as to select by attribute this great book now with the lung cancer data.

582
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:10,070
Okay. And then going to select radiation.

583
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:20,470
Okay. Okay. Now the next step is you want to create a new layer based on what you selected.

584
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:31,330
Based. Okay. From here. Yeah. So you can right click to selection and to make the layer from selected features,

585
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:40,310
you may see a numeric it's get the types of equipment could get worse if you just

586
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:46,360
skip Oklahoma cancer here so now so you see only a little bit more frequently.

587
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:56,090
Yeah so you do the same thing over here, so take it so it's okay and then select plan.

588
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,600
Does this apply. Okay. Do the same thing.

589
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:05,230
I mean. Okay.

590
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:14,040
Okay. I want a creative leader for that. You know that someone options for selection may be major, and you have to go.

591
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:21,230
You select this one. You have both. I really don't know why that.

592
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:27,710
Okay. So now have you both. So now you work. Don't work with these people.

593
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:34,990
Okay. Okay. Do you think there's anyone who would you prefer?

594
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:59,710
Um, I haven't quite. Sure. Yeah, I know, because you're working on a different place, and this is a state, so you still have to deal with it.

595
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:08,110
I think we talked about education. Yeah, I'm good.

596
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:18,370
Now, I'm going to go to this one right now.

597
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:45,270
And that'll make all teachers. And then you smoke, you keep the new layer or you just name and you carry.

598
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:51,290
But it's not like. Because it doesn't hurt.

599
01:29:51,940 --> 01:30:09,150
If I wanted to, I can sit there for hours. There. There's certain things that you can't let me get with, like the name of the thing that happens.

600
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:16,240
Like, I don't know, because they're just very minimal.

601
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:19,680
Yeah, it's not my fault.

602
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:28,630
And I don't think there's any other districts in each other.

603
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:39,579
Like, really quickly, this is similar to the other.

604
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:54,060
The argument is like, it's just like I don't I want to be just for that.

605
01:30:54,100 --> 01:31:09,860
But I think it's so weird to actually have the number one right click on the contact me.

606
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:20,610
But I swear I can't understand how it connected with one.

607
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:32,519
What does it mean to be insert title?

608
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:36,480
Legendary. Oh, man. Oh, my.

609
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:53,820
11000000.

610
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:57,770
I'm just trying so hard to disagree.

611
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:03,170
Yeah. Yeah. You. Oh, I must.

612
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:08,050
Socialism. Oh, because it turned out how they lived 46 years later.

613
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:20,620
Yeah. I look here the site with this, like, history and you like, you know for sure what's happened is right.

614
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:24,930
This has just been walking into that now. Right.

615
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:31,690
So you addressing the idea that something is always going.

616
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:40,230
We just don't know what to do. All right.

617
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:44,910
So, you know, I think as you do this work, you're probably thinking, I wish I could do this.

618
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:50,139
I wish I could do that. I hope that we'll get to some of that as we move forward in class.

619
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:56,890
You're not going to be able to make everything today, but I think hopefully you're getting your juices flowing about what you would like to do.

620
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:00,220
Okay. So we'll try to cover that as we move into class.

621
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:10,750
Did everybody get a chance to redo your math layout based on a new layer for

622
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:14,620
the counties in your state and not with every other county in the country?

623
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:22,270
Is anybody still working on that? Raise your hands if you need more time.

624
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:28,750
If you need a little help, I can come and help. How about we do five more minutes of working?

625
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:31,930
Explore. There's a lot of stuff to explore if you're done.

626
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:40,780
One thing I would like you to note is when you do symbolize the variable that you're interested in,

627
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:54,370
just kind of observe how the symbolism and the visual changes so much based on the method that you use to create your cutoffs versus equal interval,

628
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:58,120
for example, and quantile for natural breaks.

629
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:07,540
Just observe how things change so much and also think about does that change my interpretation of what I'm looking at?

630
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:17,740
Okay, so one thing I want you to get away and get out of today's exercise is the way I symbolize that data makes interpretation very different.

631
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:29,110
And this is a big part of how you can make maps lie just by using this different color and choosing breaks that fit your bias.

632
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:36,220
All right. So there are methodologies to address that bias, and there's also statistics to use.

633
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:41,380
So you don't actually deal with that bias at all. But we'll learn about as we move on to class.

634
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:47,200
But the symbology feature of our map and ArcGIS pro and so forth and all mapping

635
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:52,570
programs are a really easy way to introduce bias into what you're doing.

636
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,389
Okay, I'm going to come back and help ramp it up in five and roll out.

637
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:05,320
We're both in that space, you know, as the color.

638
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:12,310
You know, the kids are really nice to see.

639
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:17,720
Okay. Yes. Well, we're going to have to stick to the program.

640
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:26,020
And then they're in the corporate world that are, you know, looking good on the computer.

641
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:31,260
That's what happens. So that's another thing when I.

642
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:38,760
Yeah. You know, why is it not popping up before the.

643
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:45,480
You know, because, you know, they're like, oh, here.

644
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:49,740
And so we're going to be worried, you know, what life is like.

645
01:35:52,530 --> 01:36:01,550
But yeah, I can't say that it's bad and it's like change or you're going to have to wait for some changes.

646
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:06,300
Yeah, whatever the case.

647
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:10,180
Why is that? No, I think. Why that?

648
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,920
None of that. I know.

649
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:21,320
It's like, yeah, everything's going to be great in his personality.

650
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:24,470
Not a big deal, but when it comes, it's great.

651
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:38,400
Like, I'm just being honest, but it seems like I think it's a little bit of both are just common areas,

652
01:36:38,410 --> 01:36:56,399
the whole primary one, the one for me, you know, in order to do that, we have to have an open mind.

653
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:01,710
This is what we're doing, right? This window is really, oh, you have to do that.

654
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:10,710
So you just make your own judgments, which we do every year.

655
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:23,460
So just so you know, this is where the growth rate is.

656
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:36,700
Okay. Which is why we go through.

657
01:37:39,550 --> 01:37:44,500
Okay. You got it.

658
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:52,650
Well, well, why don't we?

659
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:57,130
I think we can keep scrolling down. Oh, there's way.

660
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,430
You know, I didn't.

661
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:13,350
And also final debates about changes at home.

662
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:33,960
And here you have to use both. Michigan, they're going to move over and yeah, you know, I guess the thing is to look at ratings.

663
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:47,340
It's pretty late. There's a huge I don't know if I can for some viewers change and I can't add anything else.

664
01:38:48,330 --> 01:39:02,890
What do you want to do? I want to mention once she starts that, you tell me what you felt including you think I know.

665
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:12,150
At least the last time I saw something like that I put it to you.

666
01:39:12,150 --> 01:39:31,380
So with that, I was going to have to make sure to tell you as Mr. House member.

667
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:43,890
Because you're going to. As long as I don't know who will make me happy.

668
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:49,120
Oh, no. Oh, yes.

669
01:39:56,340 --> 01:40:03,200
Okay you're having. I think, at some point in this race.

670
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:36,720
Could you do something? I couldn't agree with you completely that this.

671
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:59,549
Sure. Did you press for first time? I believe now that I can see for yourself when you're doing that and you're like because it's

672
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:14,370
like you have one way or because I have something over your head and it's very strange.

673
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:30,770
Those are the things we don't. That's kind of sort of in those terms, it's like you're this is a great time to be able to concentrate now.

674
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:35,370
And I think a lot more so than just the cheesecake this.

675
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:48,150
Hmm. Granted, I'm not sure of the sentence, but this.

676
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,970
Even if she's still one of my people.

677
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:59,690
Or is this something? We're funny when sometimes.

678
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:11,490
Sometimes where you have that at least three of those. We would see a lot of future travel.

679
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:26,560
So for me, for many times I was right on the edges with the Good Samaritan in Hungary.

680
01:42:27,970 --> 01:42:39,220
Maybe we should at least have a letting go ahead. You can see the Monsanto facade when you remove some of the pictures that, yes, they are lying.

681
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:42,550
Okay. Thank you for that. So I.

682
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:50,709
Things are so. All right.

683
01:42:50,710 --> 01:42:53,680
So after you guys are done playing around,

684
01:42:54,010 --> 01:43:08,860
I say we take a quick break and then we'll come back and talk about your assignments and then we'll do still that discussion.

685
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:16,680
So let's do a ten minute break. So 420, I say 430, 13 minute break.

686
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:25,200
Okay. Bring.

687
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:40,110
But I. I.

688
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:51,200
Yeah. Oh, right.

689
01:43:54,790 --> 01:44:05,690
But it was clear year that it was going to be someone who was like, Yeah, yeah, do you hear what I'm saying?

690
01:44:05,770 --> 01:44:10,660
Don't do it. It's like, Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

691
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:24,570
So that's another one of was kind of is that it's all going into a movie and that same professor why would you also be so pretty?

692
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:30,120
Obviously you would never like a moment. I can't do.

693
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:35,260
There's two ways to do. One is to do very, very difficult things.

694
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:48,860
You can do that. So now because circumstance your name is actually creating layers because there's been a who's who was pretty cool.

695
01:44:50,230 --> 01:45:00,740
Yeah it is obviously so I think it feels like a schedule it's way really doing something you can say things for one day and then you write clearly.

696
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:13,360
The second one is this is what I got, which was we can work it out.

697
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:36,850
I what? And then I mean, it's like it seems like on the surface, you know, because I think it's like that.

698
01:45:40,150 --> 01:45:44,320
Yes. Yes.

699
01:45:44,630 --> 01:46:01,950
So why does it really? If you're trying to figure out how to kind of friend who's got their license.

700
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:24,880
Yeah. So I think that the media has been increasingly the media's in this country for reasons that will reduce the politics.

701
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:28,650
Even Clinton has said. You just as soon as I get.

702
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:48,890
Whilst. Yes, let me go back and look at all those things that I think folks are not going to.

703
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:53,760
Because it is different. Yeah. Oh, that's.

704
01:46:54,110 --> 01:47:04,420
I really like filling in. I continued to call my myself.

705
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:15,530
So he is doing it with the. So you know this at the population which is population.

706
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:30,040
Yeah. I got them in my. Oh.

707
01:47:36,980 --> 01:48:06,320
Female. And I didn't amazed that I can see to shoot and shoot and put going to make it up.

708
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:13,520
Yeah. Okay. Because the whole thing was printed.

709
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:27,350
The charity. Oh, I think that's because it's also so obvious.

710
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:30,580
I'm not sure this time to. So.

711
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:41,430
I told you because this is. You can.

712
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:47,720
Natalie Whiting. The Tampa is.

713
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:58,120
And journalists are suggesting that.

714
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:04,090
Mr. Oh, we presume you've already added that one was precise then.

715
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:12,309
Yeah, but then like the last time we touched on, you know, to do that, we, but it looks like that here.

716
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:23,620
So I don't know. It's it's incredible to just those I mean at it just so yeah that's what I tried to do when I couldn't fix minded it I think.

717
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:32,460
I think we utilize it pretty well. Yeah. So I don't know, maybe it has the dots.

718
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:37,030
I think it just because it looks like that here so I don't know. Damn it's so.

719
01:49:37,870 --> 01:49:40,930
Yeah but that might be right for the population.

720
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:45,740
I know the anything that you say.

721
01:49:45,790 --> 01:49:55,960
I thought that was a circle graph. I'm like, oh no. Because I don't know, Alicia, just the role that's going to look like that, because it took years.

722
01:49:56,330 --> 01:50:00,230
I don't know. I don't think anything to do with other things, Jennifer.

723
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:05,260
I'm full of confidence. I mean, I don't know, you know?

724
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:24,550
Yeah. Some really cool normalizations. So maybe you're in there because they are writing your letter and you change like the maximum to do that.

725
01:50:24,650 --> 01:50:26,540
Whereas here is really, well, how do you do that?

726
01:50:27,530 --> 01:50:38,930
You know, I don't I don't think you can, but I didn't think it was like right click on that later that I don't work that one.

727
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:49,010
So when I do that I can like, you know, so I was working and it just, I don't know what this does,

728
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:57,710
but for me it wasn't, you know, in the country, you know, it just gets bigger.

729
01:51:00,170 --> 01:51:05,490
Could you talk about your movements? It was like, oh, between you and me?

730
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:14,210
I think so. Okay. No, we're still, you know.

731
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:20,310
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

732
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:27,170
Yeah. Because I guess they have them, like, interesting to hear.

733
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:31,550
A lot of people were really going on, and I do.

734
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:36,650
Yeah. I favor the location and makes it work.

735
01:51:39,450 --> 01:51:44,180
Yeah. Right. Okay.

736
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:53,150
You know, it's like, oh, I think this record or.

737
01:51:55,160 --> 01:52:06,180
Yeah. You the meeting on that.

738
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:18,720
Yeah. It's a bit. Yeah, I think I do.

739
01:52:23,870 --> 01:52:43,990
I guess. I don't think I was doing that, but I forgot how to get look at, things which nobody is trying to do 100%.

740
01:52:44,110 --> 01:52:49,030
Right. Okay. Thank you. Three classes. Three. His circle.

741
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:53,950
Gigantic circle.

742
01:52:54,280 --> 01:53:04,589
Yeah. Why did you change your classes?

743
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:11,430
To only have three. Okay, so it was just because you had five and we have three.

744
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:14,850
Okay, so class and hang on. Hang on.

745
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:18,990
Wait a second. Okay, so what is three?

746
01:53:19,650 --> 01:53:23,010
No, not that any more. No. Okay. No.

747
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:27,830
Oh, really? You do go through there because. Yeah. No, that's you.

748
01:53:28,030 --> 01:53:33,860
You need three before you broke.

749
01:53:40,590 --> 01:53:44,550
Okay. Because I have heard of it. Know? I knew that.

750
01:53:53,590 --> 01:54:09,150
A lot of people that don't live in the country want to get to move out of the house and into their graduate school.

751
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,510
The decline of the nation.

752
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:23,350
Oh, never mind.

753
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:29,290
Honestly, if that's.

754
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:38,630
I think this entire, entire ledger. I know they're just going to do it all over again this time.

755
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:43,520
Yes. Now, I read what you did.

756
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:50,780
They could have had a whole bunch of other stuff clips. No way.

757
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:58,999
And you know it because I just went back to the letter to everything with the symbology is because she had a different class,

758
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,960
like she was in a different thing. I wasn't involved. Like, do it again.

759
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:07,580
Yeah. Because it was supposed to be, like, normal and helpful, but she had pulled into one once.

760
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:12,970
Oh, okay. I mean, she's got a pretty big circle.

761
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,270
She's on the bottom line, so I'm guessing that her data is different. Yeah.

762
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:19,490
Having something to do with it at least is going to figure it out.

763
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,220
Yeah. You mean you figure it out, you know? Yeah.

764
01:55:25,820 --> 01:55:30,620
Okay. Cause I'm telling you. 7500.

765
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:34,640
Yeah. Several thousand years later. Oh.

766
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:45,750
And the younger version, which at the end of the book.

767
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:33,700
But. Good to be with you.

768
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:45,770
Yes. So this works for you.

769
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:55,010
And I'm usually in there with this lady, Black Hawk down on the ground.

770
01:56:55,630 --> 01:57:01,970
But, yeah, come on. So it's all right.

771
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:14,220
No. I think I'm just playing around with the map, too.

772
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:17,320
Just having fun. Thank you, guys. Okay.

773
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:30,680
Was. I didn't.

774
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:43,390
All right. Well, I was hoping we could do a group activity where you can discuss what you learned about cancer mortality in your state.

775
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:50,850
But I think probably most of you are too focused on trying to get the system to work to make sense of the data.

776
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:55,960
So I totally understand that. But so let's not worry about that at the moment.

777
01:57:56,860 --> 01:58:01,930
But what I want to ask you right now is this your experience with using this software, right?

778
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:09,910
Like, how is it going for you so far? How hard or how easy are you finding ArcGIS pro to use?

779
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:14,079
Yeah, so I think it's cool. I really like a lot of the labs.

780
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:19,480
It's like that. There's a lot of buttons. So I think they can confuse, like which when I press what's going on.

781
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:24,790
So I think that's where, as far as I think, over time I'll get better at it. But it's just it's always great.

782
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:28,360
There's a lot of webinars we're not even using, right? So yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:31,060
So there is a lot to kind of remember. Good point.

784
01:58:31,090 --> 01:58:38,680
Yeah, I think I think it's like the processes too that I have to remember like, oh, I have to go back and select this before I can do most things.

785
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:44,410
That's right. And that's kind of why I've tried to give you all the steps.

786
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:50,860
So I think I kind of messed up today because I skipped around a little bit, and I really apologize for that.

787
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:56,500
But I do recommend that you practice the lab when you get home.

788
01:58:56,830 --> 01:59:00,069
The ones we do in class, it doesn't take that much time.

789
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:05,470
You take an hour, hour and a half to go through the lab again so you can get the steps there.

790
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:08,620
Because if you skip a step, you're like, What did I do wrong?

791
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:12,220
I can't get this to look like you're testing it.

792
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:17,050
So I agree with you. There's a lot of sequential things you need to do.

793
01:59:17,770 --> 01:59:21,220
So that's why I try to be as clear as possible in the lab activity.

794
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:25,750
I was not clear in lecture today or class today, so I apologize.

795
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:31,280
But we go back to the activities and those are, I think, well laid out.

796
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:36,460
So I appreciate what you just said. Do you like it so far?

797
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:42,280
Is that something that you want to learn more about? I hope so, because it's too late to drive it.

798
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:57,850
Yeah, I think it's kind of fun. And once you get more used to it, it'll become easier and more accepting nature.

799
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:06,760
The problem with me is that I also don't use pro that much anymore, and it's changed a lot over the last five years.

800
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:11,080
I would say so after we remember everything. So I apologize for that.

801
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:17,410
But you know, I could give you remembering all the different buttons and steps and so forth.

802
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:22,570
Any questions or comments you have about the stuff that all?

803
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:34,130
Are there things you wish you knew how to do already that you don't know yet from what you already started to do?

804
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:38,230
I think some things came up like, how do I display a different variable?

805
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:43,570
Somebody asked, How do I get two different variables to show up on the layout?

806
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:51,810
We'll get to all of that because we're going to work with map frames and creating multiple map frames in layout view, but also in mapping.

807
02:00:52,090 --> 02:00:55,870
It's important to create multiple map frames in map view for that type of work.

808
02:00:57,350 --> 02:01:04,870
So I'm glad that I'm hearing positive. Also, there's a little bit of a challenge, but I hear mostly positive.

809
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:09,310
So that's great. And then let's shift gears for a few minutes.

810
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:16,210
We're going to start like lab activities probably for today because we don't have time to do everything.

811
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:25,930
So I wanted to give you guys some information about Assignment one and to just to have a discussion about it if you have any questions.

812
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:33,360
So assignment one has to do with you finding a publication that is of interest to you that you like.

813
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:38,680
For whatever reason, it can be a lay publication, a scientific publication.

814
02:01:39,190 --> 02:01:43,190
It could be a report, it can be a news article, right?

815
02:01:43,210 --> 02:01:54,010
It could be a blog post. Anything that has a is a is a good kind of critical piece about the health issue that it's trying to address.

816
02:01:54,010 --> 02:02:04,720
And it should be a writing that dealing with the geographic analysis of a health problem and it should contain one or more maps.

817
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:16,600
So if you don't have any maps in that piece, you shouldn't use it for this class and you should critically review that paper or that report.

818
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:20,920
Critically review means you guys have done that all the time, right, in high school.

819
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:24,480
College here. You know, what's the thesis?

820
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:28,660
That the thesis makes sense. Is it logical? What data are they using?

821
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:30,190
What's the quality of the data?

822
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:38,260
Are there any problems with the data quality or are there any positive things you can say about the quality of the data?

823
02:02:38,350 --> 02:02:42,940
Looking at the maps, are the maps understandable, readable?

824
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:48,310
They look good in terms of an illustration. Are they conveying something of importance to you?

825
02:02:49,450 --> 02:03:00,940
Are the conclusions that the report provides really fall in line with the information that's communicated in terms of the data and so forth?

826
02:03:01,410 --> 02:03:07,780
Because there's a little bit more information about this assignment in the assignment section and modules.

827
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:11,530
But I also ask that you provide a copy of the publication.

828
02:03:11,530 --> 02:03:16,240
When you send it in, submit it, submit your critical review.

829
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:24,610
Okay. The second assignment, this is a this is a little more intensive than the first assignment.

830
02:03:25,180 --> 02:03:34,120
The idea of the second assignment is for you to start thinking about how to get the data that I need to create a map that I want and then created.

831
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:45,130
Okay. So what you will have to do is create one of the maps that are in that publication and then turn that in to me as your assignment.

832
02:03:45,610 --> 02:03:55,090
And it doesn't have to be the exact map. It could be a version of the map is sometimes the map may have complicated spatial analysis.

833
02:03:55,660 --> 02:04:00,399
You can simplify that and create a map of your own. You can use the map as an inspiration.

834
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:08,970
Maybe the map is about, you know, sub-Saharan Africa, but you want it to look at the same kind of thing in in the deserts of,

835
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:16,300
you know, the United States of America or something like that, because those maps there are not available readily.

836
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:24,760
So it could be an inspirational piece that you want to work from to create your own map.

837
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:28,410
So that's why I underlined your version of that map. Okay.

838
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:36,670
And you should include with that map the data source. So whatever data you're using to create your maps should be provided to me.

839
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:42,240
Include the project folder along with the project files.

840
02:04:42,670 --> 02:04:46,630
That means the NPR X file, the geo database file.

841
02:04:48,370 --> 02:04:55,210
And those are the two most important files a toolbox that is probably not going to be used by you guys at this point.

842
02:04:56,470 --> 02:05:06,700
Okay. And provide a description of how you created that map in a similar fashion that I provide you in the lab activities.

843
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:10,120
Okay. So what are the steps you took to create the maps?

844
02:05:10,930 --> 02:05:21,400
And I would like to meet with each student before October 11 to give you a consultation on the map that you're going to make.

845
02:05:21,670 --> 02:05:26,110
So at these meetings, what we usually do is we go through the paper.

846
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:31,010
Together we look at the maps you may select.

847
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:36,890
I want to try to make this one and I will kind of go back and forth with you to give you some advice on how you approach it.

848
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:44,120
Okay. I think that's an important meeting because sometimes you may bite off more than you can chew and feel really frustrated.

849
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:50,930
And I don't want you to feel that way too much. Frustration is good for learning, but too much frustration is is not good.

850
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:54,410
So I really would like to require that you meet with me.

851
02:05:54,800 --> 02:06:02,550
So I'm going to send around a sign up sheet sometime next week and we'll have a 15 to 30 minute meeting with each of you to do that.

852
02:06:02,570 --> 02:06:08,630
Okay. And just remember that you may be asked to present your map to the class.

853
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:12,890
Like, what does it mean? How did you do it? Why did you choose it, etc.?

854
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:20,060
And just got a five minute presentation about your work to the class and I may choose about three or four people to do that.

855
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:24,080
Okay. Any questions about assignments?

856
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:28,930
One and two? Okay.

857
02:06:28,930 --> 02:06:31,960
So right now we know start looking for a publication.

858
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:43,059
I notice that all of you are in a team now. So don't talk to your team for the final project and see what area you might be considering for the final

859
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:49,990
project that may help you narrow your search for the first assignment study a group assignment number one.

860
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:55,210
It's an individual assignment, but you can get some, you know,

861
02:06:55,570 --> 02:07:01,770
a head start on the final assignment if you strategically plan which paper to choose for someone.

862
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:08,230
Hey, you have a question? Do you have any places specifically that you recommend recommended for us to look for our paper?

863
02:07:09,810 --> 02:07:20,040
Oh, well, I guess in terms of like spatial analysis and maps and so forth, there's a journal called Health and Place Health in Place.

864
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:24,160
Yeah, that is a good journal that that does a lot of jazz related work.

865
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:27,760
But I think one thing you want to think about is search terms.

866
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:40,540
Right. So GIS, geographic, spatial maps of the sea.

867
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:44,860
Yeah, he's starting out geographic information systems.

868
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:46,900
I think that'll get you.

869
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:56,920
And then, of course, attach your health issue or your your local or your population in addition to those search terms and get there.

870
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:06,889
Yeah, I think that's and then you can also look at some of the papers in the class that we've signed and look

871
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:11,900
at the references for those papers and see if there's anything there that might be useful for you.

872
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:18,770
But I find that students don't have a hard time finding something with they have a hard time doing as a seminar,

873
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:23,870
too, because they maybe pick something a little more too complicated to accomplish.

874
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:28,730
So this assignment one and two is designed. So you get ready for your final project.

875
02:08:29,630 --> 02:08:37,010
You kind of are exercising the idea of going and finding the data and bringing it into artists and mapping it.

876
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:42,290
And so we'll be doing everything necessary for you to do Assignment two by the time you get there.

877
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:47,000
Like how to bring data and exercise and to look for data and stuff like that.

878
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:55,490
So hopefully you'll have enough work in class to get you ready for assignment to any other questions.

879
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,590
All right. So with that, we already did our break.

880
02:09:00,590 --> 02:09:02,600
Let's do our student led discussions.

881
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:10,190
So that's going to take about a half an hour and then maybe we'll have enough time for me to talk about the lecture piece of today.

882
02:09:11,150 --> 02:09:17,210
So first we have Jennifer talking about chapter two in and out.

883
02:09:17,270 --> 02:09:27,320
No, in the textbook, and then we'll have Q in talking about geocoding and measuring desks in the United States of America.

884
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:40,060
So let's start with Jennifer. I think I have your. Slides show up, so please start whenever you are ready.

885
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:52,610
I guess. Okay.

886
02:09:54,200 --> 02:10:05,030
So just some basic definitions of the chapter started off with just describing spatial data as being observations with explicit locations.

887
02:10:05,450 --> 02:10:09,889
This specific article focused on geospatial data because it's often is obtained through

888
02:10:09,890 --> 02:10:13,910
observation and measurement of events or objects to reference to their location in that space.

889
02:10:14,810 --> 02:10:20,870
And it's because it's like the area of interest that people most often people use are things relating to the surface of the earth.

890
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:25,670
And so geographic information is crucial to the implementation of GIS.

891
02:10:26,330 --> 02:10:30,890
And the article talked about how JS relies on having to access geography,

892
02:10:31,070 --> 02:10:36,770
geographic information to be able to present maps and things kind of similar to what we were just doing in lab.

893
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:42,560
So one of the that types of data that it talks about is field data.

894
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:48,860
So actually there are two main approaches to modeling geographic information.

895
02:10:48,860 --> 02:10:50,239
So one of them is field data.

896
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:57,830
It's also called continuous data, and it often describes phenomena that are continuously distributed above, on or below the Earth's surface.

897
02:10:58,160 --> 02:11:03,620
So some examples at the reading listed were like precipitation, soil samples or surface elevation.

898
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:11,359
And I kind of included this image that I like Googled just because oftentimes this is like a tessellation model,

899
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:15,530
which is what later talked about, but like using the grid to kind of present this continuous data.

900
02:11:16,370 --> 02:11:24,950
And then and then the other one that they talked about was object data, and it's also called discrete data.

901
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:28,360
So this is often describes items that are found on a surface.

902
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:32,149
So kind of what we were just talking about like very explicit singular items.

903
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:38,930
So like a person in a hospital or a road and many health databases are tend to use object data just because

904
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:44,840
it's easier to conceptualize and it's easier for people to be able to distribute this information on a map.

905
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:50,150
So the reading talked about four different attributes to object data.

906
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:55,340
The first is spatial. I'm talking about like the outline of the shape or showing the perimeter.

907
02:11:55,670 --> 02:12:02,090
The reading showed the example of a reservoir. So having that outline the next one was a graphical tool,

908
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:07,910
like using a symbol to represent that object on the map, and it has that shaded figure temporal.

909
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:17,360
So describing like when the reservoir was developed or when like actually that data was input it into this and then textual and numeric.

910
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:27,530
So having like the name of the reservoir or information like surface area and like I just thought it was interesting that they had four object data.

911
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:31,100
There was just these different ways, like different attributes are used to describe the data.

912
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:37,610
And one of the questions I had here was like, How can this be helpful when talking about public health data,

913
02:12:37,610 --> 02:12:46,180
like having these different ways to describe data? Separately.

914
02:12:46,260 --> 02:12:50,690
They are looking at like open houses that like native Hip-Hop, certain types of place.

915
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:57,030
So I have met several down there could help you kind of color them and kind of go to those homes to kind of check those things out.

916
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:02,520
Yeah. Bridges interpretation.

917
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:07,470
People can visualize things a lot better when you can kind of break things down as well.

918
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:14,010
Yeah, because I was also thinking about like thinking about context, like maybe which attribute would be more relevant.

919
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:20,550
So maybe in certain aspects, maybe just more of a textual or numeric data is more relevant, like having more of a table of information.

920
02:13:20,970 --> 02:13:27,270
But kind of how we were talking about maybe like having outlines or a more of a visual can be more relevant to certain contexts.

921
02:13:29,910 --> 02:13:33,420
So the other model that that the reading talked about was this tessellation model,

922
02:13:34,230 --> 02:13:37,380
which is the one that's a little bit more complicated for us to grasp.

923
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:40,379
And I just realized this image is probably really hard for you guys to see,

924
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:47,970
but it's just talk about like the geometric process of partitioning area into smaller units that do not overlap but fill an area.

925
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:56,520
So typically we see squares like in this picture or you can use triangles or hexagons and like a raster model is the most common tessellation model,

926
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:59,610
which is kind of the one we were like a term we're familiar with in this class.

927
02:14:00,060 --> 02:14:05,940
What is just talking about using pixels to represent data or information on there is a table there.

928
02:14:05,940 --> 02:14:09,059
But one of the facts that I thought was really interesting was that like the

929
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:13,230
size of the pixel affects the size of the object on like how it's represented.

930
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:21,390
And then also it's tied to like resolution. And it had a more technical like explanation of why that is by just not like thinking of

931
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:26,190
changing the size of the pixel is like how you represent the size of the object on there.

932
02:14:28,080 --> 02:14:33,270
So the next one was the vector model that they described.

933
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:36,360
And so this one is the one also that we've been using in class today.

934
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:41,219
So like made up of different layers, but each vector layers corresponds to a single class of objects.

935
02:14:41,220 --> 02:14:47,280
So like one layer can be houses and then another layer can be hospitals and the different

936
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:52,290
types of like vectors which are point lines or areas that they described in the text.

937
02:14:55,770 --> 02:15:00,300
So a specific type of vector data, as they talked about, is like this network data,

938
02:15:01,230 --> 02:15:07,770
but it uses like the terminology instead of using like points and lines is talking about arcs and nodes,

939
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:14,159
which I thought was like interesting terminology. And I had two different types of network data.

940
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:21,120
So they had a planner network which they described where like the node is made when two lines over like intersect,

941
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:27,660
they create this node and then the non planner network are arcs that meet cross but does not result in a node.

942
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:32,700
And they use the example of like thinking about an overpass on a road where it's like technically

943
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:36,450
would be considered an intersecting line when we're just using like these lines and points.

944
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:40,110
But in real life, like that's not really an intersection.

945
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:44,460
So I thought that was really interesting example that they used in the text.

946
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:48,960
And I included this image here because they talked about how like network data

947
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:53,129
is useful for like modeling transportation systems and public utilities.

948
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:56,590
And like this is probably the way that we think of those things versus the,

949
02:15:56,610 --> 02:15:59,790
the one on the previous image where they're like including the points in the lines,

950
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:04,770
which I thought was really confusing and like I just was trying to think about like

951
02:16:04,830 --> 02:16:09,479
how this could be used because they include like arrows to kind of demonstrate like,

952
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:12,870
oh, it's a one way road. They use the arrows to kind of signify that.

953
02:16:12,870 --> 02:16:18,180
But I think it's very confusing in the way that they made this diagram for me to like really conceptualize that.

954
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:24,150
So I thought it was useful to like think about it more on a map and how we can maybe use those lines or symbols the same way.

955
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:30,520
So another section that they talked about was like measuring location,

956
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:39,190
and they defined location as a position in space and location as the basis for integrating geographic data into this.

957
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:47,440
And they talked about two specific types of location. So absolutely location, which is defined as a position of a point on a grid system.

958
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:50,409
So like thinking of coordinates and like this one,

959
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:56,800
they talked about just how it's easier to like give a specific location because it's very unique versus relative location,

960
02:16:57,670 --> 02:17:01,000
which refers to the position in relation to other objects in space.

961
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:07,299
So I came up an example where like you say all like Starbucks is 300 feet from the intersection of North U and South

962
02:17:07,300 --> 02:17:12,370
State because it's like relatively going to get someone there versus like if you gave someone a specific address,

963
02:17:12,370 --> 02:17:18,549
they know exactly how to get there. If I thought it was just really interesting how they they compared those two and they

964
02:17:18,550 --> 02:17:23,350
also had a small section on like describing the history of like how GPS was formed.

965
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:30,940
And I thought it was interesting that it was originally the intent for when they made GPS systems were was like to aid with navigation.

966
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:35,860
So I was thinking probably like nautical navigation and it wasn't really intended to record locations.

967
02:17:35,860 --> 02:17:44,500
But now that's oftentimes what we use it as well. And like now we use GPS data to integrate it with other data that we have in this.

968
02:17:49,620 --> 02:17:52,469
And another like I think this is towards the end,

969
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:57,990
the last section that I thought was that I pulled the part that I thought was interesting was the section on metadata,

970
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:01,390
which is they'd like to find it just being data about data.

971
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:05,610
I thought that was a very funny definition that they gave because it doesn't really give much info,

972
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:10,230
but they talked about metadata providing information in four areas.

973
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:17,910
So the first being like the availability of data, including the information to make it possible to even like search or discover the data.

974
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:27,329
The second one was like the fitness of use of the data. So talking like looking at specific special features that like will help you determine

975
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:31,970
if you're able to use that data or not for a specific purpose and then access to data.

976
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:38,670
So how, like, how are you able to acquire the data? And then they had this last one talking about transfer information.

977
02:18:39,030 --> 02:18:47,040
So including like textbook specifications for data handling and then 2 to 2 distinct like properties it talked about

978
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:54,540
and within metadata was this dual referencing which is relating information to a geographic location and geotagging.

979
02:18:54,900 --> 02:18:59,220
So adding like geographical identifiers to like digital content basically.

980
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:04,920
And I was trying to think of like ways that we now see that that are pretty common.

981
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:08,890
So that's kind of the question I had posed is like what ways do we see geo referencing

982
02:19:08,890 --> 02:19:13,350
in geotagging today and how how could this be incorporated into like public health?

983
02:19:13,990 --> 02:19:20,370
And if there's any that you can think of that we may maybe not consider in like probably a statistical use,

984
02:19:20,370 --> 02:19:27,090
but like ways we see geo referencing in geotagging today like, you know, posting pictures online.

985
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:34,390
Yeah, that was my thought to Twitter or even like Google Maps to, you know, post pictures from your.

986
02:19:35,410 --> 02:19:41,860
Yeah. And the service people use that for reference is shared across the.

987
02:19:44,450 --> 02:19:49,639
Yes. I think one of the ones that I was thinking of, I don't know if this is exactly maybe like Jill referencing,

988
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:54,650
but I was thinking of like now the features on maps were before it was just like giving you the direction.

989
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:59,299
But like now when you pull up a certain address, it gives you like information like the hours that it's open.

990
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:03,290
Sometimes it gives you the the website, sometimes it gives you like the Yelp reviews.

991
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:05,870
I think that's also pretty interesting because it's just like that,

992
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:11,180
like tagging all this information to the address that you plugged into maps and you didn't necessarily like, look all that up.

993
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:18,890
So I thought that was a pretty cool feature. But I'm trying to think about like how we can use this more in a public health sense.

994
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:22,010
I was thinking of like a project that I'm currently working on,

995
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:28,190
so I'm doing research right now with the community, like the county in Washtenaw County with Latin communities.

996
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:36,979
And we're trying to create a network of existing agencies that work with Latinx residents, but trying to establish like what?

997
02:20:36,980 --> 02:20:42,469
Like letting residents know what services that they can go to because some of them don't know where they have

998
02:20:42,470 --> 02:20:47,750
people who are speaking Spanish and we're not too so thinking of like that maps idea where like you can plug in an

999
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:53,420
address and it gives you all that information if perhaps you can have maybe like a subset of like maps where

1000
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:58,819
someone in the county or Latin X resident could like look up a specific agency and see what services are provided,

1001
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:04,700
what hours and kind of like thinking of that map side. Yes, that's kind of what this section had me thinking about.

1002
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:13,579
So I thought that was pretty cool. And then just to wrap up some like a few strengths and weaknesses of this article, strengths were like,

1003
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:16,819
I think it was useful to have some of those figures cause I think it helped me conceptualize

1004
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:21,350
some of the content that I was describing and examples of services and the use.

1005
02:21:21,860 --> 02:21:29,000
They had a lot of specific systems that a lot of countries use that was based on some of this information, but weaknesses.

1006
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:34,550
There was a lot of technical jargon and like for getting a lot of definitions and acronyms to things.

1007
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:37,250
So that was a little bit harder to kind of tease through.

1008
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:43,580
And in some cases, like the examples were were given, but they didn't have a concrete definition, it was just given as an example.

1009
02:21:43,850 --> 02:21:49,940
So it's kind of harder to to really see what they meant by things because only examples were given for those sections.

1010
02:21:50,030 --> 02:22:00,730
So. I think that, yeah, that's all I had to do to deliver this work.

1011
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:14,750
To make it work. Hey, do you?

1012
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:33,310
Okay. Her home kind of just building off of what Jennifer set me up with today.

1013
02:22:34,030 --> 02:22:40,629
I'm just going to be we're going to be discussing geocoding and measurement of neighborhoods is in an economic position.

1014
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:49,270
So just how you can apply what Jennifer just talked about into just research and why it's needed from the perspective of us.

1015
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:59,260
So just going into the definition, because I had to kind of go over it a couple of different times as well.

1016
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:07,480
So it was defined in the paper as the process of determining geographic coordinates and geographic codes for census to find states,

1017
02:23:08,050 --> 02:23:14,860
counties, census tract specific areas of political jurisdiction, lookup codes, zip codes and economic regions.

1018
02:23:14,860 --> 02:23:17,560
So just a bunch of different spaces and groupings of them.

1019
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:25,420
The reading really focused on how geocoding is relevant for analyzing population health in relation to the

1020
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:34,030
geographic coordinates and how it can just contribute overall to public health databases and just think,

1021
02:23:34,030 --> 02:23:42,129
just like connect the dots in some places. And so one main thing is just to keep in mind is that it was just really geocoding is

1022
02:23:42,130 --> 02:23:45,730
relevant for analyzing population health in relationship to geographic coordinates.

1023
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:57,939
So just going through the summary, the emphasis is just the importance of focusing on socioeconomic data and how to incorporate that into research.

1024
02:23:57,940 --> 02:24:06,849
Because they did highlight everybody thinks it's important and they've known and talked about how important it is for decades,

1025
02:24:06,850 --> 02:24:12,759
but it's just not incorporated well or at all in a lot of databases and research,

1026
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:21,700
especially in studies having to do with TB, HIV, AIDS, cancer, those are the more notable ones.

1027
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:27,460
But it's pretty it was pretty sparse during the time of this when this was written.

1028
02:24:28,630 --> 02:24:38,110
And so because there's very few studies that we, as we all know as students, that can lead to misconceptions depending on the community,

1029
02:24:38,110 --> 02:24:42,219
which I think just teaches us not to take things at face value,

1030
02:24:42,220 --> 02:24:49,330
especially as people who receive so much data and can look at a lot of different visualizations of data.

1031
02:24:50,260 --> 02:24:57,940
But to really think things through and to see why things are the way that they are, why we are visualizing it that way, and how it's,

1032
02:24:58,180 --> 02:25:08,290
you know, how it got there to that point and then was also it was noticeable was that this was reflected on the state and national level.

1033
02:25:08,290 --> 02:25:12,130
And again, I'm just keeping in mind this was written a little while ago.

1034
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:21,400
So they talked about potential solutions, which was is which is going to be census driven area based data,

1035
02:25:21,790 --> 02:25:26,950
which is going to attempt to characterize persons in the scope of public health in total population.

1036
02:25:27,730 --> 02:25:34,270
And so this data is going to provide information on people, you know, in their groupings,

1037
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:38,830
in their neighborhoods, in whatever spaces that they're put together in,

1038
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:49,719
and their country, the region, their gender, ethnicity, income, their what else they talk about, their occupation, status, things like that.

1039
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:58,209
And again, it's just used to connect the dots of what data was already available and was just missing some components to be able

1040
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:05,410
to just interpret it better and analyze it for whatever initiatives that they were planning on doing with that data.

1041
02:26:05,770 --> 02:26:13,840
And so my discussion question is, so the text I've mentioned was written in 2003,

1042
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:18,909
what kind of advances do you think have made in this research field since then?

1043
02:26:18,910 --> 02:26:27,310
Or maybe if you don't want to take that perspective, maybe if we were thinking about this in the present day, like what kind of.

1044
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:35,320
Where would be the differences? I guess. If there are any.

1045
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:51,440
I guess. It's like an issue is like the like with their own mortality rate and how just like a certainty this hasn't been a lot of well there's

1046
02:26:51,470 --> 02:26:58,760
more pushes now to kind of like have this national kind of database of understanding like where the virus rates are or just in general,

1047
02:26:58,760 --> 02:27:06,139
like where these there's something happening since like since 2003 years feel like more of a push to kind of

1048
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:11,570
like have that data available and do research and produce like different interventions and stuff like that.

1049
02:27:11,690 --> 02:27:20,230
Right. But I think previous to that, maybe it was strategic to keep that problem from being solved or to interact with those communities.

1050
02:27:21,920 --> 02:27:30,470
So and like a lot of like change and it was like this has been touted around how impactful some of this socio economic data is like that.

1051
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:33,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good point.

1052
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:46,820
I think the conversation around having the most ethical and valid data has been, I guess, tended to, I think, better.

1053
02:27:46,820 --> 02:27:52,580
And presently but also I was thinking too that the technology that we have is also really different.

1054
02:27:52,580 --> 02:27:57,320
So how we can take that data and also collect that data will also be really different, more efficient, a lot quicker,

1055
02:27:58,130 --> 02:28:03,990
and also sharing that out so other people can build their research and databases off of that as well.

1056
02:28:04,010 --> 02:28:09,589
That's what I was thinking. Yeah, I just have a counter question.

1057
02:28:09,590 --> 02:28:16,399
Yeah. Like, do you think that since 2003, like the layperson's ability to see that data and take it in and like be able

1058
02:28:16,400 --> 02:28:19,900
to talk about it has also increased or just the technology has gotten better.

1059
02:28:19,940 --> 02:28:21,799
I think the way that we talk about it as well,

1060
02:28:21,800 --> 02:28:27,680
because I think the common knowledge to how to have those conversations has also spread across the public health space.

1061
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:36,830
And, um, and I think also people who are collecting the data are going in with a different mindset as well.

1062
02:28:37,130 --> 02:28:43,640
So yeah. Okay.

1063
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:48,690
So then they went into the building blocks of just how they group people together.

1064
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:57,620
This census block consists of just 85 ish people in population, which is built into then the census block group, which consists of 1000 people.

1065
02:28:57,620 --> 02:29:01,849
And then the census tract, which is the largest space, is going to be average population of 4000 people.

1066
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:10,190
But like I mentioned before, is also based off of like the interest of the researcher and what they what they want to focus on.

1067
02:29:10,190 --> 02:29:19,610
So that was going to be the political jurisdiction, the economic background, the gender of the population as well,

1068
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:23,360
and so grouping them, but then also based on size as well as how they're kind of doing it.

1069
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:33,380
But my next question is they mentioned in the text that blacks are meant to create homogeneous groups in regard to their socio economic background.

1070
02:29:34,220 --> 02:29:43,070
And then what are some possible barriers that homogeneity can pose for the future when they're doing this research or collecting this data,

1071
02:29:43,460 --> 02:29:47,210
if there is any, or is a good thing to talk about that do.

1072
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:04,859
Like one thing I thought about was a lot of these we're talking about socioeconomic

1073
02:30:04,860 --> 02:30:08,970
background and it's just a very multifaceted thing can be some sometimes be complex.

1074
02:30:09,330 --> 02:30:18,450
And so figuring out how to standardize that and who really falls into whatever criteria was something that I thought of in terms of kind of various,

1075
02:30:18,450 --> 02:30:23,190
because maybe some people may be left out depending on what criteria you set for who applies.

1076
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:27,649
Yeah. Yeah, I was. I was just thinking, like, kind of the same thing.

1077
02:30:27,650 --> 02:30:31,400
Like, you don't know his background either. They come from, like, generational.

1078
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:38,690
Well, like, I just feel like there's a lot of other factors that could impact rather than just like right now.

1079
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:41,720
Snapshot. What's your socio economic like? Yeah.

1080
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:56,360
Yeah. So going into the area based on data collection, that's what they propose in terms of a solution for just supplementing data.

1081
02:30:57,050 --> 02:31:02,320
The pros that they listed was it can be can be added to existing data pretty easily.

1082
02:31:02,330 --> 02:31:10,309
So, you know, if you want to go back and you know that they're missing data on socioeconomic status from a certain community,

1083
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:11,330
you can definitely add that.

1084
02:31:11,330 --> 02:31:20,870
And it's pretty easy to do and it can again provide context for certain neighborhoods or locations about their socioeconomic standing,

1085
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:24,049
which we all know is really important for analysis.

1086
02:31:24,050 --> 02:31:32,270
And then it also has the ability for to be used for all characteristics, regardless of age.

1087
02:31:32,270 --> 02:31:39,290
Gender, occupation says everything we want to consider in terms of socioeconomic status is what what the paper said.

1088
02:31:39,650 --> 02:31:45,050
But some cons is that the data at the end of the day, when you bring it to the table,

1089
02:31:45,410 --> 02:31:51,049
it can just be a tribute to the individuals, like an exception based of the individual.

1090
02:31:51,050 --> 02:31:52,580
And that's really hard to sometimes.

1091
02:31:56,560 --> 02:32:04,090
Convince, you know, whoever whoever has the data that this is something that applies to the entire population or something that we should consider.

1092
02:32:04,810 --> 02:32:15,520
And like Caroline just said, it's hard to capture something from a specific time and then apply it to other periods of time.

1093
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:16,870
It's not always translatable.

1094
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:26,530
And that then runs into the issue of just there's going to be gaps from past decades that may not be filled accurate as accurately.

1095
02:32:28,090 --> 02:32:38,889
And my next question is, so in the event that you collect data from a different time period, it doesn't reflect the ideological time of the study.

1096
02:32:38,890 --> 02:32:52,370
Is the data completely irrelevant? Because I say no, like it's going to replace a bit missing.

1097
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:56,780
And now we have it like we're filled in so people, they can't fill it.

1098
02:32:57,650 --> 02:33:05,210
So it is like data from like today, if you're doing on the same neighborhood, they're the same group of people from 20 years difference.

1099
02:33:07,260 --> 02:33:11,419
You would make a case then I was like, Well, versus doing it or not doing it.

1100
02:33:11,420 --> 02:33:13,410
Yeah, having some data here that's like, Yeah.

1101
02:33:13,580 --> 02:33:19,370
Let's see if we can kind of like push folks to like put money and time energy into like getting more up to date data.

1102
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:23,390
Yeah, I agree with you. Yeah, I didn't disagree with you. Sorry. I just want to talk about.

1103
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:30,680
Right, cool. So just moving forward, just in the paper.

1104
02:33:30,690 --> 02:33:34,399
So they had a couple studies.

1105
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:42,080
It was a small handful just to test the methods of this data collection that they were trying to make a case for.

1106
02:33:42,410 --> 02:33:49,160
And what happened was that each initiative and each study that they had had different

1107
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:54,080
socioeconomic variables and examined really very few health outcomes to compare it to.

1108
02:33:54,990 --> 02:34:01,670
Um, so my question is that oh, I'm sorry, it's too early to questions.

1109
02:34:02,150 --> 02:34:08,630
Oh, so based on what I just said, based like from your experience of research.

1110
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:15,800
Why would this method not really support what they're trying to prove?

1111
02:34:29,250 --> 02:34:43,110
So I was thinking that this was a long time ago and they're trying to start people using socioeconomic data to supplement data that are existed.

1112
02:34:43,110 --> 02:34:46,130
And so they're kind of like the trailblazers, right?

1113
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:51,900
And so I think that you have to set up a standard and when you have different variables,

1114
02:34:52,590 --> 02:34:55,800
how can you compare to others and really support your own data?

1115
02:34:56,250 --> 02:35:00,569
And then to examine really not a lot of health outcomes it doesn't support,

1116
02:35:00,570 --> 02:35:07,170
then it doesn't give you enough data to say, well, this is like, can you see the correlation basically?

1117
02:35:07,830 --> 02:35:11,460
Because I think it was like in the single digits how many studies they actually did.

1118
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:15,879
So that's what I was thinking. Thank you. Pretty much. So I just see.

1119
02:35:15,880 --> 02:35:22,260
Not so I'm just gonna move on. So then from their studies though,

1120
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:28,919
their overall takeaways was just that everybody agrees that socioeconomic status is important to contribute and add to

1121
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:34,440
your data when you're doing research on a population or a neighborhood or whichever group that you want to focus on,

1122
02:35:36,510 --> 02:35:42,690
but for it to be useful, it has to provide context.

1123
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:47,400
It has to be consistent with the methods that they're actually using to study the validity,

1124
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:52,649
obviously easily interpreted to because it cannot be too complex,

1125
02:35:52,650 --> 02:36:01,500
kind of connecting the dots between the two things and applicable for public health departments in the U.S. just for them to use readily.

1126
02:36:05,270 --> 02:36:08,600
Okay. I don't know. There's so many questions I have here because I was.

1127
02:36:10,430 --> 02:36:15,060
But. So these findings from a study conducted 20 years ago.

1128
02:36:15,890 --> 02:36:19,530
Do these conclusions still apply today when you're thinking about, you know,

1129
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:28,489
the data that you're collecting and the methods that you're using and in reference to public health,

1130
02:36:28,490 --> 02:36:36,140
other areas that still need work in terms of connecting socioeconomic status and other data that's been collected.

1131
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:49,910
Yeah. I'd say some areas still need work because I feel like I read different papers and they socio economic services like slightly differently,

1132
02:36:49,920 --> 02:36:55,620
like slightly different cut off points, which I mean it's good to have it in the context of like where that study is.

1133
02:36:55,620 --> 02:37:05,690
But I feel like we still kind of need like something to this effect but like modern and like, yeah, I can go to like with this system.

1134
02:37:06,180 --> 02:37:10,649
Yeah, I think there's like better initiative to have emphasis on it, which I think is really great.

1135
02:37:10,650 --> 02:37:15,420
But I think with anything, especially in health, the health space, you can always improve,

1136
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:24,360
especially on specifics and just making sure that the interpretation of your data is going to be accurate as well.

1137
02:37:25,410 --> 02:37:29,960
Okay. So. Overall.

1138
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:38,420
So this project provided reasoning and justifications for focusing on initiatives in fact, and efforts people have agreed were already relevant.

1139
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:41,299
So this was they were talking about this for the eighties, too.

1140
02:37:41,300 --> 02:37:48,410
So they're just trying to provide support to put more emphasis on context and socioeconomic data

1141
02:37:48,410 --> 02:37:54,540
in research just so they can actually get to the root cause of all of these health outcomes,

1142
02:37:54,770 --> 02:37:57,980
because you have to know where to start to accurately address something.

1143
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:02,540
And I didn't write down my feedback. I was just going to talk about it.

1144
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:09,559
It was extremely technical, so I had to sift through a lot to get to the purpose and what they were really the message they were trying to get to,

1145
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:13,219
but it was still very informational. So I understand why.

1146
02:38:13,220 --> 02:38:20,420
Because because as people who are trying to make justifications for this kind of change, you have to provide a lot of information.

1147
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:24,550
So I completely get it. It was just a long read, you guys know?

1148
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:37,500
And that's it. Thank you, both of you.

1149
02:38:38,190 --> 02:38:48,300
Good work. All right. So one comment I see is that this is an old paper, but to be honest,

1150
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:55,630
there has not been a lot of work done to define socioeconomic status at the area level.

1151
02:38:55,650 --> 02:39:00,690
That was the whole point of this paper. Right. We talk about individual level assets all the time,

1152
02:39:01,290 --> 02:39:13,170
but we need a more consistent way of measuring the socioeconomic status of areas like counties or blocks or states and so forth.

1153
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:23,490
And Kreager and her group has done a lot of work to try to get us there, but unfortunately we haven't moved much further than these guys went.

1154
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:34,379
So the point I want you to take away from this article is that how they provide is actually a very good standard way of

1155
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:42,630
developing a social and economic index for any area that you want to look at in the United States of America using census data.

1156
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:48,389
So they pull out about 12 or 13 census variables, right?

1157
02:39:48,390 --> 02:39:55,010
Things like percent below the poverty level, percent with less than high school education,

1158
02:39:55,620 --> 02:40:04,410
percent of people who are black, percent vacant homes, percent of people who don't have transportation.

1159
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:12,960
And those types of variables and put them together using factor analysis to develop an area level index in a lot of us,

1160
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:17,820
all of us care about the issue of socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes.

1161
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:24,430
And so many of you will deal with that question in all of your work, in the work in this class.

1162
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:29,399
So this is a paper to help you start thinking about how am I going to operationalize

1163
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:33,900
socioeconomic status and whatever area you look at in the United States of America.

1164
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:38,640
And it talks about how to use census data to do that.

1165
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:46,649
So the good thing about what they're telling us is a lot of good things is that those census variables are consistent over time.

1166
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:51,690
For many decades, the same variables have been collected in this country over and over again.

1167
02:40:52,770 --> 02:41:01,350
So we can use this methodology today to describe socioeconomic status of areas.

1168
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:05,460
The only thing it requires is that some understanding of factor analysis.

1169
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:14,910
But let's say you don't know how to do factor analysis. So you can look at the variables that they have identified as indicators of X, right?

1170
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:23,370
The ones we generally use are poverty level or maybe high school completion rate or female headed household that we talked about in class.

1171
02:41:23,850 --> 02:41:27,510
But as some of you commented, different studies is different ones.

1172
02:41:28,050 --> 02:41:33,330
And we need to come together to come up with a common, consistent index.

1173
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:39,750
Other countries have done really well in that area, like the United Kingdom, Canada.

1174
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:43,650
But the US is somehow behind in this area.

1175
02:41:44,250 --> 02:41:46,739
I think part of it has to do with that.

1176
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:56,040
We may be more identity focused than class focused in our understanding of social disparities so that we have moved a little

1177
02:41:56,040 --> 02:42:05,530
bit away from thinking about class and U.S. as one of the primary drivers of unfairness and disparity in this country.

1178
02:42:06,630 --> 02:42:14,310
And I think we need to move in that area a little bit more. So this paper is a is a really great paper, in my opinion.

1179
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:19,520
I know it's a little old, but it's still very relevant. I didn't mean it like that at all.

1180
02:42:21,570 --> 02:42:25,260
I guess what I'm trying to say is don't discard the old the old studies.

1181
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:31,469
You know, these are foundational studies in this field. So even vaguely doctoral students.

1182
02:42:31,470 --> 02:42:35,730
And how am I going to measure X at the county level or whatever I'm looking at?

1183
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:41,370
I point them to this article and then try to replicate their methodology for their dataset.

1184
02:42:41,880 --> 02:42:47,700
Okay. Yeah. So let's see, what else did I want to say about it?

1185
02:42:48,370 --> 02:42:54,899
And I think that's kind of it at the moment. And that I think we, I hope, was hoping we would have more time.

1186
02:42:54,900 --> 02:43:04,050
But we have maybe just 4 minutes to wrap up today's session and let's see how far we can get.

1187
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:11,040
Okay. I just want to kind of give you a preview. I think what I would like you to do, actually, is a little bit of a homework assignment.

1188
02:43:11,910 --> 02:43:17,600
I want to talk about these steps next time. But I wanted you to think about this issue.

1189
02:43:17,610 --> 02:43:22,760
Okay. This homework assignment right here. I want you to go find a map.

1190
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:27,020
This is going to get you started on your first assignment, right?

1191
02:43:27,480 --> 02:43:34,290
Go find a map that has an obvious public health relevance. You know, you see maps in The New York Times front page every day, right.

1192
02:43:34,310 --> 02:43:41,370
You can choose that map if you like. But I want you to break it down into these elements here.

1193
02:43:41,460 --> 02:43:46,800
Okay. First is describe the key messages that are presented in the map.

1194
02:43:47,310 --> 02:43:52,770
Think about the design of the map and critically review its if you like it, how would you improve it?

1195
02:43:53,370 --> 02:44:01,630
Explain why you chose that map. And more importantly, describe the data you would need to create such a map in our.

1196
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:16,260
Okay. And and once you do that, now think about how to organize the map content into these five bullet points here.

1197
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:20,220
What question is that map trying to answer?

1198
02:44:21,570 --> 02:44:28,230
Okay. Every map is trying to answer some question. What variables are needed?

1199
02:44:28,380 --> 02:44:32,280
Would data for what variables are needed to create that map?

1200
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:35,910
What is the unit of analysis of that map?

1201
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:48,930
For example, if you have a map of COVID infection rates in the United States of America by county, the unit of analysis of an individual, one person.

1202
02:44:49,440 --> 02:44:56,489
Okay. Because you're looking at individual infection rates. Infection in the in the geographic unit of analysis.

1203
02:44:56,490 --> 02:45:03,090
And then in that map would be the county. Because you're aggregating individual experiences to the county level.

1204
02:45:03,690 --> 02:45:09,900
Okay. And then think about the time frame. What time frame is I've met trying to depict.

1205
02:45:11,700 --> 02:45:16,590
I think as you do that that exercise will help you get to assignment to.

1206
02:45:17,490 --> 02:45:25,860
Okay. What question is being answered? What variables are needed so I can figure out the data source and what units of

1207
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:32,370
analysis are are being depicted and temporal issues temporality kind of came up here

1208
02:45:32,370 --> 02:45:38,189
to time is a big issue and especially when you use existing data that you got you

1209
02:45:38,190 --> 02:45:44,310
got mismatches of time that there's some census data maybe collected ten years ago.

1210
02:45:44,370 --> 02:45:48,360
Infection rates that collected yesterday. What does it all mean?

1211
02:45:48,930 --> 02:45:53,580
So try to do this for a map of your choice. Just pick one in this week.

1212
02:45:53,700 --> 02:46:03,630
Okay. And we'll talk about it and see if you can bring bring a digital copy of that map to class and then we can talk about it in class.

1213
02:46:05,430 --> 02:46:15,550
Yeah, one more minute. So next week, we'll go over key steps in using GIs and then we'll talk about census data and all that stuff.

1214
02:46:15,570 --> 02:46:18,780
Okay. And we'll even downlink census data.

1215
02:46:19,770 --> 02:46:22,950
All right. Did you use to some of the maps?

1216
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:28,110
No. You need to submit it and then you can save it for yourself if you like.

1217
02:46:29,130 --> 02:46:41,290
But you don't need to submit any. I was raised in a single.
