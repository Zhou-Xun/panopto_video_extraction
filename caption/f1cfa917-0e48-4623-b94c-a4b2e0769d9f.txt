2
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:18,569
In this unit, we go over common
chronic diseases, the risk factors,

3
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:22,560
their trends, and whether or
not we can make a difference in terms of

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,470
the population health by preventing
common chronic diseases.

5
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,680
What is a common chronic disease?

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,870
Well, it's basically any disease that once
you have it, you really have it forever.

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,140
And that illness, for
instance, changes over time,

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,935
it progresses, often into other things.

9
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:46,330
So for instance, common chronic diseases
you probably already know about include

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,980
heart disease, hypertension,
diabetes and obesity, asthma,

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,190
chronic pulmonary disease, emphysema,
things that are more autoimmune,

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,900
like rheumatoid arthritis,
Crohn's disease, Lupus.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,270
Or for instance, mental illnesses
like depression, schizophrenia,

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:09,450
bipolar disease, or
even things like dementia and Alzheimer's.

15
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,160
All of these are common chronic diseases.

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,800
If we look at
the United States as a whole,

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,680
nearly half of Americans have one or
more common chronic disease.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,100
Many Americans actually have more than
one common chronic health problem.

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,560
So if we look at the whole span, right now
we have an estimate of something like 25%

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,240
of Americans have one
common chronic disease.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,020
Something like 10 to 15% have two.

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,670
There's something between 5 and 10%
that have three common chronic diseases.

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,980
And some individuals have five or more
common chronic diseases at the same time.

24
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,950
What's the most prevalent common chronic
disease in the United States today?

25
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,516
Well, actually it's pulmonary conditions.

26
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,724
So that's the asthma,
the emphysema, the COPD.

27
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:04,330
The next most common chronic
disease is hypertension,

28
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:11,778
then followed by mental disorders, heart
disease, diabetes, and cancers and stroke.

29
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:16,290
Older adults, we know, are more likely
to have common chronic diseases.

30
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,180
However, Americans of all
ages actually are affected.

31
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,220
There are some children that actually
have these common chronic diseases.

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:31,150
There are many 20 to 40 year olds that
have one or more common chronic diseases.

33
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,740
Something like an estimate

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,620
of 40 to 50% in the 45 to 65 age
range have a common chronic disease.

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,932
So it actually is across the whole entire
age spectrum that common chronic disease

36
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:47,040
affect population health.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,490
We also know by studying prevalences
that there are certain common chronic

38
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,164
diseases like diabetes that are more
prevalent among minority populations.

39
00:02:56,164 --> 00:03:00,846
So for instance, the estimate of
the age adjustment prevalence for

40
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:04,722
whites to have diabetes is
something like 8 to 10%.

41
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:09,493
Where, for African Americans,
it's more like 10 to 15%,

42
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:12,280
for Hispanics, more around 10%.

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,442
The highest group within the United States
is the Pacific Islanders,

44
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:21,642
the Alaskan Natives, and
the American Indians that have

45
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:25,600
prevalence up close to
25% in their populations.

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,620
Chronic diseases are also the leading
cause of death in the United States.

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,840
For decades,

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,410
heart disease has been the number one
killer, closely followed by cancer.

49
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,550
Both of which are sort of large,

50
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,760
prevalent, common chronic diseases
within the United States.

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,330
How do we know these
epidemiological statistics?

52
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,560
Most of them come from
cross-sectional studies.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,990
For instance, the Center for
Disease Control, the CDC, has an annual or

54
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,660
biannual survey called the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey.

55
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,220
Where they go out into communities, bring
people into physical exam situations,

56
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,060
give them multiple sort of interview
sessions, and then also draw blood.

57
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,170
And take sort of images to understand
what is the disease of Americans

58
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,050
in a particular year, and to get those
prevalence estimates to Congress,

59
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,011
to Departments of Health,
as well as to health care systems.
