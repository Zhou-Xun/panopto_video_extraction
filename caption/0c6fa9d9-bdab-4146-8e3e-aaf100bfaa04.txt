00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,496
In this video, we're gonna discuss how blood glucose is regulated,

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:09,340
the role of insulin and how this relates to type two diabetes.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,231
Blood glucose is an important molecule and provides fuel for

4
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:15,040
a lot of tissues throughout the body.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,494
The main sources of blood glucose are dietary carbohydrates under the fed state

6
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:20,956
and in the fasting state,

7
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:25,240
the liver can convert other substances into blood glucose.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,440
What blood glucose is used in many tissues throughout the body.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,124
After a meal,

10
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:33,740
the vast majority of blood glucose is disposed of in the muscle tissue.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,944
One of the hormones that is the most important for

12
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:39,640
controlling blood glucose levels is a hormone called insulin.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,430
Insulin functions to both promote muscle dependent, who goes up there, and

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,979
to suppress liver dependent blood glucose production.

15
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:52,704
In this way, when blood glucose levels are elevated, insulin levels rise

16
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:57,740
prevents glucose disposal into muscle and prevents more glucose permission.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,086
Under conditions of obesity on the lipodystrophy,

18
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:05,239
cells become resistant to the effects of insulin.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,415
When that happens, insulin is less able to promote glucose disposal in the muscle and

20
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:13,440
to prevent equals production in the liver.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,397
This means that will be more glucose being pushed into the blood from the river and

22
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:20,140
less taken out by the muscle.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,696
In response, the pancreas is gonna promote more insulin production

24
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:27,704
to keep blood glucose levels from rising.

25
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:30,870
If the obese or liberal dis trophic state continues,

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,007
insulin resistance will counterbalance the increase in insulin and there'll be even

27
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:41,640
less suppression of equals production and less promotion of people's disposal.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,072
In this way, there becomes an arms race between the production of insulin meant to

29
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,840
keep Blanco stable and the increase in insulin resistance.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,111
If that's not alleviated by the reduction of excess lipid in other tissues,

31
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:58,692
then eventually blood glucose levels will become out of control, more rise.
