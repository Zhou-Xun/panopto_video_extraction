1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,210
So what we will do will discuss the recreational water quality and its management.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,000
How do we deal with the recreational water quality? W.H.O. do has some guidelines.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,140
EPA CDC has some policy regulation regarding this, but.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,970
Here's the. One of the.

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,280
East in the Great Lakes anywhere, career graduates.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,210
I mean, I can't remember what he's about, Buddy. Some should be somewhere in the applause.

7
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,170
Close the top of the CD. In that area, I think it's the Platte River.

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,100
Okay. Oh, yeah, that's good. Yeah, that's really the case.

9
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:49,120
I mean, if you look at this, the wall here, if you look at this water, what do you think?

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,400
Looks pretty clean, very clean acoustically.

11
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,360
Okay. You can see the bottom. I mean, I have the video of that also.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,470
But if you look at this, water is super clean and and is great.

13
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:08,400
I mean, definitely if it's great. So I mean, you can swim there.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,470
That's fine. That's my daughter. We. She was a little better if we put the microscope.

15
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,510
Get a job with the water. Similar like that put on the microscope.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,050
So that's probably you see quite a few bugs moving around.

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,680
Okay.

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:38,840
Moving around, you may see less from from that wall, but this is if you put any drop of the water from the river, from legs under the microscope.

19
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,420
And that's probably you can see what you can see here. So.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,670
Whether all these are. Bedbugs.

21
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:59,690
No. Okay. So this is just the a lot of these openings you find in the water, we caught mussels.

22
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,350
So basically. And doesn't really cause harm to you.

23
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,360
But any harm to. But does. Doesn't really matter to me.

24
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,410
There's no padding here. Okay. Could be some water values here.

25
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,450
Amounts. What are the orange like?

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,920
Squiggly lines look like springs. Yeah, this is.

27
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,840
If you could draw some criteria. It's like a sprouts. This is.

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,330
Different type of bugs. Okay, so.

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,260
This also occurs when see, the water is key. As known as Rumi is safe.

30
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,220
And we're not talking about a chemical here. Right. Okay.

31
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,760
I mean, you look at this. If you can put yourself in this could be you can find some.

32
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,390
So surely if it's not me, it's no good.

33
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,270
But if it's clean from bottom, you save. Okay.

34
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,100
So we need to continue to see how can we make sure that when you swim to the recreation activity.

35
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,150
While I still enjoy enjoying the water. If I still can think of a health.

36
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,910
And the other. And if you go to I have a chance to visit Yellowstone.

37
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,029
Okay. Because Volume River. It was born in river.

38
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:38,580
So here you can find here is really this this war come from the hills mountain area and there's a melt slope.

39
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,970
The come from there on this path. The half of this extremely cold.

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,970
Okay. Here on the water come from the green. It's actually pretty hot.

41
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,590
Okay. Tony Hall. Okay. So.

42
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,770
As the last piece is, that's the place to enjoy it. Okay.

43
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,180
Do you have the experience? Like very cold water, a symptom.

44
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,630
And then you can move to the to this the whole world here.

45
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,410
It's like a sauna. As a matter of fact, it's open. Okay.

46
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,160
So are people. Try to enjoy it. I enjoy it.

47
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,960
And then there's one of the signs that says Voyage Submerging Your Head and the inhalation of the thermal steams.

48
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,110
Okay. The reason for that. Why is that? I mean, the water looks super and well.

49
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,260
Okay. The water looks super cute on the whale.

50
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,000
I mean, the reason, for example, could be there's a there's two different type of microgreens could call it health concerns.

51
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,880
One is the amoeba. Okay. The cook, I mean, baked mini ship.

52
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,400
It's like having this symptom. Okay.

53
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,860
And also, we got our disease because these bugs, like this environment, they can survive here.

54
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,850
Okay. I can survive here and then. I mean, if you get exposed, then you can sell.

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,260
Okay. And they do have people getting like some people getting like, hey, break it.

56
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,220
Infected with this amoeba. We use amoeba.

57
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:34,630
So that's that's the easiest thing. So why say you cannot not imagine somebody your head into the water and do it here?

58
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,140
That's to reduce the exposure. I mean, if you do just the normal we swim in there, you'll be fine.

59
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,380
You have to have the speed to protect you.

60
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,060
But if you someone your head was, you always get interested and you likely will get exposed to these bugs in the world.

61
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,650
Look, that's the the bar here. We only have this one sign.

62
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,310
I mean, there's no one can really stop me doing that. If you.

63
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,660
I mean, if we do that. I mean, I can't really stop to that.

64
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:19,130
But that's the signs you can find. Find. So that's it.

65
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:31,910
But how do we really regulate or manage the water quality of what we enjoy or we enjoy the water?

66
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,570
We want streams and we still want to protect the public health.

67
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:46,770
We still want to protect public health. So there's two different types of recreational water.

68
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,200
If you look at think about it as coastal and freshwater. Like the beach is open.

69
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,150
But the other recreational that we have the swimming pools that.

70
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,340
Right. It's really important to me that we have different to impose private public.

71
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,460
As a little bit different from the over water bags it beats we have.

72
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,780
Why we want to play with war or leaving the war.

73
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,820
Because it has. I'm afraid that's how me health. I mean, we doit. Okay.

74
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,930
I don't know what I told you guys when I was a kid.

75
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,830
When I was a kid.

76
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:47,250
I was with you in the cruise with the big river cruise with big river to all these small streams, rivers running from the White Houses.

77
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:54,420
And during the summer, that's a good time. And all the kids, after the lunch, parents went to for a laugh.

78
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,480
And then we just. Jumping into the river and the preview of what flopped.

79
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,310
It's a very fun, very enjoyable. But at that time, we don't really think about.

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,040
The water pollution. And then we make clear with the sand sediments all come out of this.

81
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,020
I still get that. But if this group is really we enjoy that, it's great.

82
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,780
And also, those other things really will have a lot of positive effects on human health by.

83
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,830
Busy in the mineral water has been rubbed to cure a variety of illnesses.

84
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:38,180
I remember I went through to the to the Trinidad Tobago.

85
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,750
Is that close to the Caribbean Sea there?

86
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,610
There's a there's a they the people went to a US Falls mining site.

87
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,750
There's some water come out from that site because it's very high condition miners think about is why how certain

88
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:03,560
miners and people are still going there to take the bus because they think they can can benefit their house.

89
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,709
Okay. This like benefit award from the peer relief joint, some relaxation.

90
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:19,430
That's all this idea that we have and some with the with the the hot springs, for example, that's the case.

91
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,570
Okay. So that's the reason why people enjoy that.

92
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,230
I mean, the other sports activity is that we can you can you can you can think of.

93
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,680
So what kind of activity you can find in the Coast Guard and freshwater?

94
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:46,379
What kind of use you can think of. Facing waiting, swimming, diving, boating, fishing and sales of boating.

95
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,030
All this you can do in the open water. So that's activity.

96
00:09:51,690 --> 00:10:00,040
You can find different type of activity. I mean, I believe probably all of you has enjoyed doing some of this also.

97
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:09,870
Right. I enjoy doing that. I mean, I enjoy really doing the the standard boating board on the water and do the kayak.

98
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,560
That's the one thing I enjoy very much as well. I'm not.

99
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,060
I haven't tried this kind of stuff, so maybe it's not my style.

100
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:28,160
I'll have to try this. Okay. So you can find different type of users like the general public juju hotel guests,

101
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:35,450
colorist swimmers crowns can be especially spot users during the spring break.

102
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,180
People went to the south. That's all this activity you can find on the beach, right?

103
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:52,150
So one thing we need to really do to to define the activity is in terms of health or the Explorer risks.

104
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:59,410
Is that what these low contact. This type of activity was his low contact.

105
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:08,410
At which there's no no, no contact with the water. But if you walk just along the beach, you don't really have a contact because you still enjoy that.

106
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,110
But it's no contact. But as most nights with me, there's no exposure.

107
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:22,759
So we know that for the some of these toxicants from harmful algal blooms every just walk

108
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:30,140
along the shore you still can if they're from aerosols that's one of the incidental contacts.

109
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:40,700
If you go contact recreational activity at which only the regulators wages or you which where contact like example boating,

110
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,150
fishing, wading and then the other contact, the full body contact.

111
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,090
That's how we define full body contact. Recreational activity, which the whole body like you do the swim.

112
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,050
Diving. Why work?

113
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,320
Okay. So that's. You have the whole body contact.

114
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,600
With what? Okay.

115
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:09,240
If we do a swim, if we do the diving, that means you contact with water with your whole body.

116
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,700
So these are defined by the different category of activities.

117
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,870
That's also how much you contact with water.

118
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,020
Define what I would use because I define how much potential exposure you may have to the water contaminants.

119
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:32,370
We'll get to the work in 10 minutes. So that's the thing. And then if you think about health, what kind of how you can have.

120
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:43,190
Physical, Harris. Cold heat some nights and once you get most interesting is really water quality like

121
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,590
it's contaminated by the sewage if you have a sewage discharge into the water.

122
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:56,360
And I was exposed to the micrograms. Their presence in the water.

123
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,800
That's another thing they're talking about. And we'll see how we define how they would control it.

124
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,380
And then contamination of the beach fence, algae compounds, chemicals, physical agents.

125
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,030
And the other thing is really with open water, it can use aquatic organisms.

126
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,690
Something can buy stick you. Okay.

127
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,660
And that's the another hat as you may be able to encounter during these few activities.

128
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:30,050
But when we talk about water quality, most chemicals and biological agents, we can see the water.

129
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,970
Let's see the this.

130
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:44,690
If we think about health outcomes, what kind of health outcomes you may be able to experience during the recreational use drowning impact injury.

131
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,720
That's injury physiological.

132
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:55,780
Okay. And then once he would be ready to do all quality management work on these infections.

133
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:04,710
Okay. And then quantity of what you exposed to the to the chemical contaminant contaminant one.

134
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:19,970
Ingestion causes infection. So it's a little bit difficult to get the information about this, especially like when you go use a swim in the beach.

135
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,240
You may come back with some symptoms. You don't really pay attention to that unless really severe.

136
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:31,150
But sometimes you do get. People do get a diarrhea from this kind of recreation or activities.

137
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,150
So now how do we define a good beach wall?

138
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,600
Or how do we define? It's okay to use. Okay.

139
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,700
This is a matter that we have. We have the sanitary inspection.

140
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:54,310
Why do we think about a sanitary inspection? Cruise to the beach.

141
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:04,340
If his discharge from the suits if the suits direct discharge, those area, we know the sewage, all these contaminants will find.

142
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,550
Hazardous chemicals, you can fight from the sewage.

143
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:16,430
So if there's any close sides to the sewage, not only just the municipal sewage, but also access to test.

144
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:25,030
When microplastics and like weight and general waste in garbage, would that be under sanitary as well.

145
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:34,810
Yeah, that's that's if it's like if for them, if the, the disposal sites always have and then it feels then yes.

146
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,960
Because IDG from the inside it will also contaminate.

147
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,600
But the other thing is really like if you could do the one thing, for example, if you go to the like lakes here,

148
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:52,090
there's the parts with lake inhibitors, the any lakes you have that do have this restroom special.

149
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,710
But there's no really connect to the sewage system. But we have they have septic system.

150
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:06,480
With a big case connected and then the water overflow, they can probably discharge into that into the lake.

151
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,910
So that's also belonged to a sewage inspection. If you have that, I'll give you example.

152
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:18,240
You know what we are doing with this. So and then we use make your water quality assessment here.

153
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,430
And then through the inspection, we haven't really talked about the chemical contaminants in the recreational water.

154
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:36,920
If you look at it here, when we talk about whether we need to close the beach and unless there's really like the the known

155
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,970
discharge from the wastewater from the we know the Wixom that took about a week there and the the

156
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,730
the manufactured plants discharge the waste into the river and then we have the warning to say no

157
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,900
because like you said if you're home then the lifted but doesn't know by most daily monitoring.

158
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:03,020
We only do this sanitary inspections and then we'll talk about is a microbial assessment.

159
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,560
So here is if as a water contact recreational.

160
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,230
If if no. Depending on the use there.

161
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,810
We don't really classify the residues with the sanitary inspection and the microbial content, the assessment,

162
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:32,610
and then you can classify very good goods fair and then depend on these if it's a fair for us, usable for the several days of the rain.

163
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:42,220
So good. Very good. Good different conditions, but even heavy rain sometimes if you have the sun respecting with heavy rain.

164
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:46,540
Normally we don't recommend the use of the beach wall. Okay.

165
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:53,600
That's how they do it. And then interminable concentrations, the organisms we are talking about.

166
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,980
There's less than 40.

167
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,780
This is salutary. And then if it's less than 40, this category will say it's very good, very good.

168
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:15,540
But sometimes you have to take the actions, especially that we have, that this is talk about the enterococci per 100 meter.

169
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,460
Okay. When we talk about the beach or most of the time we'll use into a full ecology.

170
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:30,010
Okay. So here's the the metric that we are using to do the sanitary inspection.

171
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,760
But I also would do the microbial world assessment to basically look at these bugs in the water.

172
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:43,100
For example, this is the work talking about. The reason for that is really.

173
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,390
These pictures, you see, that's before. In the sewage.

174
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,630
We have a different kind of presence if you find in a soup. Right.

175
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,700
You can really find all different type of project in the sewage and the different concentrations you.

176
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,440
So now if you think about do we really have these outbreaks as issues of recreational water?

177
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,890
Yes, we do. Okay. For example, here, this is a pretty old data.

178
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,420
Pretty old data.

179
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:26,320
But we do have a shigella E.coli, Leptospira, Giardia, Krypto norovirus like a virus and then a virus and some of the West Nile agents are identified.

180
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:33,460
So what are you can see here? Different type of flu outbreaks, number of cases every respiratory time.

181
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:38,970
So which means that, yes, we do have outbreaks associated with recreational.

182
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,860
With the beach. This is a much underreported. Okay.

183
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,120
This is much, much, very much on the reports. Look.

184
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:56,740
Think about it. So when you get a little bit uncomfortable or doesn't feel well, a lot of times you may just admit it.

185
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,160
When not go see the future because of this. So especially after you use the law.

186
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:14,380
So we do have like Kansas. I mean, how many outbreaks you can identifies in that area?

187
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:27,580
So we talk about a microbial world for he really is important because why we do this and then this is a spreadsheet of risk exposure and.

188
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,970
There's a 1% illness risk. I think this is the respiratory risk.

189
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,310
So if it's less than 40, we know that every time when we talk about the set up of the standards.

190
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,800
Think about the statement was said, it's not a zero risk. Okay.

191
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,960
It's not a zero risk if that's what it is. Acceptable risk.

192
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,780
Okay. We can we can start, for example, for the water and the recreational use.

193
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:05,229
This is less than 1%. If you swim the 100 times, you get one time.

194
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,860
In effect, it will give them diarrhea. But why?

195
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,070
In fact, that's what we call the risk label.

196
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,400
As reasonable or you have hardier people there, everyone gets.

197
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,600
So that's the risk we're talking about. That's acceptable risk. For example, this acceptable risk, get there.

198
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,590
Okay. But with drinking water, that's it. Risk is too high.

199
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,220
But you go on to dominate it out of hundreds now. Okay.

200
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,240
Out of hundreds now. But this is for the recreational water use.

201
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,500
Yes. The risk level, the level we can tick higher.

202
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,100
And that's all of your choice, right? Is also try only through the recreational water.

203
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,009
And also your choice. Okay. So that's also one of the reasons why the risk level is much higher than the.

204
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,840
Do you want to think about it? But when we use this value.

205
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:07,300
Okay. If they sell for 4000 me for how you being neater then the risk is less than 1%.

206
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:14,350
So that's how we calculate the standard. The the the, the, the, the, the with the criteria we use.

207
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,740
Then we have the risk level is lower than this 1% of.

208
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,120
Okay. So that's how where these numbers come from. Okay.

209
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:39,720
We've come from. So what is the legislation or policy we have regarding the beach water or the recreational water on the coastal area?

210
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,680
We have the beach act. We have the clean beach plans. We also have to talk about the bacterial rules talked about already.

211
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,850
So we the beach acts all these coastal areas that we can find covered by this act.

212
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,080
And then it's about more than 4000 to more than 4000 beach here.

213
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:07,770
And then this is one of the big states as a beach site, we have more than 215 sites that's covered by this beach act.

214
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,600
And then all the other Great Lakes space you can see here,

215
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,310
all the Great Lakes State is also covered by the beach is not only just coastal areas but also freshwater.

216
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,690
Okay. If you look on all these coastal areas, yes, they are also covered by the beach.

217
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:29,370
But then I think the the you can see here the Michigan has pretty high normal here,

218
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:36,270
the New York of North Carolina and then Florida and California, actually.

219
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:49,860
So all these are covered by this this beach act that's talking about the the the water quality in these beach and the coastal areas in freshwater.

220
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:58,650
So EPA also do have this clean beach and talk about different ways of trying to make sure that the.

221
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,370
We can monitor the beach on foot. It's interesting.

222
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Now with the Beach Boys, we.

223
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,800
It's still on the voluntary.

224
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:19,430
So for example, normally these fell onto the the the responsibility of the local health department, the county health department.

225
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,900
The state will provide some funding for this, but the local health departments, where they do the work.

226
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:35,710
So you can see we have the Department of Human Health in the state government and then will also have the equal of the county government,

227
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,290
the funding from equal. But all of this work will come down to the.

228
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:50,440
Could be held in time. We don't really have the country. Department of Imam Muslim oc the order of this community House Department.

229
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,450
So that belonged to the Environment House. So it's part of the house.

230
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,190
So you have a house service that don't have to do the monitoring of the beach all the time,

231
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,700
but if they have some issues, they want to do the investigation.

232
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:11,290
So one of the we are involved with with the Washoe County Health Department is that

233
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:17,060
they are monitoring the Independence Lake because the like to be under the mountain.

234
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,859
And then they try to do the Marquesas tracking. They cannot do it.

235
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,970
So they come to my lab to get help, to do the process, checking to figure out of the problems.

236
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,920
But that's the EPA this.

237
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:36,640
And then, for example, we we have different reports from this is one of the from 2005 about how many days they have closed the beach.

238
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:43,780
The oceans talk about so that's three that every year, for example we do have a lot of activities ongoing.

239
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,390
We'll do the inspection. We have the crew, the beach. Okay.

240
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:53,140
We have the CO. The beach. And sometime you also have a sign.

241
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,040
So, you know, good for him. And now this is for have the crew the beach.

242
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,070
That's the the the the the when you really see the beach sometime you see the signs there.

243
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,560
I mean, yes, they do that you have to have these issues and they don't have the final bacteria.

244
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,690
We talk about in the sky, this is what's a risk.

245
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:22,150
And if you think about the. A step towards swimming officially per thousand swimmers.

246
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:28,780
If this is the number we have established, you has a number like this at 1%.

247
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,860
Here is clues about its own important. This is possibly the swimmers an eight.

248
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,610
So that's the risk level except good and with that rule.

249
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:47,260
And then we have these indicators confusion is basically okay for example is a 300 meter or with the equalize 126.

250
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:56,820
This is the final factor rule now we use if we test for equal, I should be less than 123 per 100 meters.

251
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,870
Okay. That's the rules is a market not allowed.

252
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:16,860
But this is a very. Average number of books you can find with 33 but with equally is 126.

253
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:21,960
So if this have this, you can see that would be safe to speak a goose.

254
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,420
But because this is for science, we must prove it. It gets the affection.

255
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
So that's how we use the final bacterial rule for this.

256
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,000
Good because final victory we used to do to determine so independence this guy doesn't

257
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,299
mention or the county health department they do the monitoring of independence

258
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:52,610
make and then they do find some places some time they have to the the the the

259
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:57,710
equally confusion is above 126 and then they send the worst summer to us.

260
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:05,240
We do the case. Yes we also find us is higher than that. So they do the investigation now to figure out where it's come from.

261
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,960
Okay. Let's come from. So this is what was the real world?

262
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:22,850
We do have this reputation of the closet. So what they're doing is that they have the restroom, the quality there,

263
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:28,930
and they have a separate tent and then they discharges over to the victim exclusive.

264
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:38,300
So there could be somebody leaking there. So the health department, the beloved Defense Department.

265
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:51,800
So the the the thing the the the park is managed by the parks that occasional wherever they do come, they have all public works at that.

266
00:28:52,280 --> 00:29:02,170
And this one the we talk about a lot of court in the morning of the beach is intact by the by the the health

267
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:10,909
department even the House decided that if you so with you want to have the I can I just go to the park to fix the

268
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:16,879
leaking you have to do because they say how do you confirm that we have a leaky with us do that do that in the in

269
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:25,940
the event in the safety system so that's how do they come to my lab to see if you can find if you can say yes,

270
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,420
the contamination we have now higher than the allowed number.

271
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:35,240
Okay. If you can say this is comes from human sources.

272
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:41,130
Then we can go to the pipes, push them to fix this system, to go it.

273
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,070
To fix the system. So they don't have to do the business.

274
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:52,290
Checking for them to find out whether there's any indicator indicator genes that belong to the human medicines.

275
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:02,470
We do find some. Yes. So that we can now they can bring this information back to the post department saying, please check ethics.

276
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,229
So this is a lot of data. So that's that's how it goes.

277
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,230
How logs in the in the real system.

278
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,090
In the real world. Okay. In the real world. So you can adjust the I mean, the the house about to come.

279
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:19,640
I just go there to say fix check the system. All this takes the resources people to do the work.

280
00:30:22,870 --> 00:35:48,120
Okay. Let's take a quick break. Let's talk about swimming pools. Okay.

281
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:54,250
So a lot of type of recreational water use as a swimming pool type.

282
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,360
I don't know how many of you like Sweeney, but Sweeney, you do.

283
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,630
It's great. It's very great because it's very aggressive.

284
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:13,680
Both My boy, my my boys, he's a player for the one team in high school is pretty intensive training.

285
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,460
And also he's a swimmer and they all both you went to a stadium, made a speech final.

286
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,750
So he spent a lot of time in the water and doing this.

287
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:34,130
So there's different of because he's swimming pools some of which go to water park and they have hot tubs plunge pools Mitchell Spa.

288
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,270
So it will have the physical conserving pools,

289
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:44,549
the different type of clothes to the swimming pools that's most of the indoor stories are also have although this

290
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:54,180
is the swimming pool we have I used to when I was more I used to go to the YMCA to go to swimming pools with them.

291
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:05,250
They have warm water swimming pools there. Okay. And unfortunately, every time when I swim here, when I get back, I'll get sick.

292
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,750
Okay. I guess you make me wonder why that.

293
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:21,340
So we see in that in the in the YMCA, in the swimming pools, they have the section called the warm water section.

294
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:34,290
So for the young kids to play there. So but every time, almost every time I can see, when I go there, when I get back, I'll first.

295
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,190
That's just my, my, my, my, my self individuals.

296
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,219
It's. Why is it? Think about the condition.

297
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,620
What's going on? You. The warm water.

298
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,080
With Keith Small to show what we can do.

299
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:11,520
What could happen in. What could happen in a swimming pool in the warm water.

300
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,110
But little kids. Yeah. The pianist, the PE.

301
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:22,160
Sometimes you have to pay for the also. Okay. And the warm water.

302
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,690
The warm one. It was the warm. Wonderful. What's.

303
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:32,360
What's the. What's I mean, Wal-Mart is good, but it was a bad thing about the warm water.

304
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:41,850
Bacterial what can we go there to go crazy there and we also because it's so important.

305
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:47,700
So we have these organic matter also from swimmers discharging to the water.

306
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,590
So think about that kind of conditions condition.

307
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,690
There's really a fever and fever for the bacteria weakens.

308
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,910
Okay. So what I do.

309
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,690
How do we handle this? The article read.

310
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,800
So that's also one of the reasons when you go to the public swimming pools,

311
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:18,190
you will see pretty heavy smell from the crew action with the sweat or game matters.

312
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:28,140
So. And there's also sometimes the go to the the hotels.

313
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,600
They have the small swimming pool somewhere where they're. Okay.

314
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,830
And with all what I did, what I'm doing now makes my.

315
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,290
I really, really, really, really go through this type of thing.

316
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,379
Okay. And with the experience of what I know how to manage, it is honest.

317
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,590
I'm very confident, very familiar with this place.

318
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:59,850
Like we knew that they would get a job if I were a go to Michigan swimming pool, as it will probably pretty fine.

319
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:04,970
They're on very good management. So that's the water quality is okay, is great.

320
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,830
But for these small hotels, all these places, you don't work with many of us.

321
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:17,540
And I will not go with you. Okay. So with this type of uses, you can find all different types of uses.

322
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,620
And even with the special spot, he uses swimmers, water polo participants.

323
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,470
And it's great. I mean, work sport is great for gaming also.

324
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,750
It is great, but we talk about water quality.

325
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,180
Yeah, there's a lot of issues related to that.

326
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:44,210
What kind of hazards you can find in a swimming pool type you can find physical has Johnny injury but also could we

327
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:51,110
please coach some nights depending on where the indoor outdoor and maybe other things really water quality issues.

328
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,490
Okay we have these different content. We'll talk about more about the water quality contaminants.

329
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,480
But the other different from the arbor, we have air quality issues.

330
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:10,700
Right. So if his indoor environment. It's not just water quality, but air quality is also that could be the issue.

331
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:21,440
So if you 70% in the in the security in the swimming force, you'll be there all the time for extended period time.

332
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,490
Everyone owning the water. But even just inhale this.

333
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,140
The air could be health concern. Okay.

334
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,140
So injuries in terms of the health outcomes out of the health outcome.

335
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:40,790
Similarly, we have this drowning injury, some physiological.

336
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:49,030
And the other side is really infection. Inducing inhalation contact with bacteria from the swimming pools.

337
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:59,510
And then we also have the could be also chemicals like a pony and some others come from these chemical contaminants in the soup was

338
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:08,660
in a soup was not really how these aquatic organisms that can bite you all right is not like the coastal area that freshwater.

339
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,080
But in this room, for most of the time, you don't really have that issue.

340
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:20,930
Again, you think about this, use a different type of use because no contact.

341
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,830
No contact, meaning for direct contact and the extent of direct contact.

342
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,790
So that's the depend on the name of the contacts.

343
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,720
You may have different exposure risks associated with this.

344
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:42,570
So now in terms of how this will have come from. As the faculty derives.

345
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,750
Contaminants has come from the swimmers itself. Right.

346
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:57,579
We have the virus. I'm just mentioning some kids who live there and then they could even still wear diapers.

347
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:06,610
They can still get into it. So bacteria virus and the problem and that's one of the concerns we have, in fact,

348
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:11,680
is going out in the water and they use chlorine cartridge where really cannot kill them.

349
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:17,750
And with the high concentration of organic matters. In the swim.

350
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,760
You see me swimming pools in this type of water, and then chlorine will react.

351
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,360
And that's really how the smells issue in the swimming pools if it's not good.

352
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:36,320
Did you have this issue with that? And then also because this normally the disinfection efficiency against this is much less.

353
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:46,300
As could be the issue and then surely you also have this known frequently derives I mean depending on the water use the source of water,

354
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:53,920
use tap water or use the spring water or use other water so they can also have a different type of contaminants

355
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,340
in your face because you can find from the water so immediately and also the monies that can be from

356
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:06,909
the tap water and from the tap water from some of your fungi reservoir can also come from the social watch

357
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:13,960
like if you breathe we took up out of the the hot springs in the in the in river in the Yellowstone.

358
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:20,080
And you can see this and the amoeba and then the region we then what is typical of

359
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,190
animals you can find from the saltwater in the swimming pools or the in hot springs.

360
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,330
So what the the chemicals come from?

361
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:43,000
The chemicals in the swimming pools in the pool soak up a spa water so all derived disinfection byproducts might be cells, water from cells.

362
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:51,850
And then we also have a better derived to think about the urine weights that lotions sunscreens use.

363
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:58,390
Can also get into the water. And then the amendments disinfecting you add chemicals, coconuts you add.

364
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,600
And altogether you can also have this dispersion byproduct. You can find.

365
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,670
And they use pretty high concentrations of disinfectants, chlorine from them in swimming pools.

366
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,699
Okay. So every time you come out of work, we swim.

367
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:20,830
Because if we don't push our oh, you, some of the, the shampoo you use, you'll see previous males and smells of the car.

368
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:27,500
Every time one of my my boys stepped into my car, I said, Have you done a good job today?

369
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:34,299
I guess that's green. And so so that's the content of this.

370
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:40,120
You can find it from the swimming pools. Okay. And one of the big source is really a swim itself.

371
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,400
Is sufficient from the intensive use. So.

372
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,370
That's assuming it was. So how do we do this?

373
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:57,979
I mean, this is for academic disinfecting byproducts and then with high concentration of chlorine and then we'll talk about micrograms.

374
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,610
So we try to to do this. How can we manage the swimming pool type of water quality to maintain the water quality?

375
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:15,970
That's really a deterrent. And the other 1010 is really we don't have the standards unified and the ways to do this.

376
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:26,209
I can feel a little bit about how can we really manage. So the CDC really took about the a report we do how we are ski on infections and in fact,

377
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,690
different types of infections associated with swimming pools. Okay.

378
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,160
CDC is not lying. They are not looking at it. They are looking at it.

379
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:40,610
But we do have a current incidence of the infections associated with swimming pools.

380
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:45,509
Okay. Which room could we assume for that? We have the private swimming pool.

381
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:50,140
Well, public swimming pools, all different type. And they all do this.

382
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:54,630
How can we be? Could be like, how is the swimming pool and how do they think of that?

383
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,770
To talk about how can we reduce the risks like the design, construct the facilities that we do have,

384
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:09,090
the code for the for the for the swimming pools and the operation of management d'éducation information regulatory requirements,

385
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:18,420
okay, chemical all these. But we don't really have a water quality just due to water quality in terms of swimming pools.

386
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,580
Okay. Yes, there's a little bit about it.

387
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,890
So thatability should be less than 0.5% of civil casualties.

388
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:33,540
And then this work never really should be. One milligram per liter of chlorine is a relative figure.

389
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:39,910
This is a label. Some others parameters for that. Think about the regulations.

390
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,080
This is a for the. For the public swimming pools.

391
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,390
The guidance for the recommended routine for the public swimming pools disinfect

392
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:56,050
was heavily used weekly for the trophy counts and then conforms weekly.

393
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:05,950
And as numerous Angelina and then major spars for example you don't really test the hot stuff that it has all of these but you can

394
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:14,370
see here you see weekly or most of the history of these different folks either in the swimming pools as recommended from this,

395
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,799
not every time they do that. So for example,

396
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:27,580
just the to the to the to the YMCA swim for was I go there I'm I'm I'm sure every time I pay attention to the water

397
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:35,320
quality and sometimes it's tough to take the water to take the page and then I ask me what this is all I'll tell you,

398
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,630
it's kind of secret. So they don't want to, you know, to know exactly I mean, assure you, I mean, whatever you like.

399
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:50,379
But that's just what kind of work we are doing surely is not really sufficient to my to my, to my thinking.

400
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,500
It's really especially for that type of swimming pools.

401
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,310
Okay. With that up, swimming pools is not really sufficient.

402
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,690
Legislation policy. We also have a national code.

403
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,009
Okay. We don't really have the national code. And then we.

404
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:15,110
We, we. Some stayed on.

405
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:21,380
Local authorities set up some regulations. Okay. So this is CDC has some of the.

406
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:54,250
You do have some guidance regarding this this in the in some of the the the the work space like different places

407
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:03,520
have the disinfection recommendations the guidance for that to impose especially in the schools for example.

408
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,969
They do have this guidance related to how to disinfect,

409
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:19,330
how to do this and also ventilation in terms of the the the the the use this site and and think about you just mentioned in the Sumwalt and

410
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:28,520
in this the air quality is also another issue but another issue because these are aerosols come out from this and also the bacteria in fact,

411
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,580
you see the the microorganism can also come with aerosols.

412
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:38,840
They can come out so that it can cause exposure to these through them and also has a Walkerville.

413
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:49,850
I just mentioned, the stage has. I'm code for that. This is different than what the Michigan calls go in into of the public swimming pools.

414
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:59,000
They are talking about disinfecting. That was the page and was a page in terms of page, what kind of conversation you have to use.

415
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:04,040
This is a really difficult issue to have have in order to keep this.

416
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,260
So that's the the the the the codes from the department.

417
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:14,850
Environmental quality regulations. The swimming pools. But this is a public swimming pool.

418
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,420
There's public swimming pools. And then do the analysis.

419
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:27,060
And then what treatment? So the the owner of the public school employees will be responsible for crunching the sampled

420
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:33,080
owner operation to ensure that all four samples announced the presence of to the whole matter.

421
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,660
Only the water samples. Is unacceptable. Water quality.

422
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:44,600
Okay. Appraisers over to total coliform bacteria or transgenic rodents is our acceptable oil quality.

423
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,400
But if you do the tests,

424
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:58,460
you'll be able to find especially crypto expensive crypto so as to be sure to continue the recirculate filter disinfection 24 hours per day.

425
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,210
So basically what you do, you have to have this filter system,

426
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:08,210
you have recycling of the water and then at a disfigurement you maintain a different connotation.

427
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:14,390
That's what's most of these swimming pools they are doing is to make sure that you need to operate that.

428
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:20,600
So one of the problem with the this this method is really the requirement is now was chlorine.

429
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:26,300
With chlorine, they cannot really cure the crypto giardia.

430
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,760
It's not effective.

431
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:38,090
We have sense and especially when you have the heavy use like this, like this, this type of heavy use and this chlorine is not sufficient for that.

432
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,860
So that's recommended. Surely you have the filter. You have to replace the filters regularly.

433
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:47,420
And also you need to do for example, if you can do that, you need disinfectant.

434
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,200
I'll be quick. So that's what I'm thinking when we visit overview.

435
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,320
This is the the the ABO drinking water and then.

436
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:02,910
We use UV disinfectant there. It's probably better if you can use it in the future for publicity.

437
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:11,340
Okay. We will see with the public assuming force is just pretty constant so that sometimes they don't really do that.

438
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,600
So that's what we have in terms of the regulations the suing for.

439
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:26,200
If a private. I know, right?

440
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:33,850
Because probably impossible evidence if you're ever in the States, they will not have any regulation of that.

441
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,050
Okay. So it's dependent really on how do you manage that?

442
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:43,720
Okay. How do you make sure your public private swimming pool is not heavy use?

443
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:48,640
Yeah, that's true. But it comes at water quality. Don't you ever with public swimming pools?

444
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,350
Ever. We don't really have a national code regarding the public swimming pools.

445
00:53:54,580 --> 00:54:01,300
I mean, you can you can argue with the public swimming pools. It's just it's kind of a lovely statement, like drinking water you have to use.

446
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:06,680
And the use of complexity to do so is optional, too.

447
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:12,190
So. But if you look at this. Look at this.

448
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:17,140
You [INAUDIBLE] associate with these swimming pools? We do frequent through here.

449
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:22,840
That's how we close the swimming pool. Because people get sick from. People get sick from it.

450
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:32,290
So now let's say if you think about it for if you if you if you if you assigned to investigate.

451
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:42,020
If is outbreak associated with you important if you sushi and she has to to investigate what's going on.

452
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,230
So what kind of samples you will collect what type of sample you are correct.

453
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:54,780
Just to figure out what kind of artwork you may have. So what tests you will do.

454
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,010
And, and. What kind of samples you collect.

455
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:24,280
They have some thoughts on this. This debate will come to come back to this.

456
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:26,690
So another thing, really.

457
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:36,980
So how can we make sure that the water is safe and the 2 to 4, the recreational water effects, really, if you can get it, real time monitoring.

458
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:42,830
So now what do we do? The typical season we are doing is we cook the water samples, bring them back to the lab.

459
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,799
Into a test 24 or 24 hours or 48 hours.

460
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:55,780
We see the results. What's the issue with that? What could be the issue with that people could be recreating?

461
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:01,000
Okay. So during that period of time, they get exposed to that already.

462
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:09,580
Right. So it will be great if we can have this real time monitoring of the microphone activity so that if there's a surge because you can find it.

463
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:13,870
But if you can already find that real time, like hours, you'll see the results.

464
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:19,010
And then you can cruise the beach right away so that can reduce exposure.

465
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,630
So that's feasible now with freedom, but with PCR, this AQ with feasible now,

466
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:31,309
but part of they are under the present effect because the the the difficult to get the water

467
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:38,600
sample and ship to the lab and still take about a day to get the results over with the PCR.

468
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,460
But it's possible that you can go there to take the water. Sand provides some techniques available.

469
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:52,070
You can do the PCR on sites, just apply by apply the water on site and then do the PCR reaction on you will be able to tell you on these.

470
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:00,290
So that's that's the feasible right now if you provided the other things once you do get the results since they're delayed,

471
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:04,220
are they even representative of water quality anymore or could the water quality have changed?

472
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:11,240
Yeah, that's a good question. Also, so sometimes you need to take the repeated samples and this is also something that we use average numbers.

473
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:19,559
Okay. And then the others, really, when you take a cup, take a swimming,

474
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:29,970
take a hot tub and be aware of this some of this contamination, what took up all the other things, but also the mycobacterium.

475
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:39,390
This is another interesting study. For example, the mycobacterium avium is very like the warm water, the like this like the aerosols.

476
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:50,960
So so what happens is when you take the swim, which we also have this a farmer's law and all the the safety got law,

477
00:57:51,690 --> 00:58:01,350
because when the state over the extended time they are exposed to this mycobacterium avium either one.

478
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:06,550
And this bacteria, they like the water, warm water.

479
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:11,830
Also, they like the the easier it will be aerosolized.

480
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:18,250
So you can find from the walls, from the surface, from the walls and in the air, in the swimming pools.

481
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:24,120
And if you got, for example, you stayed there for quite some time and then you get exposed.

482
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:31,210
So that's one of the the effects, the cause of swimming with the mycobacterium, because this reef we have.

483
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:41,250
Okay. Let's come back now to to this. If you have this outbreak associated with swimming pools in this age group, the YMCA.

484
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:46,930
They found. They do have the the people get sick.

485
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:54,000
After the swim and most if we see one case and visible cases.

486
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:58,250
So this outbreak now. So how do you connect the samples?

487
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:03,750
What kind of analysis you want to do? You also confirm to see that the throughput you have.

488
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:21,760
And we're getting to out of. How do you do the investigation?

489
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,440
Did you take a sample water test at Oak Creek?

490
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:38,780
The water sample? Yes. Q Evaluate the.

491
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:44,030
Technology used to be able to see if it's working properly.

492
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:48,680
So let's investigate the that's the, the, the remediation, right?

493
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,760
So that's the remediation. That's first that was the investigation. There was a mediation.

494
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,600
So that was something that.

495
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:12,370
When the when you collect their sample too, just in case it's airborne depending on looking at samples of the virus.

496
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:21,370
What kind of water samples? Aerosols. So we want to do some tests on the people who was there to make sure they all have the same thing.

497
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:27,250
Okay. So patients like specimens, maybe fecal samples.

498
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:39,030
Okay. So these are the assumptions. You are correct because the water samples you are you are correct samples, you pick them human specimens.

499
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:44,180
Cycle matures, basically the most likely you will have the physical material.

500
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:56,690
So they will do that and it will come out ultimately. To identify the species of the pathogen.

501
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:01,340
Okay. So first of all, do the MRD equal on.

502
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,440
To see how was the conversation that you call on the wall?

503
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:14,300
That's an indicator they use, right? Because the indicators, if we see very high load of indicators, I mean,

504
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:23,630
what has the issue by so family and are we the patients normally we know with they when they go to see the patients see the physician,

505
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,910
they will identify they will identify what kind of face it may have.

506
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:35,900
So it is equally or quick example they could identify that symptomatic a little bit longer.

507
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:42,740
But the the the the the the the the corner this job has is pretty quick.

508
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:49,380
Okay for the diarrheal is that we'll be able to figure out most likely it will be able to keep up with.

509
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,870
So you pick water samples, you can be sampled.

510
01:01:53,870 --> 01:02:00,890
Likely the human species is able to analyze the first water sample, whether there's any indicators of coliform to the coliform bodies,

511
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:06,020
and then give them what kind of species intelligence from the human patients.

512
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,800
And then you go figure out whether they have all the presence of the water.

513
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:16,670
Okay. I know how to confirm this.

514
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:25,969
The infection will come from the swimming pool. Although we assume that the swimming of the stream that gives the vice.

515
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:29,300
Do you have some evidence to say they get it from swim?

516
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,030
Okay. It's better to have that also. So we have to go back to. Right.

517
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:41,279
Just to say they are very likely to come from within. So they're very similar.

518
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:48,750
So that's what we talked about. This was, Becky, confirmed by another evidence to say this infection could come from.

519
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,890
Okay. That's true that I was investigating.

520
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:58,440
So now we do the remediation phase. Right.

521
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,960
We need to do that in regulation. How can we remediate the problem?

522
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:16,570
Okay. What do you need to figure out? You need to make sure everything's working properly.

523
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,960
So what can you do? Like everything all right?

524
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:26,980
But your tests to see whether they have sufficient disinfectants, they're ready to continue to be disinfected.

525
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,400
If they use a quarry, the quarry are still working.

526
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:35,260
Okay. Right. Because sometimes the quarry just.

527
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:39,490
Okay. So you have to check. You have to check that first.

528
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,680
The page also needs if you check the page.

529
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:49,900
I mean, the Piaget is also very important indicator to see whether this system works of chemistry of active and they use detecting the filters.

530
01:03:51,620 --> 01:04:01,280
Okay. It was a famous I think already it's five very, very long period of time that can also lost the effects from the filtration.

531
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,160
Okay. Search is. So that's the the.

532
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:09,970
You may need to replace all the standard filters they use.

533
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:21,430
Okay. So you have re read and circulars and the re of suspense and they remove these.

534
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:26,790
You said they re re re re system with a new set of.

535
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,020
Okay. So now after the.

536
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:43,780
You do this once. And then you go back and get the Tesla work samples, tick the box and see whether it's just too for.

537
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,100
I'm okay with that, with matters, without the use of the heavy use.

538
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:54,220
You probably will not be able to see the cotton now that you kept open to the public.

539
01:04:56,200 --> 01:05:02,050
Okay. But maybe we open the topic and come back a bit so that you can do this topic.

540
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:11,080
Okay. So we need to test. I mean, especially if you have the issues, you have to work for them more frequently than before.

541
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:20,730
Okay, people. So in terms of the the swimming pools with warm water with young kids.

542
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,300
Okay. With. Yes, you can swim there.

543
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:34,840
I'm not really I don't really strongly suggest. Although yes, it would be helpful for me to enjoy that type of environment.

544
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:45,510
But I don't really suggest that the reason for that is we have the warm water the queen of the desert is worthy of.

545
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:55,360
Remove from the the water. You may not have the high confusion of the gas in the water with disinfectant.

546
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:03,060
And then we have these. Right temperature to promote the wrinkles of longer on.

547
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:11,570
Okay. So that's the the the issue that we have is different from the what we have in the House.

548
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:20,150
If you're if you just want to buy your swimming pools and recycle it, the collected and the young kids need to swim with you.

549
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,940
So from the public health perspective, from my point of view, I don't really suggest that.

550
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:31,620
I don't really suggest it. For the big swing pools like me.

551
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:37,050
Think that's so big with a low temperature with temperatures in there and they should be fine.

552
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:45,240
We should be fine. Okay. So that's I think, the term that we manage by definition, we have a national corporate.

553
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:51,720
So if you have hat on it, but they don't have the sufficient resources to look.

554
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:55,710
And in terms of outbreaks. Official swimming pool is pretty high.

555
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,040
Okay. Redford speaking to the Drinking Water Stories house.

556
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,540
Okay, but you can argue public school. That's your choice.

557
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:10,710
Okay. It's not like, what do you want of the basic human rights?

558
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,650
We have a very good job on those who employ them.

559
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:26,570
You can go against that by becoming the public health impact, by putting a swimming pool now in the United States, for example.

560
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,890
Let me just say this. The Hyatt was higher than the peak, more.

561
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:38,980
Okay. Beautiful. So think about it. I mean, when you have the intimacy.

562
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:44,790
Yes. I mean, we have a good team of engineers. We love to do well, so that should be fine.

563
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:50,640
But when you go to this small restaurant over the whole year, like ever with ten restaurants,

564
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:59,900
it could be that risk had risen to the to to the they have in the detective booth type stuff.

565
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:09,310
And obviously it's very like abusive. I had myself have experience with that also and no doing this for my kids.

566
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:16,100
That would be one be easier to do that. So I guess I know that from Sweet.

567
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,000
I mean, come on, see it come up and that's a problem. So.

568
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:28,230
So just because you do that, it's difficult. There's no national standards how to manage them.

569
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:34,170
Look what this means for me. How to cope with get it is very difficult.

570
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:39,560
Okay. This policy. Or was it about you?

571
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:49,580
Anything? My mobile phone for the discussion.

572
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:56,000
I haven't got it because I was like 650. So you will not be able to, you know, forgot about it.

573
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:30,510
So this is more discussion tool. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

574
01:09:49,980 --> 01:10:07,710
Everything you do, you're going to have to do something.

575
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:17,150
Life. You in 4 to 6 weeks now you're going to be able to find me.

576
01:10:18,320 --> 01:11:48,440
Yes. Yeah.

577
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:46,180
And who?

578
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:18,310
Okay. Mr. This is.

579
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:43,570
Right. Right.

580
01:14:01,510 --> 01:15:07,370
I. You know, I went into this.

581
01:15:47,460 --> 01:16:56,870
Too many of us have to do it and we're not going to be there to do this.

582
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:02,760
The abuse was over.

583
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:14,150
I'm scared. Who's going to be able to do all the.

584
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:24,120
Do you like that?

585
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,370
Oh, really? Yeah. Each of those.

586
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:36,330
I'm just trying to find something else to accommodate ones.

587
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:41,100
Oh, good. Think it's going to work out?

588
01:17:42,660 --> 01:18:05,200
It's kind of a hard topic. I know he's going to be studying, but this is a close knit group of family.

589
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:13,870
Yeah, he does it to that nature, I guess is the part of it.

590
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:18,430
Oh, he was telling me about this. Oh, I want extension.

591
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:23,710
Okay, guys, I've got to finish him off on Thursday.

592
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:40,200
Healing is not like other humans.

593
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,120
Yes, but he actually just died. But I feel like.

594
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,640
His name was Russell. His name was Russell.

595
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:08,070
His weekend has I downloaded Photoshop in Lightroom because we get it for free through Michigan.

596
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,319
And that's why you're. Yeah, no, because, you know.

597
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:17,950
And now I'm using it. I thought I had some free time this weekend, so I was getting into it was very fun.

598
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:23,379
I recommended school for that one.

599
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:32,960
Our extra free time. We all know you have. All right.

600
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:51,330
Well, you know, I need to.

601
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:57,250
Can singer. Oh.

602
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:11,110
Oh. Oh, I know.

603
01:20:15,380 --> 01:21:04,830
But that's. Okay.

604
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:31,900
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I think.

605
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:11,860
It's such a security nightmare. I have now just logged into somebody else's email.

606
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:50,290
Peter. You know, these attempts, you know you do and everything.

607
01:22:50,300 --> 01:23:01,930
And like if people don't log out, it should automatically log everybody out as soon as you able to see where you're logged in and you know where you.

608
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:06,330
Yeah. Maybe there's, you know.

609
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:51,790
And so are.

610
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:13,300
His last sentence, said Sydney's Douglas.

611
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,930
I texted her that she wants to join me team.

612
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:28,870
Okay. It has a significance from this actually great weather to ride your bike to.

613
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:34,090
What is the perfect equilibrium for you? Roswell.

614
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:41,530
I said everyone. That is excellent. Did you hear from Lenny Bruce?

615
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:49,450
No. I heard. Yes. Now I know it's perfect.

616
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:55,390
Nothing's called. It is a very rare occurrence.

617
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:07,450
What was it like in five degrees? Well, I guess it was like as to where just today, I wasn't sure what the temperature was.

618
01:25:08,090 --> 01:25:12,579
35. Yeah, it was perfect analysis here.

619
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:16,540
Right. Like many text you.

620
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:26,130
He also banked with a backpack full of rice.

621
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:36,240
What's that? Oh, that's for you. This bowl fit perfectly in my bag cooked rice, so it is harder than uncooked rice to check it out.

622
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:43,050
It's the perfect shape, and it's pretty heavy.

623
01:25:50,340 --> 01:26:01,300
I was good. Looking good. I read about stuff last week, so Sunday was really restful because they were finally open.

624
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:06,560
But they've also taken.

625
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:08,840
Yeah, I did it Saturday morning.

626
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:19,680
I had the video cameras not working, but I was getting a nice cold, snowy, snowy sore hill and I went and where they think.

627
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:25,190
Yeah, I was wondering about that because the snow took me by surprise.

628
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:31,070
Can you let Shannon know that we. I have the zoom, but the video is not working.

629
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:37,770
But I think she'll be able to see the slides. She doesn't need to see her.

630
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:50,360
Exactly welcome to give it one minute for Sanders to she'll come on.

631
01:26:55,550 --> 01:27:07,160
Or is he just mainly. I think this is a mistake because since the news of Hillary Clinton, 40.

632
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:17,810
All right. So well, let's just keep watching the zoom to see if she tries to come on.

633
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:21,410
I think I'll have to let her in. All right.

634
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:28,490
Well, good morning, everyone. Today's a good news day, right? Because we have the cultural potluck right after class.

635
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:35,660
The HSA is working really hard on all of the events and I'd like to thank them when they had the bake sale on Thursday.

636
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:39,170
Raised a lot of money. Their plan.

637
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:49,500
Oh, good. Thank you. I appreciate it. Hey, Shannon.

638
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:55,710
Excellent. Can you see our screen with the slide deck?

639
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,320
Okay. The camera's not working in the room. It won't.

640
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,600
It won't like, let me start video. And so if you don't mind, we'll just do slides.

641
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:08,260
Is that okay? Okay. We can see you, though, in the corner.

642
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:16,939
Thanks. Sorry about the bus. Yes, I'm single parenting this week.

643
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:22,140
So it was like, we're going to be late, make my breakfast because I slept.

644
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:25,870
I'm like, I'm still not ready. We'll be okay.

645
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,610
We made it a school, at least in the same direction.

646
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:34,760
It's a lot easier to get here. 4:10 a.m. Plus, get him there at 745.

647
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,230
Yes, but because my husband's out of town, the dog has been out of sorts.

648
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,810
And one of he's a he's a mountain curry. He has a dog that needs a job.

649
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:54,590
And so his job has been since the kids started going back to school, his job is to take them to school.

650
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:58,159
So he jumps right into the truck or the car, whichever one it takes us.

651
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,730
And he, like looks out the window and make sure everyone gets to school.

652
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:06,530
And so I'm looking at the dog this morning knowing that I'm going to be gone all day and I'm like,

653
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:14,660
I'm going to have to take him to school and let him think that his job is being done and then bring him back home.

654
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:26,540
So I did that. So I was starting to think HSA for all of their community building activities, the bake sale, the potluck,

655
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:36,050
which is today and then they are actively planning an in-person holiday party, winter holiday party crossing our fingers.

656
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:42,140
They were we were planning on last year too but that we had to revert to remote.

657
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:46,130
But we did have that really cool silent auction.

658
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:49,520
So that was fun too. I don't know if they're still going to do that this year.

659
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:58,520
Also, good news, Ariana's. In this picture, our lab group was able to continue our tradition of doing the turkey trot over the weekend,

660
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:04,190
although I did not was not able to go because I was going to the football game, it became complicated.

661
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:12,410
So it looks like you guys got it in right before the snow. Yeah, I honestly didn't even feel that cold until about, oh, 1030.

662
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:16,040
And then it was freezing. Yeah, it was a little bit weird.

663
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:22,490
Oh, crazy of a day. Yeah. There's in the gray that's with the red deer here.

664
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:27,229
Yeah. That is like yeah that's timoko. That's the other good news.

665
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:31,790
Timoko passed their prelim on Thursday, and those are tomorrow's kids.

666
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:35,990
The kids stole the show, man. Yeah, it was Emma Claire one, right?

667
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:42,350
Her age group. Claire Is this all the US? This one Claire Laurie was about has triplets.

668
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:48,510
These are the her two girls. The boyfriend didn't come right back to back with their cells.

669
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:51,950
Claire Oh, my gosh. And Jackie son is getting so big, too.

670
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,180
Oh, thank you. They were hilarious. Kids to the side.

671
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:59,959
If anyone else want to share any good news or gripes.

672
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,040
I don't have any gripes today because I'm trying to be like in a positive mood.

673
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:15,320
I feel it does help because if I start thinking of them, it also cascade down.

674
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,680
Some good news you'd like to share. Professionally. Personally.

675
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:30,840
Well, next week we get a break, right, Thanksgiving break.

676
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:35,790
So hopefully everyone can catch up then. Well, I would gripe about that.

677
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:45,780
What? So I take chemistry. I have watched and I hope I still blab Wednesday to you, but says they're kind of weird over there.

678
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:52,390
Are you trying to travel home? I was. I was. I may go across the state and I'll just go thing tomorrow morning.

679
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:57,380
Yeah, but. So it's fine. It's just like. Oh, a little weird.

680
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:02,120
I know, I know. It just isn't until 930.

681
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:06,020
So it's just an interesting bit that Wednesday is interesting.

682
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,260
I remember. They have some interesting policy like discovered.

683
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,250
We technically have class till noon on Wednesday. Right, I believe.

684
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:18,829
But you don't have like if you know on Wednesday class or or it's Wednesday afternoon.

685
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:26,690
That's good. So. Excellent. But in a similar position with my husband well he works but this to like the Chrysler

686
01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:31,280
headquarters his job is like sending him over there and it's an hour and a half away.

687
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:35,300
So on Wednesday, he won't be home until seven.

688
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:43,610
Oh, God. That's all right. Enjoy Friday weekend, all right.

689
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:49,610
Yes. All right. So today we're talking about manicures with Ariana Grande.

690
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:55,360
Do her mock manuscript review and shouldn't going to do about writing a peer response review letter.

691
01:32:55,370 --> 01:33:01,070
Thank you all. I wanted to check to see if anybody wants to do an elevator pitch today.

692
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:09,080
No pressure you're thinking about. Going home and tell your family and friends what you're working on this semester.

693
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:19,250
All right. We'll come back to that if there's time at the end. We only have three more classes, but it was so exciting.

694
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:25,040
Yes. Ambers graduating. But the rest of you will be be here.

695
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:29,390
I know, I know. But next this year, I mean, we're with the rest of you.

696
01:33:29,420 --> 01:33:35,410
Be here for a while. It was my winter class that so many people are graduating.

697
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:41,790
I'm like, Oh, we're not going to see you, but keep in touch. So just a reminder, we have three more classes.

698
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:51,540
Next week I'll be presenting on mentorship, abbreviated, so that we can get back and do this communicating science section.

699
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:56,250
And then at the end we'll talk about finding a job.

700
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:04,260
Just about everyone hopes to do at the end of this, whether it's an industry or academia and then being satisfied in your career.

701
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,840
We added this job negotiation and startup packages.

702
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:14,370
I know that you will be experts on that, so if you have any questions,

703
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:21,810
but it's just a way to get us started because a lot of times people will come to that part of their career and be like, What?

704
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:27,670
I never even thought about this. And there's a lot of like ambiguity.

705
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:31,260
They don't give you sometimes to be like, What's your salary range?

706
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:34,860
What kind of lab do you want? And there's no parameters put on it.

707
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:41,399
And you don't want to like you don't know how to go to high to low and then lay low will finish up with work life balance,

708
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,430
which I really try to encourage.

709
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:51,239
I think there's a whole lot more discussion in professional circles about work life balance compared to,

710
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:56,340
let's just say like even five or ten years ago and especially with our new president.

711
01:34:57,810 --> 01:35:08,880
He had the chairs and deans leadership meeting on Thursday and the topic was announced and it was was workplace and academic well-being.

712
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:16,410
And I think he's got some really awesome ideas. [INAUDIBLE] be giving a public address on Thursday morning and announcing some of that.

713
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:20,910
But I was going to be there on time.

714
01:35:20,910 --> 01:35:24,930
Right. So I'm like pulling in. It's at the union in the parking deck over there.

715
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:30,750
And this woman who is walking and I'm in my car, she fell like really bad.

716
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,050
And I'm pulling up to, like, help her.

717
01:35:34,050 --> 01:35:41,459
And then and then Dean Bowman is right there, and I'm like, Oh, so Dean and I help her, and and then he goes, and I have to go park.

718
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:45,810
And so then I get into the union right on time, like not late.

719
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:52,770
A lot of people in there and I walk in and it was like, Oh gosh, I got to find the seat right soon because it's about to start.

720
01:35:53,040 --> 01:36:00,780
And I see this woman I know from the president's office, she's like a special counsel to the past and current president.

721
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:06,360
Her name is Liz. I've known her for about five years and Liz's Dana come sit at my table.

722
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:12,479
And I was like, okay. So I go with Liz to go sit at her table and I get to her table and it's the

723
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:17,180
president and the provost table and the only seat open is next to Santa Ana y.

724
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:23,489
So there I sit and we did a we did roundtables during this two hour meeting.

725
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:33,420
So it was myself and the chair of sociology and the head of the ellison honors program and the president, the provost and the head of h.r.

726
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:42,899
For wellbeing talking about work life balance and it was really great because they said what do you do in your unit for this?

727
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:48,930
And I was able to talk about our community conversations and how we had just had the one on science and religion last week.

728
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:55,049
And Ariana even brought up the one that you had thought of workplace inclusion for body size,

729
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:58,560
and they were like pretty impressed that we did this regularly.

730
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:04,770
And I was like, Well, it's not me, it's the committee. So I'm really glad that we're making strides and work life balance.

731
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:09,800
That sounds really nice. He is his Twitter.

732
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:13,470
He's everywhere. Yeah. So there's never that. I know.

733
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:16,840
I was waiting because he took I saw him take the picture. I saw him. Yeah.

734
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:18,780
And I was like, what is he going to put the pictures up?

735
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:24,029
And it wasn't right away because then I could see from his Twitter that he then after that met with some faculty.

736
01:37:24,030 --> 01:37:28,440
He met with them. I saw Colwell from ABC in that in that tweet.

737
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:33,200
So I don't know how he does it, but he is doing it. It's not somebody else.

738
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:36,300
I guess I'm virtual assistant, I don't think yet.

739
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:43,590
I mean, average. Yeah, I know you can usually tell when it's not the person, but when you're tweeting,

740
01:37:43,590 --> 01:37:47,340
this is I think this is appropriate for us to talk about in this class. Like when you're tweeting.

741
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:49,840
It's not exactly live tweeting sometimes though.

742
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:57,450
But but tweeting, you know, you I would get so nervous that I would just say something wrong, even a typo or even just spelling.

743
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:00,899
But, you know, he he seems very comfortable with it.

744
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,350
So and I think the community appreciates it for sure.

745
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:11,129
And then lately you saw him throwing out the t shirts at the game wearing his custom jersey.

746
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:14,720
Yes. It seems very engaging in community, which is rare, right?

747
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:19,400
Yeah. Yeah. And I think in that we'll have opportunities to meet him here at Public Health, too.

748
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:23,280
[INAUDIBLE] come by. But there's only so many hours in the day. Right.

749
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:36,180
So remember to before next week to take one of your colleagues examples of of science in the public and

750
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:45,450
apply these to two of the 11 principles for evidence based communication and pull them out examples.

751
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:52,259
So how does the article bridge the chasm addressing this divide between research and practice?

752
01:38:52,260 --> 01:39:00,570
And that's like why we I think many of us are in public health is because while we want to do state of the art research,

753
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:05,970
we also want to make an impact on on public or on policy.

754
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,669
See on the clinic. So take that.

755
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:17,910
And then the second one is to also take a lens when looking at the article about promoting the importance of these societal values,

756
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,050
inclusion, ethics and democratic participation.

757
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:26,190
So do take some time to do that between now and next week.

758
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:35,220
And then just a reminder, we have the two last assignments, the LinkedIn profile due next week.

759
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:42,600
Ironically, I got this email last week from LinkedIn that was like completing your profile is quick and easy.

760
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:48,870
I'm like everybody listening to me. So I got exposed to go add job preferences.

761
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:50,730
So I thought that was really ironic to get that.

762
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:59,250
And then thanks to on upon for letting everybody know in yellow Digg how to do the summary because it's not always intuitive on all the platforms.

763
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:04,440
And then a reminder of the research write up assignment for the end of the year.

764
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:11,250
This 1 to 2 page short summary of a fellow students research written for the lay audience.

765
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:21,420
And there's lots of examples of the environmental health news format in the Dropbox also include 1 to 2 additional resources.

766
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:24,690
If you're the readers would like more information, where do they go?

767
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:33,180
It can be primary literature, but it also can be something that's secondary on the web and then do at the end of the term.

768
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:36,089
And then these are our write up partners.

769
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:42,930
I didn't hear anybody who wanted to switch, so enjoy interviewing each other and getting to know the research.

770
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:50,170
Any questions? All right.

771
01:40:50,190 --> 01:41:00,470
That was my last slide. I thought so. All right. So Ariella are now able to access that the Dropbox from there.

772
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:06,070
I there's that part of the manuscript and I just realized that.

773
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:12,790
Yup. I can get that right. Yeah. I think this, this here.

774
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:19,130
No. This is somebody else's problem.
