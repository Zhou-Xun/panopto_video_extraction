1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,110
Yeah, I cried for 4 hours.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:18,240
So I was like, okay, that's just printing my newspaper, calling people every time I hear the same thing.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,650
I think so. I like my facts.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,210
I really do. I'm going to go to sleep and then like we go to sleep.

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:01:00,800
I mean, we really need to have change because I know it sounds like my music, so I'm actually going to now.

6
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,310
Just let me know. I haven't got anything. I literally I'm just going to show it to you.

7
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,000
And I am like, Yeah, oh, we're going to be just like, Oh, okay.

8
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:24,350
I just got now, like, I think I might stay on this tour together, okay?

9
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:35,669
I don't think I'll still be here, but I'm just saying.

10
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,800
Okay, so I wanted to have a few announcements before we started class today.

11
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:52,810
So the last quiz before the exam quiz number six very soon and I'll put the due date for it.

12
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,720
Usually give you until Monday to complete the three questions for quiz.

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,410
Quiz number six. The other announcement was having to do with the exam.

14
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,530
The exam will be on Wednesday, October 19th, after the break.

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,940
And deeper issues about the kinds of questions it'll be on the exam.

16
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,940
You look at the end beside in terms of how I'm going to structure the exam,

17
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,330
in terms of the types of questions that you should expect to see, what do you focus on studying?

18
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:39,540
Focus the objectives. So for this lecture, I have three objectives.

19
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,400
Explain, describe, understand.

20
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:51,930
Expect more of your questions for the learning objectives that have defined or explain less detail on questions that start with understand.

21
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,380
And if I say identify, expect to see those concepts included in a multiple choice question.

22
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:09,530
Okay. So I made some edits to this lecture to kind of clarify some things.

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,900
And I rushed through the very last few slides and I wanted to go back and then go through the summary

24
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:25,080
and then go over that the set point and that the different long term energy regulation model.

25
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:37,940
One step at a time and you've read about these. If you've completed the reading assignment on models that explain long term body weight regulation.

26
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,350
So let's start here with the summary, what we've discussed so far.

27
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,600
So it's the isolated realm, levels that matter.

28
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,220
So in the studies looked at isolated ground realm levels.

29
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,149
After a meal he saw that X led to growth of ghrelin levels.

30
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,650
Decline in people with lean body weights are normal weights or a typical weights,

31
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,250
whatever you want to however you want to describe this group, but not in individuals with obesity, it was kind of a flat line.

32
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,280
You'd have the gut peptides. Those levels were consistently lower in individuals with obesity.

33
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,080
They did increase after a meal, but they were consistently lower at baseline and then after meal.

34
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,629
And that in terms of issues related to, you know, why if you have lots of leptin,

35
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:39,410
if you have a large adipose tissue mass, why is this does that not inhibit further food intake and further weak gains?

36
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,240
And there are some theories that have been used to describe and explain this.

37
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,660
And one theory was the hypothalamic inflammation is the glial cells.

38
00:04:51,050 --> 00:05:04,910
These are cells that proliferate in response to rotation and the concept directly alters and the closest contributes to further weight gain.

39
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:12,020
By making you less sensitive to the levels of leptin and insulin in your body.

40
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:24,980
The other regulated homeostatic system is the leptin receptor where we're talking about leptin resistance.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,580
And in this instance, even though you have high levels of circulating leptin, that signal is ineffective in reducing food intake and body weight.

42
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,090
And I showed you a very detailed figure describing how this process works.

43
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:58,490
And it's this the leptin receptor signaling events that occur that make the events essentially turn off the sensitivity of the leptin receptor,

44
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,620
the circulating levels of left it, making it insensitive, causing this leptin resistance to occur.

45
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:17,389
So these are some theories that attempt to explain why we see an inability of the higher peripheral energy stores in the form of

46
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:29,390
higher adipose tissue mass and why that doesn't seem to suppress energy intake when you have a higher level of adipose tissue.

47
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:42,170
So we describe these systems that are known to affect short term energy intake and expenditure,

48
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:51,709
and there are a number of long term models that have been proposed, the one you've been exposed to as the set point theory and the set point theory.

49
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,520
I talked about this.

50
00:06:52,610 --> 00:07:02,000
The very end of the lecture has to do with its focus on adipose tissue as that signal that can regulate food intake and energy expenditure.

51
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,980
And that was based on studies done by Kennedy in the fifties.

52
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:20,060
And you've probably seen this before from 630, where Kennedy had a group of of rats of five in each group, and it looked at body weight.

53
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,930
And as the animals got older, they gained weight.

54
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:34,070
And in the two different groups and one group, he restricted their caloric intake and in another group he kept them on the same chow diet.

55
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:45,320
And then after a period of restriction, he put them back on that normal level of or ad libitum exposure to their food and they gained the weight back.

56
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:56,209
And based on this model, it was thought that you have the set point that there an inherent body weight that is internally

57
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:07,400
regulated and this determines the end body weight regardless of other types of environmental influences.

58
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:20,600
This is a key point. So you don't have in this model highly palatable food, you don't have in this model energy expenditure in the form of exercise.

59
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:31,220
So the lack of these environmental influences are not lacking in this particular model to explain long term weight regulation.

60
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,290
And there have been other models that have been proposed. Have you seen that?

61
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,820
You've seen in the readings that I. Happy to.

62
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:52,030
So there there are a number of reasons why a set point theory fails to explain long term energy regulation.

63
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:01,270
And its focus is on this adipose tissue that signals to brain through leptin about peripheral energy stores.

64
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,439
And weight gain by a body. Fatness is above the set point.

65
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Food intake will decline and energy expenditure increases.

66
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:21,970
And during weight loss, the adipose tissue declines are below the set point and food intake increases and energy expenditure decreases.

67
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,680
Okay, but there are issues with this theory and there are a number of them here.

68
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,190
It can explain the increasing prevalence of obesity in developed nations.

69
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,920
So we've gone from the early sixties to a 13% prevalence, 2.2%,

70
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:50,740
and it can't explain why there is a higher prevalence of of overweight and obesity with people who are at a lower socioeconomic income level.

71
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,530
It can explain why children who watch more television are more likely to be overweight.

72
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:10,510
We can't explain individuals weight gain in college marriage or after moving to Western nations or environmental influences.

73
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,760
It can explain weight loss that occurs after you've acquired an infection.

74
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,910
Or if you have cancer.

75
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,670
Cancer projects here doesn't fit well with this model and shy disorders.

76
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:38,730
It's more than just adipose tissue signaling through leptin is responsible for controlling long term body weight.

77
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,750
You have a tendency to gain weight after the age of 18.

78
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:53,940
Once you reach the age of 6065, there's a decline in body mass, largely due to loss of lean tissue.

79
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,400
And this model doesn't explain that very well with anorexia nervosa.

80
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,020
After recovery, these individuals rarely become overweight or obese.

81
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:15,000
So the tight regulation of food intake and energy expenditure is more likely to be explained by environmental influences.

82
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,070
And the other thing, it's more than just fatness.

83
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,290
That mass accounts for 5 to 45% of the total body weight.

84
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,350
So there are other things that are important in terms of long term body weight regulation.

85
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:43,380
So eating you may have heard about this settling point model and here's an illustration that kind of captures this concept.

86
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:51,060
You have intake in this case, it's rain falling downhill that would represent energy intake.

87
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,240
And then you have water that has filled this reservoir and it reaches a certain level.

88
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:06,630
And that certain level would correspond to a level of adiposity, a level adipose tissue level of triglycerides within the adipose tissue.

89
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,510
And the outflow is affected by the depth of this particular pool.

90
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,560
If more energy in the form of food come into the system.

91
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,640
In this case, they're looking at using the analogy of rain.

92
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,380
That reservoir fills up and it reaches a higher level.

93
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:36,040
And in response to this, the outflow of water in this particular reservoir increases.

94
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,810
So it's the level here is passively determined by input and outflow.

95
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,630
And then in the opposite scenario, where there's little rain,

96
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:58,149
the depth of the reservoir is lower such that there's less water flowing out

97
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:03,730
of the river and there's lower levels of water in this particular reservoir.

98
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,649
So this is the settling point model, which was popular for for a number of years, and it's been discarded.

99
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:23,139
And there have been other types of models that have been used that would include more detailed information about how this process is regulated.

100
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:29,140
And we know that it's regulated. We just don't understand over the long term how this process occurs.

101
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:36,100
So new models have been proposed in this particular model.

102
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:47,010
The focus here is on energy intake. And instead of saying that energy intake is solely regulated by internal systems,

103
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:56,290
the the energy homeostasis system, which occurs through the central nervous system in the gut and adipose tissue.

104
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,590
It also includes the environment in the form of uncompensated factors.

105
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,709
So here's this energy intake regulation model.

106
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,090
You have intake in the center.

107
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:20,190
And you have environmental factors and these factors are not compensated for in terms of their your ability to regulate them.

108
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,740
So if you're in an area and if you're in an environment with abundant energy sources, you're likely to take in more energy.

109
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,790
If you are in an environment with lower levels of energy resources, your energy intake will be lower.

110
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,990
And then there's the physiologic regulation of body weight over a long period of time.

111
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:52,050
And this one is influenced by energy expenditure and energy intake, and they interact with one another.

112
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,690
So there are these are the physiologic processes that we've been talking about all along.

113
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,750
Yes, body weight is regulated in the short term by these different types of influences.

114
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,430
And this does affect intake, but you also have to consider the environment in which we live,

115
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,760
which happens to be an estate, as it's been described in the paper as obesogenic.

116
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:26,340
It raises our BMI because we're exposed to higher levels of energy and we want to consume it because it's there.

117
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,690
And it considers the influence of the hedonic system.

118
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:42,630
We are consuming calories. The absence of energetic inactivity, the uncompensated energy intake influence.

119
00:15:51,650 --> 00:16:03,050
And then finally we discussed the paper, discussed this dual interconnection model, which kind of captures a little bit of the previous models that,

120
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:14,450
yes, it includes the environment, but it also includes this physiologic control of energy intake and energy expenditure.

121
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,360
And here we have a graph.

122
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:28,100
We have body weight for body fatness on the Y axis and time on the X axis.

123
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,380
And then you have different scenarios in which the body weight fluctuates.

124
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,860
The gray hour, the arrows respond to pressures from environmental factors.

125
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:54,070
So in a circumstance where there is an environmental pressure to decrease body weight, you'll you'll lose body weight in response to these pressures.

126
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,340
It could be through increased energy expenditure, lower energy intake.

127
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,530
These influences will lower your body weight to a certain point where there's a lower intervention

128
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,320
point that kind of prevents you very strongly from going below this particular level.

129
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:25,480
When environmental pressures are found in the form of an abundance of energy and a limited ability to expend energy,

130
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,260
you have an upward shift of body weight, which is shown here.

131
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:39,120
And the B portion of this figure. And over time you reach a certain threshold and this is proposed to be genetically

132
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,260
determined what the upper threshold might be from individual to individual.

133
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,740
However, if the environmental pressures are strong enough,

134
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:53,880
you can push beyond this level and reach a higher level of physics that exceeds this physiologic control.

135
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,640
This kind of is a way of including the idea that the set point in this particular model.

136
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:12,070
And then if there is intervention in which you reduce your food intake, increase your energy expenditure, that body weight down.

137
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,670
So this is an attempt to explain long term body weight regulation.

138
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,560
They're imperfect models.

139
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:30,080
They're used to describe how our body weight changes over time, these physiologic mechanisms that we talked about in environmental justice.

140
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:40,600
Any questions about so far are.

141
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,650
There's no one here.

142
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,020
So it was the exam up until that point that we had. Up until that point.

143
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:20,940
Right. So now we're going to talk about the biology of adipose tissue.

144
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,770
And this is a long lecture we can use today.

145
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:36,960
And this is a very big area of research that changes are happening in the past.

146
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,930
Adipose tissue really wasn't a thing in terms of it being studied.

147
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,130
It's become an area of intense investigation.

148
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:57,420
And I'm giving you just a snapshot of the different areas of adipose tissue biology and a lot more than that I could have presented here.

149
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,730
But I'm going to give you kind of an overview.

150
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,900
So for learning objectives, you should be able to describe the structure and function of different types of adipose tissue,

151
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,550
describe the changes to white adipose tissue structure and function during its expansion during weight gain.

152
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,170
And explain why adipose tissue is necessary for glucose homeostasis.

153
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:30,040
So adipose tissue is critically important to maintain a normal or a level of blood glucose.

154
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:41,830
And I'll explain to you how this is affected by an excess of adipose tissue and a very low level or an absence of adipose tissue.

155
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:52,780
And I'm going to, at the very end, describe changes that occur to adipose tissue with aging your ability,

156
00:20:53,230 --> 00:21:00,250
your adipose tissue declines as you age, particularly in the subcutaneous compartment.

157
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:08,830
And this has consequences in terms of things like your your ability to control glucose.

158
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,520
So adipose tissue does a lot of things.

159
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:27,520
Yes, it's a long term energy storage vessel fills up with triglycerides and it's a way to store energy that you could need over a long period of time.

160
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:39,080
But it does a lot of other things as well. It generates heat in the form of non shivering thermogenesis.

161
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,340
And this is coming from the ground that exposed tissue.

162
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,440
You all have brown adipose tissue and it is functional in adult humans.

163
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:55,280
And I'll tell you a lot more about this and that it provides insulation.

164
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,159
It's it's a way to preserve energy stores.

165
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:08,840
And so it protects the heat that we generate and keeps us warm under conditions.

166
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,270
And really importantly here is that it's the main storage site for triglycerides.

167
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,390
And this adipose tissue that you have is functioning normally.

168
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:35,780
It can take up that excess energy and store it safely and prevent it from going to other tissues and organs such as the muscle and the liver.

169
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:46,639
So the uptake of lipids in muscle and liver are due to compromises.

170
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,650
And if a side function is referred to as ectopic lipid deposition,

171
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:59,780
and this can occur in states of having trying to store too much triglyceride inadequate tissue,

172
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,809
or if your adipose tissue ability to buffer that lipid is compromised,

173
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,090
it's either either that it's not functioning normal or it's a condition in

174
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:19,770
which you can't make adipocytes in the form of a condition called dystrophy.

175
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:31,130
It serves as a cushion for internal organs as well as for the rest of your body.

176
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:40,620
And in the bone marrow it replaces no matter poetic cells as you age.

177
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,810
So is your immediate poetic cells decline over time?

178
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:58,140
That space is filled up with adipocytes, and there are a number of changes that occur in your blood in response to that type of blood aging.

179
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:06,389
And it changes the profile of circulating hormones like the kinds.

180
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,660
And we'll talk about that in much more detail at a subsequent lecture.

181
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,290
And importantly, adipose tissue is a source of hormones,

182
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:25,200
and depictions of different kinds are essentially a protein produced by the adipose tissue itself.

183
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:31,200
And these active accounts in some cases are unique to the adipocyte.

184
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,300
They produce this hormone that other tissues cannot.

185
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:46,650
And then there are scenarios in which the adipocytes can produce these these hormones like immune cells, which can suck in the form of cytokines.

186
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:55,319
And then finally, there are other types of mediators referred to as viable kinds that are actually lipids.

187
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,760
They're structural. Is this actually a form of a lipid? And they can affect physiologic lysis as well.

188
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:13,330
So this is an overall diagram of different adipose tissue adipose.

189
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,320
And what I want you to understand is that this is a complex organ system.

190
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:29,220
So you have adipose tissue scattered throughout your body and you have different depots that perform different functions.

191
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:38,940
So the biggest adipose tissue that you have is the subcutaneous adipose tissue shown here and this person's arm,

192
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,950
and it accounts for a majority of stored triglycerides.

193
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:50,940
And then you have other sites where they are stored.

194
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,470
The other major site is the visceral adipose tissue compartment.

195
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:08,520
This is in your echo region. So this is outside of other types of adipose tissue storage within organs.

196
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,640
The other organs that are shown here that include adipose tissue are the lungs

197
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:22,920
where you can have adipocytes in the airways at the cardio adipose tissue,

198
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:34,270
have lot of those tissues surrounding the kidneys here, and you have adipose tissue surrounding the environment.

199
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:48,540
This is referred to as adipose tissue at each of these different sites now are regulated by different types of physiologic processes.

200
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,300
They are unique to those organ systems and we're just beginning to understand how

201
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,490
they're different and how they're they regulate different physiologic functions.

202
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,020
And then finally there's this narrow adipose tissue shell here.

203
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:15,230
And think of the bone marrow, adipose tissue as adipose tissue that nourishes the bone.

204
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,010
This is a concept that is actually very old,

205
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:33,020
and it's an area that is a focus of the research by Raymond McDougall over at the Department of Physiology, and it's also in the Diabetes Center.

206
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,760
So the major types of that post tissue are those are the white adipose tissue.

207
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,290
Those the major types are white adipose tissue.

208
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:54,020
This is most abundant, and this is the adipose tissue that's responsible for storing energy.

209
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:05,300
You have a fair amount of brown had a post tissue and you've probably learned that brown adipose tissue is important for generating heat.

210
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:14,210
When you're adapting to a cooler environment, it increases your body temperature.

211
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,780
And this is a process called non shivering thermogenesis where the heat is actually generated

212
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:27,920
by the brown and the sites you find for brown adipose tissue in hibernating animals,

213
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,100
in newborns, in DNA.

214
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:42,470
But there's also enough adipose, brown, adipose tissue in adult humans that it makes a significant contribution to energy expenditure.

215
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:54,620
And there's another type of adipose tissue that's been referred to as beige adipose tissue.

216
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,350
And this one is kind of weird, kind of unusual.

217
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:11,480
It's kind of a hybrid between the two. It has a distinct origin in terms of what it is, the cell types that it originates from,

218
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:19,220
and it has characteristics that you might find in white adipose tissue and brown tissue.

219
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,250
Here's a illustration that shows you the differences between the two.

220
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:35,240
Right. And of course, tissue. Can you get the site has a large fat fuel and within the back you all you have triglycerides.

221
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,710
Okay, here's some mitochondria here.

222
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:49,790
And then here's the nucleus shown here in purple. On the other side of this diagram, we have an example of a brown adipocyte.

223
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,520
You don't have nearly as much brown adipose tissue as you have white, but enough to make a difference.

224
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,440
And the difference here is its ability to generate heat.

225
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,880
It does that through the mitochondria.

226
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:15,290
So this particular cell type has an awful lot of mitochondria and its mitochondria are shown here scattered throughout the cytoplasm.

227
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:23,180
So the cytoplasm is very different in this cell compared to the white adipocyte we have one giant vacuole,

228
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,870
you have all the other structures within the cell periphery.

229
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:35,420
Here you have little droplets instead of one back, you have this massive droplet scattered throughout the cell.

230
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,590
And then finally, there's the major deficit.

231
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:51,010
It's kind of like both of these. The Olympic droplets would probably be a bit bigger and they would have fewer mitochondria.

232
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:58,490
And there's this concept referred to as the aging of white adipose tissue.

233
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:09,979
And there's this possibility to have these adipose tissue transition to become more brown cell,

234
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:18,170
like where they are under the influence of catecholamines or low temperature.

235
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:27,890
You can have browning of white adipose tissue and you can get an expansion of this population of adipocytes that that increase in number.

236
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,710
And they can increase energy expenditure by behaving like brown adipocytes.

237
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:49,980
So if you were to take a biopsy of white adipose tissue and most often this is done from the subcutaneous adipose tissue depot,

238
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:57,440
and you were to stain it with hematoxylin and yes and yes, something that looks like this.

239
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:08,780
Let's look at the men. And what you're seeing here is the large cytoplasm within these individual adipocytes,

240
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,220
and they bump up against each other and they press against each other and they form these structures.

241
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,090
And in between these large vacuoles,

242
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:29,540
you have intracellular organelles and you also have capillaries and you have many different cell types within this adipose tissue.

243
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:40,190
It's not just lipid. So, yes, you have individual adipocytes and that's that's what we're seeing here in the form of the lipid droplet.

244
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,200
But there's a lot more detail going on here, which I'll explain.

245
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:58,250
The next slide here. So let's first talk about the importance of adipose tissue in regulating physiologic functions.

246
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:11,610
So why not? Post tissue plays an important role in human physiology, not just in storing energy, but doing a lot of different things.

247
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,970
You talked a bit about how it affects energy balance and appetite through leptin, but it also does other things.

248
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,060
It can regulate blood pressure. It affects lipid metabolism.

249
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:44,260
It affects blood iron levels. We can sequester the cells within the spaces between the adipocytes can acquire iron and stored in the adipose tissue.

250
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:53,490
It affects nutrient transport. It affects inflammation and immune immunity.

251
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:03,690
It affects angiogenesis. It plays a critical role in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis,

252
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,920
and it secretes factors that play an important role in the body's response to is not

253
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,020
just a site where you store energy and make leptin because a lot of other things.

254
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,560
So to highlight what is there, I have an illustration.

255
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:37,920
So if you were to isolate the different cell types and put them up on the screen and show you what they what they,

256
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,500
what is actually in that adipose tissue,

257
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:47,010
you come up with an illustration like this and this is kind of disproportionate in terms of the size of these cells.

258
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:53,040
But this is a way to explain to you much better. So here are the adipocytes.

259
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,970
Here's the large vacuoles. And these little dots for us are representative of their nuclei.

260
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,710
And you also have an extracellular matrix composed of college and fibers.

261
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,530
And the college and fibers are produced by fibroblasts.

262
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:22,130
And that structure is really important and actually holding are providing structure for the adipose tissue.

263
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,680
Maybe have a vascular supply for gas.

264
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,310
Oxygen and carbon dioxide. Transport and nutrient transport.

265
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,250
So this area is richly perfused with with blood.

266
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:47,179
So you have capillaries that perfused this tissue and then you have within these

267
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,460
spaces cells that will become mature adipocytes under the right conditions.

268
00:35:53,510 --> 00:36:01,890
So this purple cell here is a pretty different sized. Under the right conditions, it can become a mature domicile.

269
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:10,510
And in between these cells are immune cells.

270
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,620
So you have these blue cells, these would be T cells.

271
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,210
You also have macrophages and here are two cells shown in red.

272
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:32,010
And within the blood vessel you have epithelial cells and you might have some smooth muscles within the larger arteries that produces tissues.

273
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,590
So you've got a lot of different cell types, not just stored lipid and.

274
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,600
You know, how is adipose tissue?

275
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:00,030
It expands through two different processes,

276
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:11,549
X2 and hypertrophy and exactly why that expansion would occur through one or the other

277
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:19,000
mechanism is determined by what's going on in that particular white adipose tissue people.

278
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:26,440
And its genetic program and your genetics.

279
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:36,630
So. Subcutaneous adipose tissue expands primarily through the process of hyperplasia.

280
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:42,980
And when adipose tissue expands in this manner, you get more adipocytes.

281
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:53,660
So the adipocyte number increases and the adipocytes are increasing in number because you have more lipid to store, more energy to store.

282
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:01,220
And this is a way to safely store triglycerides,

283
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:12,500
such that they're not continually releasing free fatty acids such that they aren't in this chronic state of inflammation.

284
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:21,500
So the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines would be low and that the immune cell number here would be kept low as well.

285
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,270
So there's not as much of a recruitment of the cells to this particular adipose tissue department.

286
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:38,259
The vascular supply to these cells is sufficient to maintain the transport of oxygen

287
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:46,419
and the removal of CO2 to prevent hypoxia and to prevent the fibrosis from occurring,

288
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,880
which can occur. The activation of fibroblasts laid down for a positive interests.

289
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,880
And under these conditions, you're sensitive to insulin.

290
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:06,940
So this is a safe way to store access triglycerides through the process of hyperplasia.

291
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:17,020
The warrant states in response to a positive energy balance purchase fee.

292
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:25,360
The expansion of adipose tissue occurs by increasing the size of the adipocyte.

293
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:37,310
So notice that the diameter increases in each of these two different sites and you also see a lot more of these immune cells.

294
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:47,270
These are macrophages that can accumulate in white adipose tissue if it expands to the point where it can become hypoxic.

295
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:59,030
So the cell size increases. Its ability now to control spillover of fatty acids is impaired in this particular scenario.

296
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:10,940
And you have signals here that recruit lots of these these macrophages, and some of them become activated.

297
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:17,600
And the activation of these cells is referred to as a and one phenotype.

298
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,280
The ATM here is the adipose tissue macrophage.

299
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,620
So here you had a lot of blue cells and maybe a couple of points.

300
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,520
Here you have a lot more red ones. And this in this scenario,

301
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:37,520
the adipose tissue macrophages become activated and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines contributing to this tissue inflammation.

302
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:47,080
The individual adipocytes can expand to such a degree that they can't be adequately perfused

303
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:55,570
with capillaries and they experience hypoxia and they die through a process of paper ptosis,

304
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,690
and they can release things that can contribute to information.

305
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:07,120
And this would be cellular components known as danger associated molecular patterns.

306
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,890
And this creates this inflammatory environment in adipose tissue in which you have this hyper hypertrophy occurring.

307
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:25,390
Hypertrophy of adipose tissue occurs more in the visceral adipose tissue compartment than anywhere else.

308
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:37,360
And it's an indication that perhaps your subcutaneous adipose tissue isn't able, for whatever reason, to expand through hyperplasia.

309
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,340
So you get greater expansion of adipose tissue above the waist.

310
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:51,370
And this is a sign of greater hypertrophy of your adipocytes and above the waist,

311
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,680
subcutaneous compartment in the abdominal region and within the visceral compartment.

312
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,280
This is associated with decreased insulin sensitivity.

313
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:14,130
And I'll show you more detail later as to how this mechanistically affects glucose homeostasis in the liver and in the muscle.

314
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,990
Yeah, sure it does. Insulin insensitivity.

315
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:28,709
Cause this or this? Cause this, like this causes the insulin sensitivity so that each of the fat cells get larger.

316
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,920
But the amount of the fat cells do not increase.

317
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,880
Right? The number does not increase. The diameter exists.

318
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,940
Disease caused insulin insensitivity in the liver and muscle.

319
00:42:44,050 --> 00:43:00,460
This is the. Yes. So I'll talk about mechanisms of how increasing the level of circulating lipids affects insulin sensitivity

320
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:06,280
as a consequence of this type of a response to tissue adipose tissue expansion in a later lecture.

321
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,380
So.

322
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:27,640
This is a diagram here where we're looking at a bigger picture and we're looking at how an expansion of adipose tissue can affect metabolic health.

323
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,050
So if we start here at the beginning of the diagram,

324
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:44,270
we have energy expenditure and energy intake and in this particular scenario we have an excess nutrient in calorie excess.

325
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:53,270
And this can be caused by consuming a diet with a highly palatable diet with lots of fat and sugar

326
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:03,320
that's not compensated for energy expenditure and in the healthy storage of this excess energy.

327
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:13,630
You get the increase in the number of these adipocytes through these precursor cells.

328
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,840
This is a pre vascular deficit.

329
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:23,590
So this process is activated in the scenario of adipose tissue expansion.

330
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:32,500
So these cells come from the blood cells actually, and they undergo hyperplasia.

331
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,240
And when they reach the adipose tissue mass,

332
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:53,770
they undergo a maturation process where they increase in number and they attain the capacity now to take up lipids and store that lipid safely.

333
00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:03,240
And if someone has increased their adipose tissue mass where this occurs hyperplasia, dramatic,

334
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,730
they can be metabolically healthy despite the fact that they have a larger adipose tissue mass.

335
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:20,889
So this would occur in someone perhaps that if you were to characterize this response, what would the adipose tissue look like?

336
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,550
It would probably look like they have more subcutaneous adipose tissue.

337
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:34,610
Deposited below the waist in the femoral and the gluteal gluteal femoral adipose tissue pads.

338
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,710
So this is a safe way to store excess energy.

339
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:51,360
And so you have beneficial depictions acting in response to these types of scenarios.

340
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,870
After 21, you have leptin suppressing food intake and we've talked quite a bit about this.

341
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:10,290
And then the hormone adiponectin which sensitizes cells and tissues to glucose suppresses hepatic glucose output.

342
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,970
It's anti-inflammatory anti fiber genic within the adipose tissue mass.

343
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:25,080
In the other scenario, you have the conditions which promote hypertrophy.

344
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,790
This is an unhealthy storage of excess lipid,

345
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:40,260
so the adipocytes undergo hypertrophy and as a consequence the adipose tissue mass expands and

346
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:47,870
the ability of the capillaries now to sufficiently supply this tissue with oxygen declines.

347
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:55,260
These cells are too big and as a consequence they they become hypoxic and some of them die.

348
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,690
And the process of necrosis promotes an inflammatory environment.

349
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:07,770
And in this type of environment, college and deposition increases,

350
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:19,860
the fiberglass become activated, and this inhibits biogenesis from the newer adipocytes.

351
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,790
This is the process that occurs when adipose tissue expands to the process of hypertrophy.

352
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:38,880
As a consequence, lipids that would normally be stored in adipose tissue get out into the blood and are stored as topically in muscle and in liver.

353
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:49,220
And this leads to a metabolically unhealthy phenotype where you have increased levels of glucose and lipids in circulation.

354
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,700
And when I talk about metabolic syndrome,

355
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:02,750
you've heard about this in 630 and you're going to hear a lot more about it in your medical nutrition therapy class.

356
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,220
It refers to five different components excess abdominal adipose tissue,

357
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:19,010
elevated blood pressure and elevated blood glucose, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides.

358
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:26,120
If you have three of these things, you would be diagnosed with a condition of having metabolic syndrome.

359
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,360
Okay. So this review for most of you. Have you heard this before?

360
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,350
Have you seen this before? Some of you are shaking your head.

361
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,370
Some of you. Okay. Okay.

362
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:54,100
So let's zoom in and look at what's going on in the Adipocytes.

363
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:01,990
This is a figure taken from a paper in cat adipose tissue.

364
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:07,060
In this case, it's from the epidermal adipose tissue compartment.

365
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:11,020
This is the visceral, adipose tissue site in a mouse.

366
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:24,110
And here you have two different pictures here of this white adipose tissue and a lean versus one meeting.

367
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,990
Now, remember that the mouse didn't have a left functional left of the receptor.

368
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,680
As a consequence, they're always hungry, they're hyper patient.

369
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:41,020
They're constantly eating just regular animal chow, and their adipose tissue mass expands tremendously.

370
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:52,480
And if you were to take a biopsy of these adipose tissue from that, the visceral department would look at something and it would look like this.

371
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,480
So here's that tissue, here's the lean scenario.

372
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:06,480
And then you see this particular area of the section standing brown.

373
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:17,740
This end refers to or is is marking regions in which the adipocyte now is undergoing cell death.

374
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:27,580
And in these regions you have surrounding this adipocyte, you have cells that are staining for these macrophages.

375
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:39,310
Here's an accumulation of this is a mostly nucleotide cell here, and here's a bunch of cells that are staining positive for macrophage markers.

376
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:44,830
So there's lots of macrophages. Here's a different stain to show you what these would look like.

377
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:50,109
So within the intracellular between these cells,

378
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:56,469
you have an accumulation of macrophages that occurs when you have these sites that

379
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,730
are dying and undergo a process of necrosis and it recruits inflammatory cells.

380
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,810
They become active and they secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.

381
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:14,950
And so this is a recruitment of these types of cells.

382
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,480
These inflammatory macrophages is referred to as crown like structures.

383
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:26,530
And that's what you're seeing here in brown and that mouse adipose tissue section.

384
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:46,700
So let's zoom out here and look at this model that is proposed to explain metabolic disease

385
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:55,850
that can develop if you have an inability to find excess lipids into the adipose tissue.

386
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:03,980
So this is referred to as the soggy bathroom carpet model of overnutrition related metabolic disease.

387
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:13,100
And here we have a bathtub. In the bathtub represents your capacity to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides.

388
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:22,190
And it fills with energy intake, which is represented by this faucet filling the tub.

389
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:29,720
And energy expenditure is represented here by this drain.

390
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:34,970
And if this storage capacity is not exceeded.

391
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:42,500
You stay in homeostatic balance. You have normal glucose homeostasis, metabolic health.

392
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:55,980
And the next scenario, you have a condition in which you exceed the capacity of that adipose tissue to take up an excess energy.

393
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,830
And as a consequence, the water in this scenario spills over.

394
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:08,760
So you have greater energy intake and about the same amount of energy expenditure.

395
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:14,459
So in the bathtub illustration, water flows over the slides and leaks into the carpet,

396
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:22,140
making a soggy, soggy carpet, which would represent metabolic disease in this scenario.

397
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:31,740
So the capacity of the adipose tissue to take up that triglyceride has been exceeded in this scenario.

398
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:37,950
And this would represent a condition in which you have insulin resistance.

399
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:48,960
Plus one lipid now is stored, is going outside the adipose tissue and it's affecting insulin sensitivity in the muscle and the liver.

400
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:59,370
You don't have to have a big bathtub in order for this to occur.

401
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:07,590
In other words, you kind of serve metabolic disease and people with me because their the function

402
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:16,919
of their adipose tissue is impaired for whatever reason might have dystrophy,

403
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:24,720
you might have a condition in which your adipocytes cannot expand through hyperplasia.

404
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:36,570
So you can observe this condition occurring if you have a native post tissue mass that has a limited capacity to store excess triglycerides.

405
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,640
And that's what's represented here in non-obese insulin resistance.

406
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,520
So the water flowing in again represents the energy intake.

407
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:56,880
But in this scenario, the bathtub is smaller, the ability of the adipose tissue to take up that excess energy.

408
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:03,570
It's exceeded early. And the energy expenditure isn't compensating for this.

409
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:15,570
So the bathtub is overflowing. And as a consequence, you get ectopic liquid storage and this occurs and this results in metabolic disease,

410
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:20,370
insulin sensitivity, hypoglycemia, type two diabetes.

411
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:30,070
Okay. So what proof do I have that backs up this model?

412
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:42,810
So I'm going to show you a number of experiments that have been done in animal models to support these hypotheses.

413
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:53,970
So this first one is the proof that the buffering capacity of adipose tissue is protective against type two diabetes.

414
00:55:55,090 --> 00:56:04,790
So the hypothesis going in here is that adipose tissue prevents the spillover of lipids, resulting in exocrine storage and assistance,

415
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:13,380
and that tissue could expand beyond normal limits, which are increasing the size of the bathtub.

416
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,550
It would prevent topic, lipid deposition and maintain normal blood glucose and insulin responsiveness.

417
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:27,640
Is this the case? So this is the hypothesis going into this experiment.

418
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:40,100
So this is a classic study published back in 2007 and Phil Shearer's lab at the University of Texas Southwestern.

419
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:44,060
And he designed this this mouse.

420
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:51,710
So he took the mobile mouse, the mouse that doesn't produce a functional leptin.

421
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,480
And that's this mouse here.

422
00:56:54,410 --> 00:57:06,830
And these mouth mice, if you just put them on chow, they get to be about 60 grams, which is twice the size of a mouse on that genetic background.

423
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:18,590
And he did something really clever. He genetically programed these mice so that they would produce an abundance of the different kinds of nectar.

424
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,460
Adiponectin promotes a type of genesis,

425
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:38,460
and it would increase the ability of these animals and help their hyperplasia to store excess energy in the adipose tissue.

426
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,960
People with a lot more deficits. And.

427
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:50,340
Here's what's shown here in this diagram. So the open symbols here represent just one deficiency of openness.

428
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:59,060
But we have this ability to overexpress adiponectin something really interesting happens.

429
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,450
They get a lot bigger and that's what's shown in this mouse here.

430
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:10,180
They get to be almost 100 grams just on regular chow guy.

431
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:28,190
And when you look at the levels of a difference in shown here, males and females, this essentially proves that they're producing.

432
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:31,700
They're producing. Yes, they're producing more adiponectin.

433
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,959
And so that's shown here in the black bars.

434
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:47,540
And the white bars represent a dip in levels in the male and female mice that are transgenic.

435
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,870
This is the black bars here. They're overproducing adiponectin.

436
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:57,350
And you can do this. You don't have to have this transgenic mice to have this response.

437
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:02,510
You can give them a drug called Pioglitazone.

438
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:14,240
And Pioglitazone is a PPR agonist, which is that agonists is a drug that can promote a type of genesis.

439
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:24,620
So you get more adipocytes. And our agonist does this by internally increasing the levels of the protected in mice.

440
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,850
And that's what's shown here in the gray bars for both male and female.

441
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:36,830
Also noticed that females are producing more adiponectin than the males are.

442
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:47,200
When you look at the relative differences and the different adipose tissue pads,

443
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:55,750
the visceral inguinal and gonadal, these referred to different visceral adipose tissue pads.

444
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:04,780
And then here you have the brown fat here, and you see that the transgenic animals are those that are given the PPR agonist.

445
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:15,009
Agonist, there's a relative increase in the size of these adipose tissue depots in each of these scenarios.

446
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:19,840
And there's actually also an increase in the brown adipose tissue in these animals as well.

447
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:30,700
And then this is bottom figure shows you the type of adiponectin that's present in the blood of these animals.

448
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:37,990
And I don't want you to worry about that right now in terms of whether or not you have adiponectin

449
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:44,200
as a monomer or a high molecular weight adiponectin or about that in the next lecture.

450
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,280
So let's look at fasting serum parameters in these different mice.

451
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:56,550
This is fascinating. Here is a wild type mouse cell.

452
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,370
It has a blood glucose level of 92.

453
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,459
You look at the yellow bobby mouse, the mouse that can't make leptin, it's fasting.

454
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:21,520
Blood glucose is above 300. The same mouse that can Overexpress Adiponectin now has a blood glucose level of 100 milligrams per deciliter.

455
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:29,010
So even though these mice are a lot bigger, they're living with homeostasis.

456
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:33,820
This is not different than the wild type animal. Let's now look at insulin.

457
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:44,590
So here's insulin in nanograms per milliliter, 1.83 in the wild, type 7.85 in the B mouse three three.

458
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,020
Not statistically different than the wild type.

459
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:58,220
So this shows you the importance of adiponectin and regulating insulin levels and then some sensitivity.

460
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:07,670
The next piece of this table looks at triglycerides 147 milligrams per deciliter in the wild,

461
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:14,960
type 302 times higher in the mouse in the transgenic animal.

462
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:26,520
They're actually significantly less. So you have less circulating triglycerides and the mouse that overexpress is the dip in active.

463
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:35,240
So they're very, very capable of controlling the lipid levels because their adipose tissue is highly functional.

464
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:42,370
And the final line here is free fatty acids in serum.

465
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:50,890
It shows the same pattern. But these differences aren't that aren't statistically significant because of the variability seen here.

466
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,120
Perhaps if they had a larger number of animals, they would be statistically different.

467
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:10,330
Now the next set of graphs looks at a number of things related to glucose and lipid cholesterol levels.

468
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:19,360
So in this particular portion of the figure, you have blood glucose levels and an oral glucose tolerance test.

469
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:25,310
Here is what happens to blood glucose in the dark samples or the field samples.

470
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:30,160
Here you have the transgenic mouse, the transgene mouse.

471
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:38,740
Again, it's bigger. And its ability to clear this glucose from the blood is much better than Covid-19, which is shown here.

472
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,209
You also notice that they start at much different levels.

473
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:48,580
The transgenic mouse has lower blood glucose and the mouse.

474
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:53,530
When you look at their insulin responses, you also see some interesting things.

475
01:03:54,490 --> 01:04:02,020
So at baseline, the insulin levels in the mouse is higher than that of the transgenic mouse.

476
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:18,130
And with glucose, the transgenic mouse, insulin increases and then it goes down with the mouse insulin increases and it continues to increase.

477
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:23,920
Way out here, even after 3 hours, he doesn't go down after this time period.

478
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:30,940
That's because the glucose levels remain high or remain elevated.

479
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:35,830
The animals are insulin resistance. They can't take up that excess glucose.

480
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:42,370
If you do the same experiment, instead of giving them a layer of glucose tolerance test,

481
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:52,420
you give them a whole list of lipids and you'll notice that there's huge differences here in terms of circulating triglycerides.

482
01:04:53,380 --> 01:05:01,120
So here in the field, symbols you have, the transgenic mice will be obese, transgenic mice.

483
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:09,370
And then with the open seq symbols, you have the ova mice where the level of circulating triglyceride increases,

484
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:19,720
it goes way up and then it comes down slowly after 8 hours where the level of triglyceride transgenic mice remains low throughout this time period.

485
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:34,090
So the ability of the transgenic mice, which has a lot more adipose tissue to take up that excess lipid now is much better than in the mouse.

486
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:45,820
There are some other experiments done looking at this type of a scenario where you give them a lipid challenge, and in this particular scenario,

487
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:55,930
they're giving the transgenic animal a monoclonal antibody antibody that's going to get rid of the excess adiponectin.

488
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:05,380
And we find that the transgenic mice behaves a lot like that of your mouse in this scenario.

489
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:16,780
The next set of figures referred to an experiment done where instead of giving them a nutrient challenge,

490
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:23,500
glucose lipid, they're giving them catecholamine type drugs.

491
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:37,570
So in this particular scenario, they're giving them drugs that activate the receptors involved in catecholamine physiology.

492
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:45,130
And you're looking at the release of free fatty acids in the mouse and in the transgenic mouse.

493
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:49,420
They're about the same at baseline and it goes up a bit higher in the transgenic mouse.

494
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:55,630
And then when you're looking, you're doing this experiment, you're looking at insulin levels.

495
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:02,800
The insulin levels go up a little bit with this adrenergic challenge and the mobile B mouse,

496
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:12,100
but the insulin levels already are much lower in transgenic mouse and the insulin levels go up in response to this particular challenge.

497
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:22,810
So they're more they have a greater ability to respond to these challenges in energy or hormones with with the transgene.

498
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:33,820
And then there are some differences here in regard to cholesterol levels as well being lower and lesser are being lower.

499
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:45,180
And the animals who have this transgene but let's look at the adipose tissue mass do

500
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:50,080
not have the triglycerides stored in the liver and the beta cells in the pancreas.

501
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:59,360
And that's what's shown in this next figure. So when the animals are five weeks old, here's their weight.

502
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:06,680
We're looking at here that the weight of the fat that's here.

503
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:15,290
So here's the lean animal. And here is some of other other tissue that they're measuring in terms of fat mass.

504
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:21,830
And here's the five weeks where we're seeing a little bit differences in terms of fat mass in the transgenic mice.

505
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,760
Over time now, things change.

506
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:34,490
So with the with the change in maturity of these animals, we start to see some big differences.

507
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:42,410
So weight gain that occurs occurs rapidly when we put the animals on a high fat diet.

508
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:54,050
And that's what's shown here in this figure. So the different colored bars refers to either the animals being on chow or being on a high fat diet.

509
01:08:55,010 --> 01:09:05,780
And you can see that the transgenic animals yet to be very big on the high fat diet over a period of about six weeks.

510
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:17,960
And this is done to kind of get a very strong perpetuation of adipose tissue expansion.

511
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:26,270
When we look at the actual tissue in these mice and compared their diameters, we see big differences.

512
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:32,059
Remember I mentioned that the expansion of the adipose tissue in the transgenic

513
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:38,540
mice was through hyperplasia more deficits that are smaller in diameter,

514
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,850
and theoretically there should be less inflammation.

515
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:50,460
Right? So here's the cross section of the mouse stage.

516
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,500
It's looking at what's going on here in between these adipocytes.

517
01:09:54,980 --> 01:10:01,790
Here's the transgenic mouse. Fewer adipocytes, fewer inflammatory cells between the different sites.

518
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:08,540
And when we measured the diameter of the individual adipocytes that are much smaller than the only mouse.

519
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:14,470
Okay. So their adipose tissue mass is expanding through hyperplasia.

520
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:19,790
More cells that have a smaller diameter and then their size.

521
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:32,900
Yeah. Chewy. So the more fat cells, more fat cells, but smaller diameter and less getting bigger,

522
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:39,420
it's a lot bigger in terms of it's not these numbers, but more like what's that the numbers.

523
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:43,410
Yeah. Still to just have to classify them not obese.

524
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,870
They are they're they're still they're still they still have obesity.

525
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:52,730
They're very big. They have a big fat, but they have metabolic control.

526
01:10:53,070 --> 01:11:00,710
And we have to show that their adipose tissue is expanded through the process of hypertension.

527
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:12,380
So this next section, this e portion of the figure shows you what the beta cells look like.

528
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:24,620
So they took a biopsy from the pancreas and they're showing you here in Ireland, and here's the transgenic mouse on the bottom.

529
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:35,899
Here's your Bob Mouse on the top. So the the beta cells are the island area is huge in your body compared to the transgenic mouse.

530
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:45,560
And this is the the objectively determined islet area, and they're much smaller in the transgenic mouse.

531
01:11:48,280 --> 01:12:02,719
So the ability to expand adipose tissue to the tip of Genesis preserves this pancreatic island cell function in terms of their ability

532
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:16,970
to produce insulin in a way that doesn't rely on this huge expansion of the individual cells in the F portion of this diagram.

533
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:26,700
We're looking at a cross-section of the liver. And on the top of this red section, you have the obviously mouse and transgenic mouse,

534
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:36,740
and you notice that the storage of triglyceride, which would represent ectopic lipid storage, is less in the transgenic mouse share.

535
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:46,720
So that lipid is prevented from spilling over into the liver and being stored topically.

536
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:58,050
So that's what this shows. Other lipids, dinosaur glycerol, are also lower in the transgenic mouse.

537
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:05,850
And if you were to fast the animals and give them insulin and look for responsiveness to that

538
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:12,900
insulin by looking at the expression of markers that would indicate insulin receptor signaling,

539
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:24,750
you find that the transgenic mouse has is much more responsive to this so that the liver maintains sensitivity

540
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:33,570
to insulin because the animals are storing the lipid safely within a higher number of adipocytes.

541
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:43,560
And then there are some other examples here in terms of the percent, the visceral fat percent of body weight shown here.

542
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:53,850
This is the cardio fat in of the mouse versus the transgenic mouse.

543
01:13:55,950 --> 01:14:02,010
So the detail that when you worry about let's look now at the inflammation.

544
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:09,780
So I mentioned that when you have hypertrophy of the individual adipocytes,

545
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:16,590
that causes the accumulation of immune cells, that causes this pro-inflammatory environment.

546
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:22,019
But if you have the capacity to make more of the connected in these adipocytes,

547
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:32,250
it kind of normalizes the pancreatic function and it improves the inflammation that you would see locally and systemically.

548
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:39,540
So here's another stage used for these islets.

549
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:47,400
Here's the wild type of mouse magic. You have this huge islet mass compared to the transgenic animal.

550
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:57,600
Here's a section of the adipose tissue we're standing in between these cells or immune cells, more fibrosis, perhaps.

551
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:09,440
And that is when you take this tissue and you isolate the different cell types, you find that with the yo yo,

552
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:18,150
the mouse, there's a lot more of these cells that are expressing transcripts for macrophages.

553
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:26,370
Next for Haiti, Imani represents here fewer of this, fewer of these in the transgenic mouse.

554
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,280
And then if you look at other markers of inflammation,

555
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:43,919
I can il6 and TNF is lower in the transgenic and in each of these different inflammatory cytokines and

556
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:50,250
I can but the vehicle I'm certain that I can become as a it's an intracellular excretion molecule.

557
01:15:52,340 --> 01:16:04,850
Okay. So to summarize, these experiments enhanced or increase to disconnect an expression in the transgenic mice increases

558
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:12,830
the size of the fat mass and the capacity of that adipose tissue to take up the store lipid.

559
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:26,330
This reduced inflammation and reduced the spillover of lipids into liver and other tissues.

560
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:30,020
Muscle. So to reduce ectopic lipid storage.

561
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:37,360
It reduced the free fatty acids in serum and it reduced triglycerides in the serum.

562
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:45,490
It reduced insulin islet cell sites and it improved insulin sensitivity.

563
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:59,750
And, um. So relating these experiments to this of the model is essentially increased the size of the bathtub so

564
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:05,600
that it can take up more water and preventing the water from spilling over and giving you a side effect.

565
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:12,140
So you have, of course, tissue expanded safely and it was able to take up more lipid.

566
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:23,210
Can this happen in humans in the capacity of adipocyte lipid storage increase in humans?

567
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:31,580
Last thing going to talk about. So in other words, can you expand the bathtub and hold more lipids in humans?

568
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:36,350
And will this prevent lipids from spilling over causing metabolic disturbances?

569
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:46,580
Yes. So this is a figure taken from a paper, another classic paper published in 2002.

570
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:51,530
And this particular one shows you one individual in the study.

571
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:56,210
So this is a man 59 years of age at baseline.

572
01:17:56,990 --> 01:18:02,390
And this is a T scan showing you in white the different adipose tissue deposits.

573
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:09,620
Okay. And you have subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue shown in white here.

574
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:22,040
And the areas of these adipose tissue depots are for measured using this CT scan and determining the number of pixels that appeared to be white.

575
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:29,290
Here, the values that you get, the body weight of this individual is only 67.4 kilograms.

576
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:40,100
But despite this smaller body size, this individual has a high level of fasting, blood glucose and hemoglobin.

577
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:46,910
And let's see, it's 7.3%. This person has diabetes right now.

578
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:52,309
This individual was treated for 16 weeks with this key part agonist.

579
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:55,700
Remember that drug that activates increases adiponectin.

580
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:02,930
And this causes the expansion of adipose tissue through the process of a type of genesis.

581
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:12,590
And as a consequence, it's the peripheral here, the subcutaneous adipose tissue mass that expands.

582
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:20,690
And this individual, his weight increased from 67 to 69.

583
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:29,740
However, the expansion of the adipose tissue was occurred primarily in the subcutaneous compartment.

584
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:34,930
So it went from 1.44 to 204.

585
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:38,780
Visceral compartment declined in terms of this area.

586
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:43,640
And look what happens to this individual's leukocytes.

587
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:52,670
They go down substantially from 180 for their fasting blood glucose, 184 to 117.

588
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,120
Their hemoglobin N1 C goes down to 6.5%.

589
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,244
Now, years ago.
