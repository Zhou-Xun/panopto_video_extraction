00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,090
Welcome to Human Genetics. No lecture three.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,510
Today's topic is the linkage disequilibrium. So let me start defining haplotype.

3
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,070
The haplotype is a group of genetic variants that tend to be inherited together.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:30,310
So usually typical genotype and sequencing technologies do not provide the haplotype information and it provides a genotype information,

5
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:39,610
which is a combination of two chromosomes. But in this case, let's assume that we have we have collected haplotype information,

6
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:48,040
which is clearly a case in the white continuing genome or a chromosome chromosome X and Y in males.

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:56,229
So let's say we observe that and there is a five different location that where the polymorphism

8
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:04,950
happens and this individual one carries a little glial T and C and Tallil in these five locations.

9
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:12,700
So in this case, the individual one case at the edge of TCT haplotype two carries age.

10
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,190
It's a haplotype in the three case a c TCT haplotypes.

11
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,419
These genetic variants tend to be inherited together.

12
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:34,930
So whenever there is a T l's happens, you know that that that Aki haplotype also likely carries G as well.

13
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:43,690
Okay. So there so that that is the phenomenon we're going to talk about today and that is our link it is going to be on is it's spoiler.

14
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,590
Now. In fact, we're not usually measuring haplotypes.

15
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,680
So in actual individual,

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,420
we usually observe as a keynote that is a combination of two pairs of haplotypes

17
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,940
and that haplotype feeding problem we're going to talk about later in the lecture.

18
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,010
So let me talk about how happy with that could happen.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,410
So before any mutation happens, let's say this is sequence of some ancestral genome.

20
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,350
And when. So part of the chromosome will have these.

21
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:35,940
These sequences, but after a mutation happens, one of the chromosome may have a substituted two g.

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,830
So to see and this is a possible mutation that happens some all your date.

23
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,420
Then these L's can be transmitted to the offsprings.

24
00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:02,370
And, you know, in in the springs we may see this this mutation in some of the individual and this C LLC and some of the individuals.

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,480
And but mutation happens can happen also sequentially.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,870
So let's say after this mutation, there's another mutation in this location happened.

27
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:24,990
The original ancestor sequence was a G by you as mutated C, then there could be three possible haplotypes that could happen.

28
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,490
If you look at the individual chromosome, one chromosome may just carry that ancestor and live.

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:41,060
That doesn't get any mutation. One of them can carry the C a little because that that mutation happened only in the in the time.

30
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,200
But the this mutation didn't that didn't happen for that particular chromosome or some of the some of them

31
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:57,109
may be carrying the mutation in both of the location that this mutation happened on top of these haplotypes.

32
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,260
So whenever you have you observed this mutation, this mutation also would happen.

33
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:17,650
Okay. So in in this scenario where you assume that this second mutation happens after having this mutation and in the same haplotype,

34
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:28,500
then you would not expect to have a have a level where the first level is A and secondly,

35
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:36,520
C, so there's no as a C haplotypes, you're going to expect unless there is a recombination.

36
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:46,760
So with we talked about recombination and in the in the first lecture, so we said that the.

37
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,650
The human genome, a mosaic of the parental genome.

38
00:04:51,660 --> 00:05:03,060
So they say you have a paternal haplotype there case these two Anglos and maternal apple at that that is close and the cross crossed over.

39
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,819
Now if the crossover happened between these two, that variation they can be recombinant recombine this way and indeed in this scenario

40
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:18,600
you'd observe all four possible hep haplotypes between these two mutations.

41
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:27,600
If there was no recombination and if two mutations happen sequentially, you would not observe these recombinant haplotypes.

42
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:34,140
You know, there is only three possible it's possible haplotypes will be observed.

43
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,430
So these recombination events happens occasionally, not quite frequently.

44
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:50,190
So the way how we can quantify that is encoded in genetic map.

45
00:05:50,520 --> 00:06:00,780
But let's talk about the cytogenetic map first that this is this is what you would visually see for the chromosome appearance in a microscope.

46
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,870
When when you stained and this is this is one possible map of a specific chromosome.

47
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:20,549
And that chromosome have a physical location where you count every a T base as a single base.

48
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:28,680
And in this case, this part, this whole chromosome contains 150 million letters of the T.

49
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,680
So this genetic map basically quantifies how much likely those recombination could happen.

50
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,330
So so these genetic map is the unit is a centimeter again.

51
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,530
Okay. So in this case, it's a 20 centimeters and 30 standing organ.

52
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:59,820
So here is a 50 Sandy Morgan. There's another 30 Sandy Morgan, which is 80 centrum organs here and 100 cennimo 125 centimeter.

53
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,770
So lovely. You know, this one cennimo can correspond to one mechanism roughly.

54
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,460
And if you have one address anymore and one more quest point to one,

55
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:23,270
expect a crossover event point of meiosis in this case OP to hear this corresponds send him over so you would expect one crossover event.

56
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,860
Between these regions we in this region.

57
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,700
Or in the one generation of recombination or meiosis.

58
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:49,270
Okay. So as you see there, we in the genetic map correspond the lovely one centimeter, 1.1 megabits, but their genetic maybe is more dense here.

59
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,750
So this is 20% more and this is 37 million, 37 million.

60
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,170
Even though these two are saying that there is an immigrant, this range, this is much longer.

61
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:07,850
So which means that our on the centromere recombination is less likely to happen than the end of the crime.

62
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,690
The tip of the chromosome this distance is short.

63
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,240
That means that there's a more chance to happen recombination at the tip of the chromosome.

64
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,499
So recombination varies by the chromosome, location,

65
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,460
and usually around the centromere recombination, where the telomere recombination is more frequent.

66
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,849
Now let's talk about the moon because it is kilograms WILLIAMS So because it is a recombination

67
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:42,380
chromosomes that mosaics of potential can have per person and it's just sort of haplotypes.

68
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:52,940
So when you look at the specific location in the genome, they carry some mosaic pieces of these ancestral haplotypes,

69
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:04,400
but they are basically only small, small pieces that are disconnected due to that recombination.

70
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,530
So the length of these segments can vary by how often the recombination happens and

71
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,620
whether or how many mutation happens between this ancestor in the present day haplotypes.

72
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,349
So in a hub, what the population size is and natural selection is that those are all the

73
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,880
parameter we're going to talk about later on when you learn the haplotypes.

74
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:41,720
But basically the the key takeaway here is that, you know, current present day haplotypes is a mosaic piece, the mosaic of the pieces from the mold.

75
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,500
The numerous ancestors of the of.

76
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,750
You know, all types. So these combination values have very close markers.

77
00:09:51,770 --> 00:10:01,429
In this case, if there's any genetic variation in these close markers, they are likely to be carrying the correlated variants.

78
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:12,799
And that's called the linkage, it is clear. So if we look at the two variants, particularly, let's say let's let's look at the A and B,

79
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,670
a little, there are close to each other in a certain chromosome.

80
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,380
And. The.

81
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,270
The aliens are here big and small and big and small.

82
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,489
So let's consider all possible combination of these cells.

83
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:42,910
And there are four possible haplotypes here. So then we can calculate the frequencies for each of their lives separately.

84
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:53,380
So what? How often these speak a in a small alias happen in the population are often big B and small B little happens in population.

85
00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:04,740
And also we can calculate how often is a, b, l is together in a haplotypes and how often a small B aliens happen,

86
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:12,070
have happened, happened together, observed together, and so on, so we can calculate the haplotype frequencies.

87
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:23,590
So if these two events are totally independent, okay, then we those, those, those are frequencies that.

88
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:31,850
Haplotype frequencies were be a capital, you keep capital B or capital A, small B and so on.

89
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,030
These haplotype frequencies will be simply the multiplication of their literally frequencies if they were totally independent.

90
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:50,850
In their case, these two variants are called in linkage equilibrium, meaning that they're independent if they're not independent.

91
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:58,950
So if this frequent this equation does not hold, then these two variants are called in linkage disequilibrium.

92
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:12,630
So and you can quantify how much this is a disequilibrium, how happens how severe the how strong the linkage of this globally is.

93
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,830
So to do that, you need to haplotype frequency.

94
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:26,700
So what we need is a frequency of these four possible haplotypes and that they are sufficient statistic which is to contain all the information to

95
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:36,630
calculate the link here this KG and then we're going to learn about these these statistic at the Prime and the are scare or Delta scare statistics.

96
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,180
So let's look at these haplotype frequencies. Suppose that we are given this haplotype frequency of the four possible haplotypes.

97
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:57,750
And if you add the frequency of two haplotype carried that carries a capital alleles, you get a little frequency of the capital AML.

98
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:08,430
Likewise, if you add the bottom two, you're going to get the daily frequency of this small yellow if you add here.

99
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,840
Then capital B and small B and little frequencies can be obtained.

100
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:19,110
So if you have the haplotype frequencies, you can get the relative frequency in a trivial way.

101
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:30,690
So then, as I said, that linkage equilibrium is basically when you can describe the haplotype frequency of a of these

102
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:37,350
four possible haplotypes as a multiplication of the each of the corresponding frequencies.

103
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,440
In this case, you can say that a little a an LP.

104
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,430
It's a bit that those two variants are independent of each other to constitute the haplotype frequencies.

105
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,420
And in that case, this is called linkage equilibrium.

106
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,180
But if they're not, they're called linkage disequilibrium.

107
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:04,610
So in this case, if especially those if two variants are close to each other,

108
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,070
there's not enough number of the combination that makes it independent enough.

109
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,230
So again, in this case, it is with linkage, equilibrium.

110
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,940
These are expected for vary if two variants are far apart, if they're in the different chromosomes, except for a few.

111
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,600
You know, if you go there are some few exceptions.

112
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,890
Those are likely to be, you know, almost independent to each other where if they are there 100 megabits away,

113
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:41,240
then it's very, very likely that there is a multiple instance of recombination happens between those two variants.

114
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:50,450
And those two variants are almost independent. But if two variants are close to each other, there's not enough time to have a recombination event.

115
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:57,920
Separate those two values and there is a to two variants that there haplotype frequencies are not

116
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,900
explained by the as an independent event of two variants in that case that there is disequilibrium.

117
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,720
Okay. So how do we quantify linkage disequilibrium?

118
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:24,760
So there's a useful statistic a d d of a B is defined as a p p haplotype frequency, so which is observed for the frequency.

119
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,479
And this quantity is the haplotype frequency expected and the linkage equilibrium.

120
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,260
So haplotype frequency observed under this linkage,

121
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:42,460
this equilibrium minus the have that frequency expected and the linkage equilibrium, this is this statistic.

122
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,749
So if there is a linkage equilibrium, these two values should be the same.

123
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,960
So the statics should be zero. Otherwise it's going to be either positive or negative.

124
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:02,590
And if you define the D this way with a simple math, you can you can just move things around and you can get this equation.

125
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:08,260
And if you use the fact that the p p of capital B is a one minus P of small B,

126
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:16,809
you can you can do some some extra calculation and you can figure out that D of A B

127
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:23,170
can also be written as a frequency of the haplotype frequency and delivery equation.

128
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:32,370
This. So feel the ABS are very easy to define but not easy to interpret.

129
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,069
The one of the reason it's a sign is arbitrary,

130
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:49,590
so it's unclear in which cases the of AB becomes plus or positive or negative because A and B can be defined in in some arbitrary way.

131
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,520
And a range of babies also depends on their frequency.

132
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:03,290
Sometimes a a of Abby. Abby the value, the possible range of those values is not always -1 to 1.

133
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:10,160
So it could be bounded by -0.1 to like positive 0.25, for example.

134
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,230
So it's an arbitrary it has an arbitrary boundary.

135
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:22,430
So it is hard to compare between the variance to make sure that the have to compare how strongly these two variants are correlated.

136
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:33,230
Okay. So this is a question that the why why the of the job a B depends on the frequency.

137
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,920
So if you if you see this in this way, it might be a little bit clearer.

138
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:48,170
So here, obviously, you know, this haplotype frequency cannot be smaller than zero.

139
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:56,570
Right. So that means that this has to be this has to be equal or greater than geneticists be in the zero and so on.

140
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:04,310
So in this case, you can see that the of AB should be less because this has to be greater than zero.

141
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,950
Right. So the of AB has to be greater than the negative value of these these value.

142
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,780
Likewise, because these value has greater than zero d of AB should be smaller than these value and so on.

143
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:28,430
Right. So that's, that's the boundary of these t d of ab values and it depends on daily frequencies of the these things.

144
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,880
Okay. So let's do some exercise.

145
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:43,410
So let's look at this deal with a b values and figure out the range of theof AP values.

146
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:51,690
So let's, let's talk about the case of of 8.3 and poppies point three in p of 8.2 and Poppy's point two.

147
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,390
Okay, so, so let's let's look at the first example.

148
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,740
The first example. You can see that.

149
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,610
You know, p so p of a b.

150
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:16,610
Of this a little. Okay. To have that frequency obviously has to be greater than zero.

151
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,410
Okay. And what is the maximum value that this haplotype can take?

152
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,000
Well, I mean, it has to have it has to have at least APL.

153
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,260
It's both of them. So they can only exist 30% in haplotype each.

154
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:42,470
So, you know, so the P of AB can have 30% in the in the population if both values are perfect, equally correlated co-occurring on all the time.

155
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:50,000
So if the capital alil always kedia always also carries keep the players and vice versa.

156
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,530
This can be as high as 30%. So then D over 80 is defined this way.

157
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:06,200
So you can. Get the pound pound boundary value due to -0.09 and positive 0.21.

158
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:16,730
With a simple, simple calculation. And if you see this 0.01, actually, this is a p p of eight times pop value.

159
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,120
So this is basically the boundary of compound of these maximum values here.

160
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,110
And 0.21 is a 0.3 times 0.7.

161
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:39,820
So this is the product of these two P of A and the possibility also that that that happens to be the bound of the upper value of t of AP.

162
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,709
How about this case? Okay. So p of a equals 20%.

163
00:20:45,710 --> 00:21:02,950
The poppy is a 10% in that case to the maximum possible frequency of the haplotype ab is 10% because a poppy is it bounded by the frequency of PLL.

164
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,890
In this case in the IPL frequencies 10% and a mean minimum batteries is 0%.

165
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,610
So D of AB is rate ranged between the -0.02 and 2.08.

166
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:25,390
If you see to two value again this -0.02 and P of a and poppy is a is a checkpoint, you two.

167
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:36,220
So this happens to be this value. In this case, 0.08 is a zero point, you know, p 0.8, which is a one -0.2 times 0.1.

168
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:45,100
So it happens to be this value. So it looks like there's a some correspondence between the possible combination,

169
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:53,650
possible multiplication of the different values and with the bound bound value of the T of AP.

170
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:01,780
So the question here is that A well, the can you directly over generate a formula for this range?

171
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:10,630
What's the range of the DOB? If you look at the equation here, you can figure it out so well.

172
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,420
The constraint is that all these for haplotype frequency has to be greater than zero.

173
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,850
So if D of a B is negative, the.

174
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:31,060
In terms of absolute value, it has to be either the bound is either this value or these value.

175
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,380
If the yield a, b is positive, the pound value is this value or disparity,

176
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:43,600
whichever actually is smaller because both of them, although the constraint has to be true.

177
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:56,110
So just moving here so you can now think about the scaling this t of AB to the possible minimum possible maximum value.

178
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:07,720
So as I said, if the of AB is less than zero that the possible the maximum bound bound value is bounded by these two possible frequencies,

179
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:16,300
if it's greater than zero, it's bounded by these two to multiplication of two to opposite levels.

180
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,980
So if you divide this possible maximum value in terms of absolute value in both of the both of the direction,

181
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:31,240
these are the prime new newly defined value will always range of between -1 to 1.

182
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:38,140
So then. So then it is more likely.

183
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,750
So this value is the nice thing is that this happens.

184
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:52,739
It is ranging between the -1 to 1 and this value will be more likely to take extreme values when they're low frequencies.

185
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,210
Small because they look frequent, small, the denominator becomes small.

186
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,200
That means that, you know, the value becomes large if you divide by that value.

187
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,930
So A if it's up, one important thing is that if it's a plus if it's a plus one or minus one,

188
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:17,640
mean that means that one of these haplotype has a frequency of zero because that's how, how, how this boundary was calculated.

189
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:25,940
So you the boundary values are determined that the all these values has to be greater than or equal or greater than zero.

190
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,810
So if the boundary hit them is the one of these haplotype frequencies that you.

191
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:42,800
So that's important part. So and sorry then it's only three or so out of four possible haplotypes, only three are observed.

192
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:52,610
And that means that there's no evidence of recombination between those two variants in a still that can explain the haplotype frequency.

193
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,829
That doesn't mean that the recombination didn't exist,

194
00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:02,430
but the haplotype frequency can explain by without assuming there's a recombination event happened between those two based.

195
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,450
So, so deprived, basically.

196
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:15,280
The nice thing is that if you have a one, one or negative one value, that means that there's no evidence of recombination between the markers.

197
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,950
Any thoughts to EL effect which is similar between them? They put the prime being very high.

198
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,880
Meaning means that those markers are very correlate each other.

199
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:31,000
The disadvantage is that the prime estimate in small samples could be hard to interpret because

200
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,780
the denominator can be a not very reliable based on the frequencies and in the variables.

201
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,660
Those estimates are often high because the denominator becomes very small and you're dividing value by the small number.

202
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:56,890
So. So then sometimes the two variants may be in linkages KG and sometimes two variants may be in the linkage disequilibrium.

203
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:03,759
So let's think about the in which cases linkage equilibrium holds in some of the

204
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,360
variants about the linkage disequilibrium holds for the four closed variants.

205
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,440
So to to detect, to distinguish.

206
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,550
So to explain whether two variants we would like to be in linguistic equilibrium or disequilibrium.

207
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:34,310
There's a lot of different factors involved. So we haven't covered these qualities in theory, but there's a how, you know,

208
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:41,610
what subpopulations history looks like is important and whether there's a random meeting between the individual happens or not.

209
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,550
So those are the basic assumptions to to make the more simplistic.

210
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:53,270
But most important factor is the distance between the markers, how far the those two variants are,

211
00:26:53,270 --> 00:27:01,060
and that that's a very key determining factor between the linkage equilibrium and the security.

212
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,200
So in this simple argument,

213
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,060
we can argue that random mating and recombination ensure that the mutations spread from the original haplotypes and make the,

214
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,680
you know, make it converge towards the linkage equilibria.

215
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,799
Okay. So, for example, let's say in some generation T,

216
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:29,240
let's say you can represent the haplotype frequency with now a live frequency that these are these statistics.

217
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:39,350
So then this is equivalent to having the previous equation, except that then now this is a represent in terms of the deal.

218
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,200
But if they happen at that frequencies. Okay.

219
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:52,880
So and are these two variants, you know, if the over 80 could be very high that that could be it could have a very strong link linkage disequilibrium.

220
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:06,170
So when so this is generation T and in the upstream let's say they do not have the that they do not have any recombination between those two variants.

221
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:15,889
Then those haplotype frequency should be the same because you know that there are the there is no recombination.

222
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:23,750
So the if the haplotypes are the connected together, if co-occurring haplotype will still still work or if they.

223
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:30,440
So all of these possible a combination haplotype will just, you know, inherited as is.

224
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,450
But if there was a recombination between those two variants,

225
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:42,050
they will become independent because there's the combinations of those to help with that breaks in a random fashion.

226
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,350
It's a random meaning. So it's a random the breaks breaks between them.

227
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,610
So those two variants will perfectly link to the equilibrium rate,

228
00:28:53,090 --> 00:29:02,240
but that the only conditional conditioning on the the assumption that the recombination happened between those two generations.

229
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,630
But we cannot insure that because recombination is a random process.

230
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,140
So. If you combine them.

231
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,400
Okay. Let's say ah is the probability that a combination happened.

232
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:24,670
Then you can just combine those two things together to model the haplotype frequency for either after one generation.

233
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:34,350
So based on the probability that the recombination happens, the haplotype frequency converges towards to the the linkage equilibrium.

234
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,749
So if you have if you have the more generation,

235
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:48,850
these this will this factor will dominate in that the these frequency will converge to the linkage equilibrium, basically.

236
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,230
So let me let me go through a little bit more of these are examples.

237
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,819
So to to explain this,

238
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:05,559
we need to explain these are in that which is a recombination rate is which is a probability of odd number of crossover between the two variants.

239
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:12,490
So one crossover or three crossover, five crossover with in that case those two chromosomes switches.

240
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:23,589
Right. So and this is also the proportion of the time to L is from the two grandparents occurring the same gametes.

241
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:37,870
So basically, you know between between these between these two haplotypes how often are those two two gametes a crossover and a create different.

242
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,990
So create create a mosaic mosaic of two potential haplotypes.

243
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,750
So and this recombination rate increases with the physical distance.

244
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,040
If they're far apart, then the probability of chance of recombination increases,

245
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,489
but the rate of increase values across the genome and we already talked about this or at the tip of the

246
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:07,090
chromosome recombination rate is higher and also the CENTROMERE recombination rate tend to be lower.

247
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:14,500
Okay. So I mean, and now let's assume that the recombination rate varies between the two markers.

248
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:21,850
Sometimes those two markers are very close. Then the combination rate is, is really, really small 0.001.

249
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,980
Sometimes the two are far apart, 100 hundred megabits apart.

250
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:32,140
And, you know, the chance of recombination in one generation could be 0.5.

251
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:44,200
Right. So the art is just a chance of recombination then if you so if you look at I so this is a probably two to too much.

252
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:51,700
So if you look at these are if these are values of 0.5, that means that that we come in the linkage.

253
00:31:51,700 --> 00:32:02,830
It is clearly the case really fast and if all is very very small value 0.01 the recombination rate.

254
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,209
Decays, but very slowly so that that's what it's showing.

255
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,490
So at this point, five recombination happens very quickly, very small.

256
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,680
That new condition still happens about the solo rate based on the number of generation.

257
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:26,360
But eventually, when you have enough number of generation, they will tend to be more independent to each other.

258
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:36,560
Okay. So the prediction is that in the larger population, this equilibrium will decay at each generation after generation this will multiply.

259
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,760
So if you have a t generation, you will turn those.

260
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,740
The statistic between the two markers will exponentially decay.

261
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:52,790
And this is on the simplistic model, random meeting and fixed the combination rate.

262
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,680
But there could be better model to allow the changing daily frequency over time.

263
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,049
So the actual the more full model will be a little more complicated.

264
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:12,379
But this will give up ideas. So in a large land omni meeting population haplotype frequency will converge to a

265
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,550
simple functional value of frequencies if the enough number of generation happen.

266
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:24,920
If the variants are close to each other, you will require a lot more generation to to to converge.

267
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,070
So and the human history, you know, basically, you know,

268
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:40,159
is has a limited number of generation to to make every pair of gene genetic variants to be linkage in equilibrium.

269
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,880
So there is some some level.

270
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,249
So if the if two variants are close enough, then there's a still linkage.

271
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:55,880
Disequilibrium demands. You know, those two variants are you know, have.

272
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,150
Those frequencies are not nearly independent.

273
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,410
So that's a that's a little bit of population genetics involved about that we didn't without

274
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,490
learning the coalition theory I think those those level of information can be covered.

275
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:24,080
Now, let's move on to the ask here. So ask is a different statistic that can be written in this way.

276
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:31,550
So know this, this is basically the square of Abby divide by these values.

277
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:42,530
Okay? And so this is the part this is also the another way to put the possible maximum values of these at these clear values.

278
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:53,780
Okay. And the this is a very identical in not just very similar identical to the way how you define a correlation

279
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:01,370
coefficient two between the two haplotypes if you include the haplotypes as you know it all in one.

280
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,160
So it's a Pearson's correlation coefficient. And are they steady asymptotically?

281
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:15,390
If you multiply the number of haplotypes there that the correlation coefficient is

282
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:21,390
expected to follow chi square distribution under under the assumption that those are two.

283
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,450
Two variants are independent. Okay.

284
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,850
So nice thing about these are squares that these are square value ranges between zero and one.

285
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,970
You know, if they become one, if those two haplotypes are perfectly correlated with each other.

286
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:43,439
So if they're a little PLL so, you know, exact segregate to each other,

287
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,590
so they provide identical information and if fit, they become zero if they're in perfect equilibrium.

288
00:35:49,920 --> 00:36:01,139
So they will become zero if the t of ad equals you get an expected value and the equilibrium is one over two and because there is some random,

289
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:10,410
this sort of AB may not be exactly zero, but if they are independent, you would expect that these these value,

290
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,320
you know, because the expected value for chi security species is one you're going to expect ask

291
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,810
expected that is one one divided by two N and if the number of if that is large enough,

292
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,360
it should be very close to zero.

293
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:35,400
So ask your equal, one implies the variant to provide exactly the same information and the frequency has to be identical.

294
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,469
So is it to make the DB prime equal one dose? Elif frequency doesn't have to be identical.

295
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:47,400
So if there's one way variants and one common variants, it's easy to make a the prime equal one, but ask equal one.

296
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,000
They have to have exactly same l frequencies.

297
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,030
They have to be perfectly correlated with each other.

298
00:36:54,450 --> 00:37:07,430
But. So Oscar is useful in the measure in the loss of efficiency when variance a is a place independent be in certain association studies.

299
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:19,530
So this is very useful metrics to figure out when you when you actually use this linkage this colloquium in association

300
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:29,550
studies to to minimize the number of variance to be tested so we can talk about this again later in the in-person lecture.

301
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,700
But basically this is the article is useful to the make the text news and to make a proxy of certain variants to be genotyping this genetic during.

302
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:48,180
So even if there's no recombination between the two variants are secure can be very small, even if frequencies are very different.

303
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,880
So. So one.

304
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:58,470
One of the main difference between the D prime and R squared is that if you have a one common variants and the one where variants that are in perfect,

305
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:08,100
perfect l.D, which means that the one two haplotype always occurs for where variants always quarrel with the common variants.

306
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,390
In the case the prime can be one ask. You can value can be very, very small.

307
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:27,180
So this is the last slide. So this is a very I think it's a very interesting example to think about the linkage disequilibrium.

308
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:38,160
So usually linkage disequilibrium, you'd expect that it it doesn't happen between the chromosome or between the body,

309
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:44,850
the variants that are far apart, but under certain circumstances, linkage.

310
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,210
This colloquium could happen if there is a some admixture and the mixed population is formed.

311
00:38:51,480 --> 00:39:00,870
So this is a good example. So the basically the situation is that there is a two variants that are perfect in in perfectly equilibrium.

312
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:05,379
So they could be in different chromosomes, for example, but they have different frequencies.

313
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:14,150
So all in one has a population P one in publishing, one between parturition two and then in 211 has a frequency.

314
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,230
Q One in population one, two, two in population two, and they're in linguistic equilibrium.

315
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:28,099
But let's assume that there is a some admixture population formed with the gamma one from the from the population one in the from friction,

316
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,200
the gamma two from the population two in this case.

317
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:39,810
These are the questions what fraction of haplotypes in the admixture population have l in one at variant one and two in variant two?

318
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,610
You can represent those frequencies using these information.

319
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:57,820
And because there is equilibrium, you can use the definition of equilibrium to provide the equation to to provide a condition to describes

320
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:04,900
what equations should hold to make sure that the linkage equilibrium also holds in in this population.

321
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,570
So there's a specific condition that needs to be needs to be met.

322
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,259
And you can solve this equation to figure out the condition, which kind of condition that that makes there.

323
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,150
The mixed population also have the linkage equilibrium to exist or not.

324
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,500
And and you can try to interpret the results.

325
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:35,260
So this is a very useful the problem to think about in covering the in-person nature.

326
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,770
But I strongly encourage you to try this problem even though this is not a part of the problem.

327
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:49,540
I think this is a word solving. You know, before the lecture and I will cover in the in-person lecture.

328
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:59,840
So that's all for today. And let's. You know, talk more in the in-person lecture we did some hands on use impulse buy.
