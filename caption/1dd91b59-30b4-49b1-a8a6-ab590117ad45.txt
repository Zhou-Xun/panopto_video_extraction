1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,160
oh like reality movies or

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,100
something I don't know own a great point. yeah

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:33,740
they were younger years left the making the great and wonderful

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,140
you know

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,300
we

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:53,180
to go by nicer because we were like going connected.

7
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:01,241
yeah yeah.

8
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:06,341
yeah I

9
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:13,301
think

10
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:29,261
you're right yeah

11
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:42,901
weird.

12
00:01:42,901 --> 00:02:21,520
nice

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:43,180
I guess

14
00:02:43,180 --> 00:03:09,941
very

15
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:34,661
I didn't

16
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:43,501
you know that we can negotiate like

17
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:48,641
their new card. right now everyone is never leaving. yes

18
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:53,841
exactly a chance. yeah how do you feel about the microphone. yeah I

19
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:59,101
only I'm like loud. um but if there's anything accessibility of finding

20
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:04,161
like new. yeah I think it's just a matter. that's totally fine. I recently

21
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:09,563
read an article that it is. I hope you know

22
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:22,463
have changed

23
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:28,863
him and my

24
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:34,943
insurance I'm coming along yes. if you can you know

25
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:40,463
I'll try to be quick I was in. hello. well dad unless

26
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:45,803
I did to him. our some of

27
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:51,063
and we are very lucky today because we have um

28
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:56,083
not just a faculty member from the school and our department but

29
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:01,483
also graduate of the place. so it's a real treat for us to

30
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:06,743
see where our graduate and so today we have Doctor Sarah

31
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:11,841
Reeves who is um an assistant professor in pediatrics and

32
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:17,381
also in epidemiology. she's also the associate director at

33
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:22,501
he the pediatric health services fellowship so she is knows

34
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:27,661
a spanning a lot of different areas aren she also

35
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:33,081
has a pay award um which is a great prestigious accomplishment

36
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:38,141
and um it's related to understanding sickle cell

37
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:43,221
disease which is which she will be talking about today snowy please look

38
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:48,361
at fact the. hi everybody Chris this is Rick okay can you hear

39
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:53,921
me. actually maybe my first time wearing and I'm like specific fighting. mom

40
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:59,461
I just wanna ask how many of you are students or trainees.

41
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:04,639
okay. that's awesome. I'm really excited to hear that as

42
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,799
eighty. 's my primary appointment as a faculty member is in the department of pediatrics and

43
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:14,879
one oh there's not a lot of us that are huge fees not and movies and so having

44
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,539
that joint appointment here in Maine in the medical school is a really unique and interesting opportunity

45
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:25,599
where we can bring any logic message to really start to challenge for more clinical

46
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,699
paradigms and ecologically logically rigorous ways and so I think think about

47
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:35,859
where you're going with your careers. I hope that that will make some sense because it's a really

48
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:41,037
interesting experience and um I watch is give a shameless plug I'm core

49
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:46,077
faculty and the Susan B meister child health evaluation and research center the cheer center. that's

50
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:51,737
gonna get me here is in. alright so they're easy and faculty investigators

51
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:56,797
across many different sub specialties in pediatrics that are in that your center and you know

52
00:06:56,797 --> 00:07:01,857
we've got a lot of I mean in purity publications but sort of every center right what I really wanna highlight are

53
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:06,857
these eighty three active research studies. the is involved a whole lot of training

54
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:11,917
is we have trainees and students from pretty much every level in every school and college

55
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:16,977
across the university. and so if any of this is interesting to you if you've any interested in child

56
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:21,997
health at all. please let me know and we can see if there's some research project or something that

57
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:26,997
might be of interest for collaboration. there are three objectives

58
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:32,177
that I hope that you get after the stalk the first is getting a flood better understanding of sickle cell anemia and the role

59
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:37,504
of preventive services and then um the other two main objectives are about

60
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:42,544
quality measurement and then using those quality measurement identify opportunities for improvement in

61
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:47,844
the care forget the sickle cell sickle cell disease is a rare

62
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:53,084
inherited disorder. predominantly affect minority populations in the United States. second

63
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:58,224
one about one in three hundred fifty five after American verse. I'm very specifically saying in

64
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:03,304
the US. this number looks a lot different across the world for this presentation I'm

65
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:08,684
just really talking about the domestic population of those the sickle cell. there is

66
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:13,864
some detection and umbrella term that covers a lot of different subtypes. there's like forty

67
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:19,004
actually there some type being added all the time so last time I checked there were about forty subtypes and

68
00:08:19,004 --> 00:08:24,124
um some of those hemoglobin which is look each beat is that hemoglobin

69
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:29,144
asking hemoglobin they do tell see me a huge BSE there's there's a lot of them and the two

70
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:34,178
that I waited here. if yes that's convenient for yourself Kenya make up a subtype that

71
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:39,238
is referred to the sickle cell anemia and sickle cell anemia is the most severe subtype

72
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:44,318
of sickle cell income for the most morbidity so going forward for the rest of the talk really only going to be

73
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:49,758
talking about facility now we know

74
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:54,898
everyone that is born with sickle cell anemia and we know that because sickle cell and had you the condition

75
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:59,978
on the newborn screening panel. so newborn screening is done across all fifty

76
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:05,298
states and I screens every newborn baby for a variety of different genetic

77
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:10,658
disorders and it's it's a long process and how those genetic disorders are picked but you know overarching

78
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:16,298
principle is that it includes diseases or conditions that early identification

79
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:21,578
can actually save lives and sickle cell is one of those. so this means that we know everyone

80
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:27,258
was sickle cell anemia. that is born in every state.

81
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:32,518
's this schematic trying is obviously safe

82
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:37,562
but hey red blood cells and blood vessels of someone that does not have sickle

83
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:42,902
cell. you can see that the red blood red blood cells. um

84
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:48,162
they're pretty flexible it's kind of like doughnuts and they moved through the vessels pretty smoothly.

85
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:53,482
letting people that have to go that hemoglobin pharmacies trans

86
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:58,982
or the rice that actually misses sheets he um red blood cells

87
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:04,442
and that comes in the form it's and really not flexible and crescent shape and that

88
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:09,802
that she does not move smoothly through the blood vessels. so they get called something

89
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:14,982
and there's blockages and really back in in underlining for simply but the underlying

90
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:20,302
principle of sickle cell and why there are so many problems associated with sickle cell. because

91
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:25,542
like blood affects every single aspect of her body right so sickle cell is since it's a blood

92
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,722
disease affects every single organ system in the body. I'm gonna talk about just a few

93
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:35,828
of these morbidity and this is going to be specific to children because I'm assuming pediatrics.

94
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:41,128
so until there was a good solid and maybe I have a very high risk of stroke it's actually three hundred times the risk

95
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:46,168
for the child was normal hemoglobin. ten percent of the kids the sickle cell have a stroke

96
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:51,288
before they're eighteen minutes and without intervention. so this meeting is like I

97
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:56,628
I really like the pot here and remind people that we are not talking about seven year or eighty year old having strokes.

98
00:10:56,628 --> 00:11:01,728
we're talking about seven and eight -year-olds that have stroke and if they survive and have this morbidity from

99
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:07,708
strokes to follow them for the rest of their lives. we don't often hear about kids having strokes

100
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,948
another morbidity to if you're paying crazies on this is actually the most common and debilitating

101
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:17,948
problem and sickle cell that continues to get worse with age. these result in at least half of the

102
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:23,088
kids over half the kids at least one hospitalization for pain crisis a year. this increases

103
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:28,108
again with age associate with reduced quality of life as I'm sure you can imagine school absence

104
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:33,168
it is just a lot really um hard circumstances. there's also a high

105
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:38,268
risk of serious infection children have about a hundred times the risk of a serious infection compared to a kid has

106
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:43,828
normal hemoglobin and we're gonna talk a lot more about that believe that for now and then there

107
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:49,008
I mean it's hard to give and choose which ones to list also key the steps in the back

108
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:54,208
in the process. if you read a failure. again it's a blood disease.

109
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:59,328
this is I'm sure you can imagine results a in block of health care utilization rate there. so

110
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:05,048
I'm gonna just briefly talk to you this is the whole body of literature also. but the top is um

111
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:10,088
more like in on if you can ourselves more outpatient visit stuff and the bottom is if

112
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:15,228
you care. so I was the agent needs to things

113
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:20,348
at the top it's about average average twenty outpatient visits a year

114
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:25,368
for these kids and dad is for laboratory visit and then you

115
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:31,016
know there's your regular outpatient visit so well child your physical things like that. you got a sore throat

116
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:36,056
and then there's also him at oldest appointment so he would tell just for the primary some specialist to take care of kids with sickle

117
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:42,576
cell. some of the scare but not all of it occurred than the sickle cell center which is

118
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:47,896
in essence a multidisciplinary clinics that provide care for kids with sickle cell.

119
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:53,156
so I mean there's very obvious the controversy about health available primary care providers are.

120
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:58,196
but then when you start thinking about the colleges and sickle cell center. there's

121
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:03,216
any kids that would really far away from I and think so where are you starting to see some problems that might occur with

122
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:08,456
access to some specialty care and in the bottle we have acute health care utilization

123
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:14,356
emergency department visits about three per year for kids and about two inpatient hospitalizations

124
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:19,676
you know there are some kids that have a hundred ED visits a year. so these are just on average. so

125
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:24,756
a lot of health care utilization. I hope that in in thinking about sickle cell

126
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:30,636
that you can see that this is going to be a challenge to manage for any child or family that's affected

127
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:35,936
but it's even more challenging when you intersects sickle cell with social

128
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:41,136
determinants of health. so in general families that are affected bicycles all are of lower income.

129
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:46,156
have Lor health literacy and lower levels of education as compared to families do not

130
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:51,696
have a child sickle with cell. so when you really start to intersect those two worlds. again

131
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:56,736
you can see why this is just a really big challenge. I do want

132
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:01,836
to say though I I feel like it so I'd like to talk about sickle cell is really bad

133
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:07,216
and really hard. um these families have are having

134
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:12,623
to deal with systems institutional racism

135
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:17,923
that face our country that are deep rooted in and challenging and these

136
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:23,043
families and and children are resilient and has

137
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:28,063
many strategies in which to overcome and mitigate this and I I'm personally

138
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:33,483
really inspired by a licensed commitment of these families and children to overcome

139
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:38,643
many challenges are out of their control. so that's that's kinda what I want to say bicycle tell him what you need

140
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:43,683
to know for the rest of the talk about six oh. now we're going to talk about the

141
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:48,823
inspection. so like again children with sickle cell have a high risk series infection about a hundred times that

142
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:53,843
was normal hemoglobin but much of this risk can be mitigated just wanna this infection

143
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:59,223
can actually be prevented. this is day. okay.

144
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:04,243
it's a penicillin process Alexis and sickle cell. trying. it

145
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:09,565
is a multi center double blind we'll see both Jeffrey

146
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:14,945
and my control trial having all the things and a hundred two hundred and fifteen

147
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:20,205
kids with sickle cell anemia. we're randomized to either receive twenty feeling penicillin

148
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:25,265
or twice daily placebo which was vitamin C as you can see and

149
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:30,265
hear the killer the probability of infection over here. really increased for each of them to see

150
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:35,305
well he really did not so and actually this corresponds with eighty four percent reduction

151
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:40,345
in inspection. this trial was stopped at eight months early given very successful

152
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:45,445
results and also given the fact that you know we're talking about real kids and real infections

153
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:50,925
three kids in the placebo digest with in this time frame. so this is trial was stopped

154
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:55,985
early and then um this is something I mean talk about numerous times going for

155
00:15:55,985 --> 00:16:01,005
him and this is publish the travel all that I think in eighty five. this is published in nineteen eighty

156
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:06,085
six. so we haven't known that kind of some for selected of the fact of the reducing chances of

157
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:11,185
infection kids the sickle cell for her thirty years. I felt over thirty years

158
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:16,205
a long time given the importance of health services and

159
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:21,465
preventive care there's other effective preventive care I haven't discussed here. the national heart lung and blood institute

160
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:26,465
release national recommendations for the care for kids and adults sickle cell the red cover those

161
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:31,585
are release in two thousand two and then the updated version of the twenty fourteen and these spell

162
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:36,805
out icon of different interventions and best practices that are either

163
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:42,565
evidence based or revote vote and I committee for the care of these children and adults

164
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:47,825
you that um obviously includes penicillin prophylactic so there's a strong recommendation

165
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:52,885
is for certificate sex with the first recommendation in both guidelines that all children with

166
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:58,225
sickle cell anemia from first to five. should be receiving daily in a fact reflects message system

167
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:03,465
recommendation. so we're epidemiologists right. we want to know is

168
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:09,025
that really happening. what proportion of children with sickle cell anemia. do you actually receive

169
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:14,599
in a bag that they should protect against infection um

170
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,719
it sounds like it should be an easy question right but it was it a bunch

171
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:25,099
of people thought that kids were getting their necessary and if I text and a bunch of people thought that they weren't

172
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:31,159
and I like this because the sake me laugh every time because I just didn't have great cases

173
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:36,179
um and so this is really

174
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,279
representative of what goes on in clinical care in general and this is part

175
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,439
at the genealogy clinical care start to intersect because if

176
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:51,759
you ask us if you ask a doctor.

177
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,759
if their patient population is up to if their patient population up to date on vaccinations.

178
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,159
they're going to say yes. all the kids in my practice are to up date on vaccinations. great.

179
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:08,439
then you start to measure things right and user defined some cats people

180
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:14,171
aren't up to date as people perceive there isn't a hundred percent compliance right.

181
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:19,491
so that's the first part when you measure it you start to find out things you didn't know before and the second part

182
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:24,551
is that things get better when you start to measure it should see did you start to fade. I know you think the

183
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:30,131
hundred percent really at sixty percent of panic right people. I have to make this a better.

184
00:18:30,131 --> 00:18:35,191
so this pattern is well established and many things vaccination asthma

185
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:40,651
control and it's also true in sickle cell and this is the where quality

186
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:46,091
measures come in. so real pilots and this is like the learning module. I am in quality measurement

187
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:51,311
quality measures assess structures or processes of care outcomes that are associated

188
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:56,431
with high quality. these are two examples of quality measures right here.

189
00:18:56,431 --> 00:19:01,511
what proportion of patients are we it is within fourteen in the heart attack and also what proportion

190
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:06,791
of patients receive the follow up from the office regarding the results of the blood. these are both quality

191
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:11,811
measures that one the quality measure is good. so for one it would be a real lower rate and when it

192
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:17,029
would be higher rate there high name associated with better outcomes either essential steps

193
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:22,089
in the process for better outcomes and these outcomes are many things they can be related to mortality. they can

194
00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:27,269
be related to patient experience it can be related to cost. that's a big

195
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:34,389
one too. so these quality measures are essential steps related to better outcomes.

196
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:39,449
there are thousands of quality measures for their mind even be. I can't I actually not

197
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:44,829
even sure there's a lot um and so there needs to be some sort of structure

198
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:50,093
on what makes a good quality measure and there's three main categories

199
00:19:50,093 --> 00:19:55,153
that really evaluate as a quality measure is a good measure the first one is that

200
00:19:55,153 --> 00:20:00,393
is important measure so measuring this actually matters. this is actually going to make a difference

201
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:05,433
if you do the thing is gonna make a difference now. the second quality

202
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:10,613
of the call the matter is that it is scientifically sound. this is like happy right

203
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:15,753
we love this part we love seems to be scientifically accurate. is it valid level when I started to call

204
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:22,093
the much out of the Quicken versus epidemiology. - this isn't necessarily how things are thought about clinical care

205
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:27,233
and finally it's feasible is for gonna check with us a lot too. you can capture the data without undue after it doesn't

206
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:34,013
take hours per patient to understand if they are meeting or not meeting these quality measures.

207
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:39,393
this is another way to look at this I could not do avid top and having to make him so this is my survey.

208
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:44,653
um if on I don't have in France from low to high this is the measuring really matter and the side

209
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:49,733
feasibility from to high so when you have the measure that's not very important and not very easy

210
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:54,954
to do. don't even bother measuring the square square don't even bother not worth it when

211
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:59,974
it's really important but really hard to do. you might wanna think about it what

212
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:05,074
you're gonna you're gonna really have to think about it and hard it might be a more future direction and that's also where you can

213
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:10,294
think about that it's really easy matter but maybe not happen French maybe this is an intermediate step in the process

214
00:21:10,294 --> 00:21:15,354
can I be thought about this really takes about three here. wrong location for me.

215
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:20,814
it's a really important measure and it's really easy to do so when you get right there you like this

216
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:25,974
talk about this is gonna be a good call to measure. but across all of that. we need to be valid because even

217
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:30,994
as important and feasible. it's not accurate. who cares. so I just telling her attorney thing about which of

218
00:21:30,994 --> 00:21:36,594
the three qualities is most important. I don't know. so we're just gonna say all three are important and

219
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:41,954
there are so many quality measures that there is actually national regulation on quality measurement

220
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:46,954
and what makes a good quality measurement and that calling measure and that's the national calling for in the national

221
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:52,094
quality forum is a national regular trade body that provides the gold standard endorsement for quality

222
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:57,346
measurement when measuring and if you have to endorse it means it went through a very rigorous testing

223
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:02,406
process and assess the importance accuracy and feasibility and also

224
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:07,486
it's important that measures and Q endorsed because payers such as centers for Medicaid and Medicare

225
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:12,586
CMS preferred to use and to endorse measures because they know all the leg work is

226
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:19,386
arty done these measures are important and valid for fees whatever. so that

227
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:24,746
kind of. yeah that's pretty much about quality measurement of the whole number gonna talk about quality measurement

228
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:29,786
and pediatrics there's there were almost no quality measures for children and there's a lot of

229
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:34,986
reason for that. first off the kids there's a time for adults and kids are pretty healthy

230
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:40,166
in general. also that key stab of time processes to outcomes

231
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:45,226
isn't so easy and kids some of these things are decades and decades away and so

232
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:50,686
it's it's hard to get measures that really meet that importance criteria.

233
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:55,842
I mean they seem commonsense importance but they aren't necessarily linked directly I actually

234
00:22:55,842 --> 00:23:01,402
took an act of congress to the game on pediatric quality measures.

235
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:06,402
this is taxed from the chip robbery authorization act in two thousand nine. actually

236
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:11,782
it's been appropriated funds for developing validating passing the portfolio pediatric

237
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:16,782
quality measures. the agency for healthcare research and

238
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:21,922
quality a check you into this money and created up

239
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:27,062
pediatric quality measures program. for peak you P P John Pete.

240
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:32,322
in the certain two thousand eleven. created seven centers of excellence across

241
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:37,762
the country and these seven centers of excellence for tasked with

242
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:42,962
I mean really doing with us at developing validating and testing a portfolio of pediatric all the measures

243
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:47,982
seven centers were assigned. I don't know maybe five

244
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:53,042
to ten different topics in which she needed to think about these quality measurements for

245
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:58,338
them if I know that's because you have the center of excellence for the peak of users of excellence and we were assigned sickle

246
00:23:58,338 --> 00:24:03,558
cell as a topic for development for measuring about testing and this is because of what

247
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:08,618
a couple things are so there are no quality measures for sickle cell at all in children and adults also there is

248
00:24:08,618 --> 00:24:13,658
an underlying on the rest of our work is getting good quality of care or not some people so

249
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:18,658
they and work people weren't so they weren't. so we were tasked to developing a quality measure. it was important

250
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:23,798
scientifically accurate and feasible to implement. obviously the same criteria been talking about

251
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:28,918
Frank F endorsement. we met with a lot of stakeholders in developed a lot of

252
00:24:28,918 --> 00:24:34,018
measures and the question that really bubbled up to the top is the most important was the

253
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:39,258
same thing we but wondering what proportion of children with sickle cell anemia receive recommended in had asked to protect against

254
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:44,458
infection. but how do we answer that. now 's we know you know when you call measure

255
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:49,458
for that but how do we actually do it. it's it's difficult to identify kids the sickle

256
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:54,518
cell and find them for a lot for a lot of reasons are rare disease. you can't just

257
00:24:54,518 --> 00:24:59,630
go to the University of Michigan you you're not gonna have a big population there's no registry or cold

258
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:05,330
Court this is in contrast to some other chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis or a lesser

259
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:10,510
lube is there are some registries and cohorts newborn screening doesn't impact

260
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:16,430
every case at first but there's no long-term follow-up there so once we know that they have sickle cell but

261
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,670
you know and there is some follow for the first year of life in some states and also the follow. across states there's a lot of

262
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,710
fragmented care and if kids are living far away from a sickle cell center. the e-mail

263
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,810
field and have city there's not a sickle cell center there so there may be going to emergency part center city or or other

264
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:37,210
places and so again there's really no real place we can call and also there's no accredited

265
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,490
center so I know I talked about sickle cell center. even not accredited

266
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,930
and this is a bigger conversation for a different time but cystic fibrosis is an example of

267
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:52,930
disease in which it is federally mandated for the centers to provide specific

268
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,950
criteria for care and if they don't they do not receive federal funding and the centers are credited and

269
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,048
sickle for this not have the sellers so it was really hard to figure out what we were going to do. we

270
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:08,188
needed a way to identify large populations with the phoneme yes we decided to use a ministry to clean

271
00:26:08,188 --> 00:26:13,568
up the again and talk a lot about ministries claims administrative claims are

272
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:18,688
some databases that have information regarding financial transactions

273
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:24,008
that happen between payers insurance companies and facilities and providers.

274
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:29,284
's they have the soon that they contain the people that are enrolled in their insurance plans what

275
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:34,304
they contain are the health services that all those people use any time that

276
00:26:34,304 --> 00:26:39,664
you interact with the health system that requires a financial transaction. this is why

277
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:45,084
that's included concluded. so that's the who what and the why of the ministry it claims

278
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:50,324
two caveats to ministry the claims our transactions financial transactions are not electronic

279
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:55,444
medical record. so they cannot be used to guide clinical care or make clinical decisions there's also

280
00:26:55,444 --> 00:27:00,684
a big lag time so really they're not useful for the actual treatment of the patient

281
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:05,724
while they're in the doctor 's office. we can use them

282
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:10,744
for research really do a lot. I use them a lot a lot but it requires some thoughts

283
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:16,484
on why we use and and how we use them because we are reading purpose seen them they're not for research.

284
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:21,524
you can use claims really well to figure out what happened. procedure codes or CPT

285
00:27:21,524 --> 00:27:26,884
codes can say you had an ultrasound for example in

286
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:32,451
if you had a medication still you know you picked up Tamiflu or whatever from

287
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:37,771
the pharmacy because there was a transaction that happened due to those actions.

288
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:42,891
also tell you why it happens which is the diagnosis code to try thirty nine and nineteen

289
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:47,891
ten diagnosis codes. so that says okay you had an ultrasound because you were pregnant or something like

290
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:52,911
that that's the why of the what and then also it can it can tell you where did you

291
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:58,491
receive your care and if you should basis emergency department. outpatient durable medical equipment different things like that.

292
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:03,971
it can not tell you anything that did not require a financial transaction. so medication prescribed

293
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:09,331
doesn't matter unless still right so you don't actually know what's going on with prescribed medication. seem a test ordered

294
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:14,431
test results he don't require financial transactions or anything that was not billed individually such as managed

295
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:19,571
care. I like this really came home team it's I mean I kinda thing

296
00:28:19,571 --> 00:28:24,811
your is claim since you said so I think examples are really helpful. so they could tell you

297
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:29,951
the dates that I wouldn't mind even. I left me out because I realize

298
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:35,511
um the in present the emergency department at University Michigan due to my dream that my green or the my diagnosis

299
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:40,571
my ID code okay. what it can't tell me is that I left because

300
00:28:40,571 --> 00:28:45,771
I had to his presentation still and also I was prescribed the medication but I didn't

301
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:50,831
need it I didn't take it I didn't still it's no transaction. so when you think about asking research

302
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:57,511
questions using a minister to claims you and I think really carefully about what you're using them for an twenties. 's

303
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:02,671
Mister Clifton catch large population sound familiar to what were trying to do and also they're highly scalable.

304
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:08,451
if I have it. I can apply the same code the same methodology to this room test age the

305
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:15,051
to entire state tour in her country I mean computing power matters but really probably scalable approach.

306
00:29:15,051 --> 00:29:20,391
so now that you know about quality measures and and Mister claims us go back to your question.

307
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:25,651
we develop the quality measures and answer this question and a quality measure we do walk through each pieces of

308
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:30,887
this quality measure is the number of children with three hundred days of dispensing about it in the measurement here over

309
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:36,007
the number of children with sickle cell anemia digit zero to five. when you divide into two numbers by each other. I mean you

310
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:42,727
get the percent damages your question what proportion children receive them in in any about.

311
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:47,907
now are gonna go through these pieces. the number of children with three hundred days. all know there's not

312
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:53,047
three hundred days and here there's three hundred sixty five point two five. but this

313
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:58,167
was a way that we can say okay you're getting nothing about it the cover about eighty

314
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:03,427
percent of the year so is pretty good. it's not great really good pretty good. we didn't want to do is absolutely

315
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:08,807
reasonable bar after him and fifty five days but we wanted to really get it kids that we're getting nothing

316
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:13,947
about to I really be covered. sec can't wear it is dispensed. so

317
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:19,207
this could be your hands the reason ministry just claims because these are actually

318
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:24,747
the prescriptions that were picked up from the pharmacy or or wherever they were picking them up from.

319
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:29,847
this is better than prescribed right because last kids are gonna actually pick them up last the families are gonna pick them up

320
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:34,997
and we're who actually prescribed and then the last one is the number of children

321
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:40,177
with sickle phoning in ages zero to five. this is concord concordance with any chili I guidelines it's exactly

322
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:45,257
the same as what their recommendations are which is important for calling measurements.

323
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:50,557
so you know that we know who has sickle cell anemia because of newborn screening but that's really where it stops

324
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:55,757
most kids. it's not I would want to really only the parents actually have the information it's not

325
00:30:55,757 --> 00:31:00,897
really any central location and you might not even have a newborn screening result available

326
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:05,977
if you moved in from another state any state programs can't provide this information 's we really didn't

327
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:11,257
know. so we wanted to develop test and validate performance. I city claims

328
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:16,337
based definition so we wanted to be able to figure out how we could identify kids to six on the who really well

329
00:31:16,337 --> 00:31:21,857
in the ministry of claims. we did this because people said this could not be done. and

330
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:27,077
we only hope you'll say that so we try to figure out a way to do it. I mean to go through each step of our study

331
00:31:27,077 --> 00:31:32,257
design. so the first thing that we did is we build potential claims base definitions

332
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:37,375
that we could use for sickle cell we did this using ICT ten diagnosis codes.

333
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:42,655
so there's four dying and there's actually lots Paris diagnosis codes are specific to to go following

334
00:31:42,655 --> 00:31:47,775
it is I mean the wind crisis because the key checks in things moving in the clinic sequestration.

335
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:53,875
there's there's a weird color would be fifty seven one and we were really annoyed when I saw the code because

336
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:58,895
there not actually a sickle cell anemia without crisis and so

337
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:04,035
but this isn't specific to the subject and only preventive care recommendation of specific physical funding and

338
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:09,215
so we couldn't get sick of of the these in the hall. we need to get the sixty percent of the flood he's a hold at

339
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:14,215
six twenty. we don't really know what to do with this. so we kept

340
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:19,615
we develop twenty three different case definitions on this.

341
00:32:19,615 --> 00:32:24,815
there's seven different categories in each category has three to five definitions within it.

342
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:30,315
um. our first definition categories suggested how related claims and we shops

343
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:35,461
those three ones that were shot specific physical something

344
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:40,821
and then we got and we're sitting and I said okay these are six twenty nearly an emergency department visits inpatient

345
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:46,741
hospitalization outpatient visit separated my specific days and a lot of this is just like a

346
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:52,001
tradition like what's done in health services research this is pretty consistent with how definitions

347
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:57,181
are thought of and then he did some other ones where we really and that nonspecific

348
00:32:57,181 --> 00:33:02,381
to go for the season we actually thought this is something we thought this is going to be a really silly addition but

349
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:07,813
people were asking who said fine we'll throw them in there then we identify a population

350
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:13,053
to test the definition I know I said that there's not numerous fears skill but in Michigan we actually do have

351
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:18,153
time. our Michigan department of Health and Human Services dot capacity is really amazing we are one of the very few

352
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:23,173
states that can link a newborn screening records to medicate records through birth certificates and

353
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:28,213
we've been doing this for the past. I mean they've been if for want to but we really didn't you know especially for the past decade or so

354
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:34,573
as we have every single kid that was born with sickle cell anemia from nineteen eighty seven.

355
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:39,833
we then of so we linked the Medicaid and new screen because newborn screening is the absolute gold standard

356
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:45,193
of who has sickle cell anemia right. we exclude anyone that had an unknown or inconclusive result to really

357
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:50,793
make sure that will like dream cases Matthew where you have all moved your own 's classification

358
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:57,673
right. it was really exciting. I mean exciting for us happy goes.

359
00:33:57,673 --> 00:34:03,113
then we've had to the accuracy the definition so we took each of those twenty three claims base definitions and I showed you previously

360
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:08,230
I'm compared it to the gold standard of newborn screening you go over those results with you.

361
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,290
this is a receiver operating characteristic are secret and I'm if I'm one might

362
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:18,290
affect the businesses and that sensitivity on the other side again so when you

363
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,370
want to get a definition that is really specific and really since

364
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:28,630
making up here. you're gonna really like. so

365
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:33,690
these are our results using the Michigan Medicaid data. it's twenty three got and points

366
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,790
label them really any receive label them. I'm just gonna go through three of these

367
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:44,370
the slowest one is three sickle cell anemia related allocations in the seventies apart. so I think sense

368
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,470
right. this is very specific. we were able to get all like all the kids we got definitely had to confirm

369
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:54,470
with the man but it was not very positive we at missed on skit a. we have these kinda

370
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,530
middle ones with premiums and were fees ones that were

371
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,890
so specific and I don't to me but we still are missing a lot of kids. our winner

372
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,986
was at least one outpatient visit they had one of the sickle cell anemia code or this

373
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:16,466
is the seven one that we were never gonna include in any case definitions we were really let me include it.

374
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:21,546
so that was a winner in Michigan both the sensitivity and specificity were over ninety percent which

375
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:27,946
is really really good for claims base case definitions but that's just Michigan.

376
00:35:27,946 --> 00:35:33,086
if you seen one state Medicaid programs in one states Medicaid program so we wanted to do this in another state to

377
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:38,266
us we partnered with New York state Medicaid and we did the exact they well did the exact same thing they tied

378
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:43,306
your newborn screening records to medicate and then they compared the

379
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:48,906
cave the twenty three case definitions we gave them all the specifications and compared to their newborn screening records.

380
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:54,026
so here's the Michigan results then I got a just also so I was so nervous

381
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:59,406
right I did not know what was gonna happen where they're gonna have totally different results and on so we're we totally off base happy program

382
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:04,892
the whole thing wrong right we have these fears on using everything all want

383
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:10,332
the rain every single definition live exactly the same in New York state as it was in Michigan

384
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:15,372
their fifties or a little lower for. we know why they were lower and

385
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:20,412
explainable why they were lower but um we were really thrilled. put it

386
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:25,532
that way and so in both New York state Medicaid machine in Medicaid program. 's

387
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:30,552
uh um he's definition at least one else he chooses it was involving your ninety fifty

388
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:35,692
seven one with the winning definition so that's how we do this now. our conclusion from

389
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:40,712
that was that kids the sickle cell can be identified using ministry of claims a quite a high level of accuracy neck

390
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:45,732
when they're not human screening results available which is the majority of the time and there's a case insurance to talk

391
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:50,772
about this these five or slightly unsatisfying to put together because it's like six

392
00:36:50,772 --> 00:36:56,172
years of work. so if you thought this is really exciting.

393
00:36:56,172 --> 00:37:01,192
you can this just cancel those two weeks ago and he turning said then we'd actually um misusing the

394
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:06,446
time code so finally

395
00:37:06,446 --> 00:37:11,606
we have a calling measure right I'd like shown you guys all the things we're gonna do actually do this is it amazing how much work went

396
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:16,746
into this like really simple calculation but actually we don't know so we didn't know right what

397
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:21,886
was dispensing about it but also said wait what in about three actually gonna include

398
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:27,286
him also over and all this and and I don't really need to gonna serve there were some political

399
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:33,186
considerations it. again people don't really think we could do this or should be doing this. so we had to be so

400
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:38,546
careful. we knew everything that is going to be scrutinized so this is another reason that we were so

401
00:37:38,546 --> 00:37:44,066
transparent and careful and what we did. so that any chill the recommendation talk about penicillin is get you received some

402
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:49,426
proof. but I was partnering with an infectious disease doctor and she said what

403
00:37:49,426 --> 00:37:54,546
about the kids are allergic dependence on the Medicare return my thing I said okay great. -

404
00:37:54,546 --> 00:37:59,606
and use it on hold on what about Marcus Allen. and. okay. I have three and a half real signs

405
00:37:59,606 --> 00:38:04,620
now and now that I've had to give me a kiss antibiotics and wonderful how give me my cell and it's like

406
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,640
smells better taste better looks better right so you'd rather have a kid actually

407
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,240
take the anime attics then not get any it also a lot of providers will prescribe maxim.

408
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,240
we didn't know what to include so we decided to test it. this is the way that we tested it

409
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,340
we use for different definitions of anime text penicillin penicillin or through my thing that's one of

410
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,860
them I said in my phone and then this one. it's any antibiotic that could potentially be protective

411
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:35,920
against your properties. these are just the proportion of kids they had

412
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,960
at least three hundred days in the years in the bottom. I mean up to the scrap a lot more about the point that I want

413
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,100
you to get from this is what happened when we looked at our different about definitions. this is

414
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,280
a definition. this is the reason we just use penicillin. this is the rates when we added over through

415
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,340
my sense to really no matter. and then we got a little bit of a bump when we thought about using

416
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,360
access online also and then um I'm kind of big bombs using all you

417
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,538
know that would protect but we felt that using calling about it's protected in our numerator which is way a

418
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:11,838
to permit. we really I mean the point of prescribed penicillin is to be per good

419
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:17,118
for the infection and so we didn't want to allow in about if that were that broad spectrum to be included

420
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:22,238
so what we decided for final definition was the number two there was three and days of dispensing about expense on with

421
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:27,318
your my for my and the measurement here over the number to the six something and I promise that is the last validation we did

422
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:32,438
for this somehow let's use the master. we applied

423
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:37,458
it to many different data sets to understand actually what what the answer was

424
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:42,534
to this question. the first dataset that we use with the national Medicaid dataset

425
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:47,774
from six states and use we that data from two thousand five to twenty twelve the reason we did not use any more

426
00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:52,834
recent data is because it did not exist like it just got released last week somewhere recent data and

427
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:58,194
it's like twenty fifty thousand dollars so we're not anytime soon. but um the national Medicaid data it's really delayed.

428
00:39:58,194 --> 00:40:03,554
so we needed to go directly to get more recent data to the state specific Medicaid datasets

429
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:08,574
and we did that in Michigan state in New York state you maybe wondering why I'm doing this

430
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:13,714
and Medicaid. ninety percent of kids sickle cell anemia are enrolled in Medicaid at some point in time.

431
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:19,534
so although there's not a complete population capture. it's really the majority of kids.

432
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:24,794
so here the results from our measure this is the proportion of kids with sickle cell anemia that received at least three hundred days

433
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:30,154
through the proportion over here and years from two thousand five or twenty twelve. across

434
00:40:30,154 --> 00:40:35,614
the bottom it and when I believe you know there's been some kind of Texas.

435
00:40:35,614 --> 00:40:40,743
um we were really sad to see this is really what is

436
00:40:40,743 --> 00:40:45,743
frustrating um. there are no improvement over time no state is doing

437
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:50,844
well and at the end of the day. twenty percent of kids are getting

438
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:55,924
in like sitting in Nevada. so we hoped that it would get better when we lived

439
00:40:55,924 --> 00:41:01,283
in more recent data. but again is it not in fact there's some evidence that there may be decreasing

440
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:06,323
rates. this is in Michigan and New York and the overall I'm in again twenty from

441
00:41:06,323 --> 00:41:12,023
eleven to twenty eighteen. so there's been no change.

442
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:17,483
and this is the sad conclusion it's a conclusion that but like the sad point

443
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:22,664
of this is that despite of evidence and recognition this nineteen eighty six landmark

444
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:28,443
study jeweler was the seller not receiving an addict that they need to protect against infection.

445
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:33,624
this is just not acceptable. this is where we start to think

446
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:38,630
about. okay what do we do about it and you can have a measure

447
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:44,690
but if you don't use it to drive change and identify opportunity for improvement. it's completely pointless.

448
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,729
so our you know that we are ready have because I talked about it for less our

449
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:55,050
very high quality calling measure it's really important these kids get there attics. this is a very valid

450
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,250
measure we know that when we save this proportion it's true it's also feasible use the minister to claims

451
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:05,290
it's very scalable very easy to them play honestly does not take much time to even program us and when you have access

452
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:10,830
to the data. so we went and got this measure and cue off endorsed.

453
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:16,790
again one of those things that's like one slide that was my life 's work but again we did this because

454
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:22,209
this and to ask endorse measures are preferred by payers and we wanted CMS to start using

455
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:27,250
this measure to improve the quality is as a lever to change the quality of care to these

456
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:33,130
kids are receiving because what gets measured gets done. our strategy.

457
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:38,215
um I really had hit on the slide because I

458
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:43,975
I'll just briefly talk about this. this process has been extraordinarily

459
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:49,095
dramatic and in many ways it it does not need to be and also has really

460
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:54,315
been obvious that maybe people are always working in the way that would benefit

461
00:42:54,315 --> 00:43:00,315
kids the most which I know I shouldn't be shocked about in politics but it's also true

462
00:43:00,315 --> 00:43:05,455
there is a thing called the course set and that's it the chip there's an adult one I but mean to talk talk

463
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:10,795
with Chuck said said about twenty five different measures that in that chip reauthorization. we're

464
00:43:10,795 --> 00:43:15,795
mandated that all state Medicaid programs have to report on these twenty five

465
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:20,896
quality measures at their state. so each state says okay this proportion of our kids are getting a well

466
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:26,015
child visit us whatever and so you can see over time as he stated in reporting these measures have

467
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:31,075
been getting better and and the results of the getting better. so our strategy and we are working very hard is to

468
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:36,899
get sickle cell on the course that we've been very close. we will continue to try and I think that there

469
00:43:36,899 --> 00:43:42,000
is the possibly this one the course that and if this measure gets on the course that this will really make a difference in the lives

470
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,099
of kids. so that kind of sums up what we've done.

471
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:52,539
hopefully you understand six twenty any name interest claims and I'm calling measures a little bit more and also

472
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:58,319
do a really long road between you know housing policy which I'm sure you all are. we are as

473
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,659
I will say that you can't you can't have one without the other but the fact that we approach

474
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:09,319
this in such a rigorous method has backed us up many many times and so I think that partnering epidemiologist

475
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:14,319
with clinicians and and people that are trying to do this work is really important and really key to the Ford

476
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,419
I mean I am biased because I'm in acting just but on I had to put aside and

477
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:24,819
Linda Elizabeth. I'm sure most of you know her with my advisor for my masters

478
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:29,959
PhD. and so my comment or make a award. so really anything I do is

479
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:35,389
because of her also our partnerships in the HHS are enormous and answer only

480
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:40,909
child also graduate from here. there's faculty that your center in New York state and this is also funded by

481
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:47,049
the arctic MP program. calling measures program and also making one from any chili I

482
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:54,489
saw a for questions if you guys have anything.

483
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:59,609
good thank. you yeah.

484
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:13,329
bye. yeah

485
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:18,929
yeah there's really not much difference in the physical outcomes in terms of health care utilization

486
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:24,069
and a lot of that is because most of the emergency department inpatient hospitalizations are really

487
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:29,389
driven by pain. the majority are and so there is another

488
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:34,609
type of preventive services and talk about which is how dropped. directory is a daily medication which helps

489
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:39,740
impact the incidence of pain crises and so in high drops when people are here

490
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:45,760
and I direct. there is a big difference in math and not really across antibiotics.

491
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:55,020
if you can see

492
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,300
no I think that is a failure to look

493
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,720
at the entire population of kids with sickle cell. I feel confident that the kids that are seen consistently

494
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,260
making the charges and the sickle cell center at least probably get prescribed most of the in a FedEx but there's.

495
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,300
thank we just finished analysis like last week that showed so most people if you ask him if you could see him

496
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,614
and talk to Siskel told us he asked only about fifteen percent or actually seen him at all just annually

497
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:26,854
so when you don't have kids coming in the door to you know get their antibiotics prescribed.

498
00:46:26,854 --> 00:46:34,333
there's no way that this is ever gonna be met

499
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:39,654
because if you exceed Kia from you just like

500
00:46:39,654 --> 00:46:45,214
a couple of things I mean we thinks it's

501
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:50,614
expensive you know. talk to. I like to use my

502
00:46:50,614 --> 00:46:55,954
absolutely I I'm having some quantity in health care and that's not

503
00:46:55,954 --> 00:47:01,033
course I'm you

504
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:06,813
know it's people to

505
00:47:06,813 --> 00:47:11,934
truly protect. yeah the whole area had

506
00:47:11,934 --> 00:47:17,194
had another. yes mhm so um sickle

507
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:23,040
cell sick if you pattern sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease

508
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,080
with patterns of the incidence of malaria had some of the complete overlap similar and have process of

509
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,980
the sickle cell trait protective against malaria and so um and

510
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:39,300
because it's of the Z as in the million genetic disorder right where if

511
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,340
two people have sickle cell trait they're tired of the twenty five percent chance of having sickle cell disease. so sickle

512
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:49,340
cell trait is protective and that's why the six of disease

513
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:57,180
occurs and so yes that's similar I have a specific field.

514
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:03,220
yeah.

515
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,580
so there's that's a great question that I only showed you guys that

516
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,840
the fifty seven. colds that were world related

517
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:19,240
to sickle cell anemia. there is actually probably like maybe fifteen other the fifty seven.

518
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,548
ask which means that there's other numbers after it codes for sickle cell and I think D fifty seven three

519
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:29,668
is sickle cell trait and so we didn't not include that in any of our definitions

520
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:37,488
but a lot of the kids that didn't have sickle cell anemia that where our true negative had sickle cell trait.

521
00:48:37,488 --> 00:48:42,548
we'd actually done some work that I think is really cool for Abby to is that we you know sickle cell

522
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:47,768
trait has no like no no negative health benefits or negative

523
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:52,868
negative health event. so we actually use new branch screening records to identify all

524
00:48:52,868 --> 00:48:58,268
kids because I'll trade I'll because the goes on the neon and then I can fill her the and village sickle cell. with normal hemoglobin

525
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:03,948
and files and wanted lean for outcomes in health care utilization. so we found no different in adverse

526
00:49:03,948 --> 00:49:09,048
outcomes or health care utilization. please that was.

527
00:49:09,048 --> 00:49:17,588
once comedian 's

528
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:25,648
controversial. that's so weird and answer claims and controversial

529
00:49:25,648 --> 00:49:30,648
yeah I I I would be having to and I think you know when he does that make to make feel proud of

530
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:36,548
the epidemiologist also and had been long a held thought and the sickle cell

531
00:49:36,548 --> 00:49:41,768
research world that you cannot use the ministry disclaims twice and if I could to the sickle cell disease much

532
00:49:41,768 --> 00:49:46,768
less sickle cell anemia thus uptight and so anytime he came of this quality measure

533
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:51,948
to anyone they would say but you can't identify those kids so this is not valid and

534
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:57,128
so we still are dealing with a lot of that even though this paper is finally published

535
00:49:57,128 --> 00:50:02,248
about two weeks ago and so that's part of it and then another

536
00:50:02,248 --> 00:50:07,528
part is getting these measures on the course and this is impact getting them on the course at

537
00:50:07,528 --> 00:50:12,528
the six measures and there's another sickle cell measure that I store it also it's about strep prevention. both

538
00:50:12,528 --> 00:50:17,668
of them and then nominated for four years running to be included in the course @ advisory committee

539
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:22,760
is the number one priority and every single year they have been rejected for no

540
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,900
good reason we cannot get clarity from the centers for Medicaid on this. it actually prompted us to write

541
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,060
a very fiery viewpoint and Jim of pediatrics that said the treatment of kids the sickle

542
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:38,781
cell is a national shame and that got a lot of attention over the last year.

543
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:43,781
so we are really unclear whether not included most of the point and then along the lines

544
00:50:43,781 --> 00:50:48,840
of what you can identify kids with sickle cell any anything. yes you can or there's not enough

545
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,060
kids with sickle cell anemia which argument is then it should be pretty easy to get in there and may tax right

546
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:00,140
and so it's been a very strange thing where you would think that everyone is in

547
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:05,220
it to make things better for kids but it's not always true so being armed with like real

548
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:10,240
faxing in real information has been essential to even get as far as we have

549
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:21,562
with us

550
00:51:21,562 --> 00:51:26,782
I do not but the entire demographic composition is very different

551
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:32,663
I think that um I just look up the staff before I came

552
00:51:32,663 --> 00:51:37,883
in in some areas there. incidence sickle of

553
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:43,062
substrate is one in for birth and it here in the united states is like one and a hundred

554
00:51:43,062 --> 00:51:48,183
or something like that. so there's also not newborn screening obviously across the world. so

555
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:53,522
there's a lot of different. thanks the so reason we have the words green is actually penicillin

556
00:51:53,522 --> 00:51:58,542
prophylactic because we need to get the faster we get the skin on tennis on the less likely they to are die

557
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:03,762
and we don't even know who has at birth. we can get them on these like things to even start

558
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:08,762
much be less at here and so in different countries where there's not different screening there's a big emphasis and we need to find

559
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:17,583
out who had sickle cell as fast as possible and help me do that so we can start and Maddox with a bit of a different question.

560
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:23,435
yes we have about a hundred patients here all right largest sickle cell center is

561
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:33,035
to try children Children's Hospital of Michigan Detroit about a thousand

562
00:52:33,035 --> 00:52:42,195
yeah. so.

563
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:53,448
um-hum course not correct to um

564
00:52:53,448 --> 00:52:58,497
no I think that's a great question so just because you pick up hearing about it doesn't mean you took them or do

565
00:52:58,497 --> 00:53:03,757
anybody for them for the right person to them right in Philly defense is still a pretty crude measure on

566
00:53:03,757 --> 00:53:08,957
my hypothesis has been that if people are feeling.

567
00:53:08,957 --> 00:53:14,137
three hundred days. it would be hard pressed for me to think that they wouldn't that they would just be selling

568
00:53:14,137 --> 00:53:19,657
them for them to sit for because actually this is another barrier to this the penicillin

569
00:53:19,657 --> 00:53:24,737
that has to be taken on have to be it only in the two week suspension on top of all of this

570
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:29,757
health care utilization. families have to go to the pharmacy or get liver the cremate best

571
00:53:29,757 --> 00:53:34,817
for two like twenty something more times the years when you add that on everything. also right.

572
00:53:34,817 --> 00:53:40,037
so my hypothesis at least for for penicillin for full is access that generally

573
00:53:40,037 --> 00:53:45,157
if we're seeing quite a few days that we can make the assumption is being taken but that is

574
00:53:45,157 --> 00:54:00,304
an accurate so our estimates are even an over estimation

575
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:05,544
oh great I can have with us all day. hey wondering if radio. thank

576
00:54:05,544 --> 00:54:07,429
you
