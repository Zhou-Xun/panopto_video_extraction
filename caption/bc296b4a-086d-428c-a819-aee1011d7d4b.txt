1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,890
In this video, we will analyze

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,870
the factors that have
contributed to the growth of

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,920
health care spending in

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,274
the United States over
the past several decades.

5
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:19,730
Our learning objective
is to analyze

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,410
how actors interact
in the pursuit of

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,630
their objectives and
how those interactions

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,710
influence the cost and

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,330
effectiveness of
the health system.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,435
Why has US health care
spending grown so rapidly?

11
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:34,970
This is a slightly
different question than,

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,445
why is US health care
spending so high?

13
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:39,590
Explaining growth
requires finding

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,630
factors that changed over time.

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,400
For example, if we always had

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,200
high levels of some risk factor,

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,180
that could help explain
why our spending is

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,090
consistently high relative
to that in other countries.

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,010
But it wouldn't help
us understand why

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,290
our spending is
growing over time.

21
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,810
Pause the video for a
minute and try to think of

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,450
three reasons why US health
care spending has grown.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,500
Compare the factors you
thought of to those on

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,120
this list and those that we'll

25
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,385
see shortly from a
more recent study.

26
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:12,500
This compilation of
studies covering

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,800
the longtime period from
the 1940s to 1990s,

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,050
showed that easily
quantifiable factors

29
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,695
explained only about
half of spending growth.

30
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:22,400
To reach these conclusions,

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
the studies measured
how much the driver

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,920
changed and estimated
this impact.

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,920
For example, we know how

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,560
the populations' age
distribution changed,

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,085
and we know the relationship
between age and spending,

36
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:35,600
so we can estimate how much

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,010
lower spending
would have been in

38
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,660
the 1990s if we had maintained
the 1940 age distribution.

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,390
Surprisingly, the aging
of the population

40
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,150
only explain 2 percent
of spending growth.

41
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,980
Factors that explain more of

42
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,420
the increased spending included

43
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,270
the rising share of expenses
paid for by third parties,

44
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,955
creating more hazard,
rising incomes,

45
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,370
and rising administrative costs.

46
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,320
Rising health care prices were

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,115
probably the most important
measurable factor.

48
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:05,840
Comparatively, US
spending per hospital

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,390
day is substantially higher
than other countries,

50
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,475
US drug prices are higher,

51
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,680
though we use more
generic, so as a result,

52
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,565
which limits the difference
on a per prescription basis,

53
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:18,145
and US medical
professionals earn more.

54
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:20,810
OECD primary care
income ranges from

55
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,820
two to four times the
average earnings of

56
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,130
a full-time worker
in the same country,

57
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,130
and specialist income ranges
from two to six times.

58
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,440
The US is at the
operand for both.

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,300
If the easily measurable
factors explain

60
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,760
only about half of
historical spending growth,

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,950
what explains the other half?

62
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,440
Many health economists
believe changing

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,740
medical technology
accounts for it.

64
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,510
New technology is
defined broadly as

65
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,100
new knowledge and capabilities

66
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,750
that change treatment patterns.

67
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,280
Whether or not that knowledge is

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,980
embodied and tangible
equipment or drugs.

69
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,830
We'll consider some of the
evidence for this and try to

70
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,360
get a sense of
whether these changes

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,530
have been worth their cost.

72
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,115
Let's review a study that
examined a more recent period.

73
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:08,200
Estimated effects of each change

74
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,490
hold constant all
the other factors.

75
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,520
Twenty-three percent
of spending growth

76
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,785
comes from simple
population growth.

77
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:17,560
The prior data we
considered was per capita,

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,040
so the remaining 77 percent
is more interesting.

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,200
Population aging became somewhat

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,735
more important in this
recent time period.

81
00:03:25,735 --> 00:03:27,700
It may be surprising
that changing

82
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,170
disease incidence and prevalence

83
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,150
actually helped reduce costs.

84
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,400
Some important
conditions like diabetes

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,695
and kidney disease did
become more common,

86
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:37,780
but the decline in
spending was driven by

87
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,510
large reductions in
cardiovascular disease,

88
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,670
partly due to
declines in smoking,

89
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,240
and partly due to better
preventive drugs and treatments.

90
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,360
The number of clinical
encounters per case was

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,955
also associated with a
decline in spending.

92
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:55,045
This pattern shows a big
decline in inpatient stays,

93
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:56,710
partly offset by increases

94
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,065
an outpatient visits
and prescriptions.

95
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:01,810
Finally, half of
all spending growth

96
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,585
making up almost two-thirds
of per capita growth,

97
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,640
reflected higher prices and

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,785
intensity per
clinical encounter.

99
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:10,720
Changes in technology along with

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,824
prices would largely be
reflected in that category,

101
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:16,120
confirming that the
largest recent drivers of

102
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,879
spending growth are the same
as the historical drivers.

103
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,840
The same group of authors took

104
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,540
a deeper look at spending
growth by condition.

105
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,610
They concluded that
the three conditions

106
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,900
with the highest
spending growth,

107
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,850
were lower back, and neck pain,

108
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,475
other musculoskeletal
conditions, and diabetes.

109
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,525
Annual spend of growth
above general inflation was

110
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,840
6.7 percent for lower
back and neck pain,

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,340
this growth occurred
despite the growth rate and

112
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,215
the number of cases
being only 1.1 percent,

113
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:48,110
significant efforts to decrease

114
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,790
the use of imaging
studies before

115
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,935
conservative therapy
had been attempted

116
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:55,240
and a lack of data showing
that new therapies are better.

117
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,140
Spending on diabetes
and dementias also rose

118
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,585
substantially driven
by case growth,

119
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:01,970
and in the case of diabetes,

120
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,815
also by drug costs.

121
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,260
Other conditions with
high spending growth

122
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,550
such as hepatitis,

123
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,710
arthritis, and
multiple sclerosis,

124
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,270
had new specialty drugs.

125
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,925
Given our experiences
with other industries,

126
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,500
we might wonder why technology

127
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,450
drives up spending
for health care.

128
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,790
For example, my
first computer cost

129
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,715
$2500 in 1988 dollars,

130
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:27,700
and featured of 42
megabyte hard drive.

131
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,555
In health care, 3rd-party
payment fuels a feedback loop.

132
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:33,460
Insurance encourages development

133
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,335
of cost increasing technology,

134
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,210
which increases financial risk,

135
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,600
which increases demand
for insurance and so on.

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,775
If patients don't
have to pay the bill,

137
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,890
there won't be a market
for innovations that are

138
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,950
cheaper and almost as good
as existing alternatives,

139
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,600
so companies won't focus

140
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,030
their research and development
on such innovations.

141
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,510
Thomas proposed a model of

142
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,730
the evolution of
medical technology.

143
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,940
A condition starts in a
state of non-technology.

144
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,190
Diseases are poorly
understood and

145
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,290
little can be done
but palliation,

146
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,489
for example, multiple sclerosis
and untreatable cancers.

147
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:12,790
Care is often but not
always relatively cheap.

148
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,980
As knowledge
progresses, conditions

149
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,590
move to a state of
halfway technology.

150
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,350
Diseases can be dealt
with after the fact in

151
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,005
a way that improves quality
of life for survival.

152
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:24,880
For example, treatable cancers,

153
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,580
kidney dialysis, organ
transplantation.

154
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,660
Care is often expensive
and uses equipment and

155
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,550
techniques that in
common terminology

156
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,130
we would call high-tech.

157
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,430
Finally, we hope
conditions move to

158
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,815
what Thomas calls
high-technology,

159
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,590
technology that allows
diseases to be prevented

160
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,425
or treated very effectively
at early stages.

161
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:47,320
For example, immunizations
and antibiotics,

162
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,810
and often relatively
inexpensively.

163
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,780
Cluster increasing
technologies largely fit into

164
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,580
Thomas's 2nd stage and

165
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,625
reflects where we are for
many important conditions.

166
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,680
Some diseases such as polio or

167
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,860
smallpox have gone through all
three stages of evolution.

168
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,760
Another way technology increases

169
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,595
spending is by reinforcing
other changes.

170
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,340
For example, obesity
rates have been rising in

171
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,670
the US and obesity is associated
with higher spending.

172
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,440
Thorpe and colleagues found that

173
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,570
27 percent of inflation adjusted

174
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,840
spending growth
between 1987 and 2001

175
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,880
was attributable to obesity.

176
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,940
However, only 12 percent
was due to the increase in

177
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,365
the prevalence of obesity

178
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,360
holding treatment
patterns constant,

179
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,610
whereas 15 percent was
due to a change in

180
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,515
treatment patterns holding
prevalence constant.

181
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:38,220
That is, more than half of

182
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,605
the obesity associated
growth in spending

183
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:42,510
would have occurred even without

184
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,640
any change in the
prevalence of obesity.

185
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,300
If I've convinced you that
changes in technology,

186
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,830
broadly defined as changes

187
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,420
in knowledge that
affect how we treat

188
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,460
patients is a major driver

189
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,970
of health care spending growth,

190
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,665
the next question is, so what?

191
00:07:58,665 --> 00:08:00,930
Rising spending on any
particular good or

192
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,495
service is not
inherently good or bad.

193
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:06,180
That depends on whether the
added spending generates

194
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,950
enough value to justify the
resources devoted to it.

195
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,070
In other words, are
people willing to

196
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,425
pay for improvements
in technology?

197
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:18,055
We can find a few pieces
of suggestive evidence.

198
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:20,320
First, there is
broad support for

199
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,585
federal funding and
medical research.

200
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,195
Second, consider this offer.

201
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:27,370
I'm marketing a new
insurance plan with

202
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,139
the slogan 1965 technology
for 1965 prices.

203
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,030
Would you enroll in that plan

204
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,115
rather than the
plan you have now?

205
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,740
If not, that strongly
suggests that

206
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,790
the average value of

207
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,460
improvements succeeds
the average cost.

208
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,820
That doesn't imply that every
change was worth the cost.

209
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,350
Or even the changes
that are worth

210
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,700
the cost on average aren't

211
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,270
used in marginal cases where
they aren't worth the cost.

212
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,490
Those pieces of information are

213
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,135
informal gut level tests of
the value of new technology.

214
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:00,070
Cutler and McClellan carried out

215
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,560
a more formal
cost-benefit analysis of

216
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
five clinical areas
that have seen

217
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,520
substantial technical
change reflected

218
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,485
in changing treatment patterns.

219
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:11,335
They examined heart
attacks, low birth weight,

220
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:14,560
depression, cataracts,
and breast cancer.

221
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,530
These are all clinically
significant areas affecting

222
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,875
different populations with
different types of treatments.

223
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,675
For the first four,

224
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:25,600
they concluded that the value
of improved survival or

225
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,080
quality of life clearly
exceeded the added costs.

226
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,075
For the 5th, breast cancer,

227
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:32,410
the value of benefits was

228
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,080
approximately equal
to it's added costs.

229
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,480
They conclude that new
medical technology

230
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,850
has improved social welfare.

231
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,090
To summarize, US
health care spending

232
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,204
has grown rapidly
for many decades.

233
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:47,380
Multiple factors contribute, but

234
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,000
changing technology is likely to

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,010
provide the primary explanation,

236
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,505
followed by prices,
income growth,

237
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:56,900
and the rising share of
expenses paid by 3rd parties.

238
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,490
Surprisingly, population
aging and changes in

239
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,200
the prevalence of
clinical conditions

240
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,195
were not the primary drivers.

241
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:05,860
Finally, although there is

242
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,690
undoubtedly waste
and inefficiency

243
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,280
associated with the
development and

244
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,200
use of technology at the margin,

245
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,610
there is reason to believe that

246
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,640
technological change has made
us better off on average.
