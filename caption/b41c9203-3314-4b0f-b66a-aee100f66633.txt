1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,930
In this video, we'll

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,730
outline the fundamental
objectives and

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,425
trade-offs in health policy

4
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:16,570
which we will call the
healthcare trilemma.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,770
Today's learning
objectives are to begin

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,350
adapting our general
model of microeconomics,

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,410
particularly the notion of
trade-offs to account for

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,450
features of health and
healthcare decisions

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,995
faced by society.

10
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,570
We'll also begin to apply

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,940
a typology of sources
of market failure to

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,560
healthcare and to analyze

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,350
why suboptimal
outcomes can occur.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,400
Our examination of data
about the performance

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,710
of the US healthcare
system makes clear that we

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,185
face a fundamental
policy trilemma:

17
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:47,734
cost, quality, and access.

18
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:49,760
Not surprisingly, there are

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,565
inherent tensions between
these important objectives,

20
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,650
even if those trade-offs
are sometimes

21
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,110
downplayed by policy advocates.

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,240
For example, if we
wanted to improve

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,190
access, we need resources.

24
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,930
That could mean either accepting

25
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,305
higher costs or lower quality
as part of the bargain.

26
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:09,710
There might occasionally be
win-win-win opportunities

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,090
where all three objectives

28
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,295
can be improved simultaneously,

29
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:16,290
but we shouldn't expect
that to be the norm.

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,870
In fact, when someone
proposes a win-win-win idea,

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,985
our first question
should probably be,

32
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:23,920
what is the barrier
that has prevented

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,800
that solution from having
already been implemented?

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,820
There are a number of
examples where advocates of

35
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,740
certain policy
prescriptions ignore

36
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,035
or downplay the
potential trade-offs.

37
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,610
That doesn't mean
that the policies

38
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,350
being proposed
aren't worthwhile,

39
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,790
but they should be
considered with

40
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,975
a clear view as
likely trade-offs.

41
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:44,115
Prevention is a great example.

42
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:46,510
Advocates will often tell
prevention is a way to

43
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,300
improve health outcomes
while reducing costs.

44
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,325
Certainly in a particular
case that might be true.

45
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:55,150
If my cancer is discovered
and treated earlier,

46
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,415
I could experience
a better outcome

47
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:59,370
with less costly therapy.

48
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,280
However, we need to account for

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,905
the entire cost of the
screening program.

50
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,990
First, we have to
promote and perform

51
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,135
screening on a large population.

52
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:10,430
Most of those will
have negative results,

53
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,080
so any subsequent savings

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,580
will have to offset the costs of

55
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,350
all those negative tests in

56
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,070
order for the program as
a whole to save money.

57
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,600
Depending on the test
characteristics,

58
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,490
many of the positive
results could be

59
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,770
false positives or cases where

60
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,735
the condition would
not have progressed

61
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:29,465
before it would've been
discovered through other means,

62
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:32,345
so we need to offset
those costs too.

63
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:35,180
Then we need to perform
confirmatory tests like

64
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,270
biopsies to figure out
who has a false positive.

65
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,400
All of that before
we even get to

66
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,500
treating the relatively
small number of

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,300
people who end up benefiting

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,135
from the earlier detection
of their condition.

69
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:49,215
What did the data tell us?

70
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:51,860
Review of the cost-effectiveness
literature showed that

71
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,940
about 20 percent of

72
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,880
preventive interventions
did in fact save money,

73
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,500
while generating
outcomes as good or

74
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,630
better than not doing
the intervention.

75
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,470
To use a technical economic
term, those are no-brainers.

76
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,155
Another 60 percent raised costs,

77
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,880
but improved outcome
is enough to

78
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,700
arguably be a
cost-effective investment.

79
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,730
The final 20 percent
either improved outcomes

80
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,670
but had an unfavorable
cost-effectiveness ratio,

81
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,500
or actually harmed outcomes.

82
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,690
Interestingly, the
distribution of

83
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,600
cost-effectiveness ratios
for interventions that

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,850
treat existing
illness looked pretty

85
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,805
similar to that for
preventive interventions.

86
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,740
A fair conclusion is

87
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,420
that all types of
interventions whether

88
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,100
preventive or
treatment should be

89
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,445
judged using similar criteria.

90
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:39,020
Do with the no-brainers
and those for which

91
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,430
the health improvement
represents

92
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,100
a good return on the
additional cost investment,

93
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,565
but don't expect lower
spending on average.

94
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:50,510
Another great example of
ignoring trade-offs occurs when

95
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,070
people focus on who writes

96
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,415
the checks for health
insurance premiums.

97
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:57,050
For example, the flow of
funds from my employer

98
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,520
sponsored plan is that

99
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,650
my employer pays
most of the premium,

100
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,330
I pay a smaller share,

101
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,910
plus the government
subsidizes it by excluding

102
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,020
my health insurance premiums
from my taxable income.

103
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,670
Isn't it great that my
employer gives me most of

104
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,320
my health insurance
and the government

105
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,830
lets me avoid
paying taxes on it?

106
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,950
Not so fast.

107
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,650
My health insurance is simply

108
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,330
part of the compensation package

109
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,160
my employer offers
to entice me to

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,655
take the job and to stay in it.

111
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,500
What my employer cares
about is the total cost of

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,370
employing me relative to
the value of my work.

113
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,065
If employers didn't
provide health insurance,

114
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,044
I could demand a higher salary,

115
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:38,015
a better retirement
plan, or more vacation.

116
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,710
If my current employer wasn't

117
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,680
willing to offer any
of those things,

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,650
I could seek an
alternative job that did.

119
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,840
Basically, I am the one who
pays for my health insurance

120
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,250
because less will be available

121
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,365
for other types of compensation.

122
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,290
When health insurance
premiums rise rapidly,

123
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,315
cash wages tend to stagnate

124
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:58,819
and corporate profit
rates seem unaffected.

125
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:00,950
The opposite of
what we'd expect if

126
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,390
employers were really the ones

127
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,440
paying for health insurance.

128
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,390
Similarly, government's
only source of funds

129
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,060
is taxes on current
and future citizens.

130
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,820
Rising health spending
crowds out funding for

131
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,400
citizens' other priorities
like higher education.

132
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,710
The third example of
ignoring trade-offs is

133
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,560
the assertion that replacing
our fragmented payer system

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,780
with a Medicare for All
program that covers

135
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,240
the entire population
and eliminates

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,460
patient cost-sharing
when they seek care

137
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,430
will save money while
improving access.

138
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,260
This one is harder to assess

139
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,750
definitively because we
haven't tried it yet.

140
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,550
It could be true, but

141
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,060
that conclusion relies on
several strong assumptions.

142
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,760
The primary path
to savings would

143
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,340
likely be paying Medicare
prices to providers

144
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,140
rather than the
higher prices paid by

145
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,415
private insurers and by
reducing administrative costs.

146
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:56,740
Getting there could
be difficult.

147
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,270
The healthcare industry will

148
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,175
strongly resist lower prices,

149
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,875
and they are quite powerful
in the political arena.

150
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,140
Some administrative
costs could certainly be

151
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,020
reduced by having only
one payer to deal with,

152
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,080
but other administrative
costs are themselves for

153
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,530
efforts to manage the care
process and reduce costs.

154
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,360
Finally, limiting

155
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,860
patient cost-sharing
would increase use.

156
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,030
Some single-payer advocates have

157
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,550
argued that the increase
in use would be modest,

158
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,260
but the stated rationale for

159
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,975
that conclusion itself is
a form of a trade-off,

160
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:29,910
insufficient supply to provide

161
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,960
access to all the care
that will be demanded.

162
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,620
Resolving the trilemma requires

163
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,930
addressing the sources
of market failure,

164
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,530
one of them, poor information
pervades health care.

165
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,960
Think about times you've
had to make decisions

166
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,840
about your own care or
that of a family member.

167
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,520
How well did you understand

168
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,870
the potential effectiveness and

169
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,925
risks of different
treatment options,

170
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,800
the quality of the
different doctors

171
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,525
or hospitals you might choose,

172
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,340
or the prices they
would charge for

173
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,660
all the services you'd get

174
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,000
as part of the episode of care?

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,790
Even providers struggle
to keep up with

176
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,520
the huge clinical literature
and often need to

177
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,010
sort out biased information
sources like those

178
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,160
sponsored by companies with
an interest in the product.

179
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,230
A particularly thorny form of

180
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,515
poor information occurs when
information is asymmetric.

181
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:19,825
One party knows
more than the other

182
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,360
and uses that for
strategic advantage.

183
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,640
One example is that
patients know less

184
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,830
than providers
about care options,

185
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,480
so providers may recommend

186
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,384
the more profitable treatments.

187
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,470
Another example is that

188
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,380
enrollees know more about
their health insurers,

189
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,240
so insurers must anticipate

190
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,440
the possibility that those

191
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,300
enrolling are sicker
than average.

192
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Several other sources of

193
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,840
market failure are
important in health care.

194
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,580
Like any other market,

195
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,850
the health care market creates
incentives through prices.

196
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,700
However, insurance
distorts the price signal

197
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,475
by making health care
appear artificially cheap.

198
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:00,700
Combining well-insured patients
with providers paid on

199
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,460
a fee-for-service basis
creates incentives to

200
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,895
use more care even if
it's low-value care.

201
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,755
In the longer term,

202
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,870
the system also
creates incentives to

203
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,570
develop better but more
costly treatments.

204
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,340
Even marginal improvements in

205
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,680
quality that come
at high cost will

206
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,420
be rewarded by a market that is

207
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,045
insulated from the
cost of decisions.

208
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:24,760
Conversely, there'll
be little chance

209
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,530
for an innovation
that's almost as

210
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,120
good as existing treatments but

211
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,270
considerably cheaper
to gain traction.

212
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,720
Many health care markets like
those for hospital care,

213
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,050
drugs, or insurance, have
limited competition.

214
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,680
Firms wield considerable
market power far from

215
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,210
the competitive ideal of firms

216
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,700
too small to influence prices.

217
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,970
This market power is often
built and sustained by

218
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,344
regulatory barriers to
entry such as licensure,

219
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:55,840
Certificate of Need
regulation, or patents.

220
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,155
Finally, there are goods
that create externalities,

221
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,390
benefits or costs that accrue to

222
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,225
third parties and are
not reflected in prices.

223
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,760
Vaccinations are a
classic example.

224
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,020
The decision to get

225
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,780
vaccinated wastes personal
benefits in money,

226
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,190
time, and side effects,

227
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,710
against personal
health benefits.

228
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,340
Ideally, people would also
consider the value of

229
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,015
protection that their
vaccination confers on others.

230
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:25,045
Finally, there are public
goods like new knowledge,

231
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,670
which ones created
are freely available.

232
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,380
In a private market,

233
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,970
that inability to capture

234
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,145
the full value of
knowledge creation

235
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:35,050
will reduce the
incentive to invest

236
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,180
resources in research
and development.

237
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,680
To summarize, the cost, quality,

238
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,710
access trilemma remains
the fundamental conundrum

239
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,160
of health policy creating
inevitable trade-offs.

240
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,560
Emanual and Fuchs argued
in the Journal of

241
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,960
the American Medical
Association that

242
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,755
the US faces a perfect
storm of overutilization.

243
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:59,005
The source of that perfect storm

244
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,300
can be traced back
to market failures,

245
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,850
and we'll spend the rest
of this course exploring

246
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,670
the sources and potential
remedies for those failures.
