1
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,110
If you read the Constitution carefully,

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,830
you'll notice that the framers did not really plan for the federal government to deal directly with health at all.

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,990
In fact, the word health does not even appear in the Constitution.

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:34,610
But the Constitution does explicitly authorize the federal government to promote and provide for the general welfare and also to regulate commerce.

5
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:45,260
So federal powers in health evolved very, very slowly in its initial duties to relegate international affairs and interstate commerce.

6
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:54,500
The federal government concentrated on preventing the spread of epidemics and assisting states and localities with limited disease control.

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,170
Let's take some examples. The earliest federal health unit, the Marine hospital service that was established in 1798.

8
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:10,280
It was partly to serve merchant seamen, but partly to prevent importation of epidemic diseases.

9
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:18,380
Fast forward to the beginning of the 20th century, and the Constitution was amended to allow the federal government to collect an income tax.

10
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,520
So think about what happens here. The federal government has new revenue.

11
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,580
Well, with new revenue comes new capacity to address health problems more directly.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,590
Now the federal government can provide resources to state and local governments.

13
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,540
Well, this emboldened the federal government, and by 1935,

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,010
the power and influence of the federal government grew even more through financial influence over state and local programs.

15
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,810
Let's take some different examples. The Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946, commonly known as the Hill Burton Act.

16
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:02,330
And then, of course, by 1965, the government's emergence as a payer in the US health care system through the creation of Medicare and Medicaid.

17
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,610
Here you can imagine the federal government was no longer just delivering a program.

18
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,420
It was actually stepping into our US health care system and becoming a payer directly interfacing

19
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,930
with the individual medical care of our nation's seniors and low income populations.

20
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,170
Another example is the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This was established in 1946.

21
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,660
Another federal agency that was growing out of the federal government's larger role in public health.

22
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,460
So the emergence of the federal government as a major influence really started to displace states from their authority over this area.

23
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,010
Now, as you might imagine, states were, of course, originally sovereign powers,

24
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,240
and eventually they agreed to share their powers with the federal government.

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,410
They derived their sovereignty from what we call police powers.

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,480
These powers allow the state government to limit the actions of individuals in order to control and avoid hazards and nuisances.

27
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,010
What does that mean? Epidemics. Other threats to individual health.

28
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:14,210
The police powers are the states way to make sure that those threats are eliminated so that individuals are protected.

29
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:22,910
They also derive their powers from the expectation of citizens that government would serve vulnerable populations in need.

30
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,480
In this way, the tension between federal and state governments continued to grow.

31
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,180
And you can see very clearly how the federal government continued to step in in a larger and

32
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,820
larger way and cause new challenges to emerge in its relations with the state governments.
