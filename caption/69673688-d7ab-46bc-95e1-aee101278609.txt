1
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay, hello, Good morning. Everyone let's get started I helped you had a today.

2
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yesterday, and I I saw most of you have a meta the first project.

3
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's great, which means it's working we have another one another project assigned today, and if I may tomorrow.

4
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And also we'll have an online quiz with go over them briefly,

5
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Any questions. People with start today

6
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, You can always let me know if I have any question.

7
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, i'm sorry i'm i'm wearing my airpod.

8
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Now, cause my kids are still at home, you know, Like 15 min they will be leaving for the camp, and then I will take them off.

9
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Alright let's go

10
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, if I if be able to see my screen now. So yesterday, if you go to the zoom here yesterday is recording what year?

11
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So. I heard that originally some people cannot watch it I guess that's because the setting require a university of Michigan Login flag on.

12
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So now I change it so that everybody should be able to see it.

13
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If you still have follow lodging the recording let us know as soon as possible, so we will try.

14
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll fix them

15
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay, let's go So today we're gonna have factor 2, which is the relatively short lecture.

16
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But then we have 2 project in cost project for most of the lecture problem now on there will be 2 projects Ruby.

17
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The white one of them will be required to submit.

18
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
For example, this 1, 2, A is going to be summit so we'll do it together.

19
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
For the rest of time we can go over to B. together, but it's not required for submission.

20
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So So you only need to work on to a and some minute.

21
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then there's a post electoral quiz which is all on just a few multiple toy questions.

22
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We can go in there. And if you, for example, take the quiz, you know, just a few multiple choice questions like 6 year.

23
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So take your time after the class. You can actually do it, you know, during the break, if you like.

24
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, essentially the sixth question there's a time limit of 6 min, about 60 min. But you shouldn't take more than 30 min.

25
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I did eat, and then you can try it twice and after that you know you'll be showing the answer, and you don't have to do that.

26
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Meant. So these are automatically graded. so I would say the automatic grading in the cameras.

27
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's not perfect in the sense you know for example, for multi-boot voice.

28
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If you've got 3 out of 5 long you might check out 0 points, because you know the way they grade it right if you for multiple choices.

29
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So. so be a little careful. So, by the way, from now on for the for the incompat project.

30
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You will be doing it in group so actually i'll today i'll try this thing.

31
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I will fix the group for each week. so this week we'll have a fixed group.

32
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They're gonna work with the same group mate starting this week on the next week of a different group.

33
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So hopefully that way you can, you know, get to know many people.

34
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So you are Rockefeller to work with groups, but you don't have to right.

35
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can work by yourself. but if you work with group, you know hopefully that will help.

36
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And then but you still need to write it down your phone, and then you know this discussion period where we'll you know, call out people from each group to to pretty, because we don't have time for everybody to to be right probably this

37
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
way we can have some group works have come in cost discussion, but the the post lecture quit.

38
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You are supposed to do it by itself, so I want to make that clear.

39
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So do we yourself. Now you know, that's the basically a check on on your understanding of the material.

40
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay. So now, let's start So the so the first lecture we basically go over very quickly.

41
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What are we going to cover up in the next 3 weeks? right from?

42
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay, kind of data, the kind of study design who you know visualization summary statistic quantify.

43
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm starting to and finally to interpretation right everything so far today.

44
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I, we gotta dig down into each that and go deeper there.

45
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So yesterday was just the overview so if you didn't got all the detail from yet to this lecture.

46
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's totally fine, because you know in the next 3 weeks we're gonna peek down into every single time.

47
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm going much further about it. So today. we gotta just talk about data visualization as yesterday.

48
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We saw right by virtualizing data you can really get a lot from from it, and then that that will help us understand the data form have positive.

49
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And so we all heard like one picture is worth a 1,000 work, right?

50
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know the the raw data. The user is usually compiled in a very big table.

51
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Fresh it, or things like those, although those are very accurate.

52
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
All the numbers are there, but we just don't have a good understanding of the data until we summarize the data into pictures or numbers.

53
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And you know, basically interpreted the data right now that's very important.

54
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So they would talk about data visualization. Now let's look at this picture from from a website.

55
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's called one world. our world in data so we see that.

56
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So first of all, this shows distribution. You know I never really formally defined distribution.

57
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I probably will not do for the next 3 weeks. But this distributions are just a way.

58
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
A bunch of data they so they are distributed. I know this is.

59
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is a circular definition, right? but basically you you Look at the data and look at you know what kind of range and what kind of a frequency they have.

60
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So that's called a distribution. So this is the distribution of self-reported life, that infection by wall regions. right?

61
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
So you look at it, it's break down by this is A the this one is the whole world average, and then they break down by different region.

62
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Western Europe, south, you know Asia, and so on, and so forth.

63
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And then basically the app questions right? and then the the second. And then the people, they reply from 0 to 10.

64
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Basically, how satisfy of you. You are about your life, right?

65
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So 0 is not satisfied at all. 10 is perfectly satisfied. Right? So that's what this should do.

66
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Now you see again, this is the sort of a unit model bell shaped right?

67
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So this is not surprising, because you know, most of the time majority of the people are in the middle, right?

68
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And then there are people on the 2 hand hold that for the whole world.

69
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And then the high of the bar is the the frequency. right?

70
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So here is a it's is a hitler graph right the high will be the frequency.

71
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So what does? How many people are there? All the percentage actually do not really matter that much.

72
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I mean they can put up vertical bar here, showing this is, you know, 20% of the population, or is it, you know, whatever?

73
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But the key is relative height of different bars, Right?

74
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We see most people are sort of a 5 out of 10, satisfied with their life, and then, when you break down into different region so yes, I talk about pstogram is very good to visualize one distribution. but it's not good to compare 2

75
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
distribution. But here the author tries to compare 2 distributions.

76
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Therefore they they have been quite creative. For example, they use the blue bar here, show the hippocamp from the wall.

77
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The data, but the other, you know, Color bar showing the particular region.

78
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So this way you kind of look at the region. compare with the the world. average right?

79
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So. you, I mean, you can immediately see that in Western Europe people are more, on average, more satisfied with their lives than the world average South Asia a little bit below average.

80
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:27,000
But about the same, and the southeast face are about the same as world average, and also what East Asia, I think, for Southeast Asia there are more people pick 5 out of 10 there.

81
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They few more people picking other numbers, but overall the distribution.

82
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You know the the location, but this is the same. The The only difference is for Western Europe.

83
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You know they are higher average. So if you know one thing you can you can think about as if there is one group which is higher and off average?

84
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
There's that gonna be another group lower than that or more right? cause otherwise the average won't be the average.

85
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, but you you can look at the South Asia. it's actually lower the average, and they didn't show Africa or America. But maybe those are lower average, or so on and so forth.

86
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh, yeah, these are the African America. So you see that actually Latin America, North America actually higher than average?

87
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Right so So after you call it's actually lower than the average.

88
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But you know the difference are not so big. I would say.

89
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know the the the mode, the highest ticket do at 5, which is the distribution?

90
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay, Any questions, so far.

91
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Alright. so you know, think about 2 conclusions you you want to reach from this figure.

92
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I already explain my my fault right? And after you look at all these figures.

93
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
They read the article. you know showing this picture what's your what's what's the 2 major conclusion you want to? Mike?

94
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So anyone want to at least say one that you're your first impression of this data that

95
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,000
The distribution is different for each region that's very very true.

96
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, actually, they could, I believe, even for each region there's a huge variety, right variation of distribution.

97
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So they could actually break down by a country. Of course, now we have too many pictures.

98
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
At least they could share. You know them larger countries with bigger population.

99
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But there, you know, the the survey will be more accurate. Right?

100
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:56,000
All that i'll i'll be curious to see barrier, I think. when you see that the different regions of the world all have like a different distributions and when you compare that to yeah, the world

101
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
distribution, you can conclude that, the larger your population size.

102
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So with the world distribution, the more likely the data will be spread out more evenly.

103
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And normal. I I would say.

104
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So you're saying, this line is the most you on his private I'd say, show you Yeah, you look like, though I mean.

105
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But, on the other hand, this this you know. all the other big pictures are with the right sort of a narrower.

106
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So do you feel with this tongue I don't know I mean the the blue one blue bars care upon the world.

107
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Average in some regions they East Asia. they are about the same, right? Yeah.

108
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So I think that depends on the region. Maybe right. But I I think not necessarily.

109
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The bigger population there will be more average. This is the picture of the distribution.

110
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We would talk about later, on actually there's 2 5 involving the Google analysis.

111
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Why is the population 5, which is the study of the the size of the population?

112
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You want to study the other line, the sample 5. So they they have different roles.

113
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So the population size away from time to Zoom meeting so it really doesn't matter for the sample size.

114
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
They give us more accuracy. The larger sample size, the more power we talk about yesterday for more accuracy.

115
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But neither of them will actually have the impact on the distribution that they distribution themselves are sort of a predecessor doesn't really depend on the size of the population model.

116
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:39,000
For. Yeah, for the phone alright let's move on So we have already talked about this kind of figure called the hip Hop right.

117
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We'll show very similar people later. so you might think this is trivial.

118
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But when I show other different kind of people later, there are different a characteristic of different conversation.

119
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So the histogram is used to display the frequency or distribution of possible value in the data set right.

120
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So the characteristics of crystal ground is that every single subject fall in and only fall in one bar.

121
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You think about it. So, although we are now showing the wall data, but this bar maybe come from like, you know, 5,000 subjects. and the answer, 5 other 10.

122
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So every single subject they fall in one bar on bar only so That's the feature of Hitler ground, and then a Hitler grammar thing to a bar plot with with numbering in Japan.

123
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Right. So we are plotting bars so generated to the bar plot for the fifth programming. but special type bar plot, where the height of the bar shows the frequency or the percentage they're the same thing

124
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
right, relatively, When you have the high showing other variable, they are not hit the ground anymore.

125
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, there there was a question. Please go ahead i'm sorry. I just did a question.

126
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So when it says, be bin, what does that mean? What?

127
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The each bin Okay, basic each bar. Okay, So you can think about you.

128
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Put the data into, you know different buckets, right I call the band The bucket is the same thing email and is each one Thank you.

129
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Okay, i'll be taking off my my air talk

130
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Okay, I hope this sounds better. now. So the question of the question here is a histogram that are missing a label for the y-axis.

131
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You dial. A limitation, I I think, is fine for them to add a one access thing.

132
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
You know, the percentage of each bar in the whole population, or the number of people in each bar.

133
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But those I was. they are so of a secondary to the picture.

134
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They want to show you right. So this picture already show a lot of information.

135
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Provide a little more information. i'll also make the pictures more massive, so I I wouldn't say that's absolutely needed in this particular case, but I will see later on.

136
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
There are other kind of bar paths where the Y access is essential, and they are not histograms.

137
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So always keep that in mind. So the last question is How can you Think of any other way of displaying the result from this survey. So you're the one running the survey you'll compile data besides the one they pick to show

138
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:32,000
here? Do they have any other idea how to show the same data with a different kind of path

139
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Think about a pie. chart It might be some might get complicated when you try to impose like the world and I mean you're speaking, but you're muted I can see your transcripts down there I couldn't hear

140
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
you

141
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So you're suggesting you using a pie chart right Yes, can you hear me now?

142
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't know why you guys can hear my call I I put it.

143
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I can see the transcript down there it's really interesting

144
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh, you can't hear him so this is my problem

145
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Hold on! Let me test my audio

146
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I think it's working on could anyone say anything anything

147
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Can you hear me? Yes, yes, thank you, Yeah, I think what's happening. is that I, my speaker, volume is too low.

148
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So I didn't hear anything Now i'm making it higher. Yeah, it's also always technology problems.

149
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Sorry about that. Okay. Yeah. So Pie Chart is another way to show distribution like this. that's absolutely correct.

150
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
We'll talk about them later and there are other ways cool let's move on with a second fever.

151
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So I will ask you to look at this figure for 1 min.

152
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Then i'll you know go over the question on the second slide

153
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay, I hope you rather try to look at it i'll go to the second slide, basically saying again, say the 2 conclusions you would read from this speaker, let me go back.

154
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Anyone want to say one conclusion you you got from here

155
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I just have a general. Alright, I was gonna say I have a general question of the first bar where it is 12 or older.

156
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Is that supposed to be, or older, If the next bar itself is 12 to 17?

157
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah, that's one quick thing. you you use notice this is not a more than the resortable plot where this bar is 12 or older.

158
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Actually, that contains all these 3 other bars I saw.

159
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This is like everybody, and then break down the 3 groups. So I would say, this is not a best way to visualize the data, because it's kind of computing.

160
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So so large you have something to say. I was gonna say the same exactly.

161
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I was just a little confused with the description of the x-axis.

162
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah. So this is actually, I would say, is an example of a bad visualization.

163
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Right. They put 4 bars here, but they're not equal this 3 bars are 3 age group, but this one is it's overall.

164
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So my first question is is this: is this cloud of his program

165
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
No, because it has an y-axis absolutely correct. Yeah, thank you.

166
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
This is not an instagram, because he has a Y access which is not frequency or percentage. right?

167
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Accounts. right? So basically, and second thing is that yeah he's the ground remote.

168
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Every single subject for you. One bar and one bar only but this part contained everybody.

169
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Right that's a very bad way of putting the full bars together.

170
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But now, nevertheless, this is a barcloth, because there are bars. Right?

171
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So this shows, if you see the you know, the past month, smallest tobacco use among people in different age.

172
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Group. right? So what's actually showing here is that you know everybody right on average, they use like 3 smoke is tobacco.

173
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Last month, but different age that you know some of them are higher from a lower average of 3.

174
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And then there's an Arab bar here i'll talk about her about later, because these are these 3 is a have to make from a sample any estimate from a sample will have a high certainty, and that parabol shows the

175
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
uncertainty. i'll pop my later. hobbies calculate the Harvard so also for us right.

176
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But actually just use the the formula we talked about yesterday, remember, as divided by scroll and that'll pretty much give you an example.

177
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So the computer will be Actually, the overall is the 3 packs right last month in the 18 to 20 first page group.

178
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:19,000
They have the highest right younger than 80 is is the lowest so that's pretty much the economy

179
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Any questions so far

180
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yes. lying. How about question? Yeah. Could you just explain again?

181
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So I understand it's not his script because of the Y-axis and one person falls in more than one category.

182
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Well alright on our current dismissed so you said it's not his scream, because the y-axis is not showing the percentage, but doesn't allow access to the percentage or no good question so I i'll put

183
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,000
this way, and i'll have example to explain a histogram shows a distribution period which means a histogram actually is A.

184
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's also distribution of a measurement from one variable and one variable only.

185
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So you not pay. You know the y-axis, the pistol Prime is always a frequency or percentage, or accounts, or whatsoever.

186
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Basically, that shows the number of people have measurement for you.

187
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That bar. So this is where i'm only show one variable but if you look at this bigger, they actually have 2 variables.

188
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Hey? right? The access shows the age. The Y access shows the the percentage of using tobacco.

189
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That's Okay, yeah, that makes sense You're welcome.

190
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So whenever you show 2 variables, you're not a histogram anymore, and the other questions

191
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But the other thing, you can see that if these are really percentage from a Facebook graph, then all the percentage should add up to 100% right.

192
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But they do not. Oh, that's another sign alright now, this figure this speaker is basically you know you take this bigger?

193
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No, this is different one. So the previous one was for smoking.

194
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Right smokers to battle. This one is for bench, and having a couple of use; but nevertheless, you know they are from the same population.

195
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You see the breakdown of the age group or the same Right now we have 2 bars, the life.

196
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
One is the main child, for who use the darker one is the heavy output we use.

197
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We can. So this is a good way of comparing 2.

198
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
They should do. Actually, this is not 2 distributed, but this is 2 2 variables, right?

199
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So comparing them use caller who did differentiate them.

200
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Now we can see. first of all, there are a lot more people to being out below than happy.

201
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Alcohol may not be surprising by the age distribution, are about the same right in the 2218 to 25 age group age group.

202
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
The alcohol use regardless which way is the highest

203
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You'll see the whole world population is 24% and 6, or having

204
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So this kind of figure is called the Bar Plot. so pithograph is a kind of Barbara.

205
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But overall the bar plot are using bars to show some variables right?

206
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So Barclays are not necessarily the histograms right?

207
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So usually bar cost, show the interaction between 2 variables on the app access access.

208
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
He's always a categorical you just do remember what is the categorical marble, right?

209
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Or so basically variable in different categories right it's not a continuous one.

210
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The Y. access is usually always a continuous variable, so Bar pop will show the interaction between a categorical variable and a continuous variable.

211
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And you know and sometimes we call them you know new married variable.

212
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So this case the categorical one is H. continuous.

213
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
One is use of telephone, so that's a feature of the bar pop.

214
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm here in this particular case. you've got to modify the bar call by adding, You know these error bars, which shows the sampling variability. But you don't have to we'll talk about how to

215
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:54,000
calculate that later on. Now let's talk about this one. So this one is the faithful crash per 1 million miles proven.

216
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Question. Number one is in the faith Pistol Gram, or a Bar plot, or General Barbara Bar.

217
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Plot about our plot. Yup: Thank you. Yeah, Because you know these are not.

218
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
These are cool crash rate in different 8. quote very similar to the previous one.

219
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Right. So if you look at the you know the bars.

220
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,000
This are page group of 5. trying is 5 years. Are they?

221
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Put the greater than 75 in one group.

222
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I got. That makes sense. If you keep going, you know, May, you may need to go to the age of like 100.

223
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Then there are very few. See the points there, and the arrow mass of the yeah.

224
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You may of the classroom rate will be incorrect.

225
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So longing of the guy that makes sense. We have seen this kind of thing a lot, you know, in recent years, you know, a lot of repository related statistics.

226
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So anyone want to tell me the first conclusion you want to make by looking at the speaker

227
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:20,000
On the fatal clashes. 400 million miles for the 16 to 19 age group is more and I'm.

228
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Confused about the fact that if the I mean if the age group, or for this more than 75, because that's more as well.

229
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But then, how much like what's the limit for that like 75 to how like?

230
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
What's the upper limit for that age group so you mean the last one?

231
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yeah, because this is for 3 years right so for 3 years it's 13 or 12.5.

232
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So this is more. but then, for more than 75 I wanna know like what's the age?

233
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Distribution, So if that's more or less compared to the same into 19.

234
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Yeah, that's a good point. so so like I mentioned right older than 75 is.

235
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:13,000
They can be any age. I give up to 100, but probably no one with 8 of 100 is still driving at this point from driving, so we don't really know the page distribution in this group.

236
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
They may not be the same age of the distribution of the population, because these are public drivers.

237
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But we can imagine they They drop down pretty quickly, right after 75, after 80.

238
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
There are very few people that so I would imagine those are.

239
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:37,000
These are mostly people between 75 and 80 or 85 that's. My guess it just doesn't make sense to show bars for 90 and 100.

240
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
There are very few people in there. Oh, my guys this are mostly people between 75 and 90.

241
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So You're absolutely right the number one conclusion I got from this is that the crap fatal crash rate is the you shape right?

242
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's the highest in the you know in young people, and very elderly, which is not surprising in the in the mid age group.

243
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The fatal rate is the lowest I don't start a Actually, if you, if you still remember we have got a car insurance right in this group, they got a the lowest premium because they're the safest

244
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
driver. so for many reason. But this is the what are they?

245
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The towers right, I mean. they could also break it down by gender.

246
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And you do I think female driver will have a lower rate So that's you know.

247
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If you if you do any inference you'll see I think female driver usually has a lower premium, because they are safer virus.

248
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So Yeah. there are many characteristics very interesting.

249
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Any question on this plot

250
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yeah, I remember when I was first getting, you know, driver license and getting interest.

251
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I think, older than 25 years old, You got a discount.

252
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I still remember that something called a 25, or older than 30.

253
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You got a discount that's because you know the insurance company think you are safer?

254
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Driver. Oh, there, okay, Now this one is a little trickier, you know.

255
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It takes some time who read, so I will explain it. so.

256
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So this come from a survey, and each row here is a question.

257
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:34,000
For example, S. P. 24, Q. 10 is a question 10, you know, in a survey 24 right with.

258
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
When a question being asked the the choices are strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree only 4 choices.

259
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:53,000
There's no other choice. So so the breakdown by this is either, you know, break down on different answers with different questions.

260
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Sorry. So my question is this: What kind of part of this there's a barpla. it's a histogram, is it?

261
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
What kind of pu would you describe this barbara barpa it's still.

262
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Yeah. But Marvin, any other ideas

263
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah, it's definitely a bar. Pu. There are bars right but in general this is actually a pretty interesting plot.

264
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I would have described it as this. This is a stacked sort of like a histogram.

265
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So if you look at each line here, they actually show a distribution.

266
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
They show the distribution of answers to that specific question.

267
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So each bar here is A is a so sort of a his program, but stacked on top of each other.

268
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
They could do that, because, you know, they answer only 4 bars so they stack them the gun he's not a sticking them off like this.

269
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
No ground, but they are actually comparing 10 different questions side by side.

270
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So this actually show show like a 10 or 11 sort of a compact squeeze collapse that's my take on that.

271
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Okay, So because the measurement here is still presenting.

272
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You see they come, they you see, all the bars although they are shifted, they don't have the same left, because, you know, they add up to 100% right.

273
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
All the pro full answers, add them together. they actually add them to 100%.

274
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So each part here is actually a sort of a squash is dumb histogram. So this is the manihistogram.

275
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Put the gap. They're they're being quite creative to compare the program together.

276
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Typically it's not easy, but this way. you know they show something.

277
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So I talk about the conclusion. right? so we don't really know what the question is like, so we don't really kind of make a lot all of it. So some questions people agree more than a 100 questions Dr.

278
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Dr. Jean, Can I have a question So the 59%, 53%, 50%.

279
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And then here it's 41 41 so how how do, How do we interpret that this personage?

280
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And then we have So what does that mean? minutes? 59%, And you have the both degree and strongly.

281
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So does that mean make 59% of the population agree, and strongly, How do we interpret that?

282
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, absolutely me, you you you know this very well. So I I have to say this is not a very standard pop.

283
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So, the author being very created in putting things together, and this only work for this kind of data, right?

284
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So it's not standard, but you are right the percentage here.

285
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I think you know there are 4 different answers. They order them, and then they they center them around.

286
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You know the medal between disagreement, So the percentage here matches the people agree, regardless how strongly are.

287
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And the present. here, you know, matter. People disagree. if you add up the 2 they always want to represent.

288
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So you know this very well, and then there's another question in the chat, asking is an instagram for continuous variables.

289
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I I have to go back a little bit you're right we can use pistol ground to show continuous variables that we often do that.

290
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But, by the way, we do histogram for continuous variable is that we actually convert a continuous variable into a categorical variable before we show them.

291
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Remember in the past program actually say here, I don't I don't really have example of a program here, because this is also categorical to be good with right but in the last lecture we have really have a histogram of continuous

292
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
variables, but the way we we show his requirements that we break it down.

293
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:39,000
We put, we break it down. the management into different events and then you know, collapse the continuous variable into kindergarten, or before it show the head over, because the who's grown are different bars right so show the bars

294
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Remember, Barclays always has categorical variable on the on the access. So to show continuous, variable, we have to convert them into categorical first. So we can always, of course, we can always show credit article using case, of

295
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
graph as well like this by just sometimes. it's not very informative, So you won't have 2 bars, and they add up to 100%, because you do that.

296
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's just not very informative or we could we could use K program to show distribution of different kind of variables.

297
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And the category that's a very good question alright that's mobile.

298
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
This is an example of a sort of a stacked or applause.

299
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Right. There are bars, you know, on a different role, but each part actually show the same information as a Hitler, because it shows a distribution.

300
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So the question number 2 is that why we choose to stack the percentage of each response on how in China? right?

301
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So basically, why do to we? You know, stack them horizontally?

302
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
The answer is that you don't do that then we need a whole crystal program to show the 4 bars.

303
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Then it's very hard for us to compare histogram across each other.

304
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But you have 10 histograms on top of each other, are part to put them in one plot, and to stack them on.

305
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
How each other we can't really Compare them Well, everything has a how's up, you know, Paul?

306
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Size will have a downside. I will upside downside.

307
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The upside of this is that you know it's very condensed.

308
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You can compare to 10 different questions together. right that's very nice. but the downside is that actually take more time to week, because people are not familiar with this part right?

309
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It may take you 3 to 5 min to realize what they're applying so i'll sign it down.

310
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So i'll be thinking about that way you choose a problem.

311
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And finally, by the one access indicate which bar correspond.

312
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
To which question right? The question is, Why are the bars all their vertically? from Q.

313
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
One to Q. over 11. if you see here, this is Q.

314
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
12, 5. Q. A. They are allered by the number of agrees and disagrees, but they are not ordered by the question.

315
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Original order of the question. I think they could all by the original question.

316
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:04,000
But that way. you know the plot this way. I think the last thing of this way is that you can immediately tell which person has the most disagree versus the most agree, like all the requests you know you got other off size but the downside

317
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,000
is that you cannot really tell that part anymore. We have access size today and showing, you know, you can order them different way.

318
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But you got different things out of it. So this is a result of order in the back.

319
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
A question right from Q. one Q. 2 up the way to Q.

320
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
11 i'll see that you no longer has the sort of a other responses right now.

321
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You can still see that this one at the most disagree and this one has the most agree.

322
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
But it's hard to find the Second Most and You know third most, and so on, and so forth.

323
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So there's nothing wrong with this It just depends on what you want to express in in the figure

324
00:52:48,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Okay, So this one take a look and think about whether it's a Hitler grime or bar pop give me a bar plot, I mean Barclays showing because i'm not his programs on the West all of them are apart

325
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I feel like this is a backlog. Why is that?

326
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Because it has 2 variables. Wise at the projected cap.

327
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,000
During the career, the occupation, and the other is the earning.

328
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So one category call and one continuous. Thank you. any other.

329
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Any other thoughts. I was gonna say that I I thought this for statisticalam again.

330
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Where you get a distribution. one categorical variable like the education, but it shows the whole distribution.

331
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Right, So that's the whole that they could have tested on education and increase the histogram for that showing the percentiles and the amount of money that they we're making just sort of stack them on time just like the

332
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,000
previous one so different questions, but showing a distribution of that of the findings.

333
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yeah, thank you. I I think both of you are right. It is indeed showing 2 variables by the you know the subject, and then the the numbers.

334
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But it's also if you look at each subject right each degree.

335
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They're not only showing one number they're actually showing the whole distribution using the discount house, So they are showing distribution. So each row here is like a hit program, but it is actually more like a if you still remember what I talked about Yes, it's

336
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:10,000
actually more like a box box, right? and remember the box Pop, show the Median, the the set of 25 and seventy-fifths per second.

337
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,000
How another whiskers right so there's not a standard box pop, but it's very similar to a box one but the box box and the histogram.

338
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
They both show distribution. So you can say this similar to hit the web right?

339
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So now we are basically putting 20 different distributions side by side and compare them.

340
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So this is very much similar to the previous one we showed here it's very much similar to this one, but here we just have show the whole distribution, because it's categorical.

341
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Here because it's continuous. so we actually show the the person House. right?

342
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:47,000
So both of you actually are correct. So some other times, you know, we will work being creative in your visualization.

343
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
You are not really limited to the standard path, you can actually combine them right if you know what you're doing and show it.

344
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Show that you want to show. Okay, so that you know you can think about.

345
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
What are the message you got from this pot? You know I thought several things.

346
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So first of all, apparently, you can see, for every single agree there is a Y distribution in the in the earning right?

347
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So I think this is live. you know, lifewise, more earning right?

348
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So you can see, for example, a chemistry there are people are like less than 2 million people are like you know, more than 4 million.

349
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So is a wide distribution. but across different subjects there's also a big change, right a big difference.

350
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I education. The meeting is about 2 million in chemical engineering.

351
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:55,000
The meeting is about formula. So basically the the degree program will have a big impact.

352
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
But individual in that particular degree program. You will also have a big impact.

353
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Right. so the person earned the most in education I think it's only an nineteenth person.

354
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Now it's not even a 99 person now i'm saying, The top 10 earlers in education are more than the bottom 10. you're kind of going to marry So So the post player role the individual and the and the

355
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
program

356
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Any question here

357
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So this is what we just talk about earlier is is a pie chart.

358
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Everybody know a high truck, right? so well. the Pyrrh shows is exactly the same thing as what a histogram shows is the distribution.

359
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Well, Pie chart is more limited to histogram, if you remember, and histogram you can show either continues or categorical.

360
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But for continuing, you need to first convert the category in pie chart.

361
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Pretty much. people usually only show the categorical right it's more limited. Well, outside of pie.

362
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Chart is that is, I say it's prettier it doesn't take any explanation.

363
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I I think you you don't need to be I get what I'm saying is, I even if my kids can understand this with like with our imagination.

364
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So that's very nice. So usually you see pie charts up here in magazines.

365
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:37,000
News newspapers right? the histogram world appear in scientific articles because it's It's take a little more education.

366
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm I drive more uphilling.

367
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So here it shows, you know, the port portion contribution to pretty much that.

368
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Now you see that the major contribution is behavioral power is 40%.

369
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And then the genetic for this position it's 30% so also, of course, right.

370
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So you can pick pie chart, or or is still grab to show a distribution.

371
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Are. They have pros on count. but I I as I said High chart is not as good scientifically as hazel ground, because there's many things right.

372
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Pistol work is hard to compare histor brand side by side, but it's almost impossible for you to compare Pi Trust side by side.

373
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Right cannot overlay a python on top of each other.

374
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It's just very hard, right number one and also it crystal Gram.

375
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You can show error bars, but pie chart is very hard to show error bars, either

376
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And third thing is that in histograms you can immediately see the difference of different bars buying pipes of artifact.

377
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Actually, if I don't write down 40% 30%, 2010% here, it seemed to me this this 2 pipe.

378
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:01,000
These 2 slices of pi are almost the same size, and this are the same size, so very hard for me to distinguish them, which lines bigger. right so visually.

379
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Pie chart are hard to distinguish, you know.

380
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Very close slices. histogram are easier, right, even though they take provide very little right.

381
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
You can still see this group is higher than this group, but if I put them in pie chart, you just cannot.

382
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I mean this is not a history. i'm not saying for Bars right Barp is very easy to see the difference.

383
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:33,000
P slice is very hard to have the difference. So pie charts are just not scientifically, you know, as as useful as Kito Brad.

384
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,000
But offside is very easy to read right, so there are up size.

385
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So the conclusion you know, I talk about right there. you know, Major Conference and might not contribute that so well

386
01:00:49,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So that's the example. Pie Tar how to talk about right high trials are rarely used in scientific research, but more using news and magazines, and so on.

387
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:15,000
It's more more for general audience rather than for sort of a specialized audience, and our human eye can this discriminate difference in left much better than volume right and hard to compare them side by side hardly incorporate

388
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:27,000
like variability and harrow bars right but they're just they just look better, you know you have to say and some people put a hole there, make it, though the plot, but it doesn't really change the nature, of high

389
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:33,000
turn.

390
01:01:33,000 --> 01:02:03,000
This one is a interesting one. You can take a minute to read and let me let me know what you think

391
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Okay, Anyone want to talk about you are reading of this bigger?

392
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Is it? Apparently this is, you know, of high chart plus of our pop. right?

393
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So what is showing here is a distribution is a You know what it is without reading on this

394
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:22,000
It does look like they're trying to show the district of the types of medications that are misused.

395
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:42,000
5 people is 12 or older that's kind of interesting because they could have just shown the misuse right, but they showed showed the entire pie of use right and that 97% of people just use it as prescribed and in there this is 2.3 that misuse

396
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
it broke down the misuse into categories of medication.

397
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And senators. So it's a it's a lot of information and sort of one piece.

398
01:03:52,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I guess that maybe they're trying to be dramatic and show that there is a small percentage of people that actually miss use medications and then broke down the distribution beds that are, miss, most likely to be misused.

399
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Yes, yeah, thank you. absolutely right. I mean they could show a one histogram.

400
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But that way this bar will be super long right. It will be like 100 times long on the bars, which look super bad, and pie charts is very good at, you know.

401
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Putting the small slice out of the whole high so they're very creative.

402
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:31,000
In doing this, I mean where they try. Sorry I feel like in some ways just like

403
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,000
By showing this they almost give a Miss I don't know what the word is like, you know.

404
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
You look at it, and you're like oh it's such a small percentage.

405
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:49,000
If they're trying to emphasize that it's a small percentage of people that actually misuse when it in reality is. still it's still 6.2 million people right?

406
01:04:49,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So I feel like this could potentially mislead or at least make one think it's less of an issue.

407
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, Yeah, I I I got it What you're saying I agree So weather is a mislead or purposely leading is up to there later.

408
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Didn't start a part of the way. they put it is trying to either, you know, per person.

409
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
You all i'm perversely trying to show this as a small slice, right?

410
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
If that's what they're trying to do then they're leading you to think that way.

411
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
But otherwise there might be misleading you to think that way.

412
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It is a small percentage, but it's still like 6 million people right?

413
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So either way, it's a small small percentage but still a big number.

414
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I totally agree with you and the there's one comma in the in the in the chat thing you know also the information about age is not given, although it's in the title you're right I mean this whole thing is about

415
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
page 5 or older they didn't break down by age they they could do.

416
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But you know now, now, with the much more complicated bigger.

417
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So the other man I want to talk about. This is almost a histogram, but there is one cache in the sense that a histogram remember each subject for you.

418
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
One bar and one mark only. Here is not as a Saturday case.

419
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
There could be a small percent of the people actually needs to use in both category, although maybe very rare. Right?

420
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So technically it is, may not be a issue. So there may be people misuse 2 different drugs, right?

421
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Well, that's a assume. each one only misuse one Then it is a distribution.

422
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:32,000
It is okay somewhere. Any other comments

423
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So I think the key to learn from this lecture is that there are many ways to express your data.

424
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Of course you have to think about. You want to express a distribution or many different T distribution side by side. You know 2 other variables.

425
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You want to, you know, associate and so on and so forth. No, you can't pick the way you visualize, and then you can be creative in putting them together and depending on how this and the the value you publish, right and you also have to

426
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
think about which party you want to emphasize, which part you you you know you.

427
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You want to avoid misleading it's kind of a combination of science and art.

428
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
When you present things we'll see many examples later on you know exercise right?

429
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:18,000
So visualization is more of the art than size. Sometimes

430
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Okay, So now let's move on apparently this is not a bar plot anymore.

431
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:58,000
There's no bars right. Oh, take a look at it speaker for 1 min, and and you know I don't have questions for you

432
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Okay, My question is how many variables are plotted in this speaker? and what type of variable are they? continual, categorical?

433
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Basically

434
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Anyone wants to answer 2 variables and it's continuous variables, 2 continuous miracles. You are absolutely correct.

435
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
So remember the difference. The bar Paul has, one continues, and one categorical.

436
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
So this is 2 continuous variable that's why they are not using the Barbara, which is not a good good use. right?

437
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:51,000
So the access is a percent average percent of fire on ownership. I didn't really tell you which Doc here is actually there are 50,000.

438
01:08:51,000 --> 01:09:01,000
There are 50 States we'll be dealing with the data set later, but each th the access has shows the average percent of our own ownership in that State.

439
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And then this the Y access of the number of May or fire on suicide rate 1,000 K population.

440
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Last thing. So each thought is a state, so that if you think about the the underlying data set behind this table, but behind this figure was the table.

441
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Each row is a state, each column you know it's a different variable, like farm ownership, suicide rate, and so on, and so forth.

442
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
We take 2 column from that hey? well i'm plotting you. So that's a very common way of making this kind of path.

443
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:37,000
So we have 2 continuous variables. This is the most standard part you can think of.

444
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So. yeah, conclusion conclusion. So anyone want to tell me the conclusion of this.

445
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Now, I'm telling you these are states you can imagine these are different states. right?

446
01:09:46,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So what's the conclusion? you can read from is the bigger that higher rates of ownership are associated with higher rates of firearm suicide perfect at least based on what the trend looks like Yup Yeah, absolutely right Yeah, i'm doing is

447
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,000
that very clear almost linear positive correlation between the 2 variables.

448
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:19,000
There are a few semi allliers here which do not follow the trying. perfectly. so I'll be interested to know which state this.

449
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:24,000
This one is right, this one and this one, but now the last for the majority of them, you know.

450
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:34,000
They follow track pretty linearly. So if I were to pick, I will look at this day, this date, this date, and the stay up down there right to see what they are.

451
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
So without having in the States, you may have a guess what which states they might be.

452
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Once you see the State names, you may or may not be consistent with your guests.

453
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That's how we form hypothesis other validate right

454
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
So this is the so-called scatter plot.

455
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So, for some people call the point part, but Scatterpot is a more common name.

456
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:10,000
So each point is the data point it, each subject and each growing up, you know, X and Y.

457
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Access are 2 continuous measurements, so that visualized association between 2 continuous particles. How?

458
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
What spend all the time later on in the later lecture.

459
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Talk about. How do we quantify the association we use correlation?

460
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I'm. not. How do we model them we use linear regression?

461
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
So that will be the third week of the course we talk about this kind of data.

462
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So it's a perfect time to take a break if you have a question these feel free to ask.

463
01:11:36,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Otherwise we'll come back in 10 min thank you

464
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Yes, there's a question yeah can you please explain to me the difference between a continuous and detached toical variable again.

465
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It wasn't is right here

466
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So different type of variables

467
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I saw data right There are quality pay there we call them categorical.

468
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:03,000
They're a longitated We call them continues so so basically data can be group or data cannot be grouped.

469
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
This is a continuous this is category it's just different terminology.

470
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Quality quantitative, right different now, future from you might use different terminology, but this is continuous.

471
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,000
This is a numeric, and this is the categorical.

472
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
So the qualitative is the categorical one.

473
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Okay, thank you. Thank you you're welcome doctors you know I I was just curious when you were talking about the hi you're like talking about the advantages and disparities, and you said that I forget whether it

474
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:55,000
was for the box part of the history that you have to changes a continuous variable to the categorical Yup, which one was that for sorry?

475
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:12,000
So. So this is a hit program right and it's actually showing a continuous variable, because these are the percent of annual doctor visits which are continuous right?

476
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Flaw them into a histogram. you need the first time convert them into different bars. Right?

477
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:24,000
So, for example, for anyone, any city with an answer between 55, and 60, you treat them equal.

478
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,000
No basic company. continues into a categorical before you, plotting them.

479
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Gotcha that's what I was saying thank you No problem.

480
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yeah, you have to do that for pistol ground otherwise cannot pop, can you?

481
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Dr. Jean, can you explain that again. How you're converting it into Chatabolico.

482
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I do get that? Yeah, you think about There are 500 Numbers ?

483
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
There are 500 number behind is bigger. Each one is the number between 0 to 100%.

484
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:05,000
So visualize all the 500 numbers we came out to just put 500 bars.

485
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I will have. That will be 500 bars, each one with a higher one, which look awful right, So the way that we have to bend them right, we create like a 10 different bnds, each one with the size of 5 and then

486
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:27,000
put numbers into different events that you can call the discretizing a continuous thing into a categorical thing.

487
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Okay, see that's that's what happened before you even create a pistol.

488
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Grant. Thank you. No problem. Now you have to. You have to think about how many events to use and where to put the cut off, or they they call the breaks. and the fifth grade might look slightly different.

489
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:51,000
If you change the way you you discreteize or categorize

490
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:57,000
But nowadays the software will do this automatically so sometimes you don't even realize this is being done before you know.

491
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Okay, so grammar is being called software, does it

492
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Thank you you're welcome

493
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Hi, Dr. John.

494
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Oh, hi! I have a small question about the high charge of the last patch of the combination with the patchard and the yeah the the back plot you said that there might be some overlap between the

495
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
among the like pain reli results and and quizzers.

496
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:04,000
So. Is there any kind of a gram that can show that the distribution with this overnap showing showed good question.

497
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I I don't really know I think I think the overlap will be very small, so it probably doesn't matter in this particular case.

498
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But you know there could be over I I think if you write an article, write a paper, you should have a footnote there, showing i'll be if the overlap is and it's no order ignored or something like

499
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:38,000
that. Oh, you can't completely, mandate with your notes Yeah, Yeah, I mean, i'm everything we'll have some corresponding description, you know in the manuscript or things like those where you can

500
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
talk about for you know if you don't really show the number of people here.

501
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You could show the number of misuse cases then that way.

502
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
There's no overlap because one person can have 2 cases right?

503
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Say, you know, 5 years ago you misuse one plot.

504
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:05,000
5 years later we see the other that you you come as twice. but if not, you know, if you count a number of cases rather than a normal people, then it doesn't matter that it's not considered over overlap anymore. right?

505
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So depend on how you probably describe it, because technically, in this case there might be a tiny overlap.

506
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I want to point it out. Yeah, I see. Thank you.

507
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Okay, I think it's time for us to continue so now we are done with the lecture.

508
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So we gotta spend some time doing who project especially for project 2 A.

509
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
We'll spend more time that's the one that's on it.

510
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So the whole point here is that you do something you try and use some men, you know, as long as you submit it, especially for those you take it for credit. You will get a credit for for your submission.

511
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
We won't be grading the contents i'll be If we're posting so about the hold on quote correct answer.

512
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Some of them times are suggested answers when there's no unique crap answer at the end of the the course.

513
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So you're gonna see all the answers I you know pull out with.

514
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
So the whole point here is that you do It you try it there's gonna be a group project.

515
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
You can do it as a group, but write it up something yourself.

516
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
So that is something that we know you did okay that's look at.

517
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So the summation is project away, so let's look at project 2 8.

518
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Here. when you click, click it, you will download award document.

519
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Let me move it a little bit

520
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:10,000
No second.

521
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Okay. So this is the word document. You see that there are 2 parts.

522
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:31,000
The first one is asked you to read the article shifts in, intended on entire pregnancies in the United States, and then look at only figure one in Our article is long, so we don't have time.

523
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
To go over everything. Look at people one and read the corresponding text and social speaker one, and answer the question here right?

524
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You don't have to write very long just you know you guys discuss as a group, if you like.

525
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I'm gonna write a couple of sentences down there and Then I will ask each group as a question, but on the second one. it's about another article. who's about a state cigarette tax right and then there's

526
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,000
a spreadsheet ask you to do. And then again, as of the question here, you can just type.

527
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Give it a it's helpful you can just pipe it in right.

528
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:11,000
And then, after this exercise you can just come in right you don't have to be doesn't have to be correct.

529
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
The key is not to try, so I will go over a little bit of articles, right.

530
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:25,000
The articles are here, for example, this is the one of the article downloaded from here, and that's the audio independent practices. right?

531
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And then the question is about bigger. one is about this figure.

532
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
So you read the speaker and read associated tax around it.

533
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
You can just search people one, and you know the search. 3 go one.

534
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,000
You see, this is a description figure one. So we basically read this and read necessary packs.

535
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
But you don't have to read the whole paper I will typically read the abstract right, and so on and so forth.

536
01:25:50,000 --> 01:26:00,000
But we don't have time to read the whole paper here read the figure and answer the questions, and the other thing is, you know, for for questions.

537
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
The part. 2 you're gonna use this crash it so the data files out here.

538
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I mean, this is not a another payroll, because down there this is another paper right required to answer other questions.

539
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And so also for us but actually there's a table here. so you can download the table from here. But there's a 500 CD data that is deadly dressed.

540
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Drive data is a hawking data. So this data is called this paper right?

541
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And so well, some of them are for Project 2 through Donald the first one in data with your dialogue that will be expressed.

542
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Sparrow sheet i'm then you can use this spreadsheet.

543
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So what this stressed is doing I would out down and show you you're download the spreadsheet and open it, using itself

544
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
So

545
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Okay, this is what you've got in the spreadsheet, I mean, make a small right?

546
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
So this brush. It will take the data So you just copy paste your data from the data spreadsheet.

547
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I provided there you don't change any you don't need to change anything.

548
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Here. You just copy paste here. the scratch will make a histogram for you.

549
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
It doesn't look pretty, but it is a work about histogram.

550
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Okay, I will demonstrate how to use it Well, some of the questions you'll run into later on.

551
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So, for example, you'll download this 500 city data right down all this data.

552
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Are you open it

553
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Hold on a second

554
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So this is the 500 city data. You see, each row is a city.

555
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
There are 500 of them. Each column is a variable and also post.

556
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
We want to make a we want to make a pistol brand of one of the variables.

557
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Say this is the annual checkout bye what's your gonna do?

558
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
You can you know there are many where you can copy the data this way.

559
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I'll be one way you just select this whole column right for those of you who are not familiar with excel.

560
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I'll slow down a little bit. so you can see right you use. You'll select this column, you can just drag it, using the mouse to drive it.

561
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I know you have either collect this. This is a copy, I believe or you can right click here.

562
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I'm gonna copy either way. you copy this call and they'll switch to the other spreadsheet here, and then click this box.

563
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:57,000
You can click this bottom paste, or you can this bottom, hey?

564
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Right or you kind of click, right click, i'm very paced bye, I I think this this button will be sufficient, or you can just say, Ca: you could just type control c.

565
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Control. V. If you're using Mac you can use you know command c.

566
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Command V. cause i'll copy you pay let's pay for here.

567
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So the data is pasted here. You see 500 that data points down here.

568
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I'm done the corresponding pitigram will be phone this way right?

569
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:31,000
You can change a little bit the number of events. Yeah, say change it to 18, you know they look different.

570
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
They actually put some empty base here which do not look good.

571
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:40,000
But nevertheless, you show the hitogram right so exactly. you don't touch the men or max on all of this.

572
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
These are automatically being created using the scratchy also don't change anything.

573
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
On the second sheet, because that's the part polar you know calculation is done. we'll make this crash.

574
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It. You just copy the data here and change the beans if need it.

575
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,000
And then the figure was showing here. Then you can copy Paste the figure into your word document. right?

576
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:05,000
You can copy this speaker example you can you can copy it or control, c.

577
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I'm going back to the word document either need it you can just paste it here right so that will control V or pay the with it here.

578
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So it just copy paste costs have you pay most of the time.

579
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:24,000
That's all you need to do there may be some more of us it's you know, exile usage later on, and i'll slow down by then.

580
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
To show you, but if you do have questions, please feel free to ask us.

581
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:43,000
You know, during this course, or you know come to our office hours, we're more than happy to help one catch is that once this data sheet is very long, right, and if you want to pay the smaller data, So you'll pay another

582
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:53,000
small data. Then the remaining one will stay there. You have to believe that before you pay new things, or you can just follow the same threshold from the you know, download this again.

583
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So I have a new brand new one. Okay, just be careful.

584
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,000
If you use the old one, you have to clean up the data before you put your new data right.

585
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:12,000
So clean up you select the whole thing again. select the whole thing I'm Benny, you can just caught i'm not really caught you.

586
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:19,000
You have to hi the lit right type of the button, and that will be gone, or you can right Click!

587
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I believe there is a delay right click and then delay and then it's a little tricky.

588
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Oh, you can ship cell sales! Oh, there we go. So I think the delivery is the easiest, so I hope this is helpful.

589
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:41,000
But you know, if you still right or trouble, you can ask yourself for help, or you can ask your group, mates for home.

590
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Alright. so any questions before I send you 2 breakout rooms

591
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So I will create maybe 5 breakout rooms i'm. Now remember the rule, so that the tomorrow you have the same room.

592
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Can I just check? Are we supposed to do this as a group?

593
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,000
And yeah, you are. I think you can. You can do either way. if you want to do it yourself. feel free.

594
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
You can stay in the lobby if you want, and do it yourself.

595
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Totally fine, and also doing a group. I I just feel like you know, give you more interaction with other people.

596
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Okay, I mean either way it's it's not The key is that you do it.

597
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:45,000
You're fine don't have to get it right but you know the case that you try

598
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Yeah, if you have other questions, please let me know.

599
01:32:52,000 --> 01:33:12,000
So I will. I will create groups today and then tomorrow i'll use the same group, and next week I will create new groups, so that if you got a Mingo with different people each week

600
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Well again give you a 25 min. it may not be enough for some of you. but that's fine.

601
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:25,000
We'll come back, Do it together, cause I cannot you know keep like $1 on this.

602
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
If you feel like 25 min is too long.

603
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
How many of the how many of you prefer like 20 min or 15, or how many?

604
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Pre 4 30, any any common, I think 25 is fine.

605
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Alright, i'll try it. you know if you all of Your fuel is pulled out through short weekend adjusted for the keys that you know.

606
01:33:47,000 --> 01:34:02,000
You got some time talking to each other. Okay.

607
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It's all

608
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Okay, well come back. I hope you all had a great time working together.

609
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:28,000
So for the rest of this this session. we will going over the questions together.

610
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I i'm not sure whether you still remember which room You're from.

611
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:41,000
But there are room 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yeah. Are you gonna be stick with that room for the rest of this week?

612
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So hopefully. you know which room you're in if you don't let me know.

613
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I? I Okay, how are you? So knowledge

614
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Let's go over the questions Okay.

615
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:23,000
I don't follow them again

616
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Okay, hope you can see them now. that's the question i'll be working on. So what I would do is i'll go around the room and maybe each group can have a volunteer answering each question, and I will Rotate

617
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:44,000
you know, throughout the the course, so that everybody got chance to talk

618
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:56,000
So the first question is about the figure one in this paper they asked about go one conclusion with respect to race or ethnic difference in the rate of I intended pregnancy.

619
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:05,000
So the pay price here on the figure. Sorry not to. Yeah, the figure is here.

620
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:12,000
So anyone else answer that first question? I just asked

621
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Room, one anybody room one you just do remember which room you are, you?

622
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Yeah, I mean, I was in room one let me see here.

623
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
And so the first for the first question, I said, there the Ps.

624
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:37,000
The overall rate is highest in the black population, then Hispanic population, and then the white population, regardless of social, economic status or the end economics.

625
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Sorry. No, thank you. Anybody has other calls. Oh, that you all agree with this?

626
02:02:47,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Answer perfect. Yeah. You're: Absolutely. right? is basically you see the you know the the difference of the 3 group stay the same automatically across the 3 in Kongoo.

627
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Okay, thank you. Now question 2 by the same question. But now, with report to income level in the in the paper.

628
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:26,000
So someone from group 2 volunteers

629
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I hope you still remember your cool I was in group, too.

630
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I can do it. Yeah. So we saw that the lower the income level, the higher the rate of unintended pregnancies across all racial and ethnic backgrounds. perfect.

631
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Thank you. Yeah, I I think you all agree with this one as well. so I won't waste time here.

632
02:03:50,000 --> 02:04:01,000
If that's absolutely correct, you see that all the race race group their I intend the proxy rate increase when you decrease the the income level.

633
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:09,000
So they're trying Is there? So with this kind of data I think it's pretty convincing, although you may ask right, Why do you break down into 3 Google like this?

634
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
What do you do? Other breakdown with the transit?

635
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Different with a strong different like this. I would think, you know, no matter how you break it down.

636
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:21,000
The trend is there right? is real real trend and there is very good reason behind it.

637
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:26,000
We'll ask you in a later question. So now let's move on to a more interesting question.

638
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I'm sorry, you know. different group of allocated with different kind of question. but hopefully, throughout 3 weeks they will every job.

639
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
So the third question is that your agency director asked you.

640
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
If a race, I think difference in the rate of I intended practice.

641
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:45,000
So this is a pretty quick question, because the previous 2 customer only has a one variable right?

642
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:51,000
So this planet is there, you know. is there a one in Palm Level group?

643
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Where race racial, I think, is probably a greater.

644
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:03,000
And so this President, providing American evidence So this is a trickier question. So it's on group 3 now.

645
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Yes, I can answer that. I put that. Yes, in the less than 100% income group.

646
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:20,000
There was a great between the Black Women group compared to the white women in my which is 53 points as well as many.

647
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Compare the Hispanic Women group with the white women group.

648
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:40,000
We get greater discrepancy of 40 points, as though but when the black women group was compared with the Hispanic women, the greater discrepancy of 70 points was observed in a feature group chrome or more than 200

649
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:50,000
percent. Okay, So I think there is an interaction you think Sorry if I'm following Crappy.

650
02:05:50,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I think, as income increase the discrepancy become larger or smaller, which one you're saying smaller. smaller.

651
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Yeah, if you look at the numbers right here, the differences, 52% here, you know, between the largest and lowest, highest and lowest group.

652
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,000
This is 26 this. Why, is still 31 so it's called down, and then go off.

653
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Another study plan. bye changing anybody, I mean, I agree with you.

654
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,000
The numbers are the numbers right you have. when you have the numbers back in your conclusion up you are stronger, right?

655
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:34,000
So anybody has different opinion. Oh, hey, Google, Yeah, I actually took this a little bit differently.

656
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:46,000
If you look at the the numbers as percentages, the the group who were more than 200%, the Federal poverty level The black non hispanic group, were 2 and a half times more likely than the white

657
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
non-hispanic women to have unintended pregnancies.

658
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Looking at the number. you know 20 as a pair compared to 51, and that's size discrepancy was not seen.

659
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:05,000
So that's degree. In the less than 100% of the poverty level group. Thank you.

660
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Thank you very much. I I again I I agree with you as well.

661
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
So sometimes there. There are 2 seemingly contradictory arguments.

662
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Both have valid points, so we get. We just have to get used to it.

663
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:24,000
So I explain what we'll just add you know if you look at the relative difference rather than an absolute difference.

664
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Right here is one, you know you can look at the white versus black, just you know, 163 over 1 10.

665
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:36,000
That's about like 50% more or 40 to 50% more.

666
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:47,000
But here it's like 2.5 times more right so the relative difference actually increase will increase income level. So both are correct.

667
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:50,000
If you look at an absolute difference, they are decreasing.

668
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:58,000
If you look at Apps relative different, they are increasing. So this is the tricky thing.

669
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:09,000
So you can imagine this paper. They can talk about this difference being associated with the, you know, racial difference being associated with income level, but they can make both sides of argument.

670
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
So you wasn't gonna go off the difference goes smaller or goes Florida.

671
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Do you know what difference you are measuring right so that's Why, we need to be very careful in a way.

672
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
They so stay there. Staying, you know. Think about this is the whole paper. We have the data with a figure.

673
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,000
We have everything right, so we can make our own judgment by looking at bigger.

674
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:29,000
But what if we just read the newspaper have a title?

675
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,000
There, though, without going back to the to the raw data, we just follow.

676
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Whatever the the journal is the same Right I I see both sides have value arguments.

677
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Actually, the way I look at it is that if there is some really something going on between, you know the gap and income level, then you would imagine the trend to be sort of a static, just like you know when we look at a question number

678
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:01,000
one and 2. the trend is there it's very strong trend there, you don't really nobody will really challenge that.

679
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:07,000
But but now, if you look at the trend regardless is relative or absolute.

680
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:14,000
They actually first go down here and then go up again. right it's not a sort of a linear trend.

681
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:19,000
So you have this U shape sort of a change which has the doubt to me.

682
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:24,000
That is, Is there really a difference? right if they're really an interaction?

683
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:34,000
How come the middle group doesn't really follow that trend So I would give much less confident on whatever computer you you can make regarding an interaction.

684
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:42,000
We talk about interaction later on, but basically interaction between income and the ratio, because you can have both sides of argument.

685
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,000
And also the trend is not clear. I was all of this include it.

686
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I wouldn't make a strong computer out of anything that's my personal pay.

687
02:09:51,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I don't know about yours any comment

688
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I mean, I think, when I looked at it when we get to the next question, it just seems like there's other factors here aren't being represented.

689
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Maybe you weren't weren't taken into account for the study in order to sort of create that that link that calls a relationship that I think we're looking for the graph here.

690
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:33,000
So just because it doesn't follow the linear friend one with one would think that there's something else that play here that may be affecting what we're seeing and not just the race or economics.

691
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Yeah, thank you very much that's why we have the the the next question perfect.

692
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:43,000
That's the perfect you know hi mike go to the next question.

693
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:52,000
So. so. yeah, essentially, I think I think it's in this deputable, no doubt, that you know the trend in the income and the racial difference is there.

694
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:04,000
But when you talk about interaction it's much much more tricky or business, I don't think it's a conclusive here. so let's go to the number 4 question as just mentioned you know do you believe racial

695
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:11,000
or you call association with I amended pregnancy that you'll see in question 102 and what's your take on this?

696
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:26,000
So now let's move on to group 4 and then you volunteer from group 4

697
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I may have been in Group 4, and I think exactly what.

698
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Sorry I forgot your name, but the last person said, Is that

699
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:50,000
There are just too many social determinants of health when it comes to and income to to draw a causal community here perfect, perfect, Any other comments

700
02:11:50,000 --> 02:12:01,000
We. We also said that for our group. Oh, study that!

701
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:08,000
You can always zoom causation either

702
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Great thanks. thanks, both of you. Yeah, you're absolutely right so we We can talk about this for a long time.

703
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:22,000
There are many possible explanation of this result but automatically This is the observational study.

704
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,000
It's not randomized trial I don't know why this retrospective Probably retrospective right?

705
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:36,000
So there are all sorts of bias. in collecting the data that's one thing. but the major thing from observational studies that you cannot rule out confounding.

706
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:45,000
So so regarding the specific question, right there could be, and causal relationship between, for example, race.

707
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:52,000
And I intend to call fine for the pro department. see but I just don't see why that could be the case right?

708
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Just being in a particular racial group make it more likely to be, you know, to have I and the pregnancy.

709
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I just don't see the argument going down there so it's so, although we see a strong association here, a strong difference.

710
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:15,000
But it's probably going through other products like you know association with Zoom My income is already already addressed here, but maybe association with educational level.

711
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Other social Catholic. You know economic status. I know there could possibly be your interaction.

712
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:29,000
You know the association between income and I intended pregnancy, which I do see some potential puzzle link between them.

713
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Right, but either yes or no that's based on my own sort of a intuition and judgment.

714
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Not. from this data there could be association. but this data is not a strong sort of a clothing evidence to support that because this is observational data, association, correlation, doesn't mean causation.

715
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:55,000
We cannot draw a conclusion of anything causal, so the income may be associated with.

716
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Again educational level and other things sorry much which again, in theappropriate soldier is fine and pregnancy right?

717
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:10,000
So again again again, we're gonna write to these kind of questions So probably we do see association which may or may not.

718
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:18,000
You know how underlying causal causal revision backing up, we need the further study. right.

719
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Incorporate other confounding factors, and covered many other other study.

720
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,000
To finally have a more evidence you're making that kind of conclusion.

721
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:30,000
So this is a a good sign. So, having association means, there could be associated.

722
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:39,000
But we just cannot say for sure any question I I didn't again.

723
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I obviously didn't read the whole article But I don't know what's their end like when number of number of data points that they have to sort of create this plot and then my other question was where did they get

724
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:57,000
the the data from right. So if you if you sort of pick and choose where you're getting the data from, then that could skew right.

725
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:07,000
What the data looks like. Very good point. so the nice thing is that article like this usually will describe all of them in detail. Party.

726
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:15,000
You don't Have time to read but you know usually they have a section describe their study design right?

727
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And let's see matthews how do you get there data.

728
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:25,000
So yeah, here, right, they got them from National, some national survey right now.

729
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Several national survey with people between this year and this year, right?

730
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:40,000
And the sorry, probably because there's a national survey probably cover more than one state under this you know sample size something like in thousands.

731
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:45,000
But they do have some description and sources. so I think scientific paper are better than magazine.

732
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:51,000
They says that they are more rag Ross in in in describing Where are the data come from?

733
02:15:51,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Well, that's very very good questions right you need to be careful, because we keep the data come from a you know specific time, period, or specific region.

734
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Then why that's generalizable to the whole us today is questionable right?

735
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Have to be careful of those. Usually the author will put up some discussion of the limitations of their study and data size in the discussion section.

736
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Later on, if you'll read them right so they will usually they will abstract and background and description of the matters right.

737
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:24,000
How do they analyze data? How do they collect the data and describe the results and have some discussion?

738
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:36,000
You know, interpretation. The results finally have a discussion usually include, you know, other parallel work, whether they support or not, support the conclusion here, and also the limitation.

739
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:43,000
So usually that make a whole study. And finally, you know, some acknowledgement and funding given complex interest, right?

740
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:50,000
If they have a company interest, they should put it here, so that makeup a complete article.

741
02:16:50,000 --> 02:17:05,000
So any other comments or questions or suggestion that before we move on to the second part of the exercise

742
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Okay, and we have a couple more minutes, you know. we may not be able to finish, but we take a break on continual background.

743
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:23,000
So the second one is regarding this state cigarette tax, I don't know whether you've got a time to finish, but we'll do it together anyhow, and you can just type, in and submit or you can just

744
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:30,000
summarize partiality that should be fine. So we need to use the data. And then look at this.

745
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:36,000
You know. Hawkins data right that's just all the data right now.

746
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Right here. So it's the hawkins data right here, without all the data.

747
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:57,000
This Here, give me a second

748
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Okay, this is the one you're seeing i'm making it a little smaller, so that you can see.

749
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:15,000
So this is the data set about 29 States, not all the 50 States, And then the full variables are percent smoking number of Perth smoking pads and tax.

750
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Change. You have to read the article to know what is variables.

751
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Are Bonarica. Guess right is the percent of people smoking.

752
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
That state is number birth in a state given probably in a, you know.

753
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Give them here yet. and then the smoking tax rate Oh, that's great.

754
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:35,000
But tax a month in that State. I know this is changing types between 2 2 time points. Right?

755
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I guess there is a positive change. There is a change in pass, so all of these are describing the paper. I listened.

756
02:18:42,000 --> 02:19:03,000
There. So these are the this the plot. So someone tell me what kind of a part of it pistol ground, or Barbara

757
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:10,000
So this is a plotting, percent smoking body in the first variable here.

758
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:15,000
So it is a far part right, Because it's 50 states categorical.

759
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:22,000
And then why access is another variable So basically we're plotting 2 variables here.

760
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Okay, So the first question is that from this figure what's conclusion What's your conclusion?

761
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I mean you could have different conclusion but i'm sorry

762
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Now he's group 5 ivd the last group

763
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Oh, our group said that they didn't have the highest descendant mother she smelled her pregnancy.

764
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Well, Alaska, happiness! Alaska had the least.

765
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Oh, sorry. Do you see? Dc. has the least, and Arizona has the least.

766
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I know West Virginia at the highest yeah over always from 5 to 20% like this.

767
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:24,000
There's a big range of this process smoking oh, that's what it is.

768
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Percent of mother who smoke during pregnancy so that's a specific population. There's study.

769
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:37,000
You have to read a article to know what they're studying, but we do see a wide range, and the question now immediately raised in my head.

770
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Is that what makes this difference? right? Is it like a different geographic area?

771
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Or is it, you know, like a political or other things? or you know, I think one question.

772
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:53,000
They they invite in the paper is that is, the cigarette hacks associated with it with higher past.

773
02:20:53,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Keep on a small class right that's a new question I have the read the article to see their study design what their conclusion.

774
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:07,000
But from here we see a different space has very different rates.

775
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Okay. The next question is that now all of the value in column B: smallest, larger, largest.

776
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:20,000
What mind is Bar Pop referred to the wire this stuff, so I will do the rearrangement myself.

777
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,000
So for those of you who are not familiar with excel.

778
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I hope you are now hi here. So we do this right.

779
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:36,000
So the way you order is value, pick this column you go to after you could do it here.

780
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:42,000
But you go to the data, and there you click this one smallest, the largest you ask you.

781
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:49,000
You want to expand the selection, you say? yes. So now this is sorted from the lowest to the highest.

782
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:56,000
You know you. you have a hard time following me. If I watch the recording by essentially select the call, go to the data sheet, then you can.

783
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:11,000
You have water, and now it's ordered this way you can easily see Dc. and Arizona as the lowest West Virginia is much higher alright, you know I wouldn't ask but I personally prefer

784
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:18,000
this bigger, better the previous one. I forgot the prevail. that was all.

785
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:23,000
The alphabetically, the space right, which will your other space alphabetically.

786
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I think the you know everything that's outside the downside when you want a hypothetical it's very easy to find your almost thing.

787
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Say I can easily find Michigan very quickly but that's pretty much the only outside, right.

788
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Well, you all there, you know, based on numbers it's easy to see the high and lowest i've been Now, if I really see the for example, the lowest 5 lowly for 5 on a high for 5 to see why though they are

789
02:22:47,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Geo. you know geographically clauster it doesn't seem to me to be the case maybe a little bit

790
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,000
There is a call

791
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:15,000
There is a question. there's a private question to me on their different data sets, because the mine has a loss.

792
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:22,000
That was 5.6%. A last call is 8 L.

793
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Right here.

794
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Yeah for for mine of I don't know maybe I have to like re-load it on excel.

795
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,000
But this is from mine that Alaska is 5.6%.

796
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:43,000
That's why I said alaska at least so I was just curious if it was like a difference, or let's do this.

797
02:23:43,000 --> 02:24:01,000
I think what you did is that when you do the sorting and the you did expand the selection, So you only saw this call while keeping these columns stay the same. Yeah, So i'm asking off the data when you're

798
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:08,000
sorting. So I have to be careful. yeah, it should be the same data set right. When you do the sorting always expand the selection.

799
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Every role will be My recall will sort of thing.

800
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Okay, So like I said. Personally, I like the second plot.

801
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:24,000
But this is just, you know my personal pay right? You can see now the the lower 5 Dc.

802
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Arizona, Ali, Connecticut, and Yuda.

803
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I already see any common commenting among them. the highest, you know.

804
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
This is main right, and the Oklahoma Missouri

805
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:43,000
This is Montana, West Virginia. I I already see a lot.

806
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:52,000
You know the size main. the other for sort of a consider these days, but they are not geographically similar, so I don't really see it very strong trial.

807
02:24:52,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Anyway. I Don't know about you final question i'm Sorry I'm running a little long, but we will take a break after this question.

808
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Now all of the value in column B by the cigarette tax rate smallest behind.

809
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Can you now make any conclusion about how the presented mother, who smoke is relatively related to cigarette tax?

810
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:19,000
If so, how do you conclude let's do this right so this is so.

811
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Right Now we're doing is that we are ordering by right here.

812
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:31,000
We just do the other again expand the selection so what's happening now?

813
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Is that although it's similarly there's no not older now, these States are ordered by their tax rate.

814
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:43,000
But we are plotting there, you know, smoking during pregnancy.

815
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:47,000
So if you assume he's right how's the impact on smoking.

816
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Nice to see you china here, right, for example, lower top tax rate will have a higher smoking higher that we will have lower smoking.

817
02:25:56,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Oh, do you see a trial? Yeah, you. You may feel like there is the downward trend.

818
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:10,000
If you just look at this far. But I would I would think think those are sort of the determined by this single outlier.

819
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Take this thing out There's no trial what's the level so just from this data, it doesn't seem to be that tax rate has an effect.

820
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Aw smoking. Of course it's much more involved question right there are pretty confounding with the other things.

821
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:34,000
How to flap the data there's only 30 space why don't you have 50, you know, all those things right?

822
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:51,000
But just from this data along I don't see a trend any coma

823
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Oh, sorry, I I think you know with with tobacco and nicotine.

824
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:08,000
It's always an interesting question as to like how long have they been smoking before they got pregnant right like the likelihood of pregnancy might be related to the level of a d addiction. like Did they just start when

825
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:20,000
they got pregnant or you know it says mothers who smoked or pregnancy, so that there's like a time frame where we don't know how long they've been smoking before the pregnancy you know

826
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,000
that that could definitely affect their choice to continue to smoke during the preference.

827
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I mean there's a real sort of medical component to it that I think they sort of I guess I don't know they couldn't.

828
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I didn't ask those questions a good point you come I had.

829
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I guess it's not boning up rather than now anymore.

830
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:54,000
But for future courses. But I was confused about question 6, because I think the number 4 should be number 5.

831
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Cause the question is, why so? I I was confused.

832
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:05,000
How very good point this would be. 5: Right? Yeah. Yeah. good point.

833
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I will fix it. Thank you so much

834
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Alright, let's take another break and come back in 10 min.

835
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,000
We have another exercise to do it. the pastor this time.

836
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:30,000
You know you only need to submit this one so based on that, If you doing all that will be you know you can forget about it.

837
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Thank you.

838
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Yeah, I do have a question once a meeting do we have?

839
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Do you want to put those those bar plots onto or dot?

840
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Yeah, you're good. you could you could put in there but really really it doesn't matter.

841
02:28:51,000 --> 02:29:00,000
You know the key is that you didn't you submit we're not gonna grade, but we're not going to create a via cable score, because we already review all the questions right.

842
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:04,000
We just marketed you some men okay, alright, Great: No problem.

843
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Thank you.

844
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Okay, Now let's continue so there's a project B.

845
02:37:51,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Which is much shorter. I will open it. no

846
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:19,000
The product. P. The first part is much shorter there's a second part.

847
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:27,000
So for the sake of time, I like us to just do it together.

848
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Okay. So So the first few questions is the ball of figure right here.

849
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Alright, let's go over. the questions so at the end of the assignment is a bigger all the following questions based on this figure. Number one describe 3 conclusions You would make probably for me here presenting the figure let's Look

850
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:56,000
at the figure together. you can open it on your computer if that's helpful.

851
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:11,000
But is it from up? Probably a magazine it's a little polar for the first one is the drug right from Harry and Morphane. alcohol, and all different kind of drugs all the way down here aspirin

852
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,000
you know, aspirin, and you know cannabis and solvent.

853
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:19,000
And then the second column is the number of the dot.

854
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:23,000
So. what it did is that these are, you know. this is a very blurred.

855
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:29,000
These are from some database, you know Google News. So this is our reporting.

856
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Oh, these are the number of that from that particular drop, you know, particular period.

857
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I believe this is from Uk i'm the third call on is the press reports.

858
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:46,000
So all of the number of death right? These are the number of press reports of the death.

859
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:52,000
And finally, if the percent of death reported, I think this number is divided by that number 9%, 2%.

860
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:56,000
So on, so forth, so that's now take a look at this plot.

861
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:03,000
It's very interesting plot. let's look at it for like 1 min, and then I want the fuel of you to tell me what you find from.

862
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:08,000
There's a lot of information here, so I won't be surprised at different, you know, different ones, and you find different things.

863
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:31,000
That's Okay.

864
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Okay, anyone want to say first, you know just one thing you'll find from this most striking to you

865
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I can say that the drug that that calls the higher number of deaths are not the ones that are most pressed reported.

866
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Thank you. Yeah. So basically, in the percentage between this and this, right, they they vary quite a bit.

867
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Right. So the number, not high number of that do not really have the highest number of report.

868
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:07,000
So. the highest number of that is Harry and morphine.

869
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Well, highest number reporting is cocaine. Anybody find something else

870
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Well, I mean it looks like the highest percentage. reporting his cannabis, which is surprising, cause I don't know that I've ever seen a statistic, noting.

871
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Cannabis related that very interesting. Yeah, you made a very good point.

872
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I mean this is from Uk so I don't really know how people report there.

873
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Maybe you know that was 2,008, right? So you know the news reporting the very the cost time.

874
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Sometimes people focus on one kind of events what what's the striking for me is that you see the the percentage is like 2%, 9%, 5%.

875
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Here, but the percentage for cannabis was like 484%, which means for every single death.

876
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:10,000
They have like 5 reports. This one New York all of these are underreported, but this is super you know, over recording.

877
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:19,000
So that's what's The striking yeah thank you Anything else kind of along those lines.

878
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:32,000
The press reports seem to focus on like very specific dreads, and not the ones that are awesome with the highest number desk

879
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Yeah, I i'm not sure if I you know follow you clearly.

880
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:44,000
You probably are saying, Yeah, maybe you can repeat it cause I didn't I didn't care it clearly.

881
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:53,000
So the press reports, for, like cocaine, is hard to 57 and 83 for heroin and morphine and 92 of our campus.

882
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:03,000
But they're they're focusing on drugs that we hear about often, but not necessarily on the things that cause what the most number?

883
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Yeah, Thank you. Yeah, I totally agree with you. They report, you know.

884
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:17,000
They? they just pick a few drop to report. So apparently the journalist in Uk that time has their own agenda right?

885
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:26,000
They report a can they all can of us? Yeah. And if you see, like alcohol, cause so many that are real, only report 2% of them.

886
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Bye, So you know they they have their their agenda.

887
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Alright, I think I think we we learn this quite well now, that's move on to the second question

888
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:55,000
A colleague of yours. tell you that he has known It's a sharp increase in reports of Cannabis relief death in the news, and he's concerned about public health. impact.

889
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,000
The cannabis is having a Uk route of other drugs.

890
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:08,000
How might you respond to this statement? Anyone

891
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Yeah, I I mean, I think the first thing I would point out is the fact that this really cannot be scientific, right?

892
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Because can't have more deaths reported than actual deaths that doesn't make sense right.

893
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:31,000
You can't have 19 and then have reported 92 times. I didn't know the sell to make me suspicious that this is inaccurate absolutely I I think there are just different newspaper Probably report

894
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:45,000
the same death again again. again. right? when they don't the names. You actually don't know whether they're the same that or now that's why it's being open yeah I mean I I think what I can say to my colleague

895
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:50,000
is that this you know you just cannot or something like that.

896
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:55,000
You know, you have to know where where they are what they're really reporting right what's the underlying data?

897
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:00,000
And they they have their apples. They had their focus, right.

898
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,000
But which may not be black, the the real world right?

899
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,000
So there may or may not be a increase in Canada.

900
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:17,000
But even if there is, by the number of 19, it compared nothing to like alcohol, Harry, or you know other kind of a drug, I'm not saying my team is not a big number.

901
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Oh, just you cannot use, reflected the the reality, just by looking at a new script was. There may or may not be a increasing kind of us, just by looking at the number of reports being increased any other comments

902
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Okay. Third question: If you run a public health agency in Uk focused on drug abuse prevention based on the information presenting in this figure, what would you propose?

903
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Your agency focuses resource. Say you have 1 million dollar this year to give right where you want to spend it on.

904
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Explain your answer. There are other other statistical information. you might.

905
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:17,000
You might want to have to help you make the decision

906
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Anybody. I would probably want to focused my spending on the highest number of deaths, but also the ones that are least reported in that highest number of deaths.

907
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:41,000
So focusing that specific not just specifically on hair within morphine, but also on alcohol who despite the fact that it's pretty high number of deaths has decreased report because potentially there's a number of

908
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:46,000
people that just don't understand or realize that alcohol composed us.

909
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:53,000
And so knowledge is power in that regard. So I would probably focus on on those 2 areas.

910
02:46:53,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Cool. Thank you. Anybody else

911
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:10,000
So I I agree with what she said. However, I would want a little bit more information to see if there's any like co-orbid use.

912
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:15,000
So like our folks, possibly using both hairwin and alcohol or mixing drugs.

913
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:20,000
I think that could be helpful information regarding like death as well.

914
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Thank you. agree with you. Anybody else

915
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Yeah, I mean, I I think we all have to save lives right?

916
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:39,000
So with limited resource. We want to spend on those, you know.

917
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
We have the hope of saving more lives, or in the reduced call, mobility as well. So I totally agree with you.

918
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:49,000
We should focus on this. But personally I have a 5 different thinking is that I wanted.

919
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Another piece of information is about a number of users. right?

920
02:47:52,000 --> 02:48:06,000
So, for example, all of the 897 that how many users underlying this, so I I would imagine you know there, maybe much less user of hiring and more pin than the number of user alcohol.

921
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:10,000
The reason I ask is because if there are like hundreds of you know Uk, they don't.

922
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Maybe tens of millions of alcohol users.

923
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Then just spending a 1 million dollars wouldn't make a debt right? cause you know Alvo has been there.

924
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Why did he use everywhere commercial, everywhere, your 100 million dollar funding? wouldn't really make a difference?

925
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:29,000
But you may actually make a big difference on Harry and Morph and other drugs.

926
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:35,000
So basically, I think it's the same russia now we just want to use save as much life and as possible.

927
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:39,000
But you know where it was spending on is is sort of a strategic right.

928
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:45,000
So, so the number of Keys information, I think, is missing is a number of users of each one of the drop.

929
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Here any comments

930
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:03,000
I also think kind of from a From a whole account standpoint, you can kind of groups some of these as well.

931
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Right. So the heroin and morphine users Typically, then, from a medical standpoint, when they go to recovery often, we use yeah, alright.

932
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:15,000
And so, you know, if you're trying to get the most bang for your buck.

933
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:22,000
I guess you could sort of group something these and and see if the messaging could be aimed at both groups of users.

934
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Yeah, I agree. I mean some of them are very similar.

935
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:32,000
They probably have the same means of you know use so it's easier to talk about target on this you know at the same time.

936
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:36,000
So also. I think some of this I don't know about Uk right.

937
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,000
But some of these are probably legal. some of them are illegal.

938
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:49,000
So the way to counter them a totally different right but for the legal drugs. You probably want to spend money on a you know, prescription or other things right on legal buses. That's a totally different story.

939
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:55,000
It's much harder to stop so I I think it depends on the way you spend your money, and you can group them.

940
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:03,000
And then, you know, take the why you think it's most promising of making a difference that was a limited amount of funding cool.

941
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Anything else.

942
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Alright number 4. Why do you think the crater of this speaker choose to close, to order the drugs by the value of number of that rather than by the price report column?

943
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:34,000
So this is older by the number of that they're not well by the second or the third call.

944
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:38,000
So. I think in this case the the authors.

945
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:45,000
They wanted to highlight the the number of debts and so, and then they wanted to like highlight.

946
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:54,000
The discrepancy between the number of press reports and Because it's not proportional to the number of deaths. So that's what they wanted to highlight that's Why?

947
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:58,000
I think they have We ordered it according to accordingly.

948
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Yeah, I I totally agree. just like the the exercise. We just did right different order, and give you a different emphasis, although the same piece of information here, I think they want to highlight the number of death.

949
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:12,000
But if they order by the second or third column, they are really highlighting.

950
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:22,000
You know how bad the media is how biased the media I think that's not a point here, although they show the information for for us to make the judgment, but they don't wanna highlight.

951
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:26,000
That right. They still want to find out of that I think that's a wise move.

952
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Your voice twice sounds to me

953
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Any other comment. I also think it's this is very misleading, because the number of tests, as you said, the total population is not specified.

954
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:48,000
So, and also, for example, morphine you give it sometimes it's given to terminal patients.

955
02:51:48,000 --> 02:52:01,000
And then there are recreational drugs like ecstasy and canvas, and so maybe that's the reason why the media report has been increased in cannabis and in cocaine because those are

956
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:06,000
not. Those are like recreational drugs. and So this is very

957
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:21,000
This is very misleading in that way that the total number of options solution is not given, So we can't be sure how many patients are up to? like How how much it is recreational, and how much it is medical so

958
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, I I think more information would definitely be helpful.

959
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:33,000
And whether you know is this already prescribed drug, or, you know, recreational drug, or even illegal drugs.

960
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:43,000
And it really depends, I think. Okay, cool So Now that number 5 don't like South Carolina is drop.

961
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Do you prefer the presentation to buy in the bigger or or the one in the discretion?

962
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Very quick, and that's cool right is here there are list drugs. you download it.

963
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:08,000
Yeah, you don't have to do this and turn in this at all, because the exercise we do together

964
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:17,000
So here we basically only take the call of the percent of reporting of this drug and make a bar plot like this. right?

965
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:24,000
We see Carabas is report like 484%. alcohol is only 2%.

966
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:29,000
Do you like this figure more, or the one you know we just saw.

967
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:33,000
This is very subjective, but you know let me know what you what's your personal.

968
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Take on this

969
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Can I say that I don't like either one of them very nice. There's just so much missing from both I mean.

970
02:53:51,000 --> 02:54:03,000
I think this one visually to me looks cleaner as in as in visually more appealing like, I think, sort of makes sense of what i'm looking at as compared to the other one which requires a lot more

971
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:07,000
back in my eyes to try to figure out what is, What is it trying to tell me?

972
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Yup: Yeah, I think this one totally God really of the the number of that I number reports this will only show the percent of reporting this.

973
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:24,000
If you show this one, you are basically just try to exercise.

974
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Cannabis is being highly already you know reported right you're basically trying to show this case of information.

975
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:35,000
The other. one shows more information, but it's kind of a harder to read right.

976
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:46,000
There's always a trade off right you have to strike a balance between how much information on the provide, and how easy people to read it right, because most of people wouldn't spend more than 1 min on a figure when they read the

977
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:53,000
newspaper. So so it's hard I I agree with you you know you have to think very hard what to present right no more, no less.

978
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Just the right amount of information in the right amount of format.

979
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Give the most you know. impact alright I think that's about it.

980
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Another comment. but I think this figure on the spreadsheet is really misleading, because it's not getting out lot of information, and it's kind of you know it's it's biased towards cannabis that's what

981
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:20,000
I feel because the real figures I mean when you look at the they go in the article it.

982
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:26,000
It shows the the the real picture is different. So I kind of think this is willfully misleading.

983
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:32,000
The public. if you give this it just yeah, yeah. Whenever you see, I totally agree with that.

984
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,000
You see some like a personality you need to ask what what's the numerator.

985
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:40,000
What's the denominator right if there's only one that you reported 10 times that's like a 10.

986
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:54,000
That's like a 1,000%. right so you know If the denominator is a small number, then the high percentage doesn't really mean too much you're absolutely right I mean sometimes showing the rod it

987
02:55:54,000 --> 02:56:00,000
or not, you have to make that again. strike a balance you don't wanna overwhelm the reader.

988
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:11,000
I also don't want to miss the critical piece of information that you might meet with people, but sometimes people just want to mislead on people That's their purpose. Then it's hard to say whether they're doing a good job of that

989
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:21,000
dog, but we should definitely try to avoid that. right. Okay, Any other comment?

990
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Well, I prefer the previous figure because although I yeah it's.

991
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:38,000
It takes more time to read that with the socos of the reported and the as the as, in fact, it makes a very sharp contrast.

992
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:46,000
And it actually arose. is my interest to look at it, and can help me to imagine, to feel the this.

993
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:53,000
A huge discrepancy between the report between the press coverage and the actual deaths.

994
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Yeah, Well, thank you. Yeah, I mean, we all might have our own.

995
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Opinion that's probably a normal polar fine Thank you I I think that's all for this exercise.

996
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Let's go back here very quickly. we are we download the 500 CD data make a hitherto where i'll do it together very quickly, so I don't have to waste time. on this exercise but I want to show

997
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:21,000
you. How do we use? Excel for the rest of the excitement?

998
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:30,000
You know, you know. in the rest. of the course so i'll slow a little bit down here, so make a histogram for let's go on.

999
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Okay, make a separate histogram for call. prevented service for older man and corporate bandit service for a holder, woman and place the histogram in your assignment.

1000
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Set a number event to 19, so we do with here we'll go back here.

1001
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:55,000
We download the 500 city data and open it

1002
02:57:55,000 --> 02:58:04,000
And to to make new hitographs. we need to use this excel spreadsheet template.

1003
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:15,000
We open it twice, so that will open 2 spreadsheets

1004
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Okay.

1005
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I mean rearrange them, and windows

1006
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Alright, let me share my windows

1007
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Got it. So So what we have is that we have this data set.

1008
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Now we have a 2 piece of scratchy we're going to make 2 histogram, one for poor

1009
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:58,000
I forgot, core preventive service for older man and for older women.

1010
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:04,000
So we go back to the scratchy. Can you find that, or the quick way of finding that is, go to the

1011
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:15,000
So for every data site we're providing this course there are other, you know, metadata first of the project description, basically where the you know what the data data set is about, and where it gets caught.

1012
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:19,000
Right. And then there's a data detection rate basically explain each column.

1013
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Remember each call is a variable right the column number and then the column heather, the one we show, and then the column description.

1014
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:38,000
Right. So here we're trying to find our core preventive service for older men and older women, and that's the description how these are measured.

1015
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:44,000
So we use column always. P. So we go back to call, and all on the P.

1016
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:49,000
This is the call i'm hope So a quick way we just take the whole call and control, c.

1017
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:55,000
I'm copying it. I pricing control c it's gonna be commands on your Mac.

1018
02:59:55,000 --> 03:00:01,000
I'm sorry. Go back to the scratchy here we just paste it here and now.

1019
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:08,000
We got a we got his kiss program, remember we changed this ben to nineteenth, so that's for the man older man.

1020
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:14,000
We see this pixel brand Now we go back for the raw data.

1021
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:19,000
We copy the column for women. Now we go to another spreadsheet.

1022
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:26,000
We need a new one for each Now we paste it here and change it to 19.

1023
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:34,000
No, we got this for women. No, I want to compare them side by side, so I will go to the I will just take the women one.

1024
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:44,000
This is a picture from the woman distribution. I just copy it and go to the mansion.

1025
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:57,000
I paste it. Now i'm having a side by side okay. So on the right hand side is the man. I I guess i'm on the left side of the woman. sorry if that's not here.

1026
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:06,000
This is, man. And this is a woman. okay i'm just doing it for quickly, so that you know we don't have to waste too much time here.

1027
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Now let's go back to the question right the first one to make the 2 fifth program.

1028
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
I did. I just show you how to do that. excel.

1029
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:21,000
You can exercise it after work. if you're not familiar with excel state one conclusion comparing the 2 history programs.

1030
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:31,000
I look at this, too. Hit the brands. Anyone want to put say something

1031
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:45,000
I guess it's hard to compare to kit look around side by side, so I move the 1 one below the math

1032
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:55,000
So the pop is the man. The bottom is the woman. I think this is a little better still, not perfect, because you know they do not align right.

1033
03:01:55,000 --> 03:02:12,000
I have to align them so now, they're aligned Florida, not not perfectly

1034
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:26,000
Everyone? Are there any conclusion

1035
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:41,000
When you will find them like that it looks like the I mean is fairly similar, and that, despite the fact that you have a distribution that is a little bit kind of more in the middle for the men it looks like

1036
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:49,000
they're overall. Normagram would be similar yeah I I agree Mail.

1037
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:54,000
They look, of course, not the same, but they look rather similar to me in terms of the center.

1038
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:58,000
Right here. The center is about 31 32.

1039
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Here is about 30, right? so you could say the men are a little bit shifted to the right and the woman. and also, if you look at the tails right, the man goes to 46, 49 right?

1040
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:15,000
The woman sorry it's blocked by the transcripts a man.

1041
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:21,000
The woman goes to 42, 44. So the man stretched for the right hand side, a little more than a man.

1042
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:28,000
So from all of this evidence, since, like the man, use the core preventive service a little more than women on average.

1043
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:45,000
But the difference is very small that's what I pop and any other comments

1044
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:52,000
Yeah, that's basically the limitation of histograms right? That's why we need a computer sample mean computer difference computer P: value computer statistics.

1045
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:59,000
We talk about yesterday to really show whether there's a difference or not, and how big is the difference, and what's the confidence interval for the difference.

1046
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:02,000
We'll do all of those you know later lecture back here to show you.

1047
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:05,000
You know Pittsburgh is good but they're not as good when you compare them right.

1048
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:09,000
When you compare them you need a numerical summaries.

1049
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:12,000
Okay. final question right? How confident you are in your conclusion.

1050
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Reaching in 6 again. I think they should be 7 I don't know why they're ship it.

1051
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:26,000
But what information would you increase a confidence? right?

1052
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:37,000
Suppose in the you know. Question 7. All work conclude was that, you know average usage demand is a little higher than women.

1053
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:43,000
How common does are you in that conclusion? part of this permanent? personally, I'm not that confident right.

1054
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:50,000
The difference is far as solo, and this is a random sample I don't know the sample size.

1055
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:57,000
This is almost as a 500 cities right so I don't know whether the difference is that robust right?

1056
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:06,000
If you draw a different random sample right? And also this difference could be explained by other variables.

1057
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Again. this is the observational data. The man may use more core facility service.

1058
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Now women may, just because they are older, right in this study.

1059
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:29,000
On average, the ages older, or maybe they you know there are many many other variables associated with different gender. so that could explain the difference.

1060
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:36,000
Right. so I i'm not. that confident about my conclusion, and the the the gender may not play a role at all.

1061
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:40,000
They may play a role, but may not play role at all right.

1062
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:44,000
If you buy chance we just sample older men here and relative younger women here.

1063
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:48,000
Then then, this difference is not gender difference, but rather age.

1064
03:05:48,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Difference. We can go back to the data side to see but It's really hard to actually this data doesn't tell us the average age of men sample in this right?

1065
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:09,000
Where's the webinar so we don't have that information so so we can never really love that you know the male just ordering this stuff.

1066
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:14,000
It's unlikely, though right because women have longer life expectancy.

1067
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:17,000
So if they sample uniformly then the women should be older.

1068
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
But you know you never know how they, how they grow the sample.

1069
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:39,000
So there could be many explanations, any comments

1070
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Okay, that's great, so that's all for the exercise in part in cost projects like this.

1071
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:52,000
You know in the future will do the same you know we'll try to give you time to do it together, like you know you go a short time.

1072
03:06:52,000 --> 03:07:05,000
We'll do one of them Oh, all together. and we summit project to wait. You don't need to do anything for Twob, or they go over there summit away. and also there's a postlock request you need to

1073
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:11,000
finish before tomorrow. 8, 30. Okay, there. There are a few other things, you know.

1074
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:15,000
I want to show here for that example, you know. express, excel, scratchy.

1075
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Try to do some exercise with it. Later I will have, you know, other projects which gonna use others like South prices.

1076
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:26,000
And also there are some reading optional reading section in the textbook.

1077
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:29,000
If you have tile and interest you can take a look.

1078
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:33,000
But finally, I want to show you about this lecture.

1079
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:42,000
So some data visualization examples at that point right because in inside typical literature, you will find it that usually they just use a few clause like hit the grab.

1080
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:53,000
They don't even use a lot of itagram People actually use box blossoms a lot, because that's more sort of a scientifically rigorous and easy to compare across and Then they use scalar part of

1081
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:59,000
other things right. but in news article or magazines they use all sorts of creative plots, which is fun.

1082
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
So i'm gonna show you a few you can you can click here.

1083
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:05,000
There's a Bloomberg a visualization website is a newer time.

1084
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:10,000
There's a whole bunch I clap them you know I will open each one.

1085
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:13,000
So the Bloomberg one. So these are Bloomberg, a website.

1086
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:27,000
There visualize all kinds of data alright let's see a few for example, let's see I don't know which one you are interested, but personally I like anything to do with math.

1087
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:34,000
So what do you talk about this right? But think about it.

1088
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:40,000
If you have 50 states data, the password visualized them is to put them in the map right previously.

1089
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:51,000
We talk about. Yeah, if you if you for them. alphabetically, it's easy to find your own state. it's much faster to find your own state on the map, right? So whenever you have like a 50 state data put him on the

1090
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:54,000
map will be always the best way to do, especially on the newspaper.

1091
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:03,000
So here it is, showing the on even recovering State post recession, that is, between 2,007 or 2,009.

1092
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:10,000
You see the recovery, you know, during recession, you know, this particular data is just a 50 state data, right?

1093
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:20,000
Just 50 data points, but by putting them on a map, things just look a lot more

1094
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Yeah, there's a comment, you know in the chat saying like a use of heat map.

1095
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:30,000
Yeah, Yeah, that's right. the heat map is more general But here is a heat map on the real geographic map.

1096
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:33,000
Right so that's that's just nice right it's very easy.

1097
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:39,000
You can find any any of your state and then let's try another one.

1098
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Oh, you know this kind of plot by this call Well, they only give you give me one before I have to pay.

1099
03:09:51,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Now let's go back luckily. I have a New York Times right.

1100
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:08,000
New York time has, a web page called the what's coming on is roughly updates every day. and then show you something of their data.

1101
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Right. So, for example, what's going on in this ground these are the minimum daily temperature from June through all those change over the past 60 years.

1102
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:24,000
In 9 cities.

1103
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:35,000
So you see the the green one is the temperature distribution in the 90 70, and then the caller wise in the 21 here.

1104
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:38,000
They want the one to show the global warming impact. right?

1105
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:44,000
So basically they show this this already sort of lay on hobbies travel.

1106
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:50,000
This are not happening in the histogram this call the deathly ground by similar like. they show a distribution of hi, Richard.

1107
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:57,000
Maybe throughout a year. i'll show 2 different time points 9 60 and 2020, 60 years.

1108
03:10:57,000 --> 03:11:04,000
In part. You see all 9 cities. the time creatures shift the right words, which means they are getting warmer.

1109
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:13,000
I mean, I suspect this is a common combined effect between global warming or climate change versus the You know the city development right?

1110
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:18,000
Once the city gets bigger. There are the green, the green policy back around the city, right?

1111
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:24,000
If you imagine hungry, in the city it's always become warmer and warmer because the number of adolation number of cars number industry in there. right?

1112
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,000
So that's that's part of the 35 as well.

1113
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:34,000
Id. but they do get warm and warm

1114
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Okay. And then there are many other graphs right there, you know.

1115
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:43,000
I like I always like a max because it's just fine, easy!

1116
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:49,000
And this one looks interesting

1117
03:11:49,000 --> 03:12:05,000
Oh, it's not the one I see? Well, anyway. this graph you know they show you a human body show you showing you the common injury, spoke voice among popular high school sports is the football, hockey wrestling and so on this

1118
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:19,000
is a very, very crazy amount. Paul, right? So you see that in football, 34% or half damage injury, right in baseball is actually ancohol is 13%.

1119
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:26,000
The most common one, which may be surprising to you but if you play basketball, you know that's not surprising at all.

1120
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:31,000
And yeah, you soccer actually is. This is half number one.

1121
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:35,000
My menu of the Hard is number one, and anchor is number 2, but some of them shoulder right.

1122
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:40,000
So these are very creative part. right? If you think about the data is actually very simple.

1123
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:47,000
Just 6 different sports, and then different body parts. And then the person I just like, just like a few, hit the ground.

1124
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:51,000
By the way, they put down on a human body, making it much more.

1125
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:56,000
It. just you know we look at people like this just want to spend one more minute on it Right?

1126
03:12:56,000 --> 03:13:02,000
So that's the that's offside so finally I will move on to this.

1127
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:06,000
How much website this kind of thing just you can't keep me forever reading, you know, looking at them.

1128
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:10,000
I just I just be fascinated by created figures like this. right?

1129
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:21,000
So this was from 2,018 let's all but you see that you know they put this one is the all the world's billionaires in a single map.

1130
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:26,000
You see that? you know they they put the country shape, and the size of the country is the number of billionaires.

1131
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:30,000
They also put a total, I guess Gdp. or something like that.

1132
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:33,000
So you see that you know which country has the most leading theirs.

1133
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:40,000
And this, Why is the you know where the money is in? I got this website.

1134
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:44,000
They care about money a lot. Everything is about money, and this is the amount of income you need to afford.

1135
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:54,000
The average house in every state. Again, we have state data putting on a on a map which always make it look better.

1136
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:58,000
And so on. So these are different company, their volume right, hold it.

1137
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:06,000
The underlying data is the same right, continues categorical on the way they they utilize them and just look much nicer.

1138
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:12,000
I will say, you know, scientists are not as creative as those those people in creating fancy plans right?

1139
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:30,000
Well, that's the that's that's nice nice to have Okay, any questions, any comment

1140
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:34,000
So we are done for the lecture today. tomorrow we'll talk about summary statistic.

1141
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:39,000
I can start a little bit on that but I find like you know we don't have enough time.

1142
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:46,000
I would rather talk a little earlier. So maybe for the rest of time today we continue with what we did yesterday.

1143
03:14:46,000 --> 03:15:00,000
You know a few of you might come up and the talk about what? what article you'll pick the yesterday and talk about it a little bit or you can. You can just come on and talk about what I have a new article you read the

1144
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:03,000
day about public health and let's just have a discussion about the news article right?

1145
03:15:03,000 --> 03:15:05,000
So it could be something a big yesterday could be something to write about today.

1146
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:24,000
I don't know why they read anything from yesterday to the day anyone

1147
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:27,000
So I I could start, you know, Yeah. Go have someone.

1148
03:15:27,000 --> 03:15:40,000
Please stop So I I wanted to. pediatric, and my article yesterday was about the.

1149
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:45,000
So the public health issue is the formula shortage that's going on.

1150
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:49,000
This has really got it. it's it was really bad back in May.

1151
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:55,000
So you guys are not aware the there's a across the nation Us.

1152
03:15:55,000 --> 03:16:11,000
There is a really, that shortage of powder Formula specifically since February and back in end of April, when the abbot plants shut down through the flooding there is there's

1153
03:16:11,000 --> 03:16:18,000
been a really a big problem for families to get formula and and how it works is across nation.

1154
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:24,000
So each State they pretty much choose one of the 3 major providers for formula.

1155
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:28,000
And so Abot is kind of the biggest, most popular one.

1156
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:43,000
And so the problem is, when the abbot plan shut down we couldn't apply formula anywhere, and also the problem is also with the global supply food chain and mobilization of formula, companies There's been a really struggle strong

1157
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:48,000
struggle to get formula, so actually hit 1 point in May.

1158
03:16:48,000 --> 03:17:03,000
Where, it was reported like about like 90% of like storage reporting that there's a formula shortage, and it has only recently improved in the last 2 weeks, because the ava plants just started

1159
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:09,000
reopening in the past like 2 weeks. So now supply is slowly improving.

1160
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:17,000
And so now, like the rates of you know shortage of formulas down to about like 70%.

1161
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:23,000
But it's still a big issue and a lot of the cities. I think the highest is like in Dc.

1162
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:27,000
Actually i'm not sure why, but there's no reporting like almost like 80% of stores.

1163
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:35,000
Actually don't care, don't have any formula so there's no like statistical analysis involved in my paper.

1164
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:49,000
But I guess the major health issue is you know you can't fight for formula, and there's certain population of infants who need certain formula for whatever medical condition they have and they just can't find it and when

1165
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:55,000
they can't find it They all can they're subject to only buying like one can at a time.

1166
03:17:55,000 --> 03:18:04,000
And it's obviously higher price as Well, well that was that's the public issue that I looked at yesterday.

1167
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:09,000
Yeah, Thanks for sharing. This is absolutely a very, very 7, not important.

1168
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:13,000
Usually I heard about this back in May, and glad to hear from you today.

1169
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:19,000
That is improving, but still I couldn't imagine you know this this 2 or 3 months.

1170
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:29,000
How people got through this yeah it used to be just like the major formula for a shortage, so like people will go to Costco and buy like the curveplane formula. to try to substitute.

1171
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:33,000
But even now it's there was a point in time where you you just cannot find it anywhere.

1172
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:41,000
And so parents who are dependent on like Wick to get a formula they could go to week, but then they just don't have any anymore.

1173
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:45,000
So parents were like stuff, because form is one of those things where you can't.

1174
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:50,000
You can't really substitute if you if you can't find it because that's what babies eat.

1175
03:18:50,000 --> 03:19:01,000
Yeah, a little bit by a back. you may one of the reasons part is that it's a factory shutdown right? But one of the you know, bigger reason was because actually there are a lot of prominent for coming in

1176
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:10,000
Canada in Uk, Europe, and Australia. but we cannot import them, because at the other end of improvement, So I hope you know. Now we ring about right There's some policy change in this kind.

1177
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:15,000
Of a national emergency kind of thing, yeah I i'm lucky.

1178
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:18,000
My kids all all the formula now. but I remember W.

1179
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:28,000
My my younger son, when he was like an infant he doesn't take any regular formula, because he has a like a milk in hollerist. We can only take a specific address.

1180
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:33,000
The one very hard to find, and the 1 h, you know, nearby grocery run out.

1181
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:41,000
We drove like crazy going around trying to get a one or 2 volumes, so I could totally imagine the new parents what kind of thing they get into the past 2 months.

1182
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:46,000
Thanks for sharing anybody else. Have things to share I mean it doesn't have to be statistic.

1183
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:51,000
I think, just to sit down Talk about public health issues right and the way we look at it.

1184
03:19:51,000 --> 03:20:02,000
I think that's very, very very helpful I would like to to oh,

1185
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:08,000
First of all, thank you, Andrew, for starting the conversation I I I'm in California right now.

1186
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:14,000
So. Oh, one of the biggest passing issues over here is that

1187
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:23,000
There. we do see the water that people get on and they were starting to find people just because we're having a water drought.

1188
03:20:23,000 --> 03:20:31,000
But the article mentioned that about 80% goes into farming and 20% to the population here in California.

1189
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:38,000
But I what I found interesting, and there was very a localized issue, and to me, just thinking of public health.

1190
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:44,000
And how do we think about connecting different aspects like without water?

1191
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:48,000
Technically there could be no life at least you're in upon it.

1192
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:54,000
Right. So for me, just thinking about this, I would think that it might become more global.

1193
03:20:54,000 --> 03:21:08,000
Approach would be better is for us to think about like how like not only is individual, how we can affect change, but how can we live, strategize, and they come together in lake use.

1194
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:16,000
This water, or however options of of dealing with this issue.

1195
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:23,000
But I will say that like just thinking about the stats, and lay how

1196
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:33,000
During this choose different numbers like a Mimi. Think a lot about weight like it was very challenging for me to like.

1197
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:43,000
Just pick an article, because, like, I guess, like science, and so ingrained in me that I was like scientific oracles.

1198
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:51,000
Were puppy on on my search, and then also, like the reputable sources. And it was really hard for me to awake right.

1199
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:56,000
Think of like, Okay, if i'm a late person where would I go.

1200
03:21:56,000 --> 03:22:04,000
So it was a very interesting exercise, so I thank you for that.

1201
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:07,000
Thank you. Thank you for sharing. Yeah, I mean from I.

1202
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:11,000
I I follow on you, so I guess all of you do, you know all the time?

1203
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:15,000
But my impression is that California is becoming drier in the dryer.

1204
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:18,000
In recent decades, playing the the the fires, and the short.

1205
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:26,000
A lot of the drought, and while the problem is everywhere like but also the in Michigan, you've heard of all back 5 years ago, you know, the water crisis in flint right?

1206
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:31,000
Like cool that you might and that happens in the 20 first century.

1207
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:38,000
So there's definitely big, big hobby house problems going on in the country in the world, right?

1208
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:42,000
I mean, if I in this country probably have any multiple country in the law

1209
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:48,000
And the news, or take part of it by whether they do something good or bad. right.

1210
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:51,000
Depend on cause that's all where we thought for information and nowadays.

1211
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:59,000
I I don't want you I actually read more social media rather than traditional news articles, because one thing is that it's not free anymore.

1212
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:04,000
You have to pay and stop scratching It's not cheap right $100 a year for New York Times, for example.

1213
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:15,000
And I I read a lot about social media but I don't know what what were your like news value to get information.

1214
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:20,000
Yeah, Usually I do leak reliable sources like Mpr. C.

1215
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:25,000
And see it, you know, like the ones on the Tv.

1216
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:35,000
Well like also. So it's a very it was a bit hard for me to try to see like how do other people would approach this.

1217
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:45,000
I suppose us really think that we have like, so we go to straight in resources. So but it was interesting.

1218
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:55,000
So I was overall, thankful that it was a good opening exercise for me.

1219
03:23:55,000 --> 03:24:13,000
Great thanks. Any other people on top

1220
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:18,000
Yeah, I i'm not something this morning again on social media, and also from Chinese social media.

1221
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:22,000
So i'm not going to share but They are referring to some study in America.

1222
03:24:22,000 --> 03:24:40,000
Internal Medicine Journal. what they did is that they study coffee intake and death rate, i'm at least according to to that social media article I wrap there is a there's a negative association which means I

1223
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:45,000
those who take copy 2 to 4 cops a day that's lower that rate.

1224
03:24:45,000 --> 03:24:48,000
I mean also compare I I think that's not new but in this particular study.

1225
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:53,000
They compare copy with sugar, without sugar, and with artificial.

1226
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:57,000
You know. sweetheart, by, they figure out with or without sugar.

1227
03:24:57,000 --> 03:25:00,000
They all help, but with artificials within that it doesn't help.

1228
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:06,000
I I I personally Don't know that I think artificial Swedener shouldn't harm, So why would there be a difference?

1229
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:09,000
And also the Schwarzenegger is low.

1230
03:25:09,000 --> 03:25:14,000
But what suggests that is that 2 to 4 costs a day will help you, I mean I i'm a copy dreamer.

1231
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:18,000
So I I i'm very glad to take this information that wouldn't change it, anyway.

1232
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:24,000
I I I you know I drink coffee but personally for this kind of study, although it's citing a newly published article.

1233
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:31,000
Right. I will give a grain of thought about taking information because to me it doesn't solve the reasonable that you know No, no sugar.

1234
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:34,000
How always artificial swimming at that, you know above them.

1235
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:40,000
I just could not make it make sense. Honestly, Auden.

1236
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:46,000
Yeah, that's how I got my information basically everywhere from you know social media nowadays.

1237
03:25:46,000 --> 03:25:50,000
From the news from the Tv. I don't really watch Tv every day anymore.

1238
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:56,000
But usually, you know, from social media, but linked to some New New York time article.

1239
03:25:56,000 --> 03:26:07,000
And you you know some scientific you know publications I I don't really drive down to the publication unless I'm really really interested. but it's good that they did this this one they give up citation right so If

1240
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:13,000
I want. I can. I can track it down

1241
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:34,000
Someone else want to share.

1242
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:38,000
Yeah, anyone read anything they you think you want to share all update with us.

1243
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:45,000
It's good always good to know what's going on there

1244
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:49,000
I can share something. So this was not the article I read yesterday.

1245
03:26:49,000 --> 03:26:55,000
I also did the Covid 19 drug. But this morning I was listening to Mpr.

1246
03:26:55,000 --> 03:27:06,000
And they were talking about a study done in one specific hospital, where they looked at women who were giving birth, who voluntarily wanted to get their tubes shine

1247
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:14,000
And then they looked at it, both for those with private insurance and those with Medicaid, and they actually saw that for both groups.

1248
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:24,000
There was a lower like the actual follow through rate for getting their tube side was lower. And there's a whole bunch of reasons right like, maybe busy.

1249
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:37,000
Or this other stuff. But then also they saw there is a disparate impact between private insurance and Medicaid, due to some Medicaid call, like requirements that have to happen prior to getting tubes.

1250
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:39,000
Tied. It was related to like a time constraint.

1251
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:50,000
So they actually saw in this one hospital. It was like only like, I think, like 40% of voluntary tube tied. procedures were happening for those with Medicaid.

1252
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:56,000
And then they looked across the country and saw, Hey, this is actually pretty typical.

1253
03:27:56,000 --> 03:28:09,000
And so they were talking about how there needs to be some policy changes regarding medicaid requirements to actually get this type of procedure to make it more accessible for low income women who want it again. it's voluntary.

1254
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:18,000
So I thought that was pretty interesting, and then they compared it to one hospital program where that type of procedure was fully funded.

1255
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:23,000
So, even if someone had Medicaid, they had like big donor money.

1256
03:28:23,000 --> 03:28:35,000
I think that could also help like pay for it. and that the completion rate that procedure was like way higher, and women reported like higher satisfaction, which I think is interesting.

1257
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:43,000
Given the current climate in the Us. regarding reproductive right, and also just to kind of agree with Maria.

1258
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:58,000
They use like pretty simple statistics right like they really made it very easy to understand which is great for the lay person, cause you kind of get the gist of the what they're trying to report on in a short period of time.

1259
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:04,000
But then it also, if you try to dig into it leads to many questions that aren't there in that reporting as well.

1260
03:29:04,000 --> 03:29:14,000
No, that's kind of a Hello, yeah thanks for sharing me, adding on to that to what you quite know about different kind of insurance.

1261
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:22,000
I recently just had some personal experience in the past. You know I just substrate, will have a insurance that my employer, provided they have different option.

1262
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:26,000
You know. expensive ones like Pbo, you know. Hmo, which is cheaper.

1263
03:29:26,000 --> 03:29:31,000
But you have limitation, you know. I always take the cheaper one, because I was relatively healthy, and never really need that much.

1264
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:38,000
But to this year I ran into some medical problems on going throughout the region of operational hospitals.

1265
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:44,000
Going, you know, Gary for to see different specialists I'm a really prostrated by by the whole system right now.

1266
03:29:44,000 --> 03:29:46,000
The pvo, because everything you do either refer and off.

1267
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:53,000
I need weeks to gather it perl you know it's not based, and it's very hard to got appointment. Why not?

1268
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:56,000
If I make a phone call get apartment usually it's in 2 months. How?

1269
03:29:56,000 --> 03:30:04,000
And I'm in Pike. so it's just not working very well, I mean, I can understand there are many things going on, especially with Covid and other things.

1270
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:09,000
But next year I would definitely switch the pdo, although painting paying like oh, several $1,000 a year.

1271
03:30:09,000 --> 03:30:17,000
I just see the difference. right getting or neither. referral or not we'll make a cube difference in terms of how much time you wait, and the difficulty.

1272
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:21,000
So I couldn't imagine you know those on medicaid that's like I love .

1273
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:24,000
How much trouble they have about any procedure you want to.

1274
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:28,000
They want to do this. so just so many, you know. strings the patch right?

1275
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:34,000
So many so many things out there. so yeah and you really have your personal experience.

1276
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:39,000
It's very hard to really see how how big a deal that is, you know, this This could play around in real life.

1277
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:46,000
Thanks for sharing.

1278
03:30:46,000 --> 03:31:10,000
So any which we have time for final one

1279
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:23,000
Okay, yeah, go ahead, right, Do all the pop Oh, there I I just want to add a but comment about insurance is because I I worked at a free dental clinic.

1280
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:41,000
And the policy was Well, we're shape funded but the policy was that patients who we would accept cannot have any insurance whatsoever, so they can't have remote medicaid I i'm from from and it was kinda hard

1281
03:31:41,000 --> 03:31:56,000
because we had to turn a lot of people away who couldn't afford you know, normal private insurances, but they also didn't have anyone to go to cause other dental offices don't want to accept medicaid

1282
03:31:56,000 --> 03:32:03,000
because there's such a low reimbursement that I actually costs the dentist money to do an extraction.

1283
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:18,000
You know 2 of restorative treatment or whatnot so it's kind of like they would just doc in this a great area that no one really like, Yeah, it's not that they weren't being concerned, But people were just kind of

1284
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:21,000
overlooked and it just like it's definitely a real problem.

1285
03:32:21,000 --> 03:32:35,000
So. yeah, it's not really a public a public health story, but it was like my personal experience, thanks for sure I think it's not a public health story, I mean i'm in the school public healthcare and I remember

1286
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:39,000
once we had a conversation with my colleagues. what really is public health.

1287
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:43,000
And my, my thing was that anything other than a private house?

1288
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:47,000
So. so. so basically, you know anything to do with how I think nowadays.

1289
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:57,000
It's, it's you know we'll see the example we're gonna use in this course, ranging from like a gun control to you know abortion or anything I mean all of this are probably awesome.

1290
03:32:57,000 --> 03:33:02,000
I think it's it's a very very broad topic apply to everybody's life.

1291
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:11,000
Everything. yeah. I think that's all for the day and Do I like cause to handle it already, so that we have a you know, time for going to lunch?
