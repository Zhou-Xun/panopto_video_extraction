1
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:34,750
Anti-Racist teaching often means sharing power in the classroom, and that's something that we're often not encouraged to do as faculty.

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,400
And oftentimes we're supposed to be seen as the experts in the classroom, and that's the training that we've been given.

3
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:50,110
But it's really important to see ourselves as learning with and alongside our students if we're doing anti-racist teaching.

4
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,939
And sometimes our institutions don't support that work.

5
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:01,809
So our curriculum committees or our accrediting bodies or even our peers who might be reviewing our

6
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:09,700
teaching aren't necessarily going to be encouraging us to really share that space with students.

7
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,880
And so those can be barriers to anti-racist teaching.

8
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:21,340
Sometimes as a woman of color, it's also difficult to know how much I should push students,

9
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,210
because oftentimes my own teaching is being really closely evaluated by my peers and my students,

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,820
and I need to be careful about how I bring things up in the classroom.

11
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,900
Within the institution. We're trying to build this effort.

12
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:47,300
And on the other hand, we're constrained by the institution's investment in, for instance,

13
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:56,010
getting funding from the same donors who, or donors or funders, who have not necessarily been committed to this model.

14
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,370
Well, that's, that's one big, one challenge, and I think it's a big challenge.

15
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,480
Part of the reason that it's a big challenge is for the purposes of the second reason,

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:22,930
which is the toll that this work takes on individual human beings, individual often women of color or people of color doing the work.

17
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:33,099
I believe there is a tremendous toll and we haven't done enough work, research to truly understand or quantify

18
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:44,680
exactly how much that, how much that cost is or qualitative work to really understand the full nature

19
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:55,180
Of the cost of that these, that this burden of this work places on individual people,

20
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:03,010
their physical well-being, their mental well-being, their social and familial connections.

21
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:16,040
The loss to the field that comes from them not being able to focus on their true research questions while focusing on institution building.

22
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,400
So a second reason, then. Excuse me a second

23
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:35,310
challenge is that we must find ways to support anti-racist teaching and work within institutions that does not exact such heavy tolls,

24
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,880
Of the faculty who have largely chosen to do this work.

25
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,530
But of a commitment to to equity and to racism.

26
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:59,500
Almost like these folks are paying a penalty for that commitment, even though so many students, colleagues, the institutions benefit.

27
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:07,070
from our labor. So there are a lot of opportunities to build here.

28
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:14,420
I believe that these opportunities. Must really.

29
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,350
be anchors in alternatives to what is already the mainstream.

30
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,710
So, for instance, by opening up to different ways of teaching,

31
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,550
not merely tweaking the topics that are currently taught using the current paradigms, I believe that we need to do.

32
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:45,660
This is an opportunity for us to really do things radically different from the ways that they're currently being done.

33
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,640
It's now 2022. Public education and education in

34
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:02,190
This country has maintained a fairly similar sort of model over certainly at least the last century.

35
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:13,090
And so. The fact that it has taken so long to get us to this point where we're thinking about how we might do it differently really suggests that.

36
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,810
We have nothing to lose by trying completely different approaches.

37
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,350
That center addressing racism that center anti-racism.

38
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:36,980
I believe if we do that, the models of teaching that we'll have will be completely different from the models on which we currently rely.

39
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,399
I guess I'll also add, since I offer two challenges,

40
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:50,120
I want to say there's an opportunity here also to promote healing for these folks

41
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,590
who often get taken for granted in our institutions despite how much we or they do.

42
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,569
And so there's an opportunity here for institutions as well as for individuals,

43
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,760
for instance, but let's focus on the institutions, for institutions to value

44
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:18,050
the lives of the well-being and the contributions of the people who dedicate so much of their efforts,

45
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:26,960
often in ways that go unacknowledged or under acknowledged or undervalued.

46
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,809
I think one of the challenges in regards to anti-racist teaching in the classroom

47
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,640
environment comes from this idea that all classroom should be a safe space for everyone.

48
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,819
Right. I tell my students early on in the semester that what we are going to discuss is

49
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,390
rooted in public health teaching because we are public health professionals.

50
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,070
And if you want to bring up a point that stands contrary to the public health literature,

51
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,010
you may feel uncomfortable and the burden is on you to justify your perspective, right?

52
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,240
And in this way, people who think, for example, that there's some power imbalance that's real or rooted in culture or genes,

53
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,290
that white people are naturally superior, that men are naturally superior.

54
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,040
I don't want these people to feel safe and comfortable in my class.

55
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,799
I want them to understand that we're there. Their views are not rooted in the public health literature.

56
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:27,980
Right, which we are there to discuss. So I think anti-racist teaching really needs to reckon with this idea of everyone feeling safe in a class,

57
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:37,520
or rather everyone's idea of feeling respected in a class. Their idea is rooted in hate and biological determinism and scientific racism that

58
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,920
we really don't want to welcome into our classrooms and don't need to be there. And I'd argue we don't really need to make the space for either.

59
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,240
In addition to that, they also waste student learning time.

60
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:55,040
So often what we'll see is that there's one student who really wants to argue a scientifically racist idea and a whole class of

61
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,479
students of color who need to feel that somehow they need to be on the offensive to defend the idea that policing can be racist.

62
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,850
Right? When none of the empirical research argues in support of the original student and all

63
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,500
of the empirical research argues to support the experiences of students of color.

64
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,050
When I think about the way public health classes are often divided, right?

65
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,920
Often we'll focus on a method or a focus on an outcome, and then sometimes we'll have a cluster of those classes that talk about race.

66
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,330
Right now, in order for things to be truly anti-racist across the board,

67
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,880
we need to talk about these positions of power and oppression and privilege largely rooted in race.

68
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:42,050
In all of these classes. So I think one of the institutional barriers to this will be that in certain areas, in public health,

69
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,770
race and racial disparities is seen as the intellectual property of that other wing of public health.

70
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:54,229
Right. But we do see that in order to understand the way that communities experience these differences,

71
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,650
these health inequities based on race is fundamentally part of every class.

72
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,130
It's fundamentally part of everything we're studying.

73
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:08,570
I think for all of our courses to be grounded in anti-racism, all of them will have to have some component,

74
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:17,270
some discussion about power and privilege and oppression, often rooted in this case, in race, and to convince all professors to do this.

75
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,870
All faculty across all departments will certainly be challenging, right?

76
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,219
I think for many methods,

77
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:32,360
courses that often see race only as a variable and a never discussed races as something historical or as rooted in power and oppression.

78
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:40,010
So racial groups tend to be different categorically, but not different in terms of their placement in society.

79
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:48,590
Without a deeper discussion of this, of this power hierarchy, it'll be impossible to have truly anti-racist teaching in our universities.
