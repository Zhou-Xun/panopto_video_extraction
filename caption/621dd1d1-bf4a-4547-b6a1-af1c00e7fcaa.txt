1
00:00:51,620 --> 00:01:07,490
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So last time we were looking at the basic characteristics of random variables.

2
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,650
That's the cumulative distribution function. Steve.

3
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,340
We showed that this is right continues.

4
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,800
And, uh, uh, we also sketched how it would look like.

5
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:50,550
If our random variable is discrete. So that's a step function and we actually classified random variables by how the CDF looks like as a graph.

6
00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:00,570
So in for a discrete one, we have a set of points that carry all probability mass.

7
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,900
We gave a definition of support.

8
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,609
Yeah. And this was somewhat intuitive, so we gave a bunch of them.

9
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:29,060
So this is a set of points where they have increases, where PDF is greater than zero, if PDF exists, where there is some probability mass point mass.

10
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:46,610
Um, we also said that this is uh, uh, as a sample such that its probability is equal to one and we take the smallest, uh, set like that.

11
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:55,820
Um, I, uh, probably need to add to that latter definition that, uh, we consider support to be a closed one.

12
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,820
So if it's an open sample that we have, then we have, uh, limiting points of that set to it.

13
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,950
Uh, but probably the most, uh, intuitive definition we can do for a simple space.

14
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,890
And that you can probably most commonly see in the literature.

15
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,129
So just to remind us,

16
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:33,200
simple spaces when there's no difference between the army figures and the values of the random variable because it's defined as an identity function,

17
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:40,400
we say that for a simple space, support is a set of values of X.

18
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,230
Or a set of values X can take.

19
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:03,370
So this is in addition to the previous lecture, um, and for a discrete one it looked like, uh, well, it's right continuous.

20
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,720
So the points of mass, uh, are excluded.

21
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,990
So discrete means, well, there are some probabilities p key, uh,

22
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:26,170
that x can take the value ex k for sums of K and uh, uh, the whole support is basically a set of points.

23
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,600
Yeah, I could be.

24
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,680
I could be infinite, but it's basically CD4 would be a piecewise constant function.

25
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,970
Taking jumps exactly at the points of support.

26
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:57,450
That's how indiscreet was defined. Then we can say that continuous or absolutely continuous.

27
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:10,760
Distributions. And most of the time we essentially omits the absolute or people,

28
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,650
admits the the absolute and just say they're continuous, meaning that they are absolutely continuous.

29
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,390
And we define that by taking a page from measure theory.

30
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:30,930
So we said that Measure New is absolutely continuous with respect to another one.

31
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,750
And most of the time this new is considered as a length.

32
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,410
Another name for it is the big measure. Uh.

33
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,840
Whenever. For any sap such that new of a is zero.

34
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:14,070
It follows that new of a is zero. And we said the the, you know, in the example of a discrete random variable.

35
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:21,270
So why this type of a distribution is not absolutely continuous?

36
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,870
Well, the measure that's defined by this distribution is discrete.

37
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,850
And it's basically the CDF that that.

38
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:45,060
So we also had a fact that the difference between CDF on the ends of the interval is actually a measure of that interval, remember.

39
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,090
So we can consider CDF as as defining a probability measure.

40
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:05,800
Um, and so if I take the measure of this set of support points for the discrete distribution, it will actually be equal to one.

41
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,110
If I take a few of them, it's going to be greater than zero. Um, uh.

42
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,130
And so length of it is going to be zero.

43
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:24,600
Um. So these are when if is.

44
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:39,720
When PDF exists. It's a derivative of the cumulative distribution function.

45
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,750
Exists with the. Uh, almost everywhere.

46
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:59,450
Right. Uh. So that means for any points in our except perhaps for south of measure zero.

47
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:10,780
Now when, when I said that, uh, giving an example of why a discrete distribution is not absolute continuous,

48
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:22,790
um, I actually took a set a such that, uh, it's part of this support for the discrete distribution.

49
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,710
I think if you look closely at the definition, I should have done the other way around.

50
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:40,700
I should have taken a set such that the CDF measure of it is zero and show that it's not the case that its length is zero.

51
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,170
Right. If I want the example. And for that we can take.

52
00:08:47,880 --> 00:09:07,650
So this is with a discrete distribution. Take some interval.

53
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,000
It doesn't matter which one, how it's close to open.

54
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,520
Uh, such that, uh.

55
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:22,830
It's between. The discrete support points.

56
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,180
And as such, there's no probability mass anywhere in that interval.

57
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:49,610
So the, uh. Uh, it's measure, uh, it's a measure of that interval.

58
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,180
He is going to be f of the. Minus half of a.

59
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:01,629
Now.

60
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:13,360
I said it's strictly between the points so I don't have to think which and they should close to be correct in terms of the right continuity of the AF.

61
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:22,600
But that's going to be a zero, right? Because if it's if I take an interval A to B.

62
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:33,490
Right. Then my city doesn't change in that interval, so it gives me a zero.

63
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,060
But the length. So the new.

64
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,359
The length of a B is B minus E that's larger than zero.

65
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,080
So this is actually the right counter example.

66
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,500
Okay. So as we talk about absolutely continuous distribution.

67
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,080
So because PDF exists almost everywhere, they are continuous functions.

68
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:19,520
So and there's plenty of those that, you know from six or once a normal distribution, logistic distribution.

69
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,969
So anything that looks like this. Right.

70
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:33,460
And for those distributions, the probability that X takes any particular value, that's a zero, right?

71
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,220
And this means for any acts in power.

72
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:50,180
And this means that there are no. No points.

73
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,850
Points. Meaning singletons. With probability mass.

74
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:18,660
In such points we call eight times. And then we said that we can build the mixtures of the two.

75
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,700
Right. And there.

76
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:42,750
Next discrete, continuous. And these are still distributions where PDF exists almost everywhere,

77
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:51,720
except that there are points of discontinuity and those points are jumps like in a discrete distribution.

78
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:01,730
So they look like this, right? So it's a combination of something continuous in the set of jumps then.

79
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:11,960
So these points are eight times. And the probability that the random variable takes the value of those points.

80
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,550
It's greater than zero because the jump is greater than zero.

81
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,060
But that essentially. Huh? Right.

82
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,549
And the interesting fact about it's that we want to briefly allude to,

83
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:35,360
but but then also quickly forget about it, is that this is not all types of distributions that exist.

84
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,230
There is yet another class that's called singular.

85
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:53,720
And it's actually a non-trivial one because at this point you probably think that it's tempting to think that this is all that exists, right?

86
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:06,830
So I either have the discrete distributions where there's just points of probability mass or I have a continuous one way it's spread out and I can

87
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:21,560
have mixtures of the two in any proportion and we'll need to develop a formalism how to work with those kind of defining a pdf or generalized PDF.

88
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:30,470
Not to call it that for mixed discrete continuous distributions and how to date integrals of them and so on.

89
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,850
But, uh, so let me just say what singular distributions are.

90
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,350
So their support has length zero.

91
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:10,110
That means they are they managed to grow on a set of points that are accountable.

92
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:21,240
Right. And so if I told you that, you would immediately point me to discrete distributions,

93
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,069
because these are the ones that manage to grow when the support is zero.

94
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,280
So it's a no brainer, right? Nothing surprising about it.

95
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:36,900
It just jumps. But the surprising thing about the singular distributions is that they don't jump.

96
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,760
So there kdf is nevertheless continuous.

97
00:15:50,510 --> 00:16:01,380
So they don't jump. And moreover the pdf.

98
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,080
Exists. Almost everywhere.

99
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:21,990
Right. So in that sense, they kind of combine features of both discrete and continuous distributions and seemingly contradictory features in them.

100
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:31,980
And so in order to persuade you that it's there's no contradiction about it and that such distributions do exist.

101
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,870
So I'll give you an example that's called control function.

102
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:47,520
So I want to give details of it so you can furnish the details yourself.

103
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,680
It's actually a good exercise. I'll just show how this is built.

104
00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:02,340
So this is zero. This is one. And so I'll take intervals for one.

105
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:13,560
And my CDF is going to be first equal to one after that and equal to zero before that.

106
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,790
Right. So the whole action will take place in the interval zero one.

107
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,840
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to divided into three parts.

108
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,850
Right. So this is going to be one third. This is going to be two thirds.

109
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:42,070
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the average value of the CDF, of the part of CDF that's that's defined already at this point.

110
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,340
So I see that I have it defined as zero on the left and one on the right.

111
00:17:47,340 --> 00:18:01,680
So my midpoint is going to be one half. And I'm going to define my CDF equal to one half and the middle third of the interval.

112
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,700
Okay. Once I've done that. So the construction is algorithmic, as you see.

113
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,220
Right. So I've done two steps of that algorithm already.

114
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:18,390
Right. I defined it for values less than zero greater than one.

115
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,790
So then I defined on the interval one third to two thirds.

116
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,580
So now I'm going to define it on the two intervals where it's yet undefined.

117
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,220
And this is one interval is from 0 to 1 third. And another one is from two thirds to one.

118
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,500
And I'm going to use the same principle.

119
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:47,520
So within each of the intervals, I'll take the division into three parts, this one into three parts of this one into three parts.

120
00:18:48,990 --> 00:19:05,519
Okay. And then so in the I will take the average value, uh, uh, of, of uh, the, uh, the values of the function that are already defined.

121
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,630
So for the first one it's between zero.

122
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,430
So the value of the left is zero, the value on the right is one half.

123
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,060
So the midpoint of it will be one fourth.

124
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Right. And I'm going to make the midpoint.

125
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:35,279
The CDF at the midpoint of my partition equal to one fourth and then I'll do the same thing for that other intervals.

126
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,470
So it's going to be like this and the point is going to be three fourths.

127
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,700
Okay. And then I'm going to continue doing it forever.

128
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,640
Right. And see what what emerges in the limits.

129
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,730
So the counter function is defined as the limits of this procedure.

130
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,840
So the CDF is the limit of this procedure.

131
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,040
Now, first of all, on any step of the algorithm I have.

132
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,269
So the points where changes occur accountable, right?

133
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:41,950
Because I'm always dividing so I can count them. Then what happens is that the intervals there where my CD4 is defined.

134
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,000
With each next step, they expand, right.

135
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,359
And they eventually will cover the whole interval.

136
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,060
Zero one. Right. So the sum of the length.

137
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,290
Length of the intervals.

138
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,170
Where? You have is defined.

139
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:26,779
We'll go to one because they will cover the whole interval from 0 to 1, except possibly for a set of countable points that have measured zero.

140
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:39,980
Right. And then I will also have the fact that the points that mark the intervals where F is yet undefined will be approaching each other.

141
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:51,910
So. Winds at the ends at the end of the intervals.

142
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,230
Where if he's yet undefined.

143
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:23,459
We'll approach each other. Right.

144
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:35,220
So I initially had just to at the first step of the algorithm, I had just two such points, the zero and the one one, the zero zero on the one one.

145
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,830
So then I had two sets of those points.

146
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:52,440
So zero one third one one half, uh, and then the other one, two thirds, one half, one one and so on with each division.

147
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,880
So I have them merging closely to each other.

148
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,700
And the consequence of that will be, uh, continuity of the limiting function.

149
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:30,209
Right. So in the limits. Uh, and uh, so, uh, if any of the intervals where F is defined already, it's basically flat.

150
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:39,090
So the pdf is zero. So the pdf is defined and equal to zero in any of the intervals.

151
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,920
Where F is defined.

152
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,260
Right. So this construction brings me to a function that will be continuous.

153
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,690
Uh, we'll somehow manage, uh, to grow on a accountable set of points of support points.

154
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:20,820
But without jumping. And then the rest of the course, we will just assume.

155
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,000
There. Our models all exclude the singular distributions.

156
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,840
So it's a nice theoretical, exotic example.

157
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,400
Uh, but it's probably not relevant to statistics.

158
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:53,720
We will assume. Our distributions are not singular.

159
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:17,880
And by the way, this example and this construction is related to another example that I want to talk about.

160
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,230
So an example of of a function of Omega that is not measurable.

161
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,790
So there's a similar construction there. Okay.

162
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:43,760
And so finishing up the discussion of the possible types of distribution, I will formulate without proof the so-called liebig's decomposition theory.

163
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,390
Namely that any distribution.

164
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,190
Belongs to one of three classes. Classes?

165
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:29,180
Of the three. Glasses or they are mixtures.

166
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:46,120
And they are discreet. Absolutely continuous.

167
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:20,040
Or singular. Okay.

168
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,820
Somehow my picture is jumping, so yours is fine.

169
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,840
Time trying to catch lines. My picture.

170
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:41,158
Still jumping. Know what's going on.

171
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:51,148
Okay. Um. Let's talk about integrals.

172
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:10,678
This is going to be a new topic and you're already familiar with with some of them.

173
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:22,678
And so the integral is the primary instrument in probability and statistics, because this is how expectation is defined.

174
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:33,448
So expectation is an integral. And let's start with you already know from calculus and that's the Riemann integrals.

175
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:47,918
So that's just a reminder. That's how it's constructed.

176
00:28:48,308 --> 00:28:55,148
So let's say I have a remem integral function and not all of them are like that.

177
00:28:57,748 --> 00:29:04,858
And what happens is that. So let's say I want to take a integral girl from to B.

178
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:16,368
And what they will do is that I'm going to add starting points x1x2.

179
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:24,918
So a match between A and B, say and of them such that.

180
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:32,148
The difference between the two points.

181
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:41,518
Will be Delta II. So that's X plus one minus x i.

182
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:52,258
And then I will use that mass to approximate my function by a piecewise constant one.

183
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:58,288
And I can do it two different ways at least. Uh. So there's always ways, of course.

184
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:05,098
Uh, but I will either do the lower values within the interval.

185
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:12,768
To approximate this function. Well, I can do the upper values.

186
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:28,598
To approximate my functions. Right.

187
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:44,088
So these values, the lower ones, I will call if I were the underscore and the upper ones I will call if I, uh, with a bar right in.

188
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:47,638
And then, uh, so we construct sums.

189
00:30:49,298 --> 00:31:02,947
Two sums, right? So one is using the upper the maximum of the function within the interval times delta I and another one is when

190
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:15,278
I take the lower approximating value of that function times the delta I and then so the integral is defined.

191
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:28,598
Is the limits is my partition becomes finer and finer, so my arm goes to infinity, there's more and more points.

192
00:31:28,598 --> 00:31:36,848
And the mass and the, uh, maximal difference between the two points goes to zero.

193
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:43,328
Um, and so then I have the upper.

194
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:47,918
So these sums, they have a name, right?

195
00:31:47,948 --> 00:32:01,328
Uh, this is the. This one is called the Upper Darby.

196
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:11,688
Some. And this is called the lower.

197
00:32:26,568 --> 00:32:36,148
So the integral by definition is the limits of the upper and lower double sums.

198
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:50,868
If it exists. If the limit exists and.

199
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:59,038
The limits of the person is same as the limits of the law with some.

200
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:23,048
So if those limits exists and they're the same, they're called the integral.

201
00:33:23,438 --> 00:33:34,278
They remain integral. And for nice functions that uh, uh, integrate integral both uh, with the remaining integral.

202
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:38,858
So the integral represents the area under the curve, right?

203
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:42,198
For, uh, the given interval.

204
00:33:42,858 --> 00:33:46,478
And this interval doesn't have to have, uh, finite ends.

205
00:33:46,488 --> 00:33:50,448
It could be incentives. Uh, okay.

206
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:58,308
So, um, we are certainly picturing the random variables here and integrating random variables.

207
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:09,888
Um, and so there are or integrated CDF, uh, PDFs, right, to get a CDF.

208
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:27,138
And uh, so one unpleasant thing about those functions is that they cannot apply to any PDF, they cannot apply to discrete distributions.

209
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:34,278
And there are also, uh, functions that can be easily constructed that are not, uh, agreement in the global.

210
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:43,728
So I can do an example. So let's say my eye.

211
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:49,398
So we have the set of rational numbers.

212
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:04,378
Let's call it the Q and I will do an indicator of that set.

213
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:11,758
So that's going to be equal to one.

214
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:22,288
If Omega is a rational number.

215
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:35,378
And zero. Otherwise, when think is irrational.

216
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:48,908
Right. So now let's picture what happens to the Derby results.

217
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:57,278
Right. So any interval I choose on the rail line will have infinitely many racial importance and infinitely many irrational points.

218
00:35:57,278 --> 00:36:05,198
And they are. The rational points will be downs within your rational right.

219
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:17,438
So and that means that if I take the lower value, if I write so because any interval I choose,

220
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:27,038
any delta will include any xi2x8 plus one will include an irrational number.

221
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:32,588
So the lowest value of the function in any of the intervals will be zero, right?

222
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:37,028
That's going to be for 80 I for any partition. Right.

223
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:44,858
And for the upper one, because any of the intervals will also include the rational number.

224
00:36:46,088 --> 00:36:52,028
So the upper value will be equal to one, right. The maximum also for any i y.

225
00:36:52,038 --> 00:36:55,238
So that would make the derby limits.

226
00:36:56,048 --> 00:37:00,698
So for but it's going to be greater than zero, right?

227
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:10,598
It's just the size of the interval I'm integrating for the four when I hope our values equal to one.

228
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:15,568
So that's for the rational number.

229
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:19,298
So for the irrational it will be zero. So the limits are never equal.

230
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:33,688
So limits of their bosoms. Zero and one.

231
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:46,308
And then. No. You call?

232
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:58,638
So that means this function is not relevant in the global.

233
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:24,718
Okay. But this is also a very jumpy function, right?

234
00:38:24,808 --> 00:38:33,778
Uh, it's. It's jumping, uh, uh, infinitely many times for any interval up and down from 0 to 1.

235
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:42,388
It's a pretty exotic one. And so we can see that the source of trouble here is the fact that it's jumping.

236
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:47,818
So for the discrete random waves.

237
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:51,538
So the the raman integral will serve.

238
00:38:51,958 --> 00:39:00,278
Uh. Serves absolutely continuous random variables.

239
00:39:03,348 --> 00:39:09,488
And the variables. Serves well.

240
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:18,028
Right. So for the discrete ones. So the integral is defined, uh, in a different way.

241
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:26,608
Uh, but uh, so the trouble with the integral is that, um.

242
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:36,328
So let's do a notation for it. So we have integral from A to B, I have some function, say F of X.

243
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:49,048
DMX. Right. And we find that this is a limit.

244
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,958
Uh, when. And goes to infinity. Uh.

245
00:39:57,098 --> 00:40:12,548
The step goes to zero of the sum of ie of either f with the upper bar or if with a lower bar times.

246
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:21,648
Delta I and Delta I is a difference between x i plus one and I.

247
00:40:25,928 --> 00:40:33,007
Some intentionally sloppy about the limits of that song because I don't want to talk about indexing here.

248
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:36,548
So it could be x, minus one, minus x I.

249
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:44,038
Excite minus X minus one, depending on how you index those points.

250
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:53,578
But this is how it looks like. And the the thing in here is the LA measure of the interval.

251
00:40:54,298 --> 00:40:59,308
That's the length of the interval.

252
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:10,308
High to exceed plus one. So we could say that the integral is taken.

253
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:21,358
He's taken over in the back of my.

254
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:46,168
Very reminiscent of. So it works well for functions that I absolutely continues with respect to the best

255
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:52,518
measure that basically justifies its use for absolutely continuous random variables.

256
00:41:53,268 --> 00:42:00,078
So now we also have the second class of distributions and that's where the matter can be discrete.

257
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:05,268
And we have a natural way to generalize the integral.

258
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:27,498
The remain integral. He's to consider.

259
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:47,108
Not only that measure, but some other measure. The measure of the intervals.

260
00:42:53,398 --> 00:42:56,568
So namely to define the integral.

261
00:42:57,478 --> 00:43:34,288
So instead of these. Make a change here and say that this is times a measure of the interval from x i to x plus one.

262
00:43:42,948 --> 00:43:46,088
Measure meal of that interval.

263
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:51,018
Now, of course, if new is the back massage, where back at the rim and integral.

264
00:43:51,558 --> 00:44:02,147
But we can now take meal that's driven by, let's say, a mixed discrete continuous CDV, in which case I can write this.

265
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:09,918
Integral is F of x plus one minus f of x.

266
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:18,228
I write and consider f to be these mixed, discrete, continuous.

267
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:31,178
And then this form, the integral is called.

268
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:44,118
The corresponding in the girl. He's called.

269
00:44:46,578 --> 00:45:12,608
The stilts and the go. And by construction, you see that this integral will serve the purpose of absolutely continuous distributions,

270
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:22,238
discrete distributions or any mixture of those. And now that we said that, this will be the class that will serve the whole statistics well.

271
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:28,688
So we only need to know really well the stilts in the Gulf.

272
00:45:28,808 --> 00:45:38,088
Right. And so let's see how, how it works.

273
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:45,468
Um, so, and the notation for such key integrals will be.

274
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:57,368
So integral, let's say, from A to B, uh, some function of X.

275
00:45:57,818 --> 00:46:06,198
Uh, well, either new D X or that can be variations, right?

276
00:46:06,218 --> 00:46:10,568
Or if we mean that, uh, it's, uh, using.

277
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:16,178
So if we change notation for this function so it's not linked to a PDF.

278
00:46:16,778 --> 00:46:30,248
Could be anything. Right? So if I have, uh, uh, a CD of defining my probability measure, then we could use notation like this.

279
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,558
Yeah. Where if defines the middle.

280
00:46:40,278 --> 00:46:44,987
Right. And it defines it's uh, uh, like here, right.

281
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:54,108
So the measure of the interval is the difference between the CD4 values at the ends of, of the interval.

282
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:07,618
Okay. So now when F is discreet, we already know how this looks like.

283
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:29,648
First of all, there will be points where they are that the if the interval includes these points, this difference will be larger than zero.

284
00:47:29,918 --> 00:47:36,368
As I make my position finer and fine and my axes merge closer together.

285
00:47:37,008 --> 00:47:44,438
So still some of them will be around those support points, and for them this will be greater than zero.

286
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:52,208
And that difference will be equal to the probability that an X takes this support point value.

287
00:47:52,998 --> 00:48:09,008
Um, so as a result, the integral will look like a sum, uh, of I write the values of the random variable.

288
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:18,218
Yeah. That's the support points times the probabilities of those support points.

289
00:48:19,088 --> 00:48:23,048
So the probabilities that are sitting at those support points.

290
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:33,378
Okay. And then, General, so we have a mixed discrete continuous distribution.

291
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:41,538
So the integral will have a sum of the remaining part of it and the discrete part of it.

292
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:52,038
But before we do that, so let's define the so called Xerox delta function.

293
00:48:54,078 --> 00:49:04,038
So at some point, I promise that we will use a notion of some kind of a PDF regardless of whether distribution is discrete, continuous or mixed.

294
00:49:04,518 --> 00:49:22,088
Discrete continuous. And so kind of an easy way to introduce this function is, let's say, to take a normal PDF.

295
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:31,948
All of us with means zero just to the right of zero,

296
00:49:32,568 --> 00:49:43,068
thinking that the direct delta function will be a limit as the mean goes to zero from the right and with some variable sigma squared.

297
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:46,968
So that's going to look something like this, right?

298
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:59,478
Well, the mean is just to the right of zero, and then they'll define, uh, delta x,

299
00:49:59,808 --> 00:50:12,798
uh, as a limit of the normal, uh, Sigma Square pdf when sigma squared goes to zero.

300
00:50:14,988 --> 00:50:22,008
Right. And if we visualize what happens so Sigma Square, this is the width of that graph.

301
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:37,548
Right. So that's going to be just an impulse that will shoot up to plus infinity, then immediately come back and be zero afterwards.

302
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:45,588
This is how the limit can be visualized.

303
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:49,728
And so it's not just the function.

304
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:53,388
So, first of all, will we get that?

305
00:50:54,078 --> 00:51:06,978
So it's going to be equal to plus infinity, uh, when X is equal to zero and it's going to be zero, otherwise when X is not equal to zero.

306
00:51:08,658 --> 00:51:14,898
But that's not all of the property as because.

307
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:24,648
So the integral of the normal pdf is going to be equal to one and of any limit of that normal pdf will still preserve that property.

308
00:51:25,158 --> 00:51:32,898
So the in the growth of delta of X over any interval that includes zero.

309
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:42,318
So this one and also integral from zero to infinity.

310
00:51:47,758 --> 00:51:50,908
D X is going to be still one.

311
00:51:54,368 --> 00:52:03,788
Now the reason why I'm dancing around 2.0 and making it a limit when my mien is a little bit to the right of zero.

312
00:52:04,328 --> 00:52:13,268
That's because I want to preserve the right continuity of the resulting function, because we're going to consider delta functions as derivatives.

313
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:21,018
So delta of x is a derivative.

314
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:31,948
Of the function that looks like. CDF.

315
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:36,238
That's a zero up until zero and one after that.

316
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:52,928
Of degenerate. CTF and degenerate means of a nonrandom.

317
00:52:57,438 --> 00:53:00,798
I know it sounds strange. Random. Random variables.

318
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:05,898
Um. That is equal.

319
00:53:08,748 --> 00:53:22,388
Is equal to zero with probability one. So that's this the graph of this the gender.

320
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:31,088
ZDF. Okay.

321
00:53:31,118 --> 00:53:35,408
So we can now define the pdf.

322
00:53:36,368 --> 00:53:40,358
I'll put it in quotes once, but then we'll stop doing that.

323
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:52,678
So the pdf of a discrete random variable. Yeah.

324
00:53:53,468 --> 00:54:01,418
So with some support points six K and the probabilities peak sitting at those support points.

325
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:11,428
It's defined as the sum. Of Delta functions times the probabilities.

326
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:35,948
So if you want to integrate, for example, this thing from A to B, F of x, the x.

327
00:54:38,118 --> 00:54:42,438
This. Well, an integral is a linear operator.

328
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:48,108
Right. And the only function that depends on the X here is the delta, right?

329
00:54:48,888 --> 00:54:56,678
And because it's linear, it's still a some of the key, key, key times.

330
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:10,428
Well, and the integral of the delta assuming it has a point, uh, a, the, the A to B has a point x k so that's going to be equal to one, right?

331
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:20,448
For any key such that, uh, x key is, uh, parts.

332
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:29,308
Ofeibea. So in other words,

333
00:55:29,308 --> 00:55:39,958
I need to look into the interval AB Collect all the support points that happen to be in that interval and sum up the corresponding probabilities.

334
00:55:41,188 --> 00:55:56,448
So that's going to be. The integral and if ad has all the support points I get uh, the uh uh uh natural fact that the sum of all pieces equal to one.

335
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:08,328
That probability is a one. Okay.

336
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:11,398
So let's have a five minute break and then continue.

337
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:28,608
So you have an interval right where X is included.

338
00:57:32,188 --> 00:57:43,398
Yeah, right. So the point is part of that interval because X minus one over M is less than x.

339
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:56,528
But you. So for now I'm just talking about the the of right right here.

340
00:57:56,828 --> 00:58:01,988
So X is part of it. Agree. Yeah.

341
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:08,428
So it's part of every interval. Right.

342
00:58:09,188 --> 00:58:14,618
Anything left of x is not part of this interval for sufficiently large you.

343
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:22,928
Right. So that means that and this is a set of common points to all of these internals.

344
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:32,138
So because X is part of all of them, X is going to be part of that countable intersection.

345
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:37,238
And anything left of X we just concluded is not part of that intersection.

346
00:58:37,538 --> 00:58:41,318
That's why it's closed on there at the point of X on the left.

347
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:54,458
So the open. Well, it was open from the very beginning.

348
00:58:54,458 --> 00:59:00,338
And this did not change. Right, because the one of our employees on the right end of the interval here.

349
00:59:05,578 --> 00:59:08,858
Oh, yeah. Okay.

350
00:59:09,118 --> 00:59:13,708
Of course, you need to guess correctly which interval to consider in a proof like that.

351
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:25,688
Right. But again, so this one is closed on the x axis part of every interval.

352
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:34,358
But anything left of x is not eventually a part of it and is sufficiently large that.

353
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:45,282
Okay. Shall we continue? So let's now look at mixed, discrete, continuous distributions.

354
01:01:55,082 --> 01:02:07,292
Next discrete continuous pdf that's going to look like is a sum up, so we will have normalization to it.

355
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:20,272
So we will have. Yeah. Uh, this would be the absolutely continuous components of the PDF.

356
01:02:41,152 --> 01:02:56,392
And the sum over key delta x minus x key x to is the discrete component of the pdf.

357
01:03:11,422 --> 01:03:15,112
So the normalization.

358
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:22,402
So the pdf will look like a discrete continuous distribution.

359
01:03:22,762 --> 01:03:30,172
It's just F of x plus some of the key delta x minus x key.

360
01:03:33,362 --> 01:03:38,762
So if I integrate, it's. IBTimes speaking.

361
01:03:44,772 --> 01:03:53,062
If I integrate it. Dex.

362
01:03:54,762 --> 01:04:01,932
So I will have an integral. Half of x d x.

363
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:11,012
But now that it has both a discrete, continuous, uh, a discrete component and the continuous component,

364
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:16,082
so that integral over the absolutely continuous path of it is going to be less than one.

365
01:04:16,892 --> 01:04:20,012
Um, and part of it will be served by.

366
01:04:26,192 --> 01:04:29,402
Right, so that in the grow from minus infinity to infinity.

367
01:04:30,842 --> 01:04:34,022
So that's the whole real line over which in the girl is taken.

368
01:04:34,892 --> 01:04:45,542
So that means it will include all the support points X, K, and each of them will filter out the peak when its respective delta is integrated.

369
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:52,202
So that will generate a sum of the case. And of course, this is equal to one.

370
01:04:52,982 --> 01:05:06,711
That's the normalization condition. And you could consider this, uh, kind of a generalization into mixed, uh, discrete continuous distributions.

371
01:05:06,712 --> 01:05:12,822
The specific cases are, of course, so if the integral F of x de x is absent, right,

372
01:05:12,852 --> 01:05:24,382
the continuous component of the pdf then normalization looks like the sum over k k is equal to one that's uh, trivial for discrete distributions.

373
01:05:24,742 --> 01:05:29,512
So the discrete component is missing here and the variable is absolutely continuous.

374
01:05:29,812 --> 01:05:37,641
And then the sum over CPK is going to be missing from that relationship than the integral from minus infinity to infinity.

375
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:42,892
F of x. The x is going to be equal to one right and for a mixed discrete continuous.

376
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:52,882
So they're both, uh, present. Uh, you can formally, uh, write down how the pdf the CDF uh.

377
01:05:57,452 --> 01:06:06,122
Right. So we rolled the PDF to see if we can say that this guy is the derivative of the CDF or the x.

378
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:22,762
And so we can go back to how those makes the CDs look like.

379
01:06:31,192 --> 01:06:39,652
This is it. Right. So the part that serves was served by they have absolutely a continuous component of the PDF.

380
01:06:39,652 --> 01:06:52,312
So that's the, uh, the period between the jumps and at the jumper adding the, the peaks that are corresponding to the size of that jump.

381
01:06:52,462 --> 01:07:07,432
Right. And if you differentiate this this function, you can represent it as an absolutely continuous function plus the, the jumps,

382
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:17,092
uh, with the delta functions sitting in them so that when you integrate over that jump you get the size of that jump.

383
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:34,522
Yeah. That's to your in the curl. Okay.

384
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:45,492
So. So we have the integral that we will use most of the time that defines our instruments.

385
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:56,562
But there's still a gap between the generality that we used when we defined random variables, probability spaces and so on,

386
01:07:57,822 --> 01:08:07,852
and the notion of the integral we have, uh, because for all of these integrals, right, they are taken over numbers.

387
01:08:09,492 --> 01:08:18,042
So the Riemann integral, the discrete one and the Riemann stilts integral.

388
01:08:32,562 --> 01:08:41,762
The girls are taken. Over our core subsets of our.

389
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:57,952
Right. But when we defined our probability spaces in our acts of armida.

390
01:08:58,872 --> 01:09:06,622
Right. So Onaga is part of capital or Omega, and that capital omega does not have to be.

391
01:09:07,492 --> 01:09:13,342
If we are as general as we were in the first in the beginning of the course.

392
01:09:15,962 --> 01:09:24,542
There does not have to be horror. Are numbers at all right?

393
01:09:26,652 --> 01:09:33,192
So the generality was that timing can be a sale of anything, not just numbers.

394
01:09:33,912 --> 01:09:41,202
Right. And in that sense, we have a problem because we don't have an integral for that type of for this type of function.

395
01:09:47,782 --> 01:09:57,312
Do not have an integral. Ford's.

396
01:10:05,652 --> 01:10:10,402
And then we can come back to the idea of the integral.

397
01:10:14,612 --> 01:10:25,021
I would still show the domain of the function that acts as has a real line, because that's a thing that can be easily visualized.

398
01:10:25,022 --> 01:10:30,182
But we are now thinking that this is Omega, not necessarily a real line.

399
01:10:33,352 --> 01:10:37,082
Right. So I have some X of Omega right here.

400
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:43,132
And my problem was with the integrals that, uh.

401
01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:49,351
So the starting point for defining the integral in the area under the curve was partitioning

402
01:10:49,352 --> 01:10:54,722
the the omega right in some way and then making this partition finer and finer.

403
01:10:56,432 --> 01:10:56,762
Right.

404
01:10:57,122 --> 01:11:07,562
And with when Omega is realigned, it's clear how to do that with just throw match points and the partitioning becomes a set of disjoint intervals.

405
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:15,211
Um, but for a general omega when we don't want to say what it is, the,

406
01:11:15,212 --> 01:11:22,772
the crux of the matter is that we cannot partition it in a reasonable way if it's not numbers.

407
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:25,982
I mean we can create partitions of Omega.

408
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:35,992
We defined what they are for General Omega's, but whenever uh, the considered kind of final partitions and things like that, right.

409
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:46,832
So the idea to uh, generalize the integral and make it apply to situations like this is to partition.

410
01:11:51,072 --> 01:11:56,232
Partition the range of X instead of the domain.

411
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:14,412
Right. So we step back and look at how the, uh, our usual integral was defined in calculus.

412
01:12:14,412 --> 01:12:19,602
So we partitioned the domain, the x axis. But it doesn't have to be the case.

413
01:12:20,112 --> 01:12:27,942
Who says we can't partition the y axis instead and define the integral this way?

414
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:32,112
So let's say I'm partitioning the y axis.

415
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:45,532
Then what we can say once, once I do that and I know how to partition it because the y axis is still they are right.

416
01:12:47,942 --> 01:12:54,462
So the range is still are. So we know how to petition it.

417
01:13:06,432 --> 01:13:12,761
So we happily divided the three match points, uh, on the y axis.

418
01:13:12,762 --> 01:13:17,111
Now, uh, create these intervals, right?

419
01:13:17,112 --> 01:13:22,482
We have values of the function ex within each of those intervals.

420
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:25,601
So these are just values like this.

421
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:37,212
So we can. Right.

422
01:13:37,332 --> 01:13:49,602
So each interval on the Y axis basically cuts generally several intervals of several segments of the graph.

423
01:13:51,072 --> 01:13:55,152
And we can say that, uh, so this is a set B,

424
01:13:55,632 --> 01:14:02,592
so we're now into getting in back into the familiar formalism that we used to define measurable functions.

425
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:12,222
So if I have a set B, which is now in the interval part of my partition of the Y axis, um, and uh,

426
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:25,692
I can find the pre image of B using X and that would be the union of several intervals at least, uh, the way it looks on my picture.

427
01:14:26,412 --> 01:14:31,842
Uh, so that's going to be a one, two, three.

428
01:14:32,712 --> 01:14:43,062
So I know that, uh, X minus one of D is a union, the one a to a three.

429
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:46,992
And when X is a measurable function, and these are the ones we consider.

430
01:14:47,472 --> 01:14:50,952
So that union is going to be part of my probability space.

431
01:14:55,322 --> 01:15:01,432
Uh, so part of the sigma algebra in that probability space and then know how to measure it.

432
01:15:02,262 --> 01:15:13,002
Right. So if I have a probability measure defined, then I will know what the measure of that thing is.

433
01:15:14,412 --> 01:15:18,852
So I have armida. I have a F and I have P.

434
01:15:22,582 --> 01:15:28,982
To Union E three. He's well defined.

435
01:15:36,582 --> 01:15:45,012
So I can now build the integral by using approximations like this.

436
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:59,472
Right. So if I can see the approximation for my ex of omega, namely considering it a constant function on any of the intervals the right,

437
01:16:00,972 --> 01:16:10,032
then I can see that I can also find the probability that X falls within this interval.

438
01:16:10,152 --> 01:16:13,152
That's going to be the measure of a union.

439
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:22,992
In this example, if of want a two and three, then I built up some of those values of X.

440
01:16:25,092 --> 01:16:35,482
So we approximate x. Acts by a discreet.

441
01:16:39,402 --> 01:16:44,052
Random variable. XM.

442
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:52,722
Right. And they analyze the number of intervals and my partition and I can say that the integral.

443
01:16:56,012 --> 01:17:01,232
Is equal to the limit. As my petition gets finer and finer.

444
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:06,652
Uh, and Delta, I now understand, is, uh.

445
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:16,512
Is the delta x on intervals of partitioned.

446
01:17:25,802 --> 01:17:29,732
Those are intervals of the TV that they have over there.

447
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:36,062
Right. Then I can say that I am taking values of X and.

448
01:17:39,682 --> 01:17:44,722
Well I need to probably two in this is there. So it's a random variable X.

449
01:17:47,282 --> 01:17:53,432
And with values. Yeah.

450
01:17:54,152 --> 01:17:58,682
I am. Right. And I will go on to.

451
01:17:59,992 --> 01:18:06,602
So on all the way to the end. So these will be.

452
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:14,162
Yes, I am tie ins. The manager of the pre me image.

453
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:26,482
Of those intervals. I'll put an index to show the beef.

454
01:18:28,012 --> 01:18:38,722
That's just one set of protections. Right.

455
01:18:38,752 --> 01:18:44,032
And such an integral will be called the integral.

456
01:18:55,482 --> 01:19:00,282
So this just gives you the main idea of it will give the rigorous definition.

457
01:19:02,622 --> 01:19:12,732
Next at the next lecture, um, but it's basically the main idea is to get around the fact that we have to well,

458
01:19:12,732 --> 01:19:16,212
we know how to partition the number axis.

459
01:19:17,232 --> 01:19:20,622
Uh, but not the only one. Okay.

460
01:19:20,772 --> 01:19:22,002
So that's it for today.
