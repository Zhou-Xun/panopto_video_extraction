1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,950
Now, I. I want to go ahead and get recording started.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,150
Everyone welcome. The fact that it's a double quick note.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,380
One Ryan currently on assignment plane so he will not be going in today and doing his research for the funeral.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,590
But we have Dr. Moyer here with us today. I love you.

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,120
Just one quick thing about assignment three solved.

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,890
I didn't know that there were a couple of things that were a little bit hard to find, like the morbidity that it was a little bit confusing.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,120
I know you would have used the daily work for that, actually.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,830
And then I do also know the mortality was a little bit confusing for some people.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,399
I just want to say if you're doing your assignment and you're struggling to find data like that, you'll figure it out on me.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,400
An email or a quick message on data. If I get a good number of people struggling with the same thing,

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,870
I can always make an announcement and tell you what pain at the data that you should be looking at, like the morbidity.

12
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,800
They know what they are, but it wasn't called inability. So I do understand why that was confusing.

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,310
So if you're struggling to find something about me now, I'm trying to find in the right direction or tell you what path to look at.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,550
But the fact that it wasn't. Well, first of all, great to see you all.

15
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,660
It's actually really nice to be back in person. I have not had a chance to do much in person teaching, so this is such a treat.

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:36,500
I'm Cheryl Hoyer. I'm faculty in the medical school, but my master's is in public health from USC and my Ph.D. is from public health here in Tempe.

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,090
So I definitely feel more at home. I feel like I'm with my people. So thank you all for having me.

18
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,000
Before I get started, how many of you have spent an extended amount of time in a low resource setting?

19
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,650
I think we're sort of Sudan and I saw a over there.

20
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,850
I lived in town and I don't work with the homeless population in Charleston.

21
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,290
I've done a lot of work in Detroit. Others that I missed.

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,459
Okay. Awesome. It's always helpful to have a little sense of who's in the room because this topic is

23
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:18,040
huge and I try to find the right altitude to pitch it out so it gets to high to low,

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
whatever. Just let me know. I'll do my best to adjust accordingly.

25
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,460
So women's health.

26
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:34,480
So every year, not every year I do these overviews, but women's health includes everything from sex selection at birth to education for girls,

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,490
child marriage, coercive, just sexual relationships, then into the reproductive years.

28
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,830
We're talking about family planning and abortion, antenatal care, facility delivery, postnatal care.

29
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,710
And then there is maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal infant under-five mortality.

30
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,519
Not to mention mental health, autonomy, HIV, STIs, violence against women.

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,000
And then in the older years, we're talking about cancer, heart disease and diabetes.

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,100
Any one of these could be its own lecture or perhaps its own course.

33
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,260
So it seems really unfair that in an hour we're going to try to touch on all of this.

34
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,220
So you probably will end this lecture feeling very dissatisfied.

35
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,270
But I actually consider that a good thing because that means you're curious and you want to go learn more.

36
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:29,180
So today I was going to show you oh, and not to mention the fact that all of these occur in their own legal and political contexts,

37
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:40,040
in various economic, different economic situations, and then different levels of service availability and within different social and cultural norms.

38
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,770
So when we talk about maternal morbidity in the United States, it's very different than maternal morbidity in Sudan.

39
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,759
And so as all of these things, there's just such huge variability in any one of these topics,

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,840
depending upon what population you're talking about, what geographic location you're in,

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,940
which also makes it really difficult to distill it all down into nice little bullet points that you can write in your notebook,

42
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,150
can be like, This is the definitive be all, end all.

43
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:11,030
Because if it's one thing you take away from public health is there's no such thing as like the definitive be all, end all.

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:20,570
So these red things are all topics that I've had some research on at some point,

45
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,780
but I'm not going to talk about all of these today because that takes forever. So these are the ones I'm going to focus on today.

46
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,120
So a little bit and that's what, five ish topics in an hour.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,210
So like 10 minutes of topic, which again is like excruciatingly painful.

48
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:47,270
And you may need to reel me back if I start going down tangents, but okay, so we're going to start with contraception and family planning.

49
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,540
And I like this quote from Melinda Gates. If women can plan their families, they're more likely to space their pregnancies.

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,450
And if they space their pregnancies, they're more likely to have healthy babies.

51
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:08,240
And if their babies are healthy, they're more likely to flourish as children. So that's the concept behind contraception slash family planning.

52
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,830
So if you're interested in family planning.

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:20,830
Family planning 2030 is like this definitive, gigantic organization that has a ton of stuff on their website, including this graph.

54
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,490
So family planning 2032 down here.

55
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,170
MCP stands for modern contraceptive prevalence.

56
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,990
And you can show these three graphs, show all women, married women and unmarried women,

57
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,980
which is a huge improvement over what they used to report, which was just married women.

58
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,850
So at least now they recognize that unmarried women might need family planning as well.

59
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,960
And it shows you different levels by region, Latin America and the Caribbean versus Asian Pacific versus Africa.

60
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,590
And what I'd like to point out here is the prevalence in Africa is significantly lower than elsewhere.

61
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:05,920
I'm also not quite sure by the 70% here, but be that as it may, because that's a little sidetrack.

62
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,030
Where the heck do they get all these data? This is all self-reported data.

63
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,710
And depending upon what the circumstances are and how you're asked, the question varies tremendously on how you're going to answer it.

64
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,790
If they are expecting you to using family planning, of course, yes, definitely.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,620
Versus if it's very taboo, you may not so. So point is different regions have different uptake of modern family planning.

66
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,950
This is a ridiculously confusing graph, but I'm going to try to make sense of it for you.

67
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:43,150
Okay, so there are different regions and in each of these regions there's different number of countries.

68
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,520
So like if you take West Africa right there, six, six, three and one, so that's 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 countries.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:57,950
Right. And what this shows you is that in six of those 16 countries, injectables are the most common method.

70
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,230
And in six of those 16 countries, the implants are the most common method.

71
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,350
Anyone want to hazard a guess as to what an implant and an injectable have in common?

72
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,190
Don't play fast. And no offense. You don't need to go to the pharmacy.

73
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,660
You don't need to tell anybody. So very common.

74
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,310
Most of my work is in Ghana, in West Africa. And nobody knowing that you're using family planning is kind of a big deal.

75
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,630
So that doesn't surprise me that implants and injectables are leaving the list.

76
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:38,750
But look here at Central America. In eight countries, the leading thing is sterilization.

77
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,970
And of course, I think I wonder if that was all purely voluntary.

78
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,350
And so I don't know. I have no idea.

79
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,460
But the point is, in different regions, you'll see a different method mix.

80
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,709
And it speaks to the culture and what's emphasized and also what's made available

81
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,390
by the unilateral bilateral organizations that show up with all the ideas.

82
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,360
So it's not as though a woman's individual choice is always the method that she gets.

83
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,049
There's a colleague and OBGYN. Her last name is Compton, Sarah Compton,

84
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:25,480
who's done a bunch of work looking at the difference between what women say they want in a method reversible few side effects this,

85
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,920
that and the other. And then what? They get an IUD that causes you to bleed.

86
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:40,010
And so you're like, Wait a minute, that doesn't match. So aside from all of that, there's a fair number of barriers to uptake in family planning.

87
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:47,330
Some of these quotes are a little bit old, but based upon what I've heard recently, they're not that different.

88
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,970
For us. We hear that the whites with these modern doctors of ours want to reduce Africans.

89
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,210
That's why they've bought family planning so that the Africans can get cancer.

90
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,240
Why should we support family planning? Or some ladies.

91
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,360
They can tell you that if she would talk to her husband about using those pills,

92
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,200
he could think she's a prostitute, a woman who cannot be trusted to be faithful.

93
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,809
And this is from a man for me. If you're calling with my wife, should she see a condom in my pocket?

94
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,970
And it will be real quarreling, telling me that I'm a prostitute getting women so I can't dare use condoms.

95
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,080
Lots of social, cultural, normative issues at play here.

96
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,140
And this sort of sums it up.

97
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,110
I think women, we think the more children that we produce, the more the husband will love you and then [INAUDIBLE] tell you, you know, my wife.

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,250
Polygamy is not uncommon in many parts of Africa. And then my wife is still young and is still producing.

99
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,880
It's a competition. So they continue competing, competing, competing.

100
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,270
My wife has produced, so now I must also produce.

101
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,410
So when your identity is wrapped up in fertility.

102
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,230
And someone's going to show up and say, here, take oral contraceptives that are good for you.

103
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,520
They'll make you make your life better. You're kind of like, wait a minute, what?

104
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:12,310
So for this first segment on contraception and family planning, I think for me, I try to sort of distill this down.

105
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:21,709
So what does all this mean? And I put this in here because my friend Dr. Priscilla, she is a Catholic nun in rural western Uganda.

106
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,410
She used to be the only region in western Uganda.

107
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,010
And at one point she said to me, when a woman comes to me on her 10th pregnancy and I know that if she has an 11th,

108
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,910
her uterus will rupture, as she put it, and her uterus is paper thin.

109
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,630
I know she cannot get and I know she can't get family planning.

110
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,860
Sometimes a tubal ligation is her best hope of surviving to raise those ten children.

111
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:51,810
But that's not necessarily what the church wants us to do. So when you think about what they were planning in that context, it's just complicated.

112
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,970
It's just very, very complicated.

113
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:02,010
So I think in the global health space and in the global maternal health space, there is a lot of champions of family planning.

114
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,430
And don't get me wrong. Family planning is good. Don't get me wrong.

115
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:14,339
There's an awful lot of champions that don't necessarily give a lot of time or attention to some of these other issues of what it

116
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:24,450
really means to a woman to be able to be fertile and to have children and to be able to control her choices about that stuff anyway.

117
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,860
And I'm really going to try hard not to editorialize, but I'm going to fail miserably.

118
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,709
I'll tell you, our next section is equally complicated abortion.

119
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,400
But before I go on there, any questions at first or any comments about the family planning stuff?

120
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,240
Okay. Well, we can always circle back to at the end, but if you think of something, don't hesitate to just yell at them.

121
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,210
So just to make sure we're all on the same page.

122
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,140
Abortion is a termination of pregnancy, but note that spontaneous and induced are sometimes lumped together.

123
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,450
So that means a miscarriage and an induced abortion can be coded as the same thing.

124
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,990
So this is a problem when you're looking at data.

125
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,590
I have a friend who we were looking at the demographic health survey data a few years back and looking at all the predictors of abortion,

126
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,740
only to finally look at the item and realize, Holy crap, this was both miscarriages and induced abortions.

127
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,080
So all these predictors were kind of meaningless because you don't really know what you're working with.

128
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,500
And then there's the issue of surgical abortion versus a medical abortion.

129
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:34,610
In many places, misoprostol is increasingly available, which is a pill you can take to induce bleeding.

130
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,600
And that's really changing the face of post-abortion complications.

131
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:45,320
There used to be a lot more post-surgical infections. And now what you're seeing is issues related to hemorrhage and bleeding.

132
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,030
And an unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating an unintended pregnancy carried out either by

133
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:00,540
persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that doesn't conform to minimal medical standards for both.

134
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,330
So this next slide is a quote that makes me queasy every time I read it.

135
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,250
But I include it on purpose.

136
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:17,410
Methods of unsafe abortion include drinking toxic fluids such as turpentine, bleach or drinkable concoctions mixed with livestock manure.

137
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,560
Other methods involve inflicting direct injury to the vagina or elsewhere.

138
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:29,620
For example, inserting herbal preparations into the vagina cervix, placing a foreign body such as a twig coat hanger or chicken bone into the uterus.

139
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:37,450
Or placing inappropriate medication into the vagina. Or rectum. Every time I read this, it makes me want to throw up.

140
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,210
But the point, the reason I put it in there is you got to be pretty darn desperate to put a chicken bone in your uterus.

141
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,300
And if women are willing to put a chicken bone in their uterus, like what?

142
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:57,140
Anyway. So when we look at where abortion is legal and illegal, this map keeps changing.

143
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,899
You can see that the I believe I'm not sure that it's showing up all together.

144
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,800
So the reddish is prohibited all together. The blue is sort of on demand and then there's kind of in-between for a bunch of different reasons.

145
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,450
But you can see there's there's certainly not consensus.

146
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,600
But then when we look at so that's where the laws are.

147
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:26,180
And when you look at the number and safety, the vast and so each circle, the size of the circle represents the number of abortions happening.

148
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,610
And then the white part is safe and the orange is less safe and the red is least safe.

149
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:40,340
So when you look at just the sheer numbers, most are happening in Asia, whereas if you look at the number of unsafe abortions,

150
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,290
nearly half of all abortions are happening in the least safe circumstances.

151
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:55,040
So the risk of dying from an abortion is highest in Africa. But yeah, you don't really think about things like look at Latin America.

152
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,810
And I know in Mexico a lot of abortions are provided by community organizations.

153
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,659
Would that be maybe considered less based on why that might be a percentage in Latin America?

154
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,910
That may be I don't know exactly how they define this, but yeah, I mean, that sounds plausible.

155
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,690
And this is another meta level point.

156
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,380
You go to conferences and you have these people that present all this cool stuff and they could have graphs and then you're like, Wait a minute, how?

157
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,630
How do they define that? Like, does that really include this, that or the other?

158
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:31,079
So be skeptical because a lot of times they don't tell you and you got like family planning 2030.

159
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm digging around in there to figure out like, okay, wait a minute, what exactly do they mean by modern contraceptive prevalence?

160
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,960
MCP I was like, moderate. So does that mean ever, does that mean today?

161
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,560
But what exactly does that mean? And there's no, they don't. I could not find it.

162
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:57,360
So be skeptical. So this graph I show just to relate to the fact that this is a case study in Romania

163
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,280
where you can see the total number of maternal deaths when abortion was restricted,

164
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:09,330
the number of maternal deaths kind of crept up a little bit and the number of abortion deaths crept up with it.

165
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,390
And then you can see that abortion was legalized and both dropped rather precipitously.

166
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,660
Abortion and maternal mortality are intricately linked in some places, more so than others.

167
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:30,720
So I kind of feel like, you know, regardless of your political affiliations and whatnot in many places, it's a it's an issue of maternal mortality.

168
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,050
And that's another piece of this puzzle. So what does all this mean?

169
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,490
A colleague I mentioned before, Sara Compton, did her dissertation on abortion in Ghana.

170
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,270
And these are some quotes from the interviews and focus groups that she did.

171
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:55,100
So where do you think most abortions are done? Most of them, meaning young girls, are afraid of going to the hospital, so they do it at home.

172
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,940
So in the case that they're bleeding profusely, that's when they're rushed to the hospital.

173
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:06,470
Why don't the girls go to the hospital? They're afraid of mistreatment that's often meted out to them any time they want to access such services.

174
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,870
Some also say that it's very expensive.

175
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,560
In our setting here, mothers and their daughters are not able to talk when it comes to issues of sex and pregnancies because they're shy.

176
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:25,159
So a lot of girls have died as a result of unsafe abortions. Next uplifting topic is maternal mortality.

177
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,910
Before we go, there are any questions or comments about the abortion stuff.

178
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,440
I'm so sorry. I feel like I'm pummeling you with terrible news.

179
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,049
Defining terms, maternal mortality, the death of a woman while pregnant.

180
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,160
Or within 42 days of the end of her pregnancy, regardless of the duration in sight.

181
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,440
And the key thing here is it's not from accidental or incidental causes.

182
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,010
So if a pregnant woman gets hit by a bus, that's not maternal mortality.

183
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,410
If a woman has an ectopic pregnancy and that ruptures and that kills her, that's a maternal mortality.

184
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,180
If there's a hemorrhage that happens after delivery, that's maternal mortality.

185
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:09,810
So the people who conflict maternal deaths with maternal mortality, they are quite different.

186
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,580
The maternal mortality ratio is deaths per 100,000 live births.

187
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:24,829
And I point this out because neonatal and infant and under there's the termination and termination as and when you give birth naturally.

188
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,990
And that's when the pregnancy test. Oh, yes. Yes.

189
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,849
So yeah, it does. Regardless of at the end, basically termination in this sense means.

190
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,510
And so that's giving birth or having an abortion or having a miscarriage.

191
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:47,130
So 100,000 live births I mentioned for a reason because the under-five infant and neonatal is per thousand live births.

192
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:57,750
So if you see 274 as the ratio for maternal mortality and then you see 27 for babies, it is not that the moms have ten times higher death rates.

193
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:05,069
The denominators are different. So that's another thing that took me a little while to figure out that, wait a minute is a thousand, 10,000.

194
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,420
But they're different because the rates for moms are much lower than for babies.

195
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,380
So they use a smaller, larger denominator to work with the moms.

196
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,970
So what causes maternal deaths?

197
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:27,979
Most can be accounted for by those top four boxes hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders or high blood pressure, sepsis, infections and obstructed labor.

198
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:34,250
And then you'll see that unsafe abortion usually leads to kind of bounce back and forth the right around 8 to 10%.

199
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,940
But the point is 60% of maternal deaths are caused by these cells.

200
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:45,200
And many of these conditions also contribute to some of the leading causes of newborn deaths.

201
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,329
So this is a hideous table that you should never put in a slide presentation because it's far too busy.

202
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:59,409
But I wanted to show you this. So this is a table looking at the number, the wrong number of maternal deaths.

203
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,460
And I wanted to show you.

204
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:11,440
In the world, they talk about nearly 300,000 maternal deaths each year and sub-Saharan Africa has about 2000 to 200000 of those.

205
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,910
So about two thirds of all maternal deaths are occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.

206
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:25,080
And then if you look at the lifetime risk of maternal death, so that's once you hit age 15,

207
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,600
how many of your peers, one out of six, are going to die from a pregnancy related issue?

208
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,530
So in this case, a low number is bad because one out of 30 is obviously worse than one out of 300.

209
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:46,080
In sub-Saharan Africa, your risk is one out of 37. Whereas in North America, where one out of 3100.

210
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,830
So, you know, that's quite different.

211
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,160
But I would also like to point out that we're still way worse than Australia, New Zealand and Europe.

212
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,990
So the idea that North America's got it figured out, we're not there.

213
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,940
So, yes, we're doing better than other places, but we still have room for improvement.

214
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:15,150
So how can these deaths be prevented? Effective antenatal care, which is the same as prenatal care, skilled birth attendants,

215
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,840
people who know what they're doing when you give birth clean deliveries.

216
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,560
The idea of using sterile equipment. Being in a sterile environment.

217
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,030
Access to medication. Access to emergency obstetric care.

218
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,460
Access to safe abortions. And high quality, patient centered care.

219
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,120
Why on earth would I add that? If you have all of this.

220
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,909
But it's a place a woman won't go because she feels judged or she feels marginalized,

221
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,420
or she feels like they're going to talk smack about her after she leaves.

222
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,540
She's not going. And so that patient centered care piece is becoming more important.

223
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,180
There's a lot of research around PCC patient centered care are M.S. respectful maternity care.

224
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,250
And it's the idea that in many places that has not been prioritized.

225
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:09,520
It's been, oh, survival is the only thing that matters. We don't really care how we treat our patients as long as they survive, everything's good.

226
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,290
And now there's much more of a light being shined on how people are treated.

227
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,010
And does that make them more likely to come for care in the future?

228
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:27,330
So I'm sure you guys are all familiar with the Millennium Development Goals, which, you know, say what you will about them.

229
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:37,110
These red countries are not likely to hit the target for 2015 until 2040 or later.

230
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:48,240
So there's a fair amount of the world that isn't reducing its maternal mortality rate by 75% from 1990 levels until at least 2040.

231
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,160
So I think we all have a fair amount of work to do. And what does this all mean?

232
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,969
So I don't know if you guys know Nick Kristof, who used to be a columnist at The New York Times,

233
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,950
and I don't know exactly what he's doing right now, but brilliant writer. He wrote Half the Sky, the equivalent of he.

234
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,960
And he wrote the equivalent of five jumbo jets worth of women die in labor each day.

235
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,430
The lifetime risk of maternal death is a thousand times higher at a poor country than in the West.

236
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:18,360
That should be an international scandal. Can you imagine if five jumbo jets crashed today?

237
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,670
Just imagine the kerfuffle and then imagine it happening again tomorrow.

238
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,440
Can you even. I can't even wrap my head around that. And yet that's happening every day and.

239
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,970
Oh, well, because it's happening somewhere else, so we don't see it.

240
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:40,060
So it doesn't really seem like it's relevant, which I struggle with.

241
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,320
Next topic is delivery. But before I do that, any comments on this last bit?

242
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,330
Yes. Are there any programs that are being done? Like, for example, New Zealand.

243
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:58,500
New Zealand, Australia are in Europe where they're able to have less maternal mortality rates.

244
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:05,250
And, you know, I can't say that I know enough about that to speak with any degree of certainty.

245
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,750
I would speculate that the universal health coverage has something to do with it.

246
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:18,510
I would speculate that more the role attitudes toward family planning and abortion, I would think might have something to do with it.

247
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:26,640
But those are my guests. And when in doubt.

248
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:33,809
Yes. So some of the delivery so facility delivery is one of the things they say is one of the

249
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,190
best things you can do to prevent maternal mortality is have women deliver in a facility.

250
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,970
But guess what? They don't really define what a facility is.

251
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,920
Facility delivery is defined as childbirth that occurs in a setting designed to provide health care.

252
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,880
But note that doesn't really mean anything about that building.

253
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,560
You could have a building with a cross on it. You walk in and have a baby, and that's called facility delivery.

254
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,020
So when you look in the data and they talk about facility delivery, they often aggregate the lowest level health centers with hospitals.

255
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,290
And so, yes, somebody could have delivered in a health post with a community health nurse,

256
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:22,240
and that's considered equal to delivering in a tertiary care hospital with a maternal fetal medicine specialist.

257
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:30,550
So there are issues with the data. Skilled birth attendant tries to get at that midwife, physician, obstetrician,

258
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:36,850
nurse or other health care professional who provides basic and emergency health care services to women and their newborns during pregnancy,

259
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,770
childbirth and the postpartum period.

260
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:48,520
In an ideal world, you would go to a facility that was well equipped with a provider who was well-trained and that would be considered good.

261
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,400
This shows you that facility and provider are not always the same.

262
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:03,460
You can see that in Central Africa you're more likely to deliver in a facility than you are to have a provider at your delivery.

263
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,660
Whereas in Northern Africa you're more likely to have a provider at your delivery than you are to deliver a facility.

264
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,480
So they're not exactly identical. Yeah.

265
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,799
I just was wondering like, how are the providers time in this?

266
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,190
Like the setting for like midwives and stuff like that or like just physicians?

267
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:31,220
Yeah, it includes a broad range. It includes midwives where they they want they define it as someone with training.

268
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,260
So you can't be a traditional birth attendant because that would have not you wouldn't have gone to school for that.

269
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,990
But they do include community midwives as long as there's been some schooling associated with it.

270
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:49,499
But as you know, midwifery school is different than going for a region training with residency and fellowship and all this stuff.

271
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:57,350
So. The other thing is the percent of facility deliveries really varies by rural and urban status.

272
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,740
It's much higher if you live in a city, which isn't surprising because there's probably more likely to be a facility nearby.

273
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,950
But you can also see the differences between rural and urban vary depending upon your region.

274
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:16,730
So and the other thing I wanted to point out is, regardless of where you are,

275
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:22,790
the if you look at green is delivering at home is delivering in a government facility.

276
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:30,620
Red is a private NGO. No matter where you are, the poorest women are most likely to deliver at home.

277
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,750
And it's a gradient. So there's this economic gradient that's pretty consistent.

278
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,500
The richer you are, the more likely you are to deliver in a facility.

279
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,870
And this graph talks about the type of provider at the most recent birth.

280
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,890
You can see your doctors and nurses. About 40%.

281
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:57,150
And then other health care providers. The thing I wanted to draw your attention to is the purple.

282
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,970
Holy crap. They're like 20% of people litter with no one.

283
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,629
Like, no one. I've had two kids.

284
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:12,160
I can't even I can't. I can't even. And yet that's not abnormal.

285
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:19,650
So there's a lot of room for improvement in the pregnancy delivery facility, base delivery stuff.

286
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:27,690
Some of the trends there, as we've talked about, there are big social and cultural factors that are linked to facility delivery.

287
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,950
In some places, it's preferred that you deliver.

288
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,690
At home, it's cheaper.

289
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,990
Sometimes you need permission from your husband or your mother in law before you can leave your home to go deliver in a facility.

290
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:46,050
And it's not like some woman can just call either and like get herself to the facility.

291
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:53,520
She needs her family to help. And if her family doesn't want her to go, she doesn't really have a whole lot of choice.

292
00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:03,210
Like I said, the logistics of getting to the facility from remote areas, the cost, the care itself, and there's also a little bit of leftover.

293
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:10,710
I don't want to say this. There's a pride in having delivered at home because you were strong enough to take it.

294
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:19,510
Which doesn't account for the fact that different people experience pregnancy very differently and 10% of pregnancies have terrible complications.

295
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,640
And you really can't predict always what 10% is going to be.

296
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:31,450
But there is still a pride in having stayed at home and talked it out, which lingers in places that said,

297
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:38,830
facility delivery and skilled attendance are increasing, but the quality of care is still an enormous issue.

298
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,850
Provider skills and knowledge, availability of equipment and supplies, physical infrastructure of the facility and maltreatment.

299
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,450
As I mentioned,

300
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:53,770
we've done some work in Ghana where now they're saying 85% of their women deliver in a facility and everyone's cheering and that's fabulous.

301
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,720
Has the maternal mortality rate drop or has the neonatal mortality rate dropped?

302
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:07,570
Not really. And when you look at those facilities where women are delivering, many of them are not equipped for basic emergency obstetric care,

303
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,940
let alone the comprehensive emergency obstetric care, which would include C-sections and transfusions.

304
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,560
We're talking basic emergency like assisted delivery with forceps.

305
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,890
Like basic stuff that they're not equipped to do.

306
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,519
But it was in a facility. So call it a win.

307
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,860
Got health services super happy about it. And it is better, I guess maybe than delivering at home.

308
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:34,390
But you kind of wonder when you're not seeing any change in the indicators.

309
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,450
So. Yeah. So I mentioned maltreatment.

310
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,540
This gets back to that person centered care where special maternity care,

311
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:51,390
maltreatment is a broad category of physical abuse, verbal abuse, neglect, detention for nonpayment.

312
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,020
Meaning I will keep your baby until you can pay the bill. Discrimination and denial of traditional practices.

313
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,410
Some women may want to give birth in a certain position or drink a herbal concoction or something,

314
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,260
and they're not allowed to do that if they go to the facility.

315
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:13,970
And here's a quote from Ghana in the house, the old women, meaning the midwives or the traditional birth attendants will pamper you.

316
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,810
But in the hospital they'll be shouting on you and treating you as if you're not a human being.

317
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,560
So in a context like that, who's going to want to go deliver in a facility?

318
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,960
You have a choice of staying home with your lovely, wonderful aunties who are going to hold your hand and tell you you're doing well.

319
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,950
Or you can go to a facility and have people yell at you and make you feel like crap.

320
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,680
So it's not always an irrational decision to not deliver in a facility.

321
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,390
So what does all this mean? This is another quote from one of my beloved grandmothers.

322
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,600
But for us, in the olden days, we will stay in the house and will be commanding the woman to push.

323
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,780
And all of a sudden you will see the woman's lying dead. And we will carry her to go and bury.

324
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,180
So this is the reason why we've accepted the Hospital for Women to go and deliver them.

325
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,910
So on the whole, there is a an appreciation of getting women to a facility for delivery.

326
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,260
Any comments about that before we move on to neonatal mortality?

327
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,270
Forget how depressing this talk is. So impressive.

328
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,490
Okay. Defining terms. Stillbirth is an infant who is born dead, never takes a breath.

329
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,999
And then there's a distinction between a fresh stillbirth,

330
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,870
which is one who died probably within hours of delivery versus one who died probably days before delivery.

331
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,600
The reason that's a distinction is one probably could have been saved by an emergency C-section.

332
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,230
The other one probably couldn't have been saved by an emergency C-section.

333
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,660
Neonatal mortality is a death that occurs within the first 28 days after birth.

334
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,430
Early neonatal is for seven days. Late neonatal is 8 to 28.

335
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,270
Infant is a death that occurs within a year of birth and under fives deaths that occur within five years of birth.

336
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:11,320
Now these three are cumulative rates. So if you were to see an under-five rate of, say, 75 per thousand, you would expect to see an infant rate of,

337
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:17,380
I don't know, maybe 35,000 and maybe a neonatal mortality rate of maybe, I don't know, 25, 4000.

338
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:24,370
The point being that if you were to see an under-five mortality rate that was lower than neonatal, that doesn't make sense.

339
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,270
So and I've seen that before. So it means the person is reporting it wrong.

340
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,230
So these add up. So you would have 17 or 25 plus 35 and whatever.

341
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,570
You got my point. So when do most babies die?

342
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,740
They die in the first couple of days. And it's it's pretty obvious.

343
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:45,220
So this is an old slide that I keep in here for a reason.

344
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:53,370
You notice anything weird about this graph? They're weird spiders.

345
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,700
Yeah. When do you think those might happen? Remember I come.

346
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:07,440
It's actually seven days, 14 days, 21 days, which are, what, one week, two weeks, three weeks.

347
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,460
People report. My baby died in two weeks. Was it exactly 14 days?

348
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:17,040
I have no idea. But the way these data are collected, the data collectors will just lump it.

349
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:25,290
So this is a literal data collection that didn't account for exact dates as opposed to this newer when

350
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,300
it's all nice and smooth and it doesn't have like a 14 day blip or a 21 day blip or anything like that.

351
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:36,600
So this graph also shows you the number of stillbirths, which is pretty high,

352
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,820
the number of deaths in women, which relative to the neonatal is pretty small.

353
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:47,760
And then the number of neonatal deaths between birth and 28 days.

354
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,250
And the point here is the same as the last slide. The first couple of days are the riskiest.

355
00:34:53,670 --> 00:35:00,420
And if you can make it those first couple of days, you're in good shape, which this slide drives home.

356
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:07,620
Childbirth itself is the riskiest point for maternal mortality for neonatal child.

357
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,460
That childbirth window is really, really tough. And a lot of that childbirth is about getting good care.

358
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,599
So this graph is confusing and horrible.

359
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,150
And I'm sorry, but I wanted to show you two things.

360
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,430
So if you look at. Under-five and neonatal mortality by region.

361
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,330
First of all, you can see it's way higher in sub-Saharan Africa than it is in Europe and North America.

362
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,830
You can also see that the under-five rate is higher than neonatal.

363
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,660
You can also see it's dropping.

364
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:51,820
But if you look at the rate that the under-five rate the under-five is dropping versus the rate of neonatal change, it's not changing nearly as fast.

365
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:59,630
Part of that is immunizations. Kids are getting more immunizations and so more kids under five are surviving.

366
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,970
But if you look at the difference here,

367
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:11,750
it doesn't show it so well in this graph that they basically say about half of under five deaths are attributable to the newborn period.

368
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:19,430
So 28 days, your first 28 days of life. Half of all kids under five die, which is mind boggling.

369
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,680
So again, it's sort of like when you think about critical windows of intervention, that first 28 days is really important.

370
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:30,260
I would also say that, you know, Europe and North America, while the rates are lower, boy, are they flat.

371
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,400
So there's not like, what's up with that? It seems like we ought to have been able to make some change, but not so much.

372
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:46,350
Yeah. So you mentioned that the riskiest time for a newborn is within the first couple of days after.

373
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:52,140
Is that the same for the mother as well as the last like hours after?

374
00:36:53,070 --> 00:37:01,680
I can't say within hours. My understanding is from like the day before birth itself to the days after that,

375
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:07,500
that window is way riskier then a couple of weeks later or a couple weeks before.

376
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:16,350
So I can't say exactly when that starts, whether it's 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, but it's that window right around delivery that is so risky.

377
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,050
You had a question. Why don't you start? Why is Ocean Star Time?

378
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,360
That's a great question I'm sure in the graph that I to get from.

379
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:34,160
There was probably a disclaimer about what was included in Oceana and I didn't catch it when I was a.

380
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:45,580
So is this chart or if, you know, like based on avoidable deaths like things like birth defects that were it would have inevitably killed them.

381
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,750
So it wasn't something like if they had better care, they would have been cured.

382
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:55,840
No, these include all. And so when you talk about like and you're you're raising a really good point.

383
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,629
When you look at what causes newborn deaths,

384
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:07,720
congenital malformations is the gigantic euphemism for all of those birth defects that could potentially be incompatible with life.

385
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,080
And so that includes these and I don't know. At this rate, I'd love to talk to a neonatal allergist.

386
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,810
Are we at a point where there are just a certain number that are dying from total malformations science?

387
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,890
Right, right. Right. Is that what's going on? I would argue probably not.

388
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,450
Based upon what I know. I think there are still some issues.

389
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,360
But yeah, it's a good question because yeah, we very well may be hitting up against that.

390
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,140
I don't know. But we're still higher than Australia. New Zealand. So they're doing something right?

391
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,800
Yes, we can see. That may be distrusted by voters in recent years has also passed away.

392
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,550
Pregnant people in America and what they're willing to look like,

393
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,050
even if they've been in the hospital for a week, you know, they might not feel comfortable mentioning.

394
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,840
Yes. Yes, I'm sure you all heard that.

395
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:07,250
Was it Serena Williams who went through the Serena who went through the whole maternal morbidity thing?

396
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,650
And here she is, this famous for those of you who don't know she was pregnant.

397
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:16,559
She had had I think she'd had a clot before.

398
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:23,640
So she knew what it felt like, a new normal, whatever that stands for, anyway, she'd had it before, so she kind of knew what it felt like.

399
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:28,500
And then Post Pregnancy was having those same feelings. It was like, this is a problem.

400
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:33,600
And everyone was just kind of pooh poohing her, like telling her she was being dramatic.

401
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,570
And here she is. Fortunately, she's a strong woman who was like, No, I need care.

402
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,930
But she had to fight tooth and nail to get it because everyone was like, Oh, no, no, no, no, you're fine.

403
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:51,600
And I do think there's been a lot of discussion about minimizing women's symptoms, minimizing what women say is painful or uncomfortable.

404
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,590
And you throw on top of that issues with race and issues with disparities.

405
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,070
And it's yes, it's it's a very charged environment right now.

406
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,470
And I can imagine that if I were in some of these women shoes, I wouldn't want to go to the doctor.

407
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,620
So, yes, there are huge issues. Okay.

408
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:19,580
So one of the things I wanted to point out is we have not all of these data that I've shown you have been pre 2020.

409
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,120
This is a slide that includes data from 2020. And we all know what happened in 2020.

410
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:33,560
The world shut down. Right? And here you have a slide that shows the number of children who didn't receive the first dose of their diphtheria,

411
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,500
tetanus, pertussis vaccine and for the first year in a long time jumped up.

412
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,770
So what we don't know is post 2020, how are all these graphs going to change?

413
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:54,580
Because when everything just kind of shut down and care was on an emergency only basis, what did that do to preventive care?

414
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:59,420
What did that do to prenatal care? What did that do to attitudes toward facilities?

415
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,360
So over the next few years, you guys will have a chance to see how some of those data points change.

416
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,500
And there's a lot of question about what was the what was the real source of that?

417
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,160
Was that fear of going to the hospital because you didn't want to get COVID?

418
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,459
Was it not getting your vaccination?

419
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:22,030
Like what was going on there? So then what causes neonatal deaths?

420
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:29,200
This gets to the question of four 7% congenital abnormalities, but most are complications of prematurity.

421
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,430
Severe infections like sepsis and birth asphyxia.

422
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:40,810
And birth asphyxia is associated with prematurity because when babies are premature, their lungs aren't fully developed.

423
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,960
So it's also a little bit weird to figure out, like birth asphyxia could be a complication of prematurity.

424
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:52,120
So some of the categorizations of these buckets is a little difficult, I think.

425
00:41:52,120 --> 00:42:00,520
But the point is 75% of neonatal deaths are caused by three main infection or three main issues globally.

426
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,190
Now, if you look at this in the United States, it's not like that.

427
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:10,420
I was we have data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services on deaths from infants from 2008 to 2018.

428
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:19,390
And when you look at the cause of death, it's like there's like ICD nine codes and all this crazy stuff out of all these things I can't pronounce,

429
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,280
because here it's not quite as simple as like boiling it all down to that.

430
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:33,610
So you still see a number of babies dying, but it's the the conditions are much more complicated to desegregate and to try to understand,

431
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:39,040
which is why I would need to be working with a new metallurgists if I were to try to do anything with those data.

432
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,810
So how can these deaths be prevented? I'm sure it's going to look quite familiar.

433
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,190
Effective antenatal care, skilled birth attendants, clean deliveries,

434
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,860
access to medication, access to emergency care and high quality, patient centered care.

435
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,959
What does all this mean? There used to be a lot of diseases killing children.

436
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,330
But now that we go to the hospital and they vaccinate them, that's why such diseases no longer have power over them.

437
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:10,180
But the newborn baby is not yours and God takes it from you, is what we say about why it had died.

438
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,490
The nurses did their best. But what God wanted to do was what happened.

439
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:21,240
I put these up here because in northern Ghana, at least, where I've done a fair amount of my work,

440
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:27,330
the idea that a baby isn't meant to be is one of the most common things that you'll hear if the baby dies.

441
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:35,040
It just wasn't meant to be. And I get it. I think that that would be a way to make sense of high levels of mortality.

442
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,629
It just wasn't meant to be. But it's also heartbreaking. This is from an interview that we did.

443
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:49,160
I had a project where we were doing interviews with moms who had lost babies as well as who had survived.

444
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,270
And this is a quote. Well, this part isn't the quote. This is a setup.

445
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:00,230
In July, a pregnant woman in northern Ghana arrived at a facility and later the clerk was trying to find her antenatal care records,

446
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:07,430
during which time the baby's head began to crown. Other patients in the waiting area, jumped up to assist and called for the nurse.

447
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:15,350
And this is what the woman says. By the time the nurse came, the child's head was out and the woman who assisted me used cloths and covered me.

448
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:20,270
The nurse came and removed the child and put it down and was then trying to remove the placenta.

449
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,920
When she finished removing the placenta and then turned to look at the child, it had died.

450
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:30,620
And she said, Oh, when she said Oh, I asked her what was wrong and she said nothing.

451
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:38,840
So it was there at the outpatient department that the child died. Like this example just breaks my heart on so many levels.

452
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:46,610
There's so many things in this little scenario that you feel like could have been done differently.

453
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:51,050
And yet I also understand how this happens. It's chaos and there's not enough staff.

454
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,760
And, you know, people come in late. I totally get how this could happen.

455
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,260
But at the end of the day, there's a clerk wasting their time trying to find a record.

456
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,410
There's other patients helping this woman deliver.

457
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:09,620
There's a single nurse who's so focused on the mom that she doesn't like rub the baby or like do any of the

458
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:14,299
things you're supposed to do to get a newborn stimulated enough to breathe so that then by the time she works,

459
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,990
she's like, Oh, and the mom is like, What happened? And she says, Nothing, nothing.

460
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,720
She said nothing. So. Anyway.

461
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:26,190
So the point. It's really complicated. It's just complicated.

462
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,800
If there was a simple solution to these issues, people would have figured it out and we'd be doing it.

463
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,660
But it's complicated. Okay.

464
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:44,330
I'm winding down. I think we've got morbidity and then a little bit of coverage of interventions and then I promise I'm going to stop talking at you.

465
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:49,910
Any questions before I move on to morbidity? Yeah, sorry about that.

466
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:56,570
Right. Well, what big groups are more prevalent in the workforce in the area that you do work in?

467
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,580
And so it's split.

468
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:13,250
There's like probably 40% Muslim, maybe 50% Christian, 10% traditional and Christian ranges widely from sort of Pentecostal to, you know, Episcopal.

469
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,730
So there's a pretty big range. But faith is strong.

470
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,620
You know, we call it a muscular Christianity. It's very strong.

471
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:29,150
And so that plays a big role in how people cope and and just their whole frame of mind.

472
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:41,600
So. Your question. From your work in Ghana, have you seen obstetric fistulas and do they really haunts your ability or mortality?

473
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:48,470
Yeah. So I personally have not seen fistulas, but I know it's not uncommon.

474
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:56,030
So for those of you not familiar with fistulas, so when you have obstructed labor and the baby's in the birth canal for way too long,

475
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:02,149
what can happen is there can become an opening between the vaginal canal and the colon.

476
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,770
So that then stool leaks for ages after.

477
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,140
And you become like a social pariah because, you know, unless you have it surgically fixed.

478
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,969
So here somebody would just stitch it up and you'd be fine. Whereas sometimes they don't know.

479
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:20,120
That official has happened until like later.

480
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,950
And then it can be really bad.

481
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:32,630
So I had a student in spend a summer in Uganda at one of the surgical fistula camps where Sister Priscilla, who you just saw, spent.

482
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:38,809
They have a call out to the community for miles around saying we're going to do fistula surgeries.

483
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:43,760
Anyone who has this problem of leaking urine, leaking feces, please call them and we will help you.

484
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:50,300
And so the students spent a summer interviewing women and trying to get dig into this.

485
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,650
So it is more common way more common than here.

486
00:47:55,010 --> 00:48:03,410
I don't think it's as big of an issue so much in Ghana, because I think Ghana has done a pretty good job of making facilities accessible.

487
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:09,290
That doesn't mean they've solved obstructed labor issues, but that's the best I can answer.

488
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:16,550
But I can send you my my students paper was really interesting to work on day of the questions.

489
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:25,930
So morbidity. So morbidity is basically illness, badness, not death.

490
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,669
And when you think about how is that related to mortality?

491
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:38,680
So there's a certain number of maternal deaths. There's a certain more than that are near-misses, moms who survive a life threatening event,

492
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:43,780
and then beyond that or other complications and long term disabilities.

493
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,990
So there's kind of a range. And for every one death, there's X number of other events.

494
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:58,830
So what's a near miss? So there are multiple definitions of near misses, which I won't bore you with because they're all really clinical.

495
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,490
But the idea is it's having a life threatening complication that you survive.

496
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:09,100
And the types of complications are these severe hemorrhage, which is bleeding, retained placenta,

497
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:17,140
which can get really infected, obstructed labor, prolonged labor, preeclampsia, sepsis, which is infection, etc.

498
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:18,580
So these are bad.

499
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:27,310
And when you have these in a place that's under-resourced, it's really difficult to treat them appropriately, which is why a lot of women nearly die.

500
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:38,740
So this is a graph that shows you the number of near-misses for every maternal death in several different countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

501
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:45,790
So, you know, is for every one death, there's five near-misses versus in Ivory Coast for every one, but there's 18 near-misses.

502
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,510
But here's the question. We don't really know is that a good thing or a bad thing?

503
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,920
Because maybe 18 near-misses for one death means, wow, more women are surviving.

504
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,400
Maybe that's awesome. Maybe it means, wow, that's really crappy care.

505
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:06,430
So we don't really know. This issue of a near miss is really murky, which is why you don't see it talked about all the time.

506
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,520
So I had a fellow from Uganda who is here as a UMass fellow.

507
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:16,359
I don't know if you guys have heard of UMass. It's the University of Michigan African Presidential Scholars Program.

508
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:24,400
UMass. Every year African scholars come from like August until December or February and spend time here working with a mentor.

509
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:31,450
Anyway, she worked with me in taking her dissertation and turning it into papers, and this was from her dissertation.

510
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,409
She went around and interviewed some ridiculous number of women in rural Uganda

511
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:40,750
who had suffered a near-miss and found that 55% of them had had a hemorrhage,

512
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:43,030
which was pretty profound.

513
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:53,080
And most of them would tell you, All I know is I woke up later and they told me I had bled and they had to give me eight units of blood.

514
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,310
And it's no wonder I survived. So not uncommon.

515
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,330
The bleeding thing is not trivial. So what does all this mean?

516
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:09,200
As we move away from maternal mortality as an indicator, because you saw the numbers are a little bit smaller for maternal mortality.

517
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,150
So it's harder to see a big difference.

518
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:18,950
Maternal morbidity is something that we can think about as a measurement for quality of care and for improvement over time.

519
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:23,490
So last chunk of slides and then I'm going to stop talking.

520
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:33,360
So this is a really ridiculously busy slide. You don't need to appreciate anything on it except from pre-pregnancy all the way through childhood.

521
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:41,340
These are a whole bunch of interventions that show coverage and the graph itself is the mean for the global mean,

522
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,790
and then the little red dots are the little country levels.

523
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,710
And then if you look at these, I'm going to flip it on its side so you can actually see it.

524
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:56,760
So if you look at pre-pregnancy, you can see family planning is 50 some odd percent.

525
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,480
And if you look at pregnancy doing pretty well,

526
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:07,170
it's the immunizations that people are actually doing pretty well with skilled attendance at delivery doing pretty well.

527
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:15,510
But then look at postnatal visits for babies are back down to like 60% and early initiation of breastfeeding is down below 60%.

528
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:22,140
And then if you move into that infancy period, exclusive breastfeeding is probably the lowest indicator.

529
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,700
And then in childhood,

530
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:31,830
you've got vitamin A supplementation and care keeping for pneumonia symptoms and oral rehydration treatment for diarrhea is really pretty low.

531
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:42,930
So the point I think, of this messy set of slides is there's a ton of coverage indicators and you can look country by country,

532
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:49,650
you can look globally, you can think about what window of time in this whole reproductive span you're interested in.

533
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,490
But gosh, it's messy. It's really messy. Okay.

534
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:59,940
Today, I was going to talk about family planning, abortion facility delivery and maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal mortality.

535
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,670
And I think we did it in less than an hour with you. So thank you all so, so very much.

536
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,000
I do have one favor before I open it up for questions.

537
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:16,530
So I still have to put together a promotion packet. I still need teaching evaluations and I don't teach classes.

538
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,099
So if you guys don't terribly mind, it's also in the PDF that got sent around.

539
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:25,170
But if you guys can fill out its like five questions and and I do actually care about what I could do better.

540
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:31,350
So for the next cohort, if there's ways that you would change this, please let me know.

541
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,610
I am open to suggestions. And with that, I will stop talking.

542
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,760
Yeah, of course. I actually don't have a standing horse.

543
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:57,510
I teach guest classes like I teach in this. And then I have our guests lecture in one of the classes.

544
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:03,990
And then I've taught in anthropology, there's a joint anthropology global health class that one of my friends teaches.

545
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:15,000
So, yeah, I'm like your pop up guest instructor, cause, you know, I would love to teach something on maternal newborn health.

546
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:19,860
I think the question is if there's enough interest in it and in my home department,

547
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,439
so I'm in the Department of Learning Health Sciences in the medical school,

548
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,460
and they're they're much more interested in sort of health systems and health structure.

549
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:33,000
And I'm sure they would love for me to teach a course on health structure, but that's not my thing.

550
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,880
So, yeah, that would be good for medical school.

551
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:42,140
So I'm a professor in the Department of Learning, Health Sciences and Joint and Obedience.

552
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:49,370
And basically, I do research like this, and then I'm an associate director of Global Reach, which is the Medical Schools Global Program.

553
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,319
Like, you know, school public health has the Office of Global Public Health the equivalent to that, and the medical school is global reach.

554
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:03,450
And I'm one of the associate directors of that. So yeah, I'm in a in a weird situation where I don't teach, but I do a lot more individual mentorship.

555
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:10,980
So every year I have a couple of global effort students who approach me to do some sort of summer or something in Canada,

556
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,700
and I've been able to work it out more times than not.

557
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,910
So if that's something you guys are interested in, you know, there's there's always that possibility.

558
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:23,820
And then I'm part of a poverty grant that is for postdocs.

559
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,299
So any event, you head down that in the U.S.,

560
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:33,780
you could also be on your way to a Ph.D. but it's designed for one year in country mentored research for both.

561
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:40,500
I'm focused in Ghana, so it's my Guinea and partners can stay in country and get a full stipend to do a year of mentored research.

562
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:44,520
Or us fellows can go to Ghana for a year, which is super cool.

563
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,450
So unfortunately it's not open to master's students. But if you had done the PhD.

564
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:57,430
Yes. I was kind of wondering what I'm gonna like on the flip side of all of this.

565
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:05,260
Like, as you said, like fertility is often kind of like value in social standing, like for women who experience infertility.

566
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:12,700
Is that something that's like are fertility treatments like have there are the resources there like for that kind of a thing?

567
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,350
That's a great question.

568
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:25,610
So first, let me start by backing up and saying that Ghana is so diverse, so educated women in Accra compared to rural women in northern Ghana.

569
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:31,440
It's night and day. So there is there are very different issues depending on where you live.

570
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:36,910
And so it's so a lot of what I've talked about is probably more relevant to the rural areas.

571
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,170
There is there are fertility treatments in Ghana.

572
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,549
And one of my fellow fellows this year is actually doing a really interesting

573
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:52,600
project on fertility preservation among young women diagnosed with breast cancer.

574
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,840
Because nobody talks about that. They talk about, oh, you have cancer, let's like chemo radiate you.

575
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,680
And only later are they like, Oh, well, maybe we could have saved some eggs,

576
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,240
or maybe we could have, you know, harvested enough to be able to allow you to be fertile later.

577
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:12,549
And so his whole thing is getting thinking about like, what do people think about that?

578
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,290
And that's something that is viable.

579
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:21,610
So I know that there are fertility options, but they're really relatively for their for the wealthy and the urban.

580
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,550
So that would be Accra and Kumasi pretty much. And then what else outside there, we probably have to travel.

581
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,890
And I also personally know some of my Ghanaian partners who come here for fertility treatment.

582
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:40,090
So because yeah. When you don't have kids there's I was just running focus group last week in Ghana and they said something like,

583
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:46,900
if you're a couple without kids, you said, let's just say eyebrows get raised so that.

584
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:48,500
Yeah.

585
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:58,230
Breakdown of like medical professionals and the rural areas have gone on the cry they're primarily male or the midwives are all generally all women.

586
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:03,030
Most of the physicians are male and OB-GYNs too.

587
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,639
I mean, there are typically or regions in the rural areas,

588
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,370
but so it's kind of weird because in in the rural areas that I've been in, most of the providers are midwives.

589
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:16,990
So most of them are women. Yes. But then you go to a district hospital and most of the physicians are men.

590
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:22,770
There is a difference in the access and treatment based on like if more women are present or more men are present.

591
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:29,700
No, I haven't. I haven't really noticed that. Yeah.

592
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,920
It's interesting because the gender thing has a.

593
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:38,430
I haven't really noticed a difference in that regard and.

594
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:50,230
And I think just the environment is the midwives are so hard core that I mean they're hard hardcore so that.

595
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:58,020
The fact that they're female doesn't necessarily mean that they're like warm, fuzzy, nice smoke.

596
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:02,970
So you can have like I could see a situation where I'd be scared to see the midwife.

597
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,690
Whereas I might actually want to see the male doctor. So.

598
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:17,850
And it just depends. I guess the point about personality and social settings has affects this, but I know that in some cases,

599
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:24,180
in areas where faith is more dominant, they might have better reactions to diagnoses.

600
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:32,640
You have you seen more resilience to infant are not designed fertility but like miscarriages and things like that because of scale.

601
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,230
Yeah, great question.

602
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:45,230
So last week I was in Ghana doing focus groups with OB-GYNs and midwives, and we were asking them about how they cope with repeated losses,

603
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:48,690
maternal losses and newborn losses because they see moms and babies die all the time.

604
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,250
And so a colleague of mine had said, wow, you know, this seems to be a problem.

605
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,250
We should be asking. We should try to figure out if there's some sort of an intervention.

606
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:04,850
And so we had this idea that maybe we could be talking about support groups or maybe we could be thinking about like workshops for resiliency.

607
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:16,230
And we had all these great Western ideas and we sat through five focus groups where the overriding sentiment was, We are strong, we're strong.

608
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:21,090
And this one guy was so funny. I remember seeing the show.

609
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:25,020
There was this white lady and she burst into tears of joy.

610
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:30,090
Tears of joy who, like nothing, would make me burst into tears of joy.

611
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:37,980
It's just so culturally different. And I do think faith plays into it.

612
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:42,630
You know, there was one of the women in the focus group, a midwife. She was like, well, let me tell you about when my baby died,

613
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:48,600
because this happens commonly enough that you get 50 providers together and they're going to tell you her stories.

614
01:00:48,600 --> 01:01:00,260
And she was saying that, you know, she was sad, but she also knew that God had a plan for her and that this had to be part of the plan.

615
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:07,620
So she read her Bible and she got up and got dressed and had a party the next day where she had everybody over to her house and everyone's like,

616
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:12,660
I can't believe you just lost your child and you're having a party. And she was like, No, you know, life goes on.

617
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:23,160
So I do think there is a very different orientation than what we would see, what we would necessarily see here.

618
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:33,210
And not better, not worse. Just very different. And so we were just laughing because we came out thinking, Oh, great, yeah, they need a support group.

619
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:43,350
You know, that's for some of our focus groups, like a normal kind of remembrance, the way you practice in common.

620
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:50,340
Yeah. So. So for those of you who are familiar with qualitative methods, so quantitative methods, you know, you do surveys, you take blood values.

621
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:55,229
Also, qualitative methods are typically interviews one on one or a focus group where

622
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:59,850
you get like eight or ten people around a table and then you ask a question

623
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:08,700
and people literally I had a microphone was passing it around to people and they were talking about whatever it was and they feed off of each other.

624
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:11,820
It is so interesting. Oh, my gosh.

625
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:17,640
It's so interesting because the things that came up were things we would never in a million years have known to ask about,

626
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:24,150
because somebody just goes off on some tangent and must mentioned something that then somebody else picks up on.

627
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,500
So yeah, it's a it's a great qualitative strategy.

628
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:35,430
It's not without its downsides because sometimes you can have a couple dominant people in the focus group who might take over.

629
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,970
And then you got to work really hard to get the other people to be able to talk,

630
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:43,890
and sometimes they go off on tangents forever and you're kind of like, Okay, when do I bring this back in?

631
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:53,160
But the point is then you get pages of transcribed focus groups and the data are their words,

632
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,870
so that then you're going through and reading line by line and identifying some big themes.

633
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:02,790
So some of the themes that we identified already, we haven't gone through and done the detailed analysis,

634
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:07,710
but there were four of us there working with us. One of the themes is stigma around mental health care.

635
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:12,930
Huge stigma because psychiatry is equated with like florid psychosis.

636
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:16,709
And so people are like, I'm not going anywhere near the psych department.

637
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,580
Are you crazy? That's where like crazy people go. So stigma.

638
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,920
Another one is blame. When bad outcomes happen, the midwives feel like the docs blame them.

639
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:31,080
The docs feel like the midwives blame them. So there was a lot of blame stuff going on.

640
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:37,080
Those were the two biggies. The other thing that we heard a lot about was lack of confidentiality.

641
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:42,810
Like here in the U.S., we have laws that say you cannot disclose somebody's private health information.

642
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,470
Know HIPA. It's a law where they don't have that.

643
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,550
And so there's a lot of fear associated with people just blabbing about your business.

644
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,020
So doctors would say,

645
01:03:52,140 --> 01:04:01,140
there's no way I would go to a psychiatrist or even a psychologist because they would talk about my business and I would be sunk as a provider.

646
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:03,510
So those are the kinds of themes.

647
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,930
And so then, for example, would blame we would then take this blame bucket and think about like, well, there's self-blame.

648
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:14,070
There's blame from other people. There's blame from the institution.

649
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:19,440
And think about how to each of those then create an understanding of what's going on.

650
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:24,420
So yeah, focus groups are really cool and this is really cool.

651
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,440
Yeah, I do overcome any central language barrier.

652
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,960
So Ghana is was a British colony up until 1967.

653
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:40,050
So the official language is English. So if you're educated, you speak English.

654
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,340
For the women, when we've done focus groups with women and grandmothers,

655
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:51,899
we have typically used local partners who speak the local language and they conduct everything in the local language.

656
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:56,940
And then typically there's two of them who will then work together to translate it into English.

657
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,709
And then if there's anything that they can't quite translate, they leave it in the local language.

658
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:08,910
There's a little explanation on the side that says this is a word that doesn't quite mean this kind of means this sort of sort of kind of means this.

659
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:13,350
So we just leave it as is. And yeah, and that's worked fairly well.

660
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:19,110
The lost in translation thing is always a risk because yeah,

661
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:28,230
the other piece that's interesting in some parts of Ghana is the local language isn't a written language, so it's really oral.

662
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:31,680
And that means too there's this like, well,

663
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:39,690
you wouldn't want to transcribe it from the words into the local language written because you can't really.

664
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:44,670
So you kind of have to transcribe it into English if you're going to get anything down on a page.

665
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,720
So. Yeah, so lots of issues there.

666
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:55,910
Yeah, I guess I was just interested in your point about doctors feeling like they can't see, like a therapist or psychologist.

667
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:00,200
Would you say that that might increase provider burnout?

668
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,110
You were at our focus group. Yeah, we were talking about burnout.

669
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:09,690
And that was another thing that like, they were like burnout.

670
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:16,520
We work. And when you're done working, you rest. And so and at the same time, you'd have somebody go, what?

671
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:20,700
Like we work and we work and we work and we work and we work so hard. We're like, kind of like burnout.

672
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:25,320
Like, totally. That was not a word that resonated at all.

673
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:31,349
I think the what they would say is that when you're burned out, when you're working too hard,

674
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:36,750
it causes you to make mistakes, which then causes bad outcomes, and then you feel bad about it.

675
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:43,200
But yeah, in terms of, gosh, going to see a therapist, the psychiatrist who's our partner,

676
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:47,370
there's like a handful of psychiatrists in the country, but one of them is our partner on this project.

677
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:51,750
She was talking, she would do the debrief at the end and talk to people.

678
01:06:51,750 --> 01:07:00,750
And then she says, you know, I know here I see my patients and they run and hide for me because they don't want anyone to know that they know me.

679
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,840
Because if they know me, they must be a patient. And that's bad. I know. I know.

680
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:11,010
When I visited the United States and I was on a bus, I was on a bus and there were these people behind me.

681
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:15,600
And they were talking about how they've just been to their therapist. And their therapist said this.

682
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,720
And the other one said his psychiatrist said this on the bus.

683
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,970
They said this on the bus and. Her weight was so weak.

684
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,950
It doesn't have to be this taboo.

685
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:34,950
But still, like she told the story of one of the resident physicians, a trainee getting dropped off for a rotation or something.

686
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:45,180
Standing and waiting for the bus out in front of the psych department and her dad calling her as she's standing there, he's like, Hey, where are you?

687
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,940
She says, I'm waiting for the bus. He's like, No, no, no where? She says, I'm in front of the orphanage, a psych department.

688
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:55,050
You need to cross the street. Someone saw you. You are looking in front of you.

689
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,710
Don't stand in front of this department. And she was like that. I'm waiting for the bus.

690
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,820
It is so taboo. So, like, overcoming that.

691
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:09,239
Like it's big. It's big. Like after residency.

692
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:12,390
So everyone's, like, their actual training. Yeah.

693
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:21,080
So. So it does mess with their actual training and, like, they're actually becoming physical, like, their actual high.

694
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:28,530
And rotation? Well, it is. You know, I don't know too much about how things parcel out.

695
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:33,420
So whether or not they have to do site rotations or they don't do psych rotations.

696
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:42,450
But I just know that the overriding sentiment is that, you know, psychiatry is safe for really, really, really mentally ill.

697
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:49,230
And so there is no Rachele Upjohn Depression Center with a fountain and nice flowers out front.

698
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,740
It's like psychiatry is for the extremely mentally ill.

699
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:01,720
Well, I took as well, of course. And so. Well, thank you guys so much.

700
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:06,310
And I think I'll have my email if not, see a Moyers camp.

701
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,260
Ah, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm around.

702
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:15,040
And yeah, I'd love to hear your thoughts on anything else you can think.

703
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:32,670
Yeah. I think we need.
