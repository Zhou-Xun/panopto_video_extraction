1
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:05,071
The rule of rescue.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,790
And this is the idea that
what people want is to be

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,850
rescued when they're in a dire situation,
and they don't wanna anticipate something.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,090
When I go exercise, I'm sweating,
and I'm taking time out of my day,

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,400
and I'm sitting there thinking, is this
going to really help me in the long run,

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,260
because this has taken time and
it's hurting?

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,500
It's an abstraction and it's all
deferred to the future, the benefit.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,830
But when you're sick,
you want something right away.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,490
It's a very natural human response.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,480
But said a little bit in
the context of prevention.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,940
We keep talking about trying to prevent
climate change, everything that I've been

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,620
reading about it suggests we're
doing a pretty terrible job of it.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,098
I just heard somewhere that, well,
in the last 800,000 years, the carbon

14
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:57,907
dioxide level in the atmosphere has never
been as high as it is, 800,000 years.

15
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:58,972
I don't remember that morning though.

16
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,550
>> [LAUGH]
>> Personally, but

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,610
I mean, that's an amazing statement.

18
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,950
So, one obvious question
with climate change is,

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,490
if we're not doing a good job of
preventing it, can we treat it?

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,090
Are there technologies that could actually

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,160
help us to reverse some of the problems
we're already beginning to see?

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,516
>> So, there is an entire area of
research and study called geoengineering.

23
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,689
>> Mm-hm.

24
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:33,170
>> And it addresses taking an active
intervention approach to climate change.

25
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:39,800
Not trying simply to reduce CO2 emissions
or carbon emissions, but also trying to

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,440
increase the uptake of CO2 either by
natural sources or by man-made sources.

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,730
So increasing CO2 absorbed in the ocean.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:55,180
Increasing CO2 uptake by plants.

29
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,470
I think most, and even at U of M.

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,290
So these researchers, scientists and

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,600
engineers are studying
geoengineering around the world,

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,900
including at U of M, we have a program
called Beyond Carbon Neutral.

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,370
And so, again, the idea is not simply
to level off carbon emissions,

34
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,870
but go further and bend the curve down.

35
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,780
I think most scientists and
engineers are humble enough to be very,

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:30,240
very cautious about any proposed solution
at such a scale as our world and

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,100
trying to predict its efficacy and
trying to predict unanticipated impacts.

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,480
So, I think it's like the says,
we have no planet B, right?

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,244
>> [LAUGH]
>> So

40
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:45,958
I think it is worth and
absolutely is worth pursuing.

41
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:50,570
But I hope that

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,350
those who are pursuing it continue
to be humble in that pursuit.

43
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,330
Because, again, unprecedented scale

44
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,130
of engineering, the very definition
of unprecedented means that we

45
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,315
don't know what might happen
that we did not expect.

46
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:15,270
So it's scary but

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:22,240
people are taking that challenge
to heart and are studying it.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,900
>> Well, that's good.

49
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,860
I think about how many problems we have
solved our way out of with technology.

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know that this one has much
of a shot of that or not, but.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,610
>> But your point, though,
I think this is very American, right?

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,121
And I think it's true
with precison medicine.

53
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:41,086
We think we don't have to worry about
these problems because we always invent

54
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,191
new technologies, right?

55
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,495
>> We'll find a solution.

56
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,860
>> And, we have a lot of answers
to a lot of these problems.

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,450
They're much more basic, right?

58
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,820
They're much more about

59
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,190
preventing things from happening than
having to develop the technology.

60
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,540
But we are hugely optimistic people about
the importance, and what technology

61
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,680
can accomplish, and so we often overlook
some of these really basic things, right?

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,770
You look at how we design our cars and
seatbelts.

63
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,280
It's all about the person clicking
that seatbelt, first and foremost.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,292
But we want to, some people, want to just
figure out, well, they'll make the cars

65
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:20,300
that are so much safer,
I won't have to worry about it, right, so.

66
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,505
>> Well, the air bag.

67
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:22,444
>> That's right.
That's one example.

68
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:24,590
>> And we have, we do,
we do invent new technology.

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,280
>> Yeah.
>> But

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,170
there's a lot we can do without
having to go there first, right?

71
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,640
>> So are there any analogies,
drawing straws in the wind or

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,210
something here, is there any analogy
between the precision medicine and

73
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,960
the big climate change problem?

74
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,000
Is there any way to draw
a lesson from one for the other?

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,390
>> I think certainly
the preventative aspect,

76
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,340
you're mentioning that things like giving
patient a scale to go home with and

77
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,840
having them, we understand why people gain
weight, calories in minus calories out.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,410
That is an incredible way to
prevent lots and lots of disease.

79
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:07,520
Preventing smoking, regular pap
smears to prevent cervical cancer.

80
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,710
Those are all kinds of things
that we sort of know work, but

81
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,520
I think, again, that sort of there
is a lot of cutting edge research

82
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,010
being done on what to do at a very
late stage after that has happened.

83
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,630
And I think often it's harder particularly
in our country to get people excited about

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,680
doing these very basic things.

85
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,020
It's also much harder and I imagine it's
the same thing I imagine if you develop

86
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,360
the technology that allows
you to sequester that carbon,

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,340
that would be a very valuable technology.

88
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,390
And that you will make a lot
more money doing that than

89
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,490
you will in doing some
very basic preventative.

90
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,070
>> Sure.
>> And

91
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,550
we see this all the time in
medicine where, say for example,

92
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,700
that a drug is found that would work
just as well as a very expensive drug.

93
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,641
If the drug is much cheaper, and

94
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:58,555
is a generic drug and no one can
patent it, there's gonna be no one

95
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:02,125
to fund that clinical trial to
show that it works as well.

96
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:06,195
And there's gonna be no one showing
up at the doctor's office saying,

97
00:06:06,195 --> 00:06:08,715
hey, you should prescribe this
drug instead of that one.

98
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:13,235
So I think it's very much,
it is a reactionary situation when we know

99
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:18,045
that much of what, probably the most
straight forward, effective technology,

100
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:22,840
or effective approach that we have
proven evidence would be the simpler and

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,860
earlier intervention.

102
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,380
I think it's very similar
with the human body,

103
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,466
I think it's very much like the world.

104
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:33,384
Meaning that it's evolved into a very
narrow range of conditions and

105
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:37,790
then when things go to the extreme
that's a very hard area to be

106
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,617
changing things in that perspective.

107
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:44,387
And I think it's similar to climate that
when you have that with human health that

108
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,938
that's something much easier to prevent
than it is to deal with at the very,

109
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,350
very late stages.

110
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,693
>> I mean, it would be interesting.

111
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:55,415
I don't know if anyone has compared
the economics of energy production to

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,339
healthcare.

113
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,779
So, one of the key
contributors to the US's CO2

114
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:05,977
emissions not increasing as
fast as they had in the past,

115
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:11,260
has been the availability of
inexpensive solar panels.

116
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,316
Now, that's great, except that those solar

117
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:21,900
panels are made inexpensively offshore,
right?

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,630
So, the availability

119
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:36,370
of this less expensive import has had the
benefit of decreasing our CO2 emissions.

120
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,520
I don't know what the comparison
is to healthcare in terms of

121
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,560
drugs and therapies.

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,920
So if something else is
developed elsewhere, and

123
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,850
it's cheaper, my guess is that there
are barriers to its entry into the US.

124
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,060
Or maybe it's developed very
expensively in the US and so

125
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,380
we just don't have access
to the cheaper thing.

126
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,328
So I think kind of the economic
A kind of landscape

127
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:09,580
plays a factor in the availability
of these types of foods.

128
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,675
>> As Ken can tell you,

129
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:14,880
medical care system doesn't follow
those normal principles of economics.

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,524
>> Okay [LAUGH].
>> So,

131
00:08:15,524 --> 00:08:19,030
almost everything we do in medical care
is cost increasing, not cost saving.

132
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,964
So it's the technology goes
in the reverse direction.

133
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:23,400
>> Right, right, right.

134
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,379
>> For a whole variety of reasons
about how we finance medical care,

135
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,632
some of the things you talked about.

136
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:34,451
But also, how people don't capture
the benefits of lowering cost,

137
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:37,789
right, they get the benefits
of raising cost.

138
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,351
And also a lot of what we
have done in medical care,

139
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:44,867
hasn't done things like eradicate disease,
hasn't done things like get rid of CO2.

140
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:49,444
They've allowed people who have
chronic conditions to live better

141
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:52,584
quality of life and
live longer with disease.

142
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:53,241
>> Okay, okay.

143
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,001
>> But they don't erase the disease,
right?

144
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,670
So in some ways, that increases cost.

145
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,413
>> Cost, as well, right.

146
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:02,013
>> Right, gets people are living longer,
but they need a lot of medicine and

147
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:04,200
other things to help them live longer.

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,760
>> Sure.

149
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,830
>> I actually published a paper 30 years
ago in which I talked about the coming

150
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,850
era of cost savings in healthcare
because of all the new technology.

151
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,672
>> Did you?
>> And said that in every other industry,

152
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:20,331
wherever we look,
we see cost savings through technology.

153
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:24,823
And we all know that by the cell phones or
laptops that we have, or the great TVs,

154
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:28,000
and compare them with
what they used to cost.

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,410
And it hasn't happened in health care.

156
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,750
>> Wow!
>> It's really almost

157
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,380
shocking because it seems like
it should be such a big market.

158
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,930
>> Yeah.

159
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,876
>> And there should be so
many people interested in it.

160
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,720
But so
much of what we're talking about, and

161
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,080
when we think about personalized medicine,
is not only how expensive it is or

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,050
isn't, but whether it's gonna be paid for
by an insurer.

163
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,200
And of course, you've spent a lot
of your life in that field.

164
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,870
And one of the big issues in public health
since I got into it 40 years ago, and

165
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,910
certainly well before that.

166
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,650
Is why is it that we're the only
developed nation on Earth

167
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,830
that doesn't have healthcare for
all of its citizens?

168
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,352
How are we ever gonna there?

169
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:09,339
>> Yeah.
>> Do you have any thoughts on whether we

170
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,925
ever will get there, and if so, how?

171
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,590
>> [LAUGH] Ever's a really long time.

172
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,090
[LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH]

173
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,141
>> So I don't know that I wanna

174
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:20,190
go to the ever part.
>> [LAUGH]

175
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,020
>> So, every other country in the world

176
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,040
really has been very clear about
what they believe about healthcare.

177
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,192
And they believe that
people should not face

178
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:34,510
barriers to getting medical
treatment because of cost.

179
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,090
They believe medical care, healthcare,

180
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,615
certain basic level of care,
is a social good.

181
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:40,620
>> Mm-hm.

182
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,970
>> In America,
we've really never had that discussion.

183
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,820
And in fact,
we have very conflicting views, and

184
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,330
you see that played out in
the political arena all the time.

185
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,890
There are many people in this country

186
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,510
who believe that medical
care is a market good.

187
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,880
It is not a basic, you know,
it's this question, is medical care,

188
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,320
is health care a right?

189
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,040
And we have not confronted that issue.

190
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,010
And we do seem to have some tolerance for
people

191
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:16,430
dying as a result of lack of medical care
that is less tolerated in other countries.

192
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,680
If you look at public opinions, people
say people should have health insurance.

193
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,801
But we also don't want to tax
ourselves for that, right?

194
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:29,944
So, one of the challenges with
the Affordable Care Act, for example,

195
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:34,517
was that it tried to get more people
insurance by raising taxes to some degree.

196
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,607
But also by having this
individual mandate,

197
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,590
this idea of individual responsibility.

198
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,390
Like, you drive a car, you should
have auto insurance, you have a body,

199
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,520
you should have health insurance, right?

200
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,120
People should have insurance.

201
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,879
And people, you know,
consumers hate that, you know,

202
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,018
Americans don't like
to be told what to do.

203
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:55,420
And we don't like to pay taxes, and so
we're very conflicted about these issues.

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,325
Certainly the Affordable Care Act
reduced the numbers who are uninsured.

205
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,400
>> Mm-hm.

206
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,270
>> But even that was not even intended
to be as sweeping as other countries..

207
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,600
Could we get there?

208
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,660
Perhaps, you know there's a lot in
flux these days in this country.

209
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,640
There are a lot of people talking
more about Medicare for all.

210
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,690
I think it'll be a long journey,
if we get there.

211
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,760
Even though at some of the polling data
says people like this idea of Medicare for

212
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,260
all, single payer.

213
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,560
They like it in abstract forms.

214
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,270
They don't like it when they get told,
well,

215
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,510
here's what it would actually take in
your taxes to actually accomplish that.

216
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,980
Here are the limitations you
would have as a result of that.

217
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,460
So I don't think we're there yet.

218
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,440
I think we're having that conversation,
and that's good.

219
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,200
I think we need a lot
more public engagement.

220
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,580
I think it'll take a long
time to get there.

221
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,560
>> How much of a contributor to that
mindset do you think comes from

222
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,020
the perception that
the healthcare that you would get

223
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,900
in a system where healthcare is all right,
is more austere?

224
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,460
I mean, I have a friend who
had an accident in Germany and

225
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,110
he described his experience in
the hospital as being very austere,

226
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:11,220
no air conditioning,
flickering fluorescent light.

227
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,570
He had a wound and the wound was bleeding,

228
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,930
the nurse gave a wash cloth to the wife
and said, clean up your husband.

229
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:30,220
So I'm wondering, first of all, how much
of that is kind of a just like a myth?

230
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,643
And how much of that really factors
into people's reluctance to pursue those

231
00:13:34,643 --> 00:13:36,900
types of healthcare systems in the US?

232
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,990
>> Yeah, so as Ken said, if we actually
look at the data of population health,

233
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,820
we don't fare very well in the US
compared to other countries.

234
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,780
So, whether it's more, you know,
there's less bells and

235
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,710
whistles, there's less luxurious care or
whatever in other countries.

236
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,290
Those actually factor
into improved health.

237
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,900
We have some really good data to show
that the quality of medical care for

238
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,900
people in most in need is very good
in these other countries, right?

239
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,860
But, and I think it's something you said,
they do make trade-offs, right?

240
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,330
So, in other countries they wanna make
sure people have basic medical care,

241
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,290
primary care.

242
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,160
They wanna get them into the system.

243
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,260
But if you have something elective,
there are waiting lists.

244
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,760
>> Sure.

245
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,540
>> And there are shortages, and so people
don't get everything instantaneously.

246
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,960
They don't get this high tech, high end
care as quickly as we get it in America.

247
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,620
And Americans aren't particularly
tolerant of waiting.

248
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,230
>> Sure.

249
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,500
>> I think Europe,
this is so cultural, right?

250
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,250
So in Europe, they've lived through
wars on their shores, right?

251
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,230
They understand what shortages are,

252
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,750
they understand trade-offs in a way
that Americans, I think, just don't.

253
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,520
And so, in America,
if you say something about making,

254
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,450
you talked earlier about making
decisions about what gets paid for

255
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,930
based upon how much does it contribute to
quality of life and how much does it cost.

256
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,686
If you say that in America, you're
accused of wanting to ration healthcare.

257
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:02,520
>> Sure, sure, sure.

258
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,840
>> And rationing healthcare is
a dirty word in this country.

259
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,530
Have you practised in other countries?

260
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,583
Have you looked at other
medical care systems elsewhere?

261
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,480
>> No, but you bring up all
of these really good points.

262
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,110
And I think the other thing is, Americans
have no idea what healthcare costs.

263
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,900
>> Yeah.
>> Because they don't pay what healthcare

264
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,780
costs.

265
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,940
But then there's also this
bizarre practice of, you know,

266
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,680
a hospital may have a contract
with an organization where, for

267
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,950
their patients,
they pay 20% of the charges.

268
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,078
So, it's fine to say we're going
to send a bill to Blue Cross for

269
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,902
$15,000 because we know we're
only gonna get paid $3,000.

270
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:46,770
But, that same $15,000 bill will go to
someone who doesn't have insurance,

271
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,046
who is the kind of patient who
certainly can't pay a $15,000 bill.

272
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:56,300
And costs of the exact same thing
very dramatically across the country.

273
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,406
That's not something,
unlike any other business,

274
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:01,550
you don't know what it's actually
going to cost before it's.

275
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,116
It's done.

276
00:16:02,116 --> 00:16:06,930
I think particularly in,
if you are injured and

277
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,050
you go to the emergency room, and
you get admitted to the hospital,

278
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,330
and you're in there for a week, that's
tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

279
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,970
And people have no clue.

280
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,600
They think well, I will be taken care of,
I don't want other people to have this,

281
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,150
but I certainly expect it, and
I think that's the real challenge.

282
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,510
And it's the same thing, I mean,
it's very easy in cancer.

283
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:34,020
It's, if there's 1 of 100 patients
are gonna benefit from the drug and

284
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,280
we have to screen everybody to find that,
should

285
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,250
we screen every patient to find the one
person who may benefit from the drug?

286
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,930
Well, if you're that patient,
the answer's yes.

287
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,520
>> Yes, absolutely.

288
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,681
>> You definitely want to know.

289
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:47,429
[LAUGH]
>> Right, right.

290
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,917
>> But, if we're looking at that
from a population standpoint, or

291
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:52,739
if a payer is looking at that, you have
to make a very different argument.

292
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:55,530
Or if it's we're going to do testing for
one of two,

293
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,464
we're gonna do a test that we want
Blue Cross to cover for $5,000 and

294
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:02,842
then we're gonna give one of
two really expensive therapies.

295
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:06,180
That is Blue Cross Blue Shield may
say then why are we paying for that.

296
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,085
If on the other hand, the question or
the proposal was we are going

297
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:14,489
to do a $5,000 test that says you
either get a therapy or you don't.

298
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:18,892
That is something that insurance would
much, we'd consider much strong,

299
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:20,146
much more strongly.

300
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:24,458
And I think we focus so much on, hey,
the patient is going to benefit, so

301
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,324
let's do it.

302
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:30,238
And I think that that really is, you see
that just sort of in the care that people

303
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,706
get in different healthcare systems.

304
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:36,216
Even, I think we practice incredible
medicine at University of Michigan.

305
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:39,237
But there are other systems
that do things better,

306
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:43,659
because they've decided that we think
this is of value of to us to do this for

307
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,800
every patient, so
we're gonna cover that cost of doing that.

308
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,110
And the benefit may not be an improved
outcome, it maybe all the we'll get

309
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,840
better, we're gonna be better at
understanding disease process,

310
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,186
we're gonna write better grants, and
we're going to drive market volume.

311
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:03,220
But I think that particularly in precision
medicine there's not a lot of focus on do

312
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,800
we improve outcomes?

313
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,950
Do we decrease cost?

314
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,100
And that as someone who's sort of been in
this space both from here at Michigan,

315
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,990
as well in a commercial side, that we
already ration healthcare in the US.

316
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,490
Because people can't afford
to have their therapy or

317
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,030
their surgery of choice unless
it's covered by insurance, so

318
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,060
you're already having
your healthcare rationed.

319
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,581
And so if you're thinking about
how to do this, the process is,

320
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:41,630
what do I have to do to get insurance
to pay for this test, this procedure?

321
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,090
And so, I think the people that are on the
business side that's their only focus is

322
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,980
we have to get this covered, versus
the patient says I want this, do this, and

323
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,910
the doctor in me says,
we should be doing this for

324
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,970
every patient because it's
gonna benefit somebody.

325
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,440
>> This whole issue of
rationing health care is so

326
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,920
fascinating because In other countries,
they do it explicitly, right?

327
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,360
So, in Great Britain,
they have a panel called NICE,

328
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,330
the National Institute of
Clinical Effectiveness.

329
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,760
They review procedures, drugs, and make
an explicit decision with public input.

330
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,890
And in America,
we're entirely opposed to that.

331
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,300
But we do it all the time,
we just do it kind of in secret, right?

332
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,310
Cuz, every,
if you read your health benefit coverage,

333
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,570
it says your health plan will only pay for
what is medically necessary.

334
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,800
Now, who decides what's
medically necessary?

335
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,750
Right?
We don't have that public debate

336
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,050
in this country and
we like to live with a lot of myths,

337
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,480
which is that we can pay for
everything for everybody.

338
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,540
Maybe we think we can live forever,
I don't know.

339
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,770
But other countries seem to have a more
realistic view that there are tradeoffs

340
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,130
that need to be made.

341
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,220
And we just don't like
tradeoffs in this country and

342
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,000
I think that's going
back to your question.

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,160
I think the challenge with

344
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,910
providing universal coverage is it
necessarily involves tradeoffs.

345
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,220
We either to pay more in taxes,
we pay more in some way.

346
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,680
We have fewer benefits, there are very
clear ways to get to universal coverage.

347
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,020
We just don't seem to like
the tradeoffs involved.

348
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,360
>> Well, it's the old you can pay
me now or you can pay me later.

349
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,670
And I was thinking when Scott was talking
about whether insurance covers it or

350
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,380
not, frequently, in emergency situations,

351
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,380
people end up getting those bills
don't have the insurance coverage.

352
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,620
And not an infrequent number of cases,
they end up filing for bankruptcy.

353
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,270
And one of the fascinating things to me,
I believe I read somewhere that

354
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,050
medical costs were responsible for
about a third of bankruptcies?

355
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,500
>> Before the Affordable Care Act.

356
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,860
>> Before the Affordable Care Act.

357
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,670
>> Yes, and the Affordable Care Act
has actually reduced that

358
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,080
quite significantly-
>> Good.

359
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,210
>> And if people lose coverage in
the current political environment,

360
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,139
who knows what the future holds-
>> [LAUGH], right.

361
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:52,063
>> But it could go back up,
but yes, that's right.

362
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:53,613
>> But the interesting thing about it,

363
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:57,110
I remember reading a book that was
very influential in my thinking.

364
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,268
Where a guy was a journalist, was going
across, I think it was a half a dozen

365
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:03,140
different countries,
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

366
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,770
>> Yes.

367
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,310
>> And he had a bad shoulder.

368
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,365
>> Yes.
>> And the question

369
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,600
is how he was going to be treated in
each of these different countries.

370
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,120
And one of the really interesting
aspects of when he talked to

371
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,630
people in the other countries, and
talked about medical bankruptcy,

372
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,709
they'd scratch their heads saying
what are you talking about?

373
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,470
>> [LAUGH] There was no such thing.

374
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,340
They never heard of the concept.

375
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,695
And yet, we have this large percentage of
people who are forced into bankruptcy,

376
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:28,080
cuz they can't pay their medical bills.

377
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,618
We got a lot to work on folks.

378
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:30,128
[LAUGH]
>> Sure do.

379
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:33,280
>> This is one thing I've always liked

380
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,400
about public health is we have
a lot of challenges in front of us.

381
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,690
There are always going to be
challenges out there, but

382
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,770
we've also had a lot of huge successes.

383
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,830
Actually, in each of
the areas that you work in.

384
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,760
We've seen some great successes.

385
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,260
And I think the people who
are watching this particular

386
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,700
discussion are going to be the ones to
make some of those changes occur, and

387
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,530
hopefully, make some improvements.

388
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,770
So with that,
I wanna thank each of you for

389
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,475
what I think has been a very
stimulating conversation.

390
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:05,300
You've really offered us
a great number of insights and

391
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,748
certainly perspectives on
these difficult issues.

392
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:12,350
And I hope for
the sake of the people out there watching,

393
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,730
that you now have a sense of some of the
issues for the future of public health.

394
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,470
And that you take the insights and

395
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,120
perspectives you've heard from our
colleagues here into account, as you

396
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,232
consider the impact of public health
in our country and around our world.

397
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:29,723
Thank you.

398
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,597
