1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:14,400
We had a game this weekend. I did not know what was going on because there was a time that I wasn't to.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:26,129
I mean, I guess I guess I'll try to use all the people that I have tried, but probably like like a story that keeps a draw.

3
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,050
And I only take it in anticipation.

4
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:47,700
I was just to say, all you gotta do is look it up, and in order to translate, it is fine.

5
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:56,850
That seems like necessary to follow everyone that player of the season or Friday night.

6
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,590
It was like, oh, I think it's great.

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:14,400
It's so much I Passover I not actually hear what you say.

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:39,400
I was going to say something, but, you know, it's like, listen, I like South Carolina right now and it's like 13 minutes.

10
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,940
So I'm like, okay, right now. All right.

11
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,860
Let's get started with a few announcements.

12
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,850
So a reminder, Thursday, I will not be here.

13
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:02,340
So your lecture is prerecorded, is posted on campus already, so please watch that to get the material.

14
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,489
It's about enhancing the CRM or other special types of phase one design.

15
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,120
So it goes over the type to CRM, the time to event CRM.

16
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,850
And also you talk of the escalation without with overdose control.

17
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,959
And there's a bunch of poll everywhere questions and not one.

18
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:29,640
So we're going to start next Tuesday with all those questions. So make sure that you've watched it and come up with any questions on Tuesday.

19
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,130
Your homework, two grades will be given back soon.

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,880
We're just working through the rest of grading those and your homework three isn't due for a little bit.

21
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,069
Hopefully you've all now signed up for your project. Are there any other questions?

22
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,880
Generally, it's very sparse class today.

23
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,910
Why now? Do you know where is everybody that is stopped coming to class?

24
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,180
Who's there? What? What?

25
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,740
Colbert. Raise Colbert. Okay, well, I'd rather be. That's a good reason to stay home.

26
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,690
Okay, girls. Glad they're not here. Okay, great. Okay, so we're going to finish talking about zero.

27
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,009
Hopefully you brought your laptop or iPod or whatever you have our studio on because you're

28
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,999
going to get a chance to play with it and to talk to your neighbor about what you're finding.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,070
And you can ask any questions, but the majority of today is going to be you practicing zero.

30
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,400
So just a reminder, so you're home is the continual reassessment method.

31
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:48,110
This is a model based phase one design. This is a design where there would be a lot of back and forth with a clinician investigator.

32
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,340
And so you should this is like the working sort of figure of what's going on in the serum.

33
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,000
And what I'd like you to know is like what kind of things you as a statistician

34
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,500
need to be prepared with versus what kind of things are coming from the clinician,

35
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:13,160
right? So for example, right, these parameters of the target toxicity level, that's the TTL or what we've been calling peace of T.

36
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:23,389
The dose levels involve the number of dose levels and what those are the prior guess of the maximum tolerated dose and the

37
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:31,430
maximum sample size are these things that you're going to have or the clinician is going to have yell at out clinician,

38
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,430
right, yeah. They're going to come with this information and there might be a little bit of talk back and forth that you might be like,

39
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,580
Oh, those double dose levels. There's a lot of those right in your max sample size is really small.

40
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Let's reconsider. Hey, you're only saying to dose levels and we're going to move forward with the serum.

41
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:58,840
Maybe we do. You want to add one or two? They might also give you this prior guess that the maximum tolerated dose or the prior guess of all of that,

42
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,000
the dose limiting toxicity probabilities at each level of dose that are really much together.

43
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,290
Right. And you might say, oh, it's going to be really difficult to identify the MTD if all of these are really close to each other.

44
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,110
Do you want to rethink the dose levels?

45
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,180
But for the most part, right, this is going to come from the clinician and there's maybe a little bit of discussion,

46
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,900
but not that much that input that you're going to have on these things.

47
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,250
Then there is the Choose the working model. What are some possibilities for the working model for the serum?

48
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,120
Anybody remember some options on the power model.

49
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,769
Yeah, that's one was another one logistic model.

50
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,549
Right. Yeah. We talked about the one parameter logistic or the two parameter a logistic.

51
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,970
There's also a pro bit model, but we didn't really go into that. So.

52
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,810
Right, these are the model options. There is also.

53
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,370
So when it says compute the skeleton, right, what they're thinking, they're more about the dose labels.

54
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:09,230
So the clinician gives you the dose levels and then gives you the expected dl t probabilities at each dose level.

55
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:19,970
But you know, for the model itself, you have to re label these as dose labels of and so right you're you yourself, right.

56
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,940
The clinician is not going to come to you and say you should believe this logistic model or I really want you to run this with a power model.

57
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,140
Right. And it would be very rare that could happen, but it be very rare that that ever happened.

58
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,649
So you need to think about what model you want to go with.

59
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,190
And it might just be like, I always use the logistic one parameter model, right?

60
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,860
And then you go forward and you do the operating characteristics and if something needs to change, you might consider the model.

61
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,570
Then you, you run these simulations and that's what you're going to have a chance to practice today,

62
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,069
and you're going to select these different scenarios.

63
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,000
You're going to look at the operating characteristics and go back to the clinician.

64
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:07,190
Well, there are a few more things here. So there are some decisions in terms of what dose or is starting at.

65
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:15,380
Right, and how many people are treated at each dose level or need to be treated at each dose level before we move on.

66
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:24,020
Right. And this is usually 1 to 3. And if we choose one, what's the repercussion, which is one?

67
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,270
The dose cohort could be size one. What does that mean for in terms of escalation?

68
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,989
Will I go quickly or slowly? Quickly, right.

69
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,640
Yeah. We have one patient true to each dose that we're going to be able to escalate quickly.

70
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:45,050
The problem with that potentially is that we're going to we could escalate to a high dose and treat some individuals with too high of a dose.

71
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,290
Right. So there's the safety constraint of, well, let's have a bigger cohort like two or three patients at each dose,

72
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:57,110
and then you're going to escalate more slowly but potentially be more safe in that those escalation decisions.

73
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,050
There are other safety modifications or stopping rules you can put in and.

74
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Those might again be something that you and the clinician are deciding on.

75
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,989
So based on how toxic you think the drug is, what other options there are for this disease,

76
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,860
how many patients you have, what you believe that is right.

77
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,130
These might all four of your safety constraints or stopping rules.

78
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,959
So you go forward, you do these simulations, you figure out some operating characteristics.

79
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,480
What are some operating characteristics that we look at? Do you remember?

80
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:46,109
Shout about. The proportion of times of certain doses declared that exactly the proportion of times that a certain dose is declared the entity.

81
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:53,849
That's a super helpful operating characteristic to see how many times are if we right we set up a scenario so we know the truth,

82
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,350
the underlying truth of which dose is the MTD and then we can look in simulations.

83
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,309
How often are our decisions actually leading us to choose that?

84
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:11,620
MTD What's another operating characteristic? The Sun revealed that each dose number of DLT is at each dose.

85
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:18,380
Right. We don't. We want to make sure that there's not too high. It's Name one more.

86
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,040
What's another really important operating characteristic? Trial size.

87
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,839
Trial size. That is. That's important. Yeah, we look at that, although we kind of define that.

88
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,379
Right. But that can change safety and stuff.

89
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,410
You. Oh, you're right. But you're right. The expected trial size could change based on whether we have safety or stopping rules.

90
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:43,220
So combining those two things, those are those are important. Yep. Number of patients treated as a sub therapeutic level.

91
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,220
Yeah. So just generally, right. The number of patients treated at each dose level, right.

92
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,980
Sub therapeutic or MTD or above, we definitely want to know that as well.

93
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,049
Right. So those are all really important operating characteristics that we want to look at after our

94
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,390
simulations to decide if we think that we have the best model for making the best choices.

95
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:08,360
We've got safety constraints in place and we can move forward to actually do this in real life, right?

96
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,840
We'd only get one of those scenarios.

97
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,129
We only have one of those scenarios and we'd only get that one group of 80 people in real life.

98
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,160
So we want to make sure that we've run through lots of different versions of it,

99
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,299
and we still think we're going to get pretty good to make pretty good decisions and find that.

100
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,110
MTD And if we're not, then we want to tweak things.

101
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:35,270
And what are some things that we could change in the model? Or change about the whole setup.

102
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,920
Per cohort size. Yeah, that's something we could change.

103
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,780
We want to talk to the clinician and make sure they're comfortable with it.

104
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,479
But certainly if we chose three at first and then we see that it's just taking far too long to get the MTD right,

105
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,410
we might want to change that and still make sure that we're not getting too many expected deals.

106
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,760
What else? So model. Yeah.

107
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,710
We could change the working moral, right. So maybe we chose a power model, but we're not.

108
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,650
We're not really doing great job. We want to go to parameter logistic, right?

109
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:15,530
Or maybe we chose to parameter logistic and it's we just don't have enough patients to do a good job estimating that we move to a one parameter.

110
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,060
What else? Are there any other things we might think about changing if we see bad operating characteristics?

111
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,990
The dose amount. The dose amounts?

112
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,240
Yeah, possibly. So that's. Probably hopefully something we discuss before we get started.

113
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:45,340
But if we see like some things happening where the probability of DLT is is really too close to each other,

114
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,680
right, then we might want to go back to the clinician and say, you know, do you really need these five?

115
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,170
We should go with four that are farther apart or something.

116
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,120
But hopefully you've got you've kind of gotten that settled before you even start your simulations.

117
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,090
There's something else within the working model that we can change. Yeah, the two cycles.

118
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,330
You can't really change the dose labels unless you're changing the model or the doses themselves.

119
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,850
So if you decide to change the model in the dose, labels can change what else?

120
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,730
There are actually two things within that prior parameter.

121
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:35,930
Yeah. So remember in the models we have a prior standard deviation on the parameter of interest and we can change that.

122
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:45,410
So it's often set. It's like you'll see in our simulations we set the scale to one, but we could make it larger or smaller and see how it changes.

123
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,090
There is one other thing in the logistic model.

124
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,240
What's that? Yes, the like, constant.

125
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,200
That's exactly how your confidence is, depending on how you're loading.

126
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,120
Yeah, great. Right.

127
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:05,060
Remember, in the logistic model, there is a constant that C and it's often set at three, but it could be set at one or some other number.

128
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,980
We could also change that. Now we don't want to just like, you know, we want to.

129
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:17,150
The idea is that we do enough of these simulations playing around with these before we actually get to any real trials that we

130
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:28,180
have an idea of what tweaking these things does right and that we're not tweaking them just to like just for the fun of it.

131
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,349
Right? We're trying to make sure that the trial is going to make good decisions so that we get to actually

132
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,020
treating people we're not going to hopefully be treating with to toxic of dose more often.

133
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,629
We're most often choosing them to be right.

134
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:50,120
We're trying to make sure that we do this all before the trial so that we go into the trial with the best model and characteristics that we could.

135
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,220
There is also the opportunity to go back to the clinician and to say, you know, the sample size is just way too small.

136
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,270
Right. We just we're not we're never going to do a good job.

137
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,870
We either need to decrease the doses or we need to increase the sample size, maybe add another clinic or something.

138
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,210
But there's just absolutely no way we can make this work. Okay.

139
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,090
So we're going to use the R package, DFC R today to run.

140
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,800
It runs both regular CRM and tight CRM, which we'll talk about.

141
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,520
Well, I'll talk to you about on Thursday in that recording.

142
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:43,390
And let's see if we have a good understanding of like these true scenarios and what we're trying to do in the settings.

143
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,070
So try to answer this whole everywhere question.

144
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,180
So first off, right, I give you the specter of 5%, 15%, 30%, 45%.

145
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:13,250
How many doses are we looking at? For, right?

146
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,060
Yeah. It's the length of the vector. Right. You got that from your second homework.

147
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,480
So just so this is a true setting.

148
00:15:20,810 --> 00:16:08,090
But does it mean. Let's try to get 15 people to answer before we start anything.

149
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:36,140
If. All right.

150
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:44,820
A little. I love to see how it changes once you see the answer, like, oh, people said this thing, I better change it.

151
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,110
Okay, so right is either a C or maybe S. Okay.

152
00:16:48,110 --> 00:17:04,790
So this is the true setting is that those one has that the deal t probability right is 5% 15% for dose, two 30% for dose three and 45% for those four.

153
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,010
That's the truth. And we're targeting a probability closest to 30%.

154
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:16,829
So it looks like most people said either dose three is an empty is the empty or that the probability

155
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:23,010
that any given patient is assigned to dose level three and will subsequently have a DLT is 30%.

156
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:32,899
So the truth is that the probability of DLT is at each of these dose levels or at dose three,

157
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:39,380
right, is 30% and we're targeting the dose which has 30% probability.

158
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:49,580
So does anybody want to change their answer? No.

159
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,150
Okay. One person, two people. So A is correct.

160
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,850
Right. The dose level three is the MTV.

161
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,140
That is the thing that we are trying to get at the end of this trial.

162
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:17,240
Right. We're trying to get the maximum tolerated dose and the true values of the probability of toxicity are given there where dose three has 30%.

163
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,740
And that's what we're targeting the probability that any given patient is assigned.

164
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,819
So this one's tricky. And so many of you chose this. There's two things here.

165
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,640
The probability that any patient is assigned to dose three and has a delta is 30%.

166
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,910
That's too many things in there, right?

167
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,760
We actually don't know the probability that someone's assigned to dose three, right.

168
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,490
We don't know what that is. It depends where they started. It depends what the cohort sizes are.

169
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:48,170
The probability that someone that.

170
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:57,350
I think what you were trying to say, right, is that if someone is on dose three, then there's a 30% chance of having a delta.

171
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,800
That's what the Delta rate means. Right. But it's a little convoluted there.

172
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,830
And then 30% of simulated trials will estimate those level three to be the MTD, we hope would be much more.

173
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,290
Right. We hope that most of our trials are actually getting a lot of our trials are guessing.

174
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,250
Depending upon the scenario, the that or a prior setting, that dose three is MTD.

175
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,630
So it's not 30%. You're going to see it. When we do these operating characteristics, we actually hope it's much higher.

176
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,580
And it does depend a little bit on the prior. Okay.

177
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,829
So that dose level three is MTD. Okay.

178
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,840
Let's try this one. You have the same five, 15, 30 and 45.

179
00:19:46,160 --> 00:20:08,319
So what's now true about dose level one? Perhaps you'll see this semantic issue.

180
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:38,450
That was the last question. The person.

181
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,750
Okay. So the majority of people said that 5% of the patients who are assigned to dose level one will experience a DLT.

182
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:57,990
Some people said that none of them are true and some people said that also the probability that dose level one is the MTD is 5%.

183
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,590
So we cannot really tell what the probability that dose level one is that MTD is right.

184
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:13,470
That depends on again, our prior setting, the number of individuals that I don't know like.

185
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,400
It's actually it's really that this is a truth.

186
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,620
It's actually never the entity right under the trees that aren't never that MTD So that's not correct.

187
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:29,760
But the majority of you were correct that 5% of the patients who are assigned dose level one will experience a DLT.

188
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,439
And so you can see that there's a slight difference in that wording from the way that the last one was worded,

189
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:45,329
where it was assigned to and have a dose level of the probability that any given patient is assigned to and will subsequently have a deal.

190
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:54,090
T Whereas this is slightly more clear, right, that the patients who are assigned to this will have the DLT.

191
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,640
So these truths are the probability of DLT at each one of those dose levels.

192
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,379
Okay. So let me walk you through an example. Oh, yeah, sorry.

193
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:12,750
Grazie. So for the truth curve, is it like after the fact, like, this is actually before the fact, right?

194
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,350
So it's true that we actually in real life, we never know the truth, right?

195
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:23,490
But in simulations, we get to set the truth. So in all of our simulations, we're going to say, what if this was the truth?

196
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:29,000
And what if we started with, like, this prior idea or like, right, the skeleton.

197
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:36,030
The clinician thought it was this thing. Let's see how we do. Given that this is the real thing in real life, we never know the truth.

198
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:41,850
So we just start with the skeleton. And then we hope that what we decide is close to the truth.

199
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:51,950
So the truth is really something that's just set by, like something that we pretend to know in simulations but is never known in real life.

200
00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:00,610
Just like in all of your other classes where you're trying to infer about you or PI.

201
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,350
Right. But we only ever have the x bar or the p hat.

202
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,630
Okay. So here is an example.

203
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:18,520
I take this from an article and show you some operating characteristics and then I'll show you the actual trial that way that that ran.

204
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,000
So this was in advanced acute myeloid leukemia.

205
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,320
They were interested in five doses and the target toxicity level was 33%.

206
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:35,140
They chose a one parameter logistic model with primer on that parameter of interest

207
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:41,920
being called beta a normal zero one prior and we put the constant we fixed at three.

208
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:51,760
We're going to specify that we need to have cohorts of three and that maximum we can only have 18 patients on this trial.

209
00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:01,420
So the clinician says, you know, based on these five dose levels.

210
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:08,830
Right. I believe that the dose limiting toxicities are going to be 5%, 10%, 15%, 33% and 50%.

211
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,200
So they're guessing right ahead of time that we're going to choose dose four as the MTD.

212
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:18,010
This is the skeleton that our clinician is providing us.

213
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,860
Now we can write out the dose level. We can write out the actual dose in milligrams per liter squared.

214
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,930
We get that skeleton from the clinician and then we can solve for the dose labels.

215
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,800
Now again, in our we don't actually ever have to put in the dose labels.

216
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,400
We just put in the skeleton vector.

217
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,260
And it figures out from that that there are, you know,

218
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:44,770
five or however many doses and then we'll calculate the dose labels based on the model that you choose.

219
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,069
But I just, again, want you to know where that's coming from so we can just take, right,

220
00:24:51,070 --> 00:25:03,640
the one parameter our logistic model put in our constant three and then the probability of delta, each one goes inside this log p over one minus p.

221
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,680
Okay. So your again your practice this.

222
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,999
So I'm not going to run it right now.

223
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,319
Let me show you the output, but you have to install the dev CRM package we're calling the CRM same function, right?

224
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:27,059
So our simulating CRM, we're putting in, we say py equals whatever we're going to call truth.

225
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:33,180
So for the first scenario, we almost always say that the truth is equal to what our clinician gave us.

226
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,680
What is the clinician was right on the money and that those are the true deal t rates.

227
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,480
Right? That's our setting one. We are setting the truth.

228
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,830
Okay? We're just making it up and saying we want to see what if it was right and what if he was wrong?

229
00:25:46,830 --> 00:26:00,629
Those are going to be our other settings, he or she. Then we have our SO in the series, in the CRM, same function they ask you to put in a prior.

230
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,900
This is not like a Bayesian prior. Okay, it's bad terminology.

231
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:11,010
This prior is actually the skeleton. And so you want to put in here the skeleton that's the clinician gave you.

232
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:17,370
And so first, right, our truth matches the skeleton, then this X not is the starting dose.

233
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:25,559
And so usually we'd start at either the first dose or the second dose, maybe a third dose, but usually we're going to start at a lower dose level.

234
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,270
So we're saying here we're going to start dose level two. We have a max sample size of 18.

235
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,580
Our target toxicity rate is 33%. We're using a logistic model.

236
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,170
We have cohort sizes of three. We're going to do a thousand simulations.

237
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,309
We're saying you don't need to tell us where we are in the simulations.

238
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:50,459
If you want to see it, that you can say, true, we are placing restrictions on the dose escalation.

239
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:58,050
So that means that we'd only be allowed to escalate one level in the doses as opposed to being able to go at multiple levels.

240
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:08,249
And then the standard deviation of our normal prior on our parameter of interest in the logistic model is going to be a one.

241
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:13,560
So it's already is it's assuming that the that it's got a normals zero mean

242
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,020
distribution and you can say what the standard deviation is if you want to.

243
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,329
I actually don't you'll have to look at the function if you can change the mean if you wanted to.

244
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:30,000
And that wasn't like a built in option, right? You could get the code from this function and modify it yourself.

245
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,230
Okay, so we run this and this is the output.

246
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,819
So here are our operating characteristics that our gives to us, right?

247
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:47,580
It tells us again, well, what was the true setting? And in this case, the true setting was the clinician skeleton, the expected setting.

248
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,899
And so what we're expecting here is that dose four is our MTD.

249
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,960
So we want to see that most of the trials, right, most of the simulations are going to choose dose four as the entity.

250
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,510
Most of our patients would be treated at dose four and not hopefully we don't

251
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,250
have that many toxicities with respect to remember we have 18 total patients.

252
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,790
So if we look here the selected is the proportion of trials right out of 1000

253
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,410
out of those thousand simulations that choose each dose level as the empty.

254
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:28,080
And so if we look here, right it's choosing dose 454, almost 55% of the time, which is the most out of all these trials.

255
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:34,200
It is choosing dose five 25% of the time and dose three 19% of the time.

256
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:42,990
The number of expected individuals treated at each dose level is the highest for the expected MTD right.

257
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:51,240
Almost six five treated at dose three four treated at dose two not that many treated at dose one or dose five.

258
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,329
And then the number of toxicities at each dose level is as follows below,

259
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:03,720
we're about two toxicities out of the individuals treated on dose four in a dose level four.

260
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,450
Another just tells you a little bit about here, right, that it gave us the dose labels down here.

261
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,489
So our calculated those themselves.

262
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:23,730
It tells you that it tells you it reminds you what your logistic model looks like and that you had some safety constraints in there.

263
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,960
Okay. So now well, what is the clinician was wrong.

264
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:36,700
Right now we want to see how our model does if the truth is actually that all the dose levels are less toxic.

265
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:44,970
Right. This is actually a good setting. But what we want is that we would then choose dose five as our MTD.

266
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:52,719
Right. We're saying that that only has 30%. So now all after all of our simulations, we want to see that most of them are choosing those five.

267
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,550
Most of the patients are treated at dose five and that we still don't have a ton of deltas.

268
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,260
So all I did in this, I kept all of the code the same. I just changed this truth.

269
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,979
Okay, that's all I changed from the first to the second. So now, right.

270
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,900
Is showing that the truth is lower expected toxicity than suggested by the clinician.

271
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:18,530
And here we can see that 67% of the time we are choosing dose five as our maximum tolerated dose.

272
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,960
We're actually treating on average more patients at dose four than on dose five.

273
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:33,440
And that's probably because why why do you think we're not treating more patients on dose five then TD here.

274
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,540
Yeah. Is it our dose escalation rule.

275
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:42,030
Yeah, it's probably the dose escalation rules. And what else? Yeah.

276
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:49,150
It requires more patient information to overcome a outage.

277
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:55,349
Yeah, that also might be the case. Right. We started with a high prior four dose five.

278
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,850
So it's probably being careful, right? What else about some other hand?

279
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,230
Yeah, I was gonna say what level like dose we started at.

280
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,380
Yeah. Well level dose we started at. And then what's the other thing. Yeah.

281
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,480
We don't have anything beyond just level five so it can't like.

282
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:16,250
That's true. We can't go up and down. What's the other thing. The cohort size, right?

283
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:22,400
We have a cohort size of three. And so based on where we start, it's taking us a long time to get to dose five.

284
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:28,180
Right. And so we're spending a lot of patients on those lower doses in order to get up there.

285
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:37,190
So the fact where we start, how many people we're requiring on each dose and the fact that our prior started with higher,

286
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,709
it's probably being cautious to go up there. Right?

287
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:50,210
So all these things are leading to not treating the most expected number of it's very similar on dose five than dose four.

288
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:55,310
Yeah. Could you say one more time. Is that like an average across the trials of the number of patients or what.

289
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,899
That's right. Yeah. So across. All right, we're doing a thousand simulations.

290
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,389
So that means we're like pretend running a thousand trials. And across all of those thousand trials, on average, about four and a half.

291
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,100
Right. People are treated on dose five. So you can have four and a half people.

292
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Right. But like five, four or five people are treated on dose five and on those four, about five people are treated on dose for.

293
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:35,180
Okay. So now I'm going to look into another scenario where the clinician wasn't had a bad first guess.

294
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:41,810
And this is actually a bad scenario where their guess was underestimating the toxicity at each dose.

295
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:52,490
So now is at what is the real probability of dose something toxicity at dose one was 10%, dose two is 20%, dose three was 30%, 45 and 60%.

296
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:58,190
In which case we should choose dose three as the MTD, not dose four like the clinician thinks.

297
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,409
Right? So now we want to make sure that we're not going to treat too many people at those higher doses,

298
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:08,510
that our data would overcome that prior and that would keep us low dose levels.

299
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:15,260
Again, the only thing I changed here is this pie statement.

300
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,309
Okay, so here my the probability that I'm selecting dose three,

301
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:31,550
which should be the MTD and its true setting is not quite 46% and I'm choosing dose for 31% of the time.

302
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,059
The number of expected patients treated on each dose level is a such where actually the

303
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,680
highest number are treated on dose to almost six people are treated on dose three,

304
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,719
not quite three on dose four.

305
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:53,410
So we are not we're generally not going all the way up to dose five and the number of toxicity is expected and toxicities are below.

306
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,770
So if we put all of this together in this overwhelming slide, right,

307
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:06,469
we can see that this is kind of the tables that you would present in a protocol or

308
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,230
a grant application if you're interested in moving forward with the tight serum.

309
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,050
This is all our serum. This is also something that you would look at and you would decide,

310
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,640
do I need to change anything or do I need to go back to the clinician to talk to anybody,

311
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,840
to talk to them about anything before we actually put this into action?

312
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,880
So based on this, right, this first table up here is just all of our different settings.

313
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,000
And so it's saying that here is the prior or the skeleton given by the clinician that was there prior.

314
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,889
It's called prior. So is there prior guess of some of the dose limiting toxicities?

315
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:47,390
Right. But it's not the prior innovation way. Our simulation scenario one was where the question was right.

316
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:55,730
Simulation two is where over us that they overestimated the toxicities and scenario three is where they underestimated the toxicities.

317
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,840
And so then if I look down here, I sort of flip things around. So now my rows are the difference in settings.

318
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:08,810
So as they're right, they're overestimating, they're underestimating.

319
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:13,220
And I'm looking how often we selected these as target. And again we want to see.

320
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:23,150
Right, that it's the biggest and for the biggest and five and the biggest and three depending upon the scenario, that true scenario.

321
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,940
And so when I look at this right, first off, I got to tell you, you're never going to have amazing,

322
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,129
amazing results, especially with like 18 participants across five dose levels.

323
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,140
You're never going to see like 90% of the time we chose the right dose, especially in cohorts of three.

324
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,640
Right. You're never going to get that good.

325
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:49,730
So like, you kind of you have to like loosen up your really smart right now like I it's not good unless you get 97 or above.

326
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,120
Right. You got to let that go. Okay. That's not going to happen in this setting.

327
00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:01,640
However, you still you probably don't want it. You don't want the best to ever be below 50%.

328
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:07,870
Okay. So if I look at these settings, right.

329
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,710
Four is being chosen 55% of the time, five 67% of the time, and three 46% of the time.

330
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,880
Now I'm I'm feeling like, you know, this is doing okay.

331
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,870
It's particularly doing well when we're overestimating the toxicity.

332
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:28,960
But I'm not sure we're doing that great when it's when we're underestimating the toxicity.

333
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,890
And I feel like we could probably even do better in the true setting.

334
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:44,110
And so here I might think about changing the cohort size in particular, because this is a very small sample size for five doses.

335
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,580
And I also might think about changing the first thing I usually change beyond this,

336
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:56,140
the cohort size and I make sure that the clinician is okay with that, is thinking about changing that skill parameter.

337
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:03,070
Okay. So those are things that I might go in and rerun these get these tables again and compare.

338
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:11,240
You know, is it is it making better choices? And my more likely in this setting, are we more likely to actually find the true anti.

339
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,829
I probably go to courses too before I just skipped right to one.

340
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,730
Right. See how well I do there because I. I do think.

341
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,379
Right, escalating too quickly could be an issue,

342
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:29,980
particularly it might actually make setting three look worse that we get too high and have to come down.

343
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,709
So I primarily do a lot of looking at this dose level,

344
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:41,080
select a target first and then also looking at the average number on each dose to make sure that

345
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:47,230
we are treating most patients at them to you or near the MTD and hopefully not over the MTD.

346
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:56,440
So for example, we're actually doing we're doing pretty well in these in that case, right?

347
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,049
Like we're treating the most patients on MTD here.

348
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:06,670
We're not treating the most patients on MTD, but that's again like a cohort size issue probably that we could potentially fix.

349
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:16,959
It's that we're escalating a little too slowly here and then here we're treating most patients on dose two as opposed to dose three.

350
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,260
Although, you know, if we look at the simulation is pretty similar.

351
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,710
So it's probably around six on each dose level.

352
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:30,309
I'm a little worried that we're going up to these dose levels four and five, particularly for this often.

353
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:36,580
So again, I'd want to probably go back and tweak the cohort size and then maybe think about the scale

354
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,140
and see if these two tables especially could improve this average number of toxicities.

355
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:54,490
Nothing's overly worrisome besides potentially that right about if we get up to to this dose for them,

356
00:38:54,490 --> 00:39:03,370
we're going to see toxicities on most people that get that dose in this setting and this overestimation or the underestimation of toxicity setting.

357
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,709
But again, you know, we'll see how that is affected.

358
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:14,470
If we decrease the cohort size, is that going to be too high? We just want to make sure that we're not going to over treat people.

359
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:28,139
So you'd go through this, you run the simulations, you check this out, and then you think, all right, let me decrease the cohort size to run this.

360
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,750
See if this looks better. If it still doesn't look better, it's not doing what you want, right?

361
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,300
Maybe you think about tweaking the scale a little bit.

362
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:40,610
And then once you get something that looks reasonable, you go and you talk to the clinician and you're like, you know,

363
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:52,069
I ran this versus cohorts of three as we talked about and it wasn't escalating quick enough is the MTD is really one of the high levels and so I this,

364
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,230
that and the other thing and just make sure that they're comfortable with it, right.

365
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:02,210
That they understand what you did and that they understand these tables and feel comfortable moving forward with it.

366
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,160
Okay. So we mostly we discussed this already before I told you about this already.

367
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,300
Okay. So here's what actually happened in the trial. So this was published.

368
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:19,490
They did not have the safety constraint, as you can see, where you could only increase one dose.

369
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,770
Right? So they actually started the lowest dose.

370
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:28,400
And then after three patients saw that they could increase two levels and they did so in our simulations,

371
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:37,520
we applied some safety constraints that they did not. I generally don't ever undo that safety constraint of going up only one dose level.

372
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,190
But you could, right in this case,

373
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:47,600
you could either think about starting at dose level two or starting a dose level one and allowing for that jumping up to levels.

374
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,950
Okay. So everything that we talked about, that was their skeleton.

375
00:40:51,950 --> 00:41:04,550
They had the logistic model with the constant step three, they had five doses, cohorts of 318 max patients and.

376
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,940
What they did. Three patients came in at the first dose, no deal to use their serum, said, hey,

377
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:18,219
you can escalate to dose three because it looks like or yeah, this is dose three, right?

378
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:24,070
It looks like that's not too toxic. They put three people on it again, probably not.

379
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:29,200
At the same time, it was like one person came in, they we saw what happened, right?

380
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,660
And then the last person had a DLT, but they are still able to escalate.

381
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,620
So the model still said, hey, even though there's a DLT, it looks like dose four is okay, right?

382
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:47,980
That target toxicity, that probability of toxicity must be around or less than 33% their target.

383
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:57,070
So they put three people on, they see another DLT. It's actually still estimating that dose four is okay.

384
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,830
And so three more people go in dose four, no deal to you, three more people go on.

385
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,960
The one person has a DLT, but it still thinks dose four is safe.

386
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,350
It puts three more people on there, two more have a DLT.

387
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:16,870
And so at the end we can based on the number of deal is that we see at the dose levels plus the prior belief,

388
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:22,239
right that skeleton with our logistic model, we combine the prior with the actual data,

389
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:31,870
the likelihood we get the posterior distribution and we can take the posterior mean estimates of the DLT probabilities which look like 6%,

390
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:36,910
12%, 17%, 36% and 53%.

391
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:43,450
So notice that they're are actually estimating that dose four has a 36% probability of DLT,

392
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:51,400
and that is the dose that they select as the maximum tolerated dose, even though their target toxicity level is 33%.

393
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:57,249
And that's because most people give themselves a little wiggle room and say, you know,

394
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:05,020
I am targeting 33%, but I am willing to go like 3% over or 3% under 5% over or 5% under.

395
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:13,030
And so in this case, they decided, you know, it's a little bit over 36, but it's not that huge over 36.

396
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:19,600
We probably have our best bet with efficacy in phase two if we move forward with that higher dose.

397
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,010
And so that's what they did.

398
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:29,440
Now, they could have before the trial said 33% is the target toxicity level and absolutely in no way will we choose a dose that goes over that.

399
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,150
So they could have ended up with dose three as their MTD.

400
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:40,000
Right. But you can see here that they didn't treat many people on dose three.

401
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,480
Right. But their estimate is 17%, way less than 33%.

402
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:50,870
And so they didn't likely want to choose that because it would probably be sub therapeutic possibly.

403
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,270
Now the great thing about this phasing system and trials is that we say, okay, well we chose this one.

404
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,560
It's a little over our target toxicity rate, but let's move into phase two and phase two.

405
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,180
We haven't talked yet that much about phase two, but these two is still really looking at safety,

406
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,170
is looking at hints of efficacy, but it's still very much focused on safety.

407
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:16,689
So if we find that we put this forward to phase two and it's really not safe, we will find that right.

408
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,740
And we could stop the trial, phase two trial early and we wouldn't move on with that dose.

409
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:27,970
So we'll make sure that we're not going to treat hundreds or thousands of patients with this dose if it's really not safe.

410
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:39,610
Okay. So the CRM right approach is that it's highly flexible, much more so than, say, the three plus three or the bias point design.

411
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,319
It allows these group cohorts sizes of any size 1 to 3.

412
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,680
We could go beyond that, but we usually don't because we have smaller samples.

413
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:55,359
We'll see on Thursday how you can modify the CRM to account for incomplete information.

414
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,520
So still, at this point we actually have to have the DLT information before we move on

415
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:06,100
to decide the dose level or decide what the next person gets in our model.

416
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:11,110
Right. So we're thinking that DLT is having quickly and or at least more quickly than accrual.

417
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,700
If that's not the case that DLT is could take a long time and or we accrue faster than we can see.

418
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,469
The DLT is then the type CRM, which I'll do which you'll watch, right.

419
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:30,340
That's going to talk about how it can account for the incomplete information and we can incorporate prior information.

420
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:36,070
Right? We have information from our clinician about what's expected and we can incorporate that with what we actually observe.

421
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,940
And it basically, if you think about it, right, it gives us like a starting point.

422
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:47,050
If you think about like a grid search, right? We're starting with like the clinician's estimates and then we're collecting the data.

423
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:54,520
And because we're starting with the clinician, we can hopefully get closer to what the truth is faster than if we just started with like 0000.

424
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,510
Right?

425
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:03,550
And so incorporating that prior information with the small sample size can really help us find that TB hopefully faster than if we didn't have it.

426
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:13,989
The cons of the continual RE assessment method is that we can't just like print out something and give it to the clinician and say,

427
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:17,260
okay, if you see a DLT now this is what you do, right?

428
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,950
This is not an algorithmic design, it's a model based design.

429
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:26,740
And so therefore we have to be updating it after we observe every individual of whether they had a DLT or not.

430
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,210
And then we can give that dose assignment information to the clinician. It cannot be done ahead of time.

431
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:38,020
We actually have to require this prior information. So the clinician has like absolutely no idea what to expect.

432
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,690
Then we're going to start off with really terrible estimates and probably not do a very good job.

433
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,870
Now, that's not usually the case as we've discussed, right?

434
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:53,019
Usually drugs are pretty similar to other drugs and or we have good preclinical data to help us with those estimates,

435
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,320
but it does require this information.

436
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,840
There are extra rules required and these extra rules really are just required for ethical consideration.

437
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,299
I don't actually think this is common. Personally, I think it's a proto design.

438
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,250
However, right. There are extra steps to running it and because there are these extra steps and it can't really

439
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:20,180
just be simply implemented by some algorithm that's not helping it get used more often.

440
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,410
Right. We saw that most people are using three plus three because it's just so, so simple to do.

441
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,520
And then we might have to modify some specifications based on the operating characteristics.

442
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,080
And so it can take a longer time, right, for the setup to feel comfortable moving into to real life with it.

443
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,990
Okay. So let me do the summary first and then I'll let you play.

444
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:50,630
But I don't wanna come back at the end. So just the larger picture.

445
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:59,600
Right phase. This is the lecture Thursday plus like the hour a little bit of Paul everywhere on Tuesday that's the end of phase one.

446
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:05,600
So now you've learned all you're going to learn in this class until you see the projects about phase one design.

447
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,129
And so generally what you should know about phase one is says dose finding, right?

448
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:15,620
This is all about safety and toxicity. We're not in phase one looking at efficacy.

449
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:21,260
We're really just making sure that whatever dose, whatever treatment we have is going to be safe moving forward.

450
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,290
There's often a lot of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics assessments in phase one.

451
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,159
We didn't talk specifically about those in terms of like what does that look like?

452
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,890
But we talked a little bit about what that means and how what the drug does to the body and what the body does to the drug.

453
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:45,410
And generally, individuals in pharmacy would be people leaving those those studies for that part of the study.

454
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,410
We have these kind of like really we talked about two main buckets, but you can split the first into two.

455
00:48:53,420 --> 00:49:03,740
So there is these algorithmic designs, the three plus three design in particular that's really easy to use, and that's why it's implemented so widely.

456
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:09,500
However, often tends to underestimate the MTD and there's very little data,

457
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:15,290
so very huge confidence intervals around the probability of toxicity of those dose levels.

458
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:21,230
There are these hybrid designs or non parametric designs like the biased coin design.

459
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,260
These are computationally simple, a little bit of a step up.

460
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:35,510
However, they're not really easily extended to other settings, like taking into account incomplete information, for example, or having multiple drugs.

461
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:43,610
These aren't going to be easy to do that. So then the model based designs, the MPI of which is like the baby step into the model,

462
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:49,420
these designs that modify toxicity probability interval and then the CRM and well

463
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:55,100
I'll talk about on Thursday the walk design escalation with overdose control.

464
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:04,100
These have a model that is going to help us model the relationship across all the dose levels except for MGP, right.

465
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:08,540
Of the dose level and the probability of toxicity.

466
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,840
This model is going to help us better able to identify the MTD that hopefully right

467
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:20,210
in more settings we will actually find identify the empty need to move forward with.

468
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:25,070
However, it requires knowledge of modeling and it also requires that you have.

469
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:31,120
A good relationship between the clinician and the statistician because you're going to need to get updated data.

470
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,350
Put it into the model to give them updated results to tell them what the next dose assignment is.

471
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:47,559
So in terms of like, so what do you decide? Right. We've talked a lot about how it seems like when you go back and you look at these,

472
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,520
it's like three plus three is horrible and CRM is clearly the winner.

473
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:55,330
Right. But you really shouldn't go into anything with that mindset.

474
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,880
There's always it's always setting specific.

475
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,040
So it always depends on the disease, the number of doses, the number, the sample size possible.

476
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:11,830
You have to take that into consideration before you have a design. You can't go in and say, we are only doing the serum.

477
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:18,669
You have to make sure that you're considering everything that the clinician is telling you about what exists already,

478
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:22,750
who the patients are, how many doses there are. And then you can make a decision.

479
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,560
If, for example, you have a limited number of doses,

480
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:34,570
then you might want to think about potentially a three plus three is not going to

481
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,200
like doing a serum wouldn't give you much more information than a three plus three.

482
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:45,129
Okay. You also can say I'm not really sure and you can run simulations doing a three plus

483
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,000
three and a serum and then make a decision based on the operating characteristics.

484
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,130
But you shouldn't necessarily just have one thing that you hammer all the time.

485
00:51:54,140 --> 00:52:01,820
You want to make sure that you're considering the science around it. So the serum is a Bayesian model based design.

486
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,060
We use expert opinion, we combine it with the accumulated data,

487
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:11,720
we get those these posterior estimates of the probability of toxicities and try to estimate the MTD from that.

488
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:20,240
It's flexible. It usually estimates them to be faster and more efficiently than non model based or algorithmic designs.

489
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,379
However, it's quite computationally intensive.

490
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,280
And so if there is a statistician who's not used to it or doesn't know these packages,

491
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,270
they're not going to be the first ones to say, let's do this type of design.

492
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,480
And like we just said, that there's just no one right choice of design.

493
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,760
You really want to think about the setting. Okay.

494
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:57,130
So I suggest you go to canvas and you download this R code that's under today's lecture, and I just I'll do it because previously I didn't have to.

495
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:03,710
I just had what was in the lecture. Not for your exercise, but I just put the exercise kind of stuff on it too.

496
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,600
So you'll see it all right here. Well, there's some funny stuff.

497
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:32,120
You might have to fix some of the things. That's what you're going to do is you're going to download this DFC package.

498
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,009
And what I want you to do is run these simulations.

499
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:44,370
And so I'm asking you to run like the setting where this is the true curve.

500
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:49,760
This is the prior curves. So one, two, three, four, five, six dose levels.

501
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:55,430
In this setting, the true curve does not match the prior expectation.

502
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:00,620
You start at dose two, you have 36 people, you're targeting a deal t rate of 30%.

503
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,149
And this I'm just having you run 100 simulations in general.

504
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:08,570
When you want to look at operating characteristics, you want to look at it at least a thousand.

505
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,620
But just to make sure we go through this quickly, it shouldn't take that long, even if you do 2000.

506
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,130
But just to make sure you do it quickly, just run 100 to get an idea.

507
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:23,120
And here notice that the scale is like this point six.

508
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,740
Okay, it's not showing it. Oh, what happened? Sorry.

509
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:34,970
Okay, sorry. The the people ahead of you put it on some sort of strange display settings.

510
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,810
It's always bizarre. Okay. Sorry. I thought I was showing you this. So, did you ever see me open canvas either?

511
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:45,470
No. Oh, my gosh. How do you see?

512
00:54:46,550 --> 00:55:01,610
Let me make it so that you can see my screen. Okay.

513
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:18,420
Let's. And it's going to keep it. Okay.

514
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:25,150
The thing is that if people want to play their slide show and presenter, do they have to change the way that the display settings work?

515
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,140
I don't want to deal with that. I just want to show you my screen.

516
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:37,650
So if you go to today, right, download this code, you'll put it in R and you'll see that it starts with like it's half ways.

517
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:44,960
It's a long way down. So you'll see this exercise part and then you might notice that there are some issues.

518
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:54,060
So you might like. For example, when I opened it, I had to correct the quotation marks because they were messed up from like a copy paste.

519
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:59,390
I mean, this doesn't matter because it's a comment, but. Right. It should have been like this.

520
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:06,440
But so I want you to go in and I want you to run this example, go through each slide.

521
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,179
Right. And you might get something slightly different because I didn't set the seed,

522
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:19,399
but you should see that you get results close to this close ish and then run through these.

523
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:26,110
And then what you're going to see is that. You're going to then try different values of the scale.

524
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,390
So the first thing you're going to do is just see what's happening step by step in a serum.

525
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,880
Then you're going to see the effect of scale on the serum.

526
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:38,740
You want to talk to that, and then you're going to see the effects of different truths.

527
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:46,030
Right. So just go through go through these slides, run the simulations.

528
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:51,100
You can do it with somebody. You talk about what you're seeing. If you have questions, raise your hand or come up.

529
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:59,290
But I want to give you the chance to actually play with this code, because I think that's very important in trying to apply these things.

530
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:07,580
So go ahead. You have about 20 minutes till class is over.

531
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,870
If you want to leave, you can. But otherwise just sit and play with it and I'll let you know when it's 120.

532
00:57:53,830 --> 00:58:09,020
We don't. So it's a good place.

533
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:30,260
But you didn't. It's like every time.

534
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:37,310
Look. Also in Cambridge.

535
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:53,410
Yeah. Sorry, I. Yeah, I do.

536
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:02,500
I thought I could get it. But you.

537
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:24,260
But you can't keep. So her involvement in I also teach law enforcement.

538
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:54,990
So. Actually, he was taking a trip to Norway this week completely against what we think actually is the norm.

539
00:59:55,290 --> 01:00:00,410
Okay. Yeah, it's. Let me guess.

540
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,630
Yeah. Yeah. But in a case of assimilation, which is.

541
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:25,470
Not necessarily. So this is probably the greatest advantage for any of this, is that I haven't done this first.

542
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:30,780
Yes, that's right. Two or three through eight on average.

543
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,690
And I just turned to a number of patients on average per night.

544
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:54,210
You're running this location about sometimes writing at least six seasons on average and proportion of that or selecting about those.

545
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:07,380
Okay. So which one is right?

546
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:14,669
Oh, yes. So there's the one.

547
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:19,010
So, yeah, you know, it was like the speech.

548
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:23,130
It was, you know, there's three abilities, there's chance, which is impossible,

549
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:33,140
choosing the right one in school, which is sort of the generic simplicity.

550
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:36,600
I think it's just how determined. Yeah. They never stop.

551
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,070
Okay, well, guess what? The Chosen One is 36.

552
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:48,560
Nice to see you. Okay. I think it must be like the most patients would want to do the that this.

553
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:53,610
It must be so. The duration must be to do something tiny.

554
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:59,130
Yeah. So they probably are into it.

555
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:05,970
Functional skills, like uniform distribution of like 37 minus or something.

556
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:12,990
Oh, it's not. There's substitutions, but it also probably is never stopping.

557
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:18,000
And you could actually see if you add up probabilities of selected.

558
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:26,940
So the reason why I was nervous is just because the less people are saying, yeah,

559
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:38,100
that's more it was that it was like, oh, this has more sorts of seeing this because there are more people assigned.

560
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,980
Yeah. Yeah. So it's not a good portion.

561
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,030
It's not it's like the number of people. So there's less people assigned in a situation.

562
01:02:47,240 --> 01:03:00,090
But this is like very similar, you know, it's like a number that and this would think more and more chance.

563
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:17,530
You. Right.

564
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:24,280
Just to point out that, like in this tight stim function, right, you're actually running the simulations, right?

565
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:35,049
You're doing this many, many times. But in this example where we just run the serum function, we're just running one trial, right?

566
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:40,140
So that's the difference between running many, many functions versus one trial where we're saying, oh,

567
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:48,760
look, we actually have data of like two patients, one at dose one, one, two, dose two and no deal to use.

568
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,300
Right? That's what we're putting in here with this toxins level.

569
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,499
And so you'd want to do all those simulations to look at the operating characteristics.

570
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:02,680
And then during the trial, we'd use the serum function to update the model right with our prior.

571
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,370
And that would give us the output for figuring out what dose we assign next.

572
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:27,510
Right. So you see the output is really different between the type SEM and the CRM.

573
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:32,820
And it's all new here, right? The next recommended is dose three.

574
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:38,819
And so that's what you can go back to your clinician with or the research assistant and say, hey,

575
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:44,020
the next patient that comes in patient three, they get dose three and then you get their information.

576
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:47,670
We rerun the serum. And so that you're kind of going through those steps here or two.

577
01:05:48,830 --> 01:06:09,180
So much energy and acreage that we have now, which is something like 20.

578
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:18,500
20 looking and.

579
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:27,310
Because it's changing. I think it's going into these games and.

580
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:35,230
Yeah. And Scottish.

581
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:47,410
Musicians. So continues this.

582
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:09,850
In most media circles.

583
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:34,530
Because it was. She?

584
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:52,750
But also it seems as if he's 23.

585
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:06,700
It's given me.

586
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:30,200
I used to teaching English.

587
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:42,640
He is interesting.

588
01:09:43,050 --> 01:10:03,260
And you're. You need to be able to see that it's not got much like two or more of the 43.

589
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:21,340
What about 45? She's.

590
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:36,080
Somebody said to me, you know.

591
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,550
Know. So.

592
01:11:54,110 --> 01:12:22,950
She? So.

593
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:35,110
Yeah, because.

594
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:50,260
Right. Right. So I.

595
01:12:57,620 --> 01:14:01,920
Yeah. Yes.

596
01:14:59,380 --> 01:16:30,190
The. All right, so it's almost time.

597
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,620
If you're done, you can go. If you're not, you're welcome to keep working.

598
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:41,690
If you have any questions, I'll stay up here for a few minutes. If you want to ask them a reminder, you don't need to come to class on Thursday.

599
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:51,760
You can if you want, but just watch the video and we'll all reconvene on Tuesday and make sure that you've got what Thursday was about otherwise.

600
01:16:51,770 --> 01:17:23,400
Have a great day. And I think it makes you think it might have been.

601
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:55,750
Yeah. Yeah. I just think, like, I was just like I was like, oh, my God, I don't think it's going to be nice if I can find like that.

602
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:03,330
I have nothing I need to find out.

603
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:13,720
You know what might be crazy? I think it's also quite funny.

604
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:33,210
I mean, yeah, like, I, I think that what I saw was, like, favorite show is the standard.

605
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:39,840
Like, it's like, well, I mean, they're having money.

606
01:18:40,000 --> 01:19:00,730
Like, when I was 17, there is a very it's just like you look at what's going on.

607
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:06,130
So what are you kind of like?

608
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:19,690
Number one, I find that I think I would be worried about so much right now.

609
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:34,050
I was like, Yeah. I was only using Navajo in Washington, which is going to be great.

610
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:46,580
I was just kidding. Questions. I know you assume that you teach it.

611
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:52,260
That's true. Oh, yeah.

612
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:59,870
You can either. Yeah. You know, you can change the individuals because I have to find something.

613
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,530
I hope not. Yeah. It was like, what does it matter for right now?

614
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:21,000
Because you go back to your belief one way or the other or like not knowing, you know, you try one person, one is as if like the trials of the prior.

615
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:30,600
Yeah. Like, I'm glad you're thinking of those students, I think because I thought was like there was no association because it's like what

616
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:37,150
changed things such as the difference between the question they're asked to finish,

617
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:49,940
like when they value and speed it up to where you just really can see that there are five things I remember.

618
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:57,210
Come on. What are the things I want to talk about?

619
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:01,020
Yeah, I like to take them my. Yeah, I was like.

620
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:11,680
I mean, like, I just look at that. I think it as I think I'm trying to get across.

621
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,630
Yes. You are auditing, right? Yeah. Okay. So you don't have to do it.

622
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:20,410
I mean, I was reading the papers upbraid you.

623
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:24,450
You also don't have to do that but yeah.

624
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:33,239
Yeah, well it's like sort of that gives you a grade is required which is just all types of,

625
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:39,500
you know, like are you fully registered as often as necessary?

626
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:53,910
I'm like, let me ask you, I think if you are registered as auditing that in order to get the benefits outside of the group.

627
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:59,410
Yeah. Yeah, you just get a s like it's not really. Yeah.

628
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:07,860
So let me just check all lectures now.

629
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:13,310
Computers. Voice Yes, yes. I really don't need somebody else's job.

630
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:18,299
I fully am like, I don't need to know these things. I could have gone to college with engineering.

631
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,160
I didn't. Yeah. And there was a big reason for that because I really don't know.

632
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:27,190
I'm like, how does it work? Doesn't matter where put three.

633
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:32,459
Yeah, absolutely. Sure. Yeah. Yes, this.

634
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:38,850
It's, it's, it's common to you. So you're not targeting something, but I'm willing to go 5%.

635
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:51,610
I like I kind of thought about doing it my first year, but I believe it was my first year of not doing it,

636
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:54,870
you know, kind of started it all falls apart a little bit.

637
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:58,050
So I was kind of like by the time the second semester, scenarios of me do that.

638
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:04,050
It's just, I mean, you could do everything. I feel like I want to talk about us.

639
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:10,540
Yeah. Yeah. Why? 640 6:00?

640
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:23,270
Because, I mean, yeah. So this I build a name isn't necessarily a formal training regime, but so what is it just once to get like six patients?

641
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,640
It's just like you're supposed to help one another.

642
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:36,170
So for 30 seconds. So this is like it's always the speaker's you.

643
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:49,680
Yeah. And if you look if you go into the documentation and figure out what they it's sometimes I feel they usually it's too much uniform

644
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:57,660
distribution of sun and so they somehow like the default is to assume that one patient is coming in basically like per month.

645
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:03,240
Right, but a little bit over a month. So they say it's like 37,000.

646
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:08,430
So 36 years. If the trial stopped earlier, you would see that number would've changed.

647
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:20,180
Ask wait. So you can compare model you can use a logistic model is just to show you a different thing.

648
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:25,790
Okay. So you can choose whatever you want and then look at the look at the operating characteristics.

649
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:57,640
Okay. Yeah. If we don't know.
