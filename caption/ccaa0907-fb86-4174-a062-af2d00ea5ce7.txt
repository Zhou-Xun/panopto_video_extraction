1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:13,830
Anyway even had a test. This. So that works.

2
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,500
They both work and probably also rent services.

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,250
So you got a sense idea is going be comfortable with you. All right.

4
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,390
Today's courts two in which I do a great deal less talking.

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,810
You do a great deal more personally. But we're going to try to think about the same thing.

6
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,540
But we're going to be thinking about two themes that I brought up, one of them quite strongly on Tuesday,

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,620
and one of which I brought up a little less strongly, but I make just as much of a focus.

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:55,780
The big theme is the extent to which when you read these cases, they aren't just decisions, they're roadmaps, they're instruction books.

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,380
They're instruction books for lower courts, they're instruction books for future litigation.

10
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:09,069
They're instruction books for state legislatures, and they're instruction books for judges who want to make decisions that are within the law

11
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,210
but aligned with their substantive and normative preferences about what is ought to be.

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,490
The other thing is the outcast brings. Remember I spoke about standing how standing is.

13
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,970
You can only be a party to a case if you have some legitimate interest in it.

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,840
Right. This was where I was talking about how for a lot of high school versus wade courts in particular cause court cases based on standing.

15
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,450
Because by the time you actually got to a federal appellate court, the baby hasn't had you were no longer pregnant.

16
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,120
If you decide that people standing is pregnant, then it was impossible to get an appellate court federal court decision.

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,620
That's an example of standing. There's lots of cases of standing.

18
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,140
If one of you defraud another person and I'm really a bystander, I can't be a party to it.

19
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,469
But you can write friend of the court briefs advocacy groups and this is like writing

20
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,129
comments on the Federal Register or trying to manage a social media profile.

21
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,210
This is this kind of policy one on one.

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:12,930
You watch for important cases and you watch for advocacy briefs that are relevant and you decide whether it is constructive, participate in.

23
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,650
And if you look at policy networks, you'll find pretty soon you're being asked to participate in briefs.

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,320
So we're going to focus on these two things.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,520
I read an extremely prominent decision is going to do a lot to shape all of our futures and then how to think about the advocacy briefs,

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,420
because the case produced absolute storm of a variable quality, and I'm sure you'll find something in there that you like or perhaps hate.

27
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,400
But first in the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton said the courts were the least dangerous branch.

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,030
And when you think about it, there are a number of structural problems that you have.

29
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,660
If you want to make law courts, you have a number of advantages, right?

30
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:57,360
You're accountable to absolutely nobody. That's pretty cool. You know, one definition of power is whether you need to listen.

31
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,510
And a Supreme Court justice is pretty much the epitome of someone who doesn't really need to listen to anybody.

32
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,220
So that's one. But cases that they need to have cases brought to them.

33
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,720
If nobody's litigating, the perfect case for you to carry out your ideological agenda overall.

34
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,450
They're constrained by legal reasoning to become law.

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,550
Even when you get cases that make an absolute nonsense out of basic statutory interpretation in the Supreme Court,

36
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,750
they don't have less weight is precedent in the eyes of a lot of other courts because

37
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,480
they involve undermining basic rules that one else get plot statutory protection.

38
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,390
This is the independent legislatures thing, for example.

39
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,150
This is also actually a lot of the ACA cases and they've got no enforcement mechanism of their own.

40
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:49,530
One of the many hysterical tweets of the early Trump years was somebody who said that the marshal of the Supreme Court was on his way to arrest Trump.

41
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,450
And this was particularly amusing because the Supreme Court literally has no power to arrest anyone.

42
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,919
They're a constitutional appellate court. They can hire a security guard.

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,980
But that security guard has exactly which authorities the security guard are.

44
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,040
Instead they rely on others enforcing what they said.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,840
So a nice example I have was to do with strip searching in Chicago.

46
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,080
There was a prominent Supreme Court case in which was deemed that the right to privacy.

47
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,610
Remember, our old friend right to privacy meant that the Chicago Police Department acted improperly when they

48
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,890
arrested a woman for having too many unpaid parking tickets and gave her intrusive strip searches.

49
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,090
And the Supreme Court ruled that your right to privacy means that there has to be some proportionate,

50
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,090
proportionate relationship between the right and the risk people's not paying your ticket

51
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,230
and whether or not you need to have your anal cavity search by calling police officers.

52
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:47,980
Now the coda to this piece of liberal activist judging was that.

53
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:55,180
But ten years later, Buckley scuffled in Cicero. If you're familiar with the geography of DuPage County, Cicero directly adjoins Chicago.

54
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,050
You have to have a certain level of Chicago skill to figure out what you can cross the border.

55
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,460
Turns out that the city of Cicero, which has exactly the same access to the Chicago Tribune as anybody else in the area,

56
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,790
was still essentially doing this as a routine practice.

57
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,380
And as far as anyone can tell, they simply had not noticed that their next door neighbor Police Department,

58
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,980
had lost the Supreme Court cases to the appropriateness of this procedure.

59
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,420
In other words, it was ten years before somebody caught Cicero doing exactly what Chicago that it's all about to do.

60
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,370
This is why relying on Supreme Court cases alone is not super effective.

61
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,310
Take Brown versus Board of Education desegregation case.

62
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,570
Well, the conditions called all deliberate speed, which is a legendary phrase because it's self-contradictory.

63
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,100
But there are lots of things that you could do. The state of Virginia had a very simple expedient.

64
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,740
They shut down all the public schools for a year to. If you don't have any public schools, then you can't be segregate your public schools.

65
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,530
This is all part of a Southern strategy called massive resistance, and in many ways it worked.

66
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:07,160
You saw less of desegregation than you would have if you just sat down with the map of the racial distribution of students in schools in the South.

67
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,250
In the United States. Foreground. You get a lot more desegregation because it was completely segregated, basically.

68
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,260
But you also didn't get as much as you would have thought because of expedience with massive resistance,

69
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,349
which frequently evolved into the centrist movement. Because then you got segregation academies where all white students go private.

70
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:33,060
Many black school students followed suits. These are all ways in which you see the lack of courts enforcement mechanisms in Kansas City.

71
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:40,020
A federal judge, district judge, basically took control of school financing for about 15 years and forced Kansas City

72
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,720
schools to redistribute funds within schools and redistribute students within schools.

73
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,979
There were a number of cases like this.

74
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:53,520
Kansas City stood out because the only apparent effect was a lot of white flight from any of the areas served by the Kansas City school districts.

75
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:00,940
Test scores did not simply get better. The conclusion of federal judicial review is that nobody became a federal district

76
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,570
judge so that they could manage the budget of Kansas City school system for decades.

77
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,520
Right. So court struck an important thing, as Andrew Jackson said, when the Supreme Court ruled that calling for immediate removal,

78
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,620
which is when white Americans kick the Cherokee off of their lands and make them walk to Oklahoma on the Trail of Tears.

79
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,750
That was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. And Andrew Jackson, low impact.

80
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:31,130
So Justice Marshall has made his decision. Now, listen before. Case the three examples Cicero Brown Indian removal.

81
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,480
If face you see the problem if you don't have an enforcement mechanism of your own,

82
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,230
all you've done is restart the politics with different balance of forces.

83
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,360
So this means the thinking about the courts can't be done in isolation despite sort of heavyweight legal scholarship and self-importance.

84
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,980
That makes you want to take that one little tip,

85
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,540
unless you're very specific circumstances like receiving a request to rewrite a contract in case situation.

86
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,000
Although I was never surprised. You don't say you're surprised as a lawyer because lawyers are never surprised.

87
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,430
Nothing. They interrupt their court registration.

88
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,750
So it's a basic principle of legal writing, by which I also mean letters to other law offices or whatever.

89
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,679
But you don't be surprised. The call.

90
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,530
That is Steve the last night, a bit of surprise except possibly the case where you don't counteroffer to my clients.

91
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,680
That is so absurd that I have not seen it in 30 years of practicing law.

92
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:37,090
That's the kind of culture that you get. But any clear I approached the law says that it can only be understood as part of a broad political strategy.

93
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,330
You might emphasize law, particularly if what you want is not popular with the broader public or unlikely to pass in the legislature.

94
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,060
In case you wish to go to the somewhat imperfect but nonetheless powerful legislature called court.

95
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:57,370
And. You therefore want to think about how it fits into a broader thing because we have a lot of comparative legal research on it,

96
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,820
basically to the extent that Brown versus Board of Education worked.

97
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,490
It's because they were local organized activists and political elites on the ground who wanted to work.

98
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,910
Same thing with Roe versus Wade. Same thing with just about any of the major decisions on either side.

99
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,220
Now this works asymmetrically in a lot of cases, nonetheless. So how do you use courts?

100
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,130
Let's start with test case. You want a good test case?

101
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,080
In a wonderful book called The New Jim Crow, which is basically not abuse of the criminal justice system to disenfranchize black Americans.

102
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,610
Yes. There's a lovely moment when informed the author,

103
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,810
former ACLU attorney describes looking for a test case on improper stop and search by police department.

104
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:49,370
And she gets this guy who has just a stack of papers for when he's been stopped and searched with no proximity to no cost,

105
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,110
and he's never rested for it. And she's thinking, here's my test case.

106
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,340
He looks good. He explains himself extremely well.

107
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,090
He's got this vast pile of evidence that he's being improperly treated by the police.

108
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,440
This is great. This is a good test case. That's.

109
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,900
This is somebody that we can get judges and juries and the public on side.

110
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,530
Well, it turns out he'd been arrested.

111
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,260
And you can immediately map in how the other side's attorneys would frame it that he's no saint, he's the no angel argument.

112
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,800
And he told them this akanmu is a test case because you got that that one conviction on your record.

113
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,180
And she describes him sitting in her office, tearing up all the sound bites of Parker.

114
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:44,030
This is why you look for test cases, right? This is why, for example, a lot of the religious liberty cases are about, for example,

115
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:51,560
cute little groups of Catholic nuns who wish to be exempted from this or that form of civil law because they're a very sympathetic group of people.

116
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,580
They just don't happen to have a facility that's compliant. They're willing to carry people up and down the one flight of stairs.

117
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:05,070
I'm not joking. I just think they're not so nice test case.

118
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,010
It's a clear test. The issue is there. The judge will have a hard time getting rid of it on procedural rules.

119
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:21,610
The judge will have a hard time rewriting the issue into something else that's more amenable to whatever it is the judge is trying to do or something.

120
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,210
The question is, are we going to determine precedence or is that separate?

121
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,570
Okay. Sorry, I skipped over this a test case. What you're doing is you are determining precedent, right?

122
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,120
You bring a test case because you want to find out what the courts will do.

123
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,530
And you want courts that are on your side to start writing the trail of breadcrumbs, start writing the precedents that will begin to create the law.

124
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,110
So you start to bring cases still enabling you to argue for the major questions of doctrine as part of building up the major questions doctrine.

125
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,370
Every time you get a new conservative judge on the Supreme Court, a bunch of states go and pass anti-abortion laws in order to which are test cases,

126
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,170
in order to try and get the help of the Supreme Court to let them go this time.

127
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,830
Mississippi lucked out because with Dobbs, you learn that anything goes.

128
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,470
So you get a good test case so the judge can't get rid of good procedure.

129
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,340
So that judge can judges can get rid of it on some procedural grounds.

130
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,100
And the specific issue has good optics, like our would be plaintiff on the police case I described.

131
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,160
Then you prepare the ground. Remember, this stuff takes time. Even when you have a court battle back from London, like the six hour day.

132
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,919
So, for example, you write one of the articles. I don't even get anybody else.

133
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,850
That law school started on what passes for the review process of law reviews.

134
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,630
Student run journals with no page limit. What could go wrong?

135
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,809
Just think of your incentives.

136
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:56,230
If you ran a journal and I sent you a 100 page self-indulgent article, you edit my footnotes to death and publish whatever dumb idea I have.

137
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,840
Right? So. I mean, come on.

138
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,140
If you want it. But you want a recommendation.

139
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:11,360
So nonetheless, what you do is you start to systematically feed articles into the law journal system in order to try and get your case,

140
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:18,780
your independent legislative document or whatever argued in order argue that the Indian Child Welfare Act is an infringement of individual rights.

141
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,550
What are. You do legal research to find precedents, and you can process this through the lot of the articles as well.

142
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:32,779
And you can also use it analysis briefs to make the case to judges who might not have perceived what was being asked of you.

143
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,680
Network and support allies within legal system. This is the point of the Federalist Society.

144
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,980
The Federalist Society was in large part created to counterbalance.

145
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:48,730
What you would reasonably describe as at least a social liberal, if not necessarily economic liberal bias within the legal education.

146
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,739
And if you remember, how many what percentage judges come from this couple of law schools?

147
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:00,100
Actually, in many ways, this is called redressing a problem at Harvard, Yale, especially Yale.

148
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,450
But the Federalist Society exists to sort of pluck smart young conservatives,

149
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:12,280
give them lots and lots of training and practice and debate, you know, research supported summer schools and so forth.

150
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,849
And at the same time, it's vetting, which is why Donald Trump really said what he previously had spoken when he told people

151
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,620
during his 2016 campaign that he would appoint all these judges from the Federalist Society.

152
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,120
This. Who pays for the Federalist Society by and large, businesses.

153
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,040
You don't like regulation. So you would say in a sense, the deregulation is business and social lawmaking is pleasure business.

154
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,260
Foreign shopping, find the right place to start the case.

155
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,380
Remember I was talking about this district judge in Florida has been so helpful to Donald Trump right now.

156
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,840
So it's not an accident that a lot of our reproductive cases are coming out of places like Mississippi and Texas.

157
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,490
And before you go. Well, Mississippi.

158
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:58,030
Well, it's partly that, but don't operate under the assumption that West Virginia is significantly more socially liberal.

159
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,850
What's actually going on is that there in the Fifth Circuit,

160
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,490
the Fifth Circuit basically gives you a straight shot at the Supreme Court for any conservative legislation you try.

161
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,370
And they're not taking especially seriously.

162
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,790
You get other circuit courts, and this is quite unusual, basically calling Fifth Circuit opinion stupid in detail.

163
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,570
But nonetheless, all you have to do is get a good case in the Fifth Circuit.

164
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,440
And now there's a prima facie case that the six can take it and make this off the court case.

165
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,190
That's how you get the Texas board case. That's how you got thousands so forth.

166
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,550
You can also start in the ninth Circuit, San Francisco, which is quite liberal, but.

167
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,740
Getting struck down by the Ninth Circuit means you started on the wrong foot instead of the Fifth Circuit giving you an out of choice,

168
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,110
esthetics and cheerleaders, while the Ninth Circuit anticipating a Supreme Court challenge,

169
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,590
writing it, and then select about how your bad and don't know law. Alex.

170
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,930
Bruce, we'll talk about that more. This is to inform the court about what they're doing,

171
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,069
because one of the things about judges is they learn not to stumble while school

172
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,130
deliberately detours you to a lot of what we would call public health school facts.

173
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,470
They pick up all the facts. Don't worry.

174
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:13,690
But it is not reasonable to expect a bunch of life tenured judges to understand American history and the consequences for women's careers,

175
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,020
reproductive rights, decisions, and so forth. Alex, you're a friend of the court.

176
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,120
You don't have any standing. You're really offering helpful advice.

177
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,420
If you look at the page, we read all the Dobbs briefs.

178
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,800
The one thing that was in the camera in reading, like a lot of people already in to the court these days.

179
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,450
Then you got rid followed cases. You need to pass and follow.

180
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,779
What was one of the issues you'll find if you read the Kavanaugh concurrence is that it's

181
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,790
very hard to have a more authoritarian regime on one side in Mississippi than the other,

182
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,500
for example. So if Illinois has legal abortion and Missouri has abortion, that is not legal.

183
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,660
Women who need abortion can drive across the bridge. This is not the 500 mile odyssey if you live in Mississippi, this is across the bridge.

184
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,620
So therefore, the logical thing if you're the state of Missouri, is to start criminalizing people who would be pregnant, who go to Illinois.

185
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,850
That's what's going on. It's going to be a lot of fun. We saw exactly the same thing with the Fugitive Slave Act.

186
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,759
The federal government weighed in on the sides of people who wanted the power to chase the slaves,

187
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,970
to the free states, to kidnap them, to bring them back to the south.

188
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,210
The federal courts went with that, went with the south on that. And that was probably the precipitating effect of the Civil War.

189
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,380
So that will. And finally, dissemination.

190
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:34,059
You need to tell people about the case. So right after Dobbs the obstetricians and they're going to tell the American people that all

191
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:38,560
the doctors involved in treating anything to do with reproduction simply want an override.

192
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,920
Because a thing that can get called abortion under a 1931 statute is, quite frankly, the standard of care now.

193
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,980
So all these different medical specialties have to basically suddenly urgently

194
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,540
go through their standard of care and not think about improving the care,

195
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,820
but think about what the general counsel thinks about what would happen if it were challenged.

196
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,860
It would anybody go to jail for this? And it spreads, right?

197
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,110
Be honest, these geologists don't want to be working in a surgery that includes a X,

198
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,560
which could be deemed an abortion under a law written from 1931 with completely different technology.

199
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,339
That's what dissemination is. And right now, it takes the form of basically hospital ethics committees, which is a technical term in this case,

200
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:24,090
for lawyers trying to work out whether you should do the standard of care or do bed rest until something has happened.

201
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,730
That means that you have to do a procedure on the woman who died. All right, so let's design it equivalently.

202
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:37,520
Dissemination is you should probably try to find a way to communicate to the system police that they should stop strip searching.

203
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,880
People are such clumsy critics, right? If you don't disseminate the case, you can remain substantially at that level.

204
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,280
What does dissemination civil society, parties, activists, networks of state legislators.

205
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:58,050
Right. Right now, there's a lot of model legislation being churned out on how to further restrict abortion.

206
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,670
Now that Dobson said, essentially for the state governments, anything goes. So this is how to use courts.

207
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:10,730
Okay. This is how you fit the use of constitutional law into a broader political strategy.

208
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,930
And the inference you should draw is that if you just file a case.

209
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,130
The best possible outcome is you win. It has very little impact.

210
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,149
And it's far more likely that nothing will happen because he didn't prepare the ground.

211
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,260
He didn't get friends into the right courtrooms. You didn't come up with the right test case.

212
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,790
You didn't define the issue. So they knocked it out several rounds, etc., etc., etc.

213
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,270
That's why in many ways this is a game for people who care about politics.

214
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,610
On the bright side, since we've established it among the nation's political elite, you're actually not that far from it.

215
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,990
Like I said, the odds are pretty good that any of you could have careers where you end up at multiple embassies.

216
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:56,640
Any questions? What is the function of media?

217
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,270
An example of dissemination with the media. You have example to disseminate.

218
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:08,880
Absolutely. I mean, one of the things of the subtle, subtle, shifting away strategy of Roberts is nobody ever covered abortion cases here.

219
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,910
This is a safe space. Most of us probably have a tire burner or a cat.

220
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,820
Right. But you have to signal to your Hotmail account where you get 6000 junk mail a day.

221
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,080
Right. And somebody sold it to somebody who does abortion rights.

222
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,000
And you've been getting essentially the same email every 12 hours for the last ten years,

223
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,030
which is that Roe versus Wade is about to be overturned and we're doomed.

224
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,820
That's like, well, what is what doesn't seem to be overturned from talking to.

225
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,910
In other words, you have a lot of people who wish to disseminate that terrible design there.

226
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:47,980
When he was saying some tactical homework and these guys are saying it's a dead decision walking dog today around my therapist.

227
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,170
There is, by the way, there was a very long period because after the decision was leaked,

228
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,850
it became clear what anybody who followed the court knew, which is the only way was the dead decision.

229
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:04,200
One. But in a lot of states, this is a nice example of communication strategy.

230
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:11,480
The organization that took charge of leading the response in the ACP rallies in support of their.

231
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,950
That was slapdash, as do most of the time. Like going to Planned Parenthood building.

232
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,720
What is the principal activity inside? General health care.

233
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,300
Yeah, women's health. Reproductive health care.

234
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,640
So Planned Parenthood is fundamentally a provider, their provider with mission, but they're a provider.

235
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:44,840
So if you're doing a strategy that a saying slash reinstating Roe v Wade rally last spring, the political strategy role has been overturned.

236
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,970
Get out in the streets. Make your voice heard. If your provider the message is our doors are open, we are proceeding as normal.

237
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,930
Abortions are illegal in Michigan. Can you see the problem reconciling those two strategies?

238
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:06,209
So if you put a different organization entirely about politics and law, say, RL in charge of these rallies,

239
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:09,900
you probably put it on a much harder edge and would have had curious providers say,

240
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,590
What are we supposed to overturn Roe and overturn I have patients tomorrow.

241
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:20,130
Even better tried to get a variance message. So this is why dissemination isn't all that easy, right?

242
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:27,180
One of the absolute peaks of anger among people who care about reproductive rights was that to say nothing has actually happened yet,

243
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:36,140
which is kind of a message. Because nothing has actually happened yet has been essentially the Abortion Rights Campaign for about ten years.

244
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,460
You can imagine that was out. So let's resolve.

245
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,640
I want you to form into five groups. Are you content to explain things work.

246
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,690
I think reasonably big groups is part of the reason do five fairly big groups because I

247
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,860
think you're going to want to divide labor internally with the groups possibly so one to.

248
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,459
Three, four or five, something like that. I trust yourself.

249
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,780
Organizing. I want you to take 10 minutes and answer to questions about one of these documents.

250
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,120
Right. So from this side of the room, majority opinion over to $0.02.

251
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,040
Well, you will have fun. Two questions.

252
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,140
What is this judge's instructions to future litigants? It's an instruction.

253
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,010
What do they tell future litigants to do? And what's their objective?

254
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:41,100
What's their desired endpoint? One. The fun ones is going to be cowbell because you first read it and you're like, Why are you doing this?

255
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,790
Like Thomas is Claire Thomas must overturn visual. Alito is clear.

256
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:52,340
Alito wants to overturn Roe and doesn't want you to think he wants to overturn it will bring that rare thing.

257
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,950
And so we're pretty clear what they're saying.

258
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:59,380
ROBERTS He wishes we could go back to softly, softly and just make abortion impossible to get while he wrote that.

259
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,340
What's not doing is what's more interesting questions. Why bother?

260
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,430
Okay. So by groups. 5 minutes.

261
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,540
If you react to what your father said, you just said God's decision.

262
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,199
Google will make you happy. The to support web page. How long does it take to write these things?

263
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,290
Like how? Just like reading through them. Like all this.

264
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,740
How long is a person? Hours is what you're looking for because they have books.

265
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,240
So the clerks read the briefs. The judges say what they want to do. This is abortion.

266
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,900
Every single one of these judges knew what they wanted to do from when they were like, 20.

267
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,090
So then you tell the clerks how to pursue the strategy that the judge thinks will be most effective.

268
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,000
So person hours is considerable because every single one of these clerks is going to be dining

269
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,540
out and having been a clerk who worked on the dog's decision for the rest of their legal career.

270
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,360
Brackets. They're very good looking, learning.

271
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,940
They are not all equally learned because if you look at undergraduate plus legal education in the United States,

272
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,990
at no point do you learn to be competent, historian, psychologist or any of the other fields involved.

273
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:08,490
But then learn it. All right. Take it away.

274
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,500
Self-organizing five groups. Alito on Hassan.

275
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:56,310
Why? I take it it's somewhere on that. It's about time that I realized I was living with your friends.

276
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,340
I hung in there because they were therefore abnormal.

277
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:34,590
Okay, so there is in less than 1% of all property, so it's less than any other places.

278
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,250
What is the question?

279
00:26:40,930 --> 00:28:13,589
So it's sort of like I guess I just I just want you to explore its handling of the coronavirus cases, in part because I heard what the president said.

280
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:49,710
Yes, I think there are 539 967 divided by 35, and I haven't seen it.

281
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:12,320
There's a clear evidence that two thirds of the state has an idea of what it is we can do.

282
00:29:14,940 --> 00:30:03,160
So, you know, I was not well enough to say to those states and our city we can testify to is the one thing you have to lose and.

283
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,710
Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:29,040
Sometimes if there is something that can help us where she took me.

285
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:35,460
But I never going to the refrigerator.

286
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,670
Right. Yeah.

287
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,340
Yeah, yeah. Right.

288
00:30:51,030 --> 00:31:27,569
I'm sorry. We just saw, like, what am I basically saying?

289
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:46,350
That we're going to get away with murder, right?

290
00:31:49,680 --> 00:32:44,010
Yes. How does that work as a prosecutor as far as like you say on the side of the argument?

291
00:32:46,550 --> 00:33:26,960
Yeah, it's less and less like I'm not saying things like ignoring it then.

292
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:40,500
I mean, you know, the question there are even harder.

293
00:33:45,010 --> 00:34:46,770
Yeah. Yeah. That, that I would have thought that I would probably be like, I don't know how you're going to do that.

294
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:57,270
Now, one reason why all my friends are just.

295
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:24,730
And I. Even though they want to go in there.

296
00:35:24,910 --> 00:36:01,130
I obviously I think they're well, I think it's just the host nation right here, right now.

297
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:35,070
You you have to work out all of the things that we're going to have to recognize this year.

298
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:51,840
ROBERTS Is there any sense of what you're describing?

299
00:36:56,270 --> 00:38:02,610
You know, but they have no idea what's going this is something that doesn't seem like it should be.

300
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:14,230
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

301
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:56,030
It has everything to do with the West and the West.

302
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:27,870
And that is something that right now, you know, there are, you know, a lot of people smoke cigarets.

303
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,490
Reporter The groups are trying to do something like in order to get hold of your answer

304
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:55,600
these questions at the end of this whole 200 pages that you and I and all of us are not.

305
00:40:31,080 --> 00:41:23,190
And of course, I did just that cause I wanted to talk to you about my mother.

306
00:41:28,150 --> 00:42:00,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:29,970
I mean, I think I don't see that happening.

308
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:45,719
Okay, so you are saying that you are okay.

309
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,070
So if you like this and you'd like to pay three times more to do it for three years,

310
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:58,050
and I've been invited to a law school because I hope you've enjoyed our little constitutional law school reading interpretation in a box class.

311
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:07,110
Let's see what we came up with. And what if, you know, order documents were stated, which is the we're going to start with the controlling opinion,

312
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,790
which is now the law of the land of the constitutional pronouncements on the current and future status of reproductive rights.

313
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:20,310
The classic thing that Justice Alito. All rise.

314
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,250
So speaking before Justice Alito in here,

315
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:39,159
we emphasized that once your legislature litigate litigants to consider viability and personhood

316
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:47,710
and that we believe that personhood believes begins with that doesn't necessarily mean that.

317
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:56,680
All right. So what they're saying is that it's hard to say that person that begins at the point of viability,

318
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,080
because if we're saying that person has is divided guy defined by having self-awareness

319
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,709
and the ability to reason in some combination that we might be able to define that person

320
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,760
personhood would not have children that don't have these skills are people with certain

321
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,190
developmental or medical conditions and that those people want to be seen as persons.

322
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:21,340
So then our views on personhood is that this might be occurring before viability begins.

323
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,320
And so we focus a lot on viability as well as like a 15 week abortion.

324
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:34,240
And in stating that if you had an abortion at 13 point or after that, you are essentially crushing and tearing.

325
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:42,350
Yes. With surgical tools. And then lastly, that abortion is not in the Constitution and therefore, we do not believe that it should be the law.

326
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:54,900
And it's also not protected by the 14th Amendment as originally in 1868, three fourths of the state deemed abortion as a crime.

327
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,450
So therefore, again, I'm calling upon the 14th Amendment.

328
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,660
Is it feasible argument? Nicely done.

329
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,140
That is the core of the decision. Roe was badly decided. There's no historical precedent for it.

330
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,680
You can't invent rights merely by having them for 50 or 70 years.

331
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:20,019
And abortion is infanticide because there's no clear way to decide when it goes from being a fetus to an infant.

332
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:26,380
Therefore, you treat the fetus as an infant. Could you pass it back to your colleague, Clarence Thomas, who thinks that was a little bit wishy washy?

333
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:35,290
So what Thomas is supposed to say in concurrence is that they agree with the

334
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:41,349
majority opinion that Roe v Wade was wrongly decided due to the 14th Amendment,

335
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:51,100
not specifically stating her privacy. You want to talk about the other three cases that are decided based on her right to privacy and say that those

336
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:57,700
need to be overturned because we're saying the right to privacy is not exclusively mentioned in the Constitution.

337
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:06,160
That's not to say that they could be civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution was amended, just not by her privacy.

338
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:12,100
So they kind of stay on the fence a little bit about whether or not those could continue to be rights that are protected.

339
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:20,509
Just definitely not virus privacy. Ladies and gentlemen,

340
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:25,280
you have just heard the only Supreme Court justice who regularly cites Malcolm X as an important

341
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,690
source of his thinking explains the 14th Amendment in substance and due process of law.

342
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:34,459
We decided to write It is right.

343
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:41,180
Kavanaugh has to bring to this and crisis for saying here and here.

344
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:53,780
So I got my sense stems from an inclusion that the Constitution is abortion neutral that is neither a pro-life document nor a pro-choice document,

345
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,800
and that Roe should be served as decisis,

346
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,630
as it relates to Roe, should not be rushed,

347
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:09,890
does actually be overturned because it's distorted this neutrality of the Constitution and the role of the Supreme Court in deciding all of this.

348
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:17,420
He quickly mentions other problems that arise from this decision and states that essentially sizing states

349
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:24,170
on things like interstate travel or where you can ban somebody from seeking an abortion across the bridge.

350
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:33,200
And as far as instructions to future litigants, I think it's clear that he does not want this issue,

351
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,410
whether abortion should be a right to be decided in the Supreme Court ever again,

352
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:47,750
because he says that the Constitution just doesn't apply to this issue, as you know, as is.

353
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:55,440
You guys want to add on to that? Yeah.

354
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:04,760
Know, I think. If you just want to say no, because, you know, I think what Romney said was right.

355
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:13,720
I have the. I basically would like because it's not a quiet decisions of the constitution

356
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:20,180
says nothing about this even though like in one of the public rooms like.

357
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:31,130
The Constitution wrote nothing about this. But we can also apply the First Amendment to the Internet because of unforeseen circumstances.

358
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:34,120
So there's a lot of people to be talking about.

359
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:43,069
And also, even though the Constitution says nothing about abortion, we can apply this stuff to cars and use the Internet.

360
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:47,780
So. Yeah, exactly right.

361
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:54,500
The people are you talking about? There's like a couple parts in there that I think might be very important talking about,

362
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,570
you know, is there an ability for people to travel across the border and having abortion legal?

363
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:04,910
And he says it might be the answer is no based on these things. So maybe that's setting up for what people should be looking at.

364
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:11,540
So this is very different. And the point people work on all of the cases because someone has been picked out,

365
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:15,800
he's got the problem and he just says, we're going to use maybe the 18th century technology.

366
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:28,070
He's going to have a state of the art 18th century technology here, like literally press onto my teaching and look for the bread crumbs.

367
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:33,470
Because Camelot is in many ways the most interesting decision. From a technical point of view, they're all agreed for insofar.

368
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:40,399
But we have a controlling decision with the abortion that Roe v Wade was bad because the Constitution doesn't give any

369
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,880
grounds and because one way is incoherent decision to believe a decision reads like a lawsuit that really happens.

370
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,549
Then you have Thomas saying the problem is that some kind of due process doesn't exist

371
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:58,890
and there is the right to privacy and none of you understand the 14th Amendment. So the controlling involvement, which you might entail right on it.

372
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,230
I think there's a lot of evidence in that that Alito Thomas.

373
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,560
Kavanaugh wants to go in a different direction and just never talk about abortion again and

374
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:11,020
let the states democratically decide what the will of people have to say about the matters.

375
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,980
But I've realized that he's opened up the entire everything to do with federalism.

376
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,870
And Missouri is still for the state police on the bridge to see it when it crosses the border.

377
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:26,350
Needed it. Now, think about the person that was over there asking what question?

378
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,170
So what do we do about it?

379
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:44,340
I think in his right to sell law, that he kept issuing a federal judge's policy possible so that we all realize the request is from the future.

380
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,469
He's never like I was, just because that he addresses that.

381
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,430
And it's like,

382
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:58,990
you know typically there's you have to have has to be grizzly to remains overturning precedent and makes a big case for why it remains free.

383
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,720
There is a case arguably the the point of this in part is he's got a theory about federalism and democracy

384
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:09,040
and also that he's doing something to cover himself so he won't be caught for having done that.

385
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,500
All future lawsuits. Because remember the personal status of the person writing it is ours.

386
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,920
Okay. One more concurrence. Respectable.

387
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,960
Everybody agreeing, except not agreeing. Wow.

388
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:29,900
So we had Roberts. And he remains an initial, which was a problem for most people.

389
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:38,330
He doesn't necessarily want Roe to be overturned, but he does want to leave it up to the states.

390
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:46,460
I think he's pretty much like the Supreme Court doesn't shouldn't have a say in this that's not obliged to make a decision.

391
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,330
He does have quite a few pages where he is upset with or he takes issue with viability.

392
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:03,960
But again, it really an the issue of viability up to the states and yeah, just for presidential time.

393
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:11,920
The reason we're throwing this thing around is not that I don't think I can yield on benefits that people do a lot of.

394
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,120
So now we have the full range of views. Okay, so here we are.

395
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:20,900
Cavanagh basically says leave it to the States and starts mapping out what a completely statewide

396
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,910
abortion regulation regime would look like and is quietly trying to dance away from broader,

397
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:32,569
substantive due process and so forth. Roberts is calling for the Supreme Court to have done what it is doing for the previous 20 years,

398
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:40,040
which is simply temporal legal precedent that doesn't actually apply. And agreeing that viability is the weak spot of ROE, which is.

399
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:48,639
Well, everybody on that side seems to be free of liability. So we had a lively conversation in the dominant political block of the Supreme Court.

400
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,820
And I hope you all enjoyed the definition of what the American constitutional law

401
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,380
currently is and the future of reproductive privacy and substantive due process rights.

402
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,480
Does anybody want to hear from the Alabama Voice? Yeah.

403
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:06,560
Okay. So for one, this design is very concerned.

404
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:15,670
And so if you haven't heard it, I have the sense that they so they think about a lot of things, but that's sort of crux of their dissent,

405
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:24,700
is that basically they're going to overturn Roe, then they have to essentially overturn all these other decisions like gay marriage, etc., etc.

406
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:33,009
And so in terms of what the instructions to future litigants are, I mean, it seems like there's a little bit of a challenge of like,

407
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:37,149
okay, well, someone bring forward a construction case and let's see what happens.

408
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:46,420
And this this decision that happened before and actually I like challenging stuff like what actually is the decision that you're making at this time

409
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:56,080
just makes it clear that the majority doesn't really and so it's not actually actually standing on much other than basically what promised the same.

410
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:06,189
And then but then in terms of thinking about they talk a lot about women's rights and how a lot of what the majority opinion is based on is like this,

411
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:11,290
you know, 1868 law when women had no rights anyway.

412
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:18,940
And so the instructions seem to say, okay, well, someone could bring a case for a woman.

413
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:26,650
This court would saying, you know, my personal liberties are being challenged here.

414
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:35,179
And of course questions about intentionality as you women throughout as the

415
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:41,790
language and really identifying or talking about other individual capacity.

416
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:48,830
And if that's just based on the historical underpinnings of all of this and trying

417
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:54,650
to make sure that it's in line with what they're referencing for and others.

418
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:00,480
I think that's a great question. I'm glad you just volunteered to answer it.

419
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:06,440
I feel like they're trying to now kind of open Canada off the table.

420
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,050
If they had to use the phrase pregnant people throughout.

421
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:16,830
You would have had a whole slew of articles from Bryant Bar and Newsweek and the Heritage Foundation and

422
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:23,790
the Federalist Society talking about these like crazy liberal countries who don't understand reality,

423
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:32,090
like and want to take, I think, a lot of negative focus away from the actual issue account, which is people in general, right?

424
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,720
Reproductive decision making,

425
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:43,780
bring themselves and make it into a conversation about gender identity that doesn't really serve the issue undergirding their dissent.

426
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,339
I think you're probably right.

427
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:55,740
And every single 100% of issues to do with trans rights are grounded in the right to privacy and substantive due process and the 14th Amendment.

428
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,950
I want to call out something that I'm glad to noticed,

429
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:05,610
which is the originalist argument is premised on the idea that this is something that was in the dissent we create over here.

430
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:10,100
The originalism is premised on the idea that you should interpret the Constitution in line

431
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,900
with the intent of the people who wrote the provision of work study when you couldn't vote.

432
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:21,829
So in a sense, part of the argument here is that you're validating a very,

433
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:27,920
very structurally sexist policy because you're saying we're going to focus on the original intent of an America

434
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,900
that excluded the people who in many ways have maybe the most direct concerns with what we're talking about.

435
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,850
So you noticed that despite all the originalists scholarship, 50 pages or whatever it is,

436
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,710
the state laws in the 19th century somehow didn't mention the structural bias.

437
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:51,030
We all see the Voting Rights Act, by the way. But Voting Rights Act cases are much more likely to be premised on the empirical

438
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:55,670
assertion that racism is going to push the empirical question for the study.

439
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:04,579
So I think also that as such, in many ways, if you feel like they were messaging to future litigants and courts,

440
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,180
or do you think they were messaging to somebody else?

441
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:18,790
I know that there were more messages into your record with a different court make up both regarding religion and the legitimacy of the court.

442
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:27,020
And that just came into court to make it clear political party that isn't going to happen in the public as well as that.

443
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:33,490
Like if we're just making decisions based off of your individual preference, basically this is a way to tell a couple people,

444
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:38,640
probably a their work and then bring the faith back again so we can go back to where it was before.

445
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:48,520
Not. And also we have the Senate leader is much more in a much more reasonable way than the rest of the documents.

446
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:54,110
I do think that it was written to the public sort of of why we should trust the court, basically.

447
00:57:55,970 --> 00:58:00,650
In other words, they wanted but in the same way that the timetable on the arguing,

448
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:04,100
the 14th Amendment history from the bench was a way of speaking to the public.

449
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:13,710
And we fully accept most of the public is more interested in the. But the public matters is a very small slice of the NFL of of the telegraph.

450
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:18,620
The public is a very small slice of the population. So let's tell the question back.

451
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:27,260
Why didn't we have one? Document that was very readable and a bunch of other documents that I guess we could say were not quite so much fun.

452
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:36,350
Why do we have to stamp out the ones like it's really quite beautifully written essay and the rest of them.

453
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,020
And they have the ability to find good writers. Okay.

454
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:43,969
If the writing comes off as very legal, it's that was the decision to make the writing very reasonable.

455
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:49,440
A technique, not a failure to master English prose. So why do we think it better?

456
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,390
It's harder for the general public to feel like they're not spending time to contemplate that.

457
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:11,010
Generally speaking, I think it will be the dissent and why long conservatives want the general public to read it because they'll see the holes in it.

458
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:16,709
Well, let's look at and I think if I were one of them,

459
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:21,270
I would say my decision is necessarily going to be criticized by behalf of the American public that

460
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:25,330
thinks that there's a right to substantive due process process which leads to the right to say.

461
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:31,270
However, and I understand half of the public here nonetheless respect the majesty of the court in its

462
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,959
efforts to interpret the law in respect of the original intent of the people who read the law,

463
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,800
as well as the quality of legal decision making on serious issues like substantive due process and the

464
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,660
extent to which we have already thought through the various implications of getting rid of rule versus way,

465
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,220
replacing it with a treaty.

466
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:55,800
Roberts is on a different agenda where he's kind of people would say, wait a minute, how in the [INAUDIBLE] did I lose control of this entire project?

467
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:01,280
Why am I off dragging contracts with a decision I that. That's all right.

468
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:09,379
So cloaking it in a difficult constitutional language is actually not a stupid idea if what you're trying to do is because of the course.

469
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:15,560
And I think it's not an accident that since the leak investigation into the leak is Peter Hatch.

470
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:23,570
I think you can infer from that. But since the leak and all the blowback, all the concern has been going on,

471
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:29,960
making speeches about how people are politicizing the courts and dragging it into party politics and losing respect for the law.

472
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:35,380
And it's a really bad thing that the courts get as far as the criticism. I think that's very common sense.

473
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:41,170
They won and now they're going to worry about their legitimacy, partly because as we discussed last time,

474
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,680
we're heading into a [INAUDIBLE] of a lot of cases and perhaps most of the child welfare,

475
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,920
which is not whether or not the government takes over or not. I think it was impatience.

476
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:53,400
Like I can't even remember the number of big issues. Okay.

477
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,220
Miss Alison, so productive and fun that I skipped the anniversaries.

478
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,620
So I like to talk about tax breaks for a couple of minutes. Or did anyone actually read a brief and really love it?

479
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,630
I'm like, Oh, yes, you need to buy it.

480
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:21,570
So I rented the one that was 240 women scholars and professionals and probably feminists organizations.

481
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,180
And so they talk a lot about how equality was not reached on abortion.

482
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:35,340
Can we go on and talk about how it actually has made women more depressed and regretted the decision not to grow their families more?

483
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:43,139
I think the thing that really made my life real throughout it is from there in a position of power,

484
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:48,920
position where they have a lot of opportunities given to them just based on who they are as professionals and scholars.

485
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:55,350
And a lot of people that are impacted by abortion restrictions are people of color and people in low income.

486
01:01:55,350 --> 01:02:00,960
They don't have a lot of those type of access to support and things like that.

487
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,730
I'll confess, I did not read all of the anarchist reads, but this sounds like this all sounds like a radical change is right.

488
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:14,610
And the theme I like to pull out is that, for example, Roberts has explicitly said he doesn't believe statistics,

489
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:19,079
but the and this breaks the weight of the facts into the conversation and basically

490
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,130
sets the people for good governance rights for all the classes you're working on.

491
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:30,150
And we could be documented probably anywhere from biosensors.

492
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:36,670
But notice how what they're doing there, they're invoking a line of quote unquote research.

493
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:41,190
Now, the research showing that abortion makes women depressed is like 100% spurious.

494
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:42,450
One of my problems.

495
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:51,900
There's research equally example different rates of abuse, abortion among sort of people of fancy colors and so forth, which can get targeted.

496
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:58,370
And I think this is genocide that's pretty powerful. But notice how on one hand, the court doesn't like social science research for two reasons.

497
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:04,790
One is might get the wrong answer. And the other is that it involves things like statistics to make this very uncomfortable.

498
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:12,229
Like, I just don't like statistics, cases and other factors and have sort of I have to make a decision about one person and a

499
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,580
social scientist tell me that there's a 60% chance of X is actually not helpful to my role.

500
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:24,969
But unless this quote unquote research filters in because they get out of this brief segment and maybe they get cited,

501
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:28,240
and real glory in this business is to get sizes out of this brief.

502
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:33,880
So how do you reach these sites in an actual position? Because that is how you go back and recruit you.

503
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:38,080
It wants to the day, even if what you're doing is you're getting cited in the footnotes in the dissent,

504
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,160
saying that the story obviously presented in the majority opinion is part of what.

505
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:49,010
So that's actually a really great choice of analysis breed and what else they're bringing to share.

506
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,900
So here's the formula for good out of this for you. First of all, you probably want to do on off your own time, right?

507
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:02,820
This is something that gets done in Washington. So I've been on hiatus. And what happens is that there's a pretty established set of networks on it.

508
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:08,440
And although, you know, what is a basic case on one of these issues coming up,

509
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:14,260
we basically get a nasty e-mail and we don't get to wordsmith the text because I know far

510
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,800
less about how to wordsmith analysis brief than somebody who's written dozens of things.

511
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,470
And you basically say, do I sign on to this?

512
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:26,270
You don't get asked just because our e-mail list, the e-mail list is one that is constructed of people who are actually going to be relevant.

513
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,010
Right. So I don't get to sign on to my blog history because what do I know my history?

514
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:33,750
I get to sign on all the policy and procedures at that time.

515
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:38,360
Right? So I'm like, I'm definitely all on the one side,

516
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,390
but I'm not on the voting rights laws because I don't do anything that would be professionally relevant.

517
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,420
This means, in a sense that you can do it with an e-mail list,

518
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:52,320
but you probably need an organization that we definitely need is somebody who is kind of into the culture of constitutional law.

519
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:59,559
I have to be the original words. So the upshot of that is Joyner support them like a lot of lobbying,

520
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:04,090
probably not wise to just start off on your loss and get on the bus to Washington and start writing brief.

521
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:13,159
But be aware this is how information gets in. I to bet that even if that particular brief doesn't get cited, if we went through this detail,

522
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:19,520
we would probably find references to briefs showing what should research about the effect of abortion on women in several of these decisions.

523
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:26,080
And by the way, one of the subtext to this is that part of the incentive to produce really bad research, right?

524
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:32,810
So we had these sex ed cases showing sexual education despite arguments in sexual education led to promiscuity.

525
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,479
Most of the based on Heritage Foundation research,

526
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,510
we had a huge breakthrough in which they learned that the same things of significance 2.1 can actually have a lot more findings.

527
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:46,710
So it sort of controls sort of significance at point one.

528
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,790
And you can then, quote unquote, show that sex ed produces promiscuity.

529
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,440
And then maybe you got into an office brief and 70% to the caucus.

530
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:00,820
Somebody had a really good annual report to their boss. Thanks a lot.

531
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:06,810
Thank you.
