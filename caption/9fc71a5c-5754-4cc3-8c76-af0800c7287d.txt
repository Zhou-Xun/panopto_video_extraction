1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:16,749
And I'm going to pull up our slides for today. Okay.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:23,680
Because I want to make sure we stay on time. I'm going to go we're going to talk about that Jay Penn article.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,990
So this is the journal Parental and Enteral Nutrition. We don't get parental and enteral nutrition until next semester.

4
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,440
Part of that semester will be front loaded and 92 nutrition support.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:48,159
But these are kind of the societies or organizations that do a lot of research in writing on malnutrition because

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,040
it's kind of intimately linked with more severe patients that often require parental parental nutrition.

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:02,019
So that's why we will see a lot of these malnutrition recommendations or criteria come out of either Japan or Aspen,

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,200
which is the American Society for Parenteral Nutrition.

9
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:13,330
So I'm not going to spend too much time with this like you see me go through this, but I'll kind of we've gone through a lot of this,

10
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,360
so we'll talk about this article, but then we'll get into the the malnutrition diagnosis.

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:31,300
So if you can open up that question, medicine, malnutrition, diagnostic criteria, the newest one that I posted last, we just have that.

12
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,340
But for now, hopefully you all read this article last week.

13
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,940
Why did this article come about or why did they even come up with this consensus statement?

14
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:52,180
We talked about this. We know malnutrition is a major contributor to increased morbidity and mortality in our hospitalized patients and beyond.

15
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:59,290
It's associated with decreased function and quality of life. A lot of that is due to like the loss of lean body mass.

16
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,559
We see increased frequency of length of stay in the hospital and that always is going

17
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,220
to lead to higher health care costs if people are continually being readmitted,

18
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,450
even, you know, two days longer than in in addition to the normal length of stay is quite costly.

19
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,900
It's very common in hospitalized patients. We know that. We saw the difference in a lot of those prevalence rates.

20
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,850
But it often goes unrecognized. Okay.

21
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,010
So this is like this is years ago that they came out with this because we had no established criteria to identify malnutrition.

22
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,480
So there was no single, universally accepted approach to the diagnosis and documentation of adult malnutrition.

23
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,829
In this article, references that we've had, prevalence estimates range from 15 to 60%,

24
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,970
depending on the patient population and depending on the criteria used.

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,079
Many were not evidence based. So this was a huge problem.

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:05,030
We didn't have a standardized way to identify and diagnose patients with malnutrition, even though it's a very common problem.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,810
Did anyone pick up what concern was brought about by CMS?

28
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,559
So this is the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services.

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,630
So this is a big player in how things get filled during a hospitalization or during health care.

30
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,800
I think some of what they brought up. Yes. The inappropriate use of malnutrition and the variation.

31
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,000
Area. But the same demographic.

32
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,440
Yes, exactly. So this is like our major billers they're getting.

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,690
They get these diagnostic codes sent to them that they have to then decide if they're going to pay for it.

34
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:52,590
And they notice inappropriate use of certain malnutrition codes and the wide variation

35
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,670
in the prevalence or incidence of malnutrition within the same geographic region.

36
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,280
So populations with similar demographics having wildly different prevalence rates

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,360
and different uses of codes that probably didn't pertain to that population.

38
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,930
That's probably a lot of those kwashiorkor poor codes being built for where we know that that's

39
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,920
really not likely what's happening and in the more developed world with our adult population.

40
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:27,509
So this was a big concern. We're getting billed for these things that are wildly different depending on, you know,

41
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,980
in the similar populations and expect to see a little bit more consistency there.

42
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,510
Okay. We've talked about acute phase proteins or A.N. We will get into those in a couple of weeks when we talk about lab markers.

43
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,679
So the authors, what did they think about the inclusion of a cute face?

44
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,970
Protein markers in the diagnosis criteria for malnutrition?

45
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah. It's limited use as an indicator of malnutrition.

46
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,680
It may not respond to like nutrition interventions. Right.

47
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:10,000
So do they think we should use be able to use like someone's albumin or pre albumin as part of our criteria?

48
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:20,920
No. Right. And we when I first started as a clinical dietitian, we could use a pre albumin as one of our two criteria and see how things have changed.

49
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:27,090
I mean, that was a long time ago, but no, it is not recommended and we'll spend even more time on this and talked about it.

50
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,159
Remember, these are negative acute phase reactants, the acute phase being an inflammatory response.

51
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,650
So if there's inflammation, which a lot of our patients with chronic disease have inflammation going on,

52
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,550
the negative acute phase proteins will be decreased.

53
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:52,600
So somebody may come in well-nourished, but maybe they're having maybe they have cancer or some underlying inflammatory condition

54
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,980
and their pre albumin will be low because of the underlying inflammatory process.

55
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,070
So acute phase proteins do not consistently or predictably change with weight loss.

56
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:10,720
Calorie restriction or nitrogen balance. And they better reflect the severity of the inflammatory response rather than poor nutritional status.

57
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,010
We'll get to this because doctors still use these.

58
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,470
So you'll get a consult, dietician consult.

59
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,969
Low albumin. Okay. Yeah, it would still happen.

60
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,800
So we want to make sure that we,

61
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:34,000
we know the utility of these acute phase proteins and they're really not going to be warranted for most of our patients.

62
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:44,590
Okay. So what is meant by the statement that current approaches or protocols have for specificity, sensitivity and inter observer reliability?

63
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,159
This should kind of go back to your AP classes.

64
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,580
You guys probably you're all student, so you've had a little bit of epi, right?

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,410
So at this point, when this article was written, current approaches were not good at detecting malnutrition when it is present.

66
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,649
So they're not highly sensitive. They're not good at determining someone is not malnourished when they truly are not.

67
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,660
So they're not super specific and they weren't consistent between practitioners.

68
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,140
So it's like we do a case scenario in a little bit.

69
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,340
Maybe half of us would have that. This patient is diagnosed with malnutrition and half would not.

70
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,530
That still can happen.

71
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:34,779
There's going to be situations where and we used to do grand rounds in the hospital and just among dietitians and present a case.

72
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,700
And then we would decide if they were malnourished and we would still have some differences of opinion there.

73
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:51,070
So it's not like always set in stone. But previous approaches were really not sensitive, not specific and really inconsistent between practitioners.

74
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,160
Okay. Some important, important attributes to consider when they produce this diagnostic criteria.

75
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,580
They wanted them to be very few in number.

76
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:09,900
So just kind of the basic hallmarks support a nutrition diagnosis will get into nutrition diagnoses a little bit later.

77
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:19,500
We do want to characterize severity if possible. That's why we have like the moderate and severe category categorization.

78
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:30,590
It needs to be kind of flexible. So change as nutrition status changes the evidence base when possible or at least consensus driven.

79
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:37,040
And it may change over time so that the the definition and criterias have changed over time.

80
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:48,349
They continue to evolve. So the criteria that they decided on in this article were insufficient energy intake, weight loss, loss of muscle,

81
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,460
mass, loss of subcutaneous fat, diminished functional status as measured by a handgrip grip strength.

82
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,350
Okay, so these are, I'd say pretty few a number, right?

83
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:08,030
We don't want to have a ton of criteria. We want to keep it just kind of to the basic hallmarks, which I think this does a good job of.

84
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:18,050
Okay. What do they mean when they said they want to have continuous rather than discrete variables?

85
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:29,530
Point two decimal points. Yeah. So think about what's take weight loss.

86
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,750
What would be like if you had a question about if you're asking somebody about weight loss, what would be a discrete response?

87
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,610
Yes, sir. Like volume specific categories will continue as allows for getting us closer to the specific diagnosis.

88
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,209
Whereas like you're not just getting specific, I don't know why you are.

89
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,230
I think you're what you're getting at. So like if we ask someone, have you lost weight?

90
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:01,080
Yes. No, that's discreet, right? Kind of departments is that is helpful.

91
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,730
But is that specific or measurable, really? No. No.

92
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,090
So we do want to be get something that's measurable.

93
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,840
We also want to establish a timeframe as well. So measurable numbers instead of a simple yes or no.

94
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,819
So we don't just ask, have you lost weight? We may ask that, but then we're going to dig a little deeper to get some specifics.

95
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,870
So we assess percent of weight loss over a specific period of time.

96
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,549
So we're always going to be after that level of information,

97
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,510
what percentage of weight to the person lose and over what period of time and we'll practices quite a bit this semester.

98
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,300
Yeah. In terms of language we talk about.

99
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:59,389
Greater than two standard deviation below and like compared to like how where do they get that something like let's say we did do

100
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:07,610
handgrip strength it's two standard deviations below the mean would be that they derive like the mean from the general population.

101
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,829
So the same they should probably not.

102
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,220
It would be like healthy adults and they would have a continuum.

103
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,860
So that's why it would be like to see any deviation. Oh, so you're well outside of what we would expect.

104
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,680
Um, so that that that's good. I mean, that's a valid tool to, to measure.

105
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,280
Like functional loss and muscle loss, but we are going to be doing that.

106
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,750
Okay. You might you may I mean, depending on where you go or if it's more of a research setting.

107
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:49,670
I've never done that in the hospital setting. But yeah, when anything refers to like a mean, it's usually derived from a bigger population.

108
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,829
But we'll talk about sometimes it's not the population that a lot of these

109
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,240
standards are derived from may not reflect the population you're working with.

110
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,139
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we have these clinical characteristics.

111
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,690
You guys have seen the Michigan medicine criteria. What do you think of these?

112
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,510
Is there anything you would add, remove or change if you're looking at how we would diagnose malnutrition?

113
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,630
Anything you're surprised is on their or it's not on their.

114
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,100
Yeah. I feel like you don't really.

115
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:41,090
Right? Yeah. The Handgrip strength is definitely a valid tool, but we wouldn't use it really.

116
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,360
So that that's a good point. Yeah.

117
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:55,930
What I. Yeah.

118
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:05,590
So that's a good point. So there are things that, you know, involves looking at the patient, patient doing more of a visual assessment.

119
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,760
So which can be subjective.

120
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Speaking of which. Next Tuesday.

121
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,450
So next week, Tuesday actually is an asynchronous class. You just will do that on your own.

122
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,000
We don't meet in person and it's talking about nutrition screening.

123
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,970
The reason I change it to be surprise is because it's really just content delivery.

124
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,500
It doesn't generate a lot of discussion. So I think you could do it just fine.

125
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,060
And we do watch a video, so you'll watch a video called A Subjective Global Assessment,

126
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,489
which is exactly what you're getting at with the visualization of our patients.

127
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:52,270
It will talk to you and guide you how to visually look at a patient for fat loss,

128
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,680
where we're going to look and where we're going to look on a patient for signs of muscle loss.

129
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,380
So there are standards for that. So that helps, but it's still subjective.

130
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:18,290
Yes. Fluid accumulation alone or in addition to one of these, would it be specific to malnutrition?

131
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:27,380
It's more clinically. Something is going wrong that you're maybe retaining some fluid and people that are malnourished can definitely retain fluid.

132
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,110
That will be part of your subjective global assessment, though, next week that you'll watch.

133
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Okay. What is. What about BMI? So we have the BMI criteria in the severe malnutrition.

134
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,780
What do you guys think about including that? Less than 18.5.

135
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,229
Right. That would be you'd have to have something else in addition to that.

136
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:57,320
Yes. But what do you think? It's probably the one that.

137
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:07,420
It's it's tough. I think the fact that we have to have another criteria outside of that helps.

138
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:14,469
And it's only for this year, I think we're going to get more away from using BMI just in general.

139
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,000
But we still now we use it and we documented in all of our our notes.

140
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,370
I'm wondering if that will eventually change. Yes. Using the.

141
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:47,570
Yes. So the BMI is less than 18.5, would be specific to very thin individuals.

142
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:54,170
So you could capture them like let's say you had a patient with a BMI of 17 and they also have

143
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,840
had a certain percentage of weight loss that person would meet criteria for malnutrition.

144
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,270
What that won't capture is our patients at a normal BMI.

145
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,920
That's why we have all those other criteria.

146
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:17,060
So I'd say we very rarely use the BMI as one of the criteria because it's only going to be specific to a very thin population.

147
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,410
But they also have had to have something else in that in that paper.

148
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,840
Okay. And that kind of goes to why do we have two criteria that are necessary?

149
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,940
A lot of patients come in. They are not eating well. They're in the hospital because they're not feeling well.

150
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:41,270
So they probably weren't eating great. So just because they haven't eaten well over the last week alone, that doesn't make them malnourished.

151
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:48,040
So it has to be okay. We've had really poor intakes for the last two weeks and I've lost this amount of weight or, you know,

152
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:56,330
so we have to have two criteria because a lot of these things on our diagnostic criteria can be occurring in patients that are sick.

153
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:05,210
But when we have the two and it kind of fits that picture, that has been proven to really help identify those that are malnourished.

154
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,999
Okay. So I think, how are we doing? We're doing pretty good.

155
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,770
So we're going to cruise ahead and practice a little bit of this.

156
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,310
So have this out or at least pulled up if you can.

157
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,140
I'm going to do a couple case scenarios together.

158
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:35,070
Okay. So this is our first case. We have a 49 year old male with a significant history of hypertension,

159
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:41,550
diabetes mellitus and stage five chronic kidney disease currently on intermittent hemodialysis.

160
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,790
So a lot of this is just the medical background. Don't worry if you're not comfortable with some of this language up here.

161
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,970
So this patient is admitted with Gastroparesis.

162
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:57,150
So this is just delayed, stomach emptying. We'll talk about Gastroparesis later in the semester.

163
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,740
It's not responsive to the medication that we usually use to help for that.

164
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,940
And he's come in for consideration of a J to placement.

165
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,060
So a feeding tube that's placed into the small bowel.

166
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,110
So we would put it there if they're having gastroparesis to bypass the stomach.

167
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,470
If they're not emptying on the stomach, we're going to be below it.

168
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,980
So the patient has had a poor appetite and an inability to tolerate food.

169
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,820
He reports nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating and discomfort after eating.

170
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,630
He's his intake is described as bites of meals.

171
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,200
He's estimating about a quarter of his usual intake.

172
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,640
And this has resulted in a £100 weight loss over the past year.

173
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:52,170
So the patient hasn't tried any specific diet to help control his gastroparesis, but just he's not really able to tolerate most foods.

174
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,030
So we don't really have a time frame other than the weight loss.

175
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,620
But in terms of how long has he not been eating? Well, we're not sure.

176
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,200
So this would be like an example of how it's set up our our chart now.

177
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,860
Again, next week, you'll you'll watch a video on what to look for on a patient to assess for muscle wasting.

178
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,240
But he has temporal hollowing and depression noted and physical exam.

179
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:24,629
So you go in we do want to look at our patients so tempo this is the temporal muscle

180
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:32,400
here when this is kind of sunk in or how long that can be a sign of some wasting,

181
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,170
which I'll let you wait till next week to determine if it's sudden muscle loss or fat loss.

182
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,250
So here's his anthropometric information. I'll do the calculations for us just for for time purposes.

183
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,330
We'll go through all this practice on these calculations in a couple of weeks.

184
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,580
But this is his ideal body weight, 80.9 kilograms.

185
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,559
It's usual body weight is 120.9 kilograms.

186
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:09,170
That's a year ago. And this is his current weight. So he's had about a 34% weight loss over the past year.

187
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:19,030
This BMI is 23.7. So pull out your sheet based on this information.

188
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:26,050
Let's take about 5 minutes and decide if we think this patient is malnourished.

189
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,940
I'll go back to this information and then you can only slide back and look at his the history he presented with us.

190
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:54,800
Severe Stage five. Chronic kidney disease is a point where you would need dialysis as soon as possible.

191
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,780
Yes, it's a part that's kind of in stage stuff.

192
00:23:01,000 --> 00:24:15,860
One more minute on this one. Okay.

193
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,160
What do we think? Is this patient malnourished? Yes.

194
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,260
Okay. I agree. Do we think it's moderate or severe?

195
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,700
Severe. Severe. This one's not easy, but pretty straightforward.

196
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,450
Right. So this is an example of a nutrition diagnosis.

197
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,590
We'll get into this later. Malnutrition.

198
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,710
They were severely malnourished. What is causing it?

199
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,149
It's related to its altered GI function. Gastroparesis.

200
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,270
Other things are contributing, are evident.

201
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:54,560
So we have to have our two criteria, right? So I would say the two criteria are the 34% weight loss that he's in a year.

202
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,979
And we don't really have this information from the case,

203
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:06,260
but we could maybe guess or gather the information that it's been at least a month with him consuming less than 50% of his usual intake.

204
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,990
We also have some physical muscle loss with the hollowing of the temporal muscles.

205
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,480
We actually have more than the two criteria. Did anybody else have other criteria for this patient?

206
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:28,590
Yes, the. Yes.

207
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,240
That if you have that information, I would include it.

208
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:39,799
So when we write diagnoses, practice writing diagnoses in a couple of weeks, whenever you have someone that meets criteria for malnutrition,

209
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,470
you have to diagnose that and you have to put your two criteria in your statement.

210
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:52,090
But if they have more, include them all. I think just because it's going to be more evidence of malnutrition.

211
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,270
Yes. Would you do a dietary inspection? Considering.

212
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,900
I mean, you can you can say, like, what's what's been like a typical day for you.

213
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,720
This pattern, you know, yesterday or this past week, you know, what's been your day.

214
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,850
And then you could say, how does it compare to what you usually do when you're feeling good or adequate baseline?

215
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:21,190
And then you'd say, Well, how long has this been going on that you've been eating this much so you can get those

216
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:27,400
measurable that measurable information and that time component that's really helpful.

217
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,389
So that all has to come from your nutrition assessment. So with these case studies, we don't have a lot of that information,

218
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:42,100
but it'll help you as a clinician that you want to gather specific information from from your patient whenever possible.

219
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:54,170
Yeah. You also have the kind of. So disease that it could be it's hard to say he is he is on dialysis.

220
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,800
So once a patient's on dialysis, they tend to feel a little bit better.

221
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,040
I mean, it's a it's a pain. They have to go in three times a week.

222
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,700
But they're that is working essentially as their kidney.

223
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,209
So some people that does have nutritional effects, which we'll get into more next semester.

224
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,950
But I'd say the more acute situation is this gastroparesis.

225
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,069
Can't keep down food because he's feeling really sick now.

226
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:25,200
The Gastroparesis is probably caused by his diabetes which led to his chronic kidney disease.

227
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,090
Like it's all linked.

228
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:38,890
But the current issue is really this this inability to tolerate food, which probably isn't directly related to the brain shrinkage and the brain.

229
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:48,590
That's what it shows, right? Yeah. So the the muscle nutrition it could be power that.

230
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,530
So that's what he does. Sure.

231
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,620
Yeah. Okay, let's do another one.

232
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:03,670
This time we have a 72 year old female. No real past medical history for us.

233
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,800
And she's admitted with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.

234
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:20,080
The plan is to initiate chemotherapy. So the patient reports, case changes, specifically that things have been taking off over the past 3 to 4 weeks.

235
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,820
She denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.

236
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,079
She does have some thrush noted in her history and physical exam.

237
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,910
So that's just some kind of can be ulcerations in the mouth and tongue area,

238
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,800
which you can imagine can maybe make things taste different or be a little bit difficult to eat.

239
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:50,110
So she said she's been eating a little less than usual over the past couple of weeks due to issues with food not tasting good.

240
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,630
She's noticed she's getting full on less food, so some early satiety.

241
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:02,340
She's still eating her meals. Only about 75% of them no longer finishing her plate.

242
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:09,240
She said she noticed that her clothes are fitting looser than normal, but does not know if she's lost weight because she doesn't wear herself.

243
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,400
So before I just want to go back to our our last patient.

244
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,340
So this patient is severely malnourished. Right. We've determined that.

245
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,370
But if we look at some things here, look at the ideal body weight.

246
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,120
It's very close to what his weight is.

247
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,780
So he's like right. Of this ideal body weight. Normal BMI.

248
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,400
Right. So how helpful are those markers?

249
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,710
Not really. He's kind of his right. It is your body weight is a normal BMI.

250
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:47,170
This patient is severely malnourished. So although those tools are helpful and they're part of our assessment,

251
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:53,990
we have lots of adult patients that are considered normal weight, overweight or obese, that are malnourished.

252
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:57,760
So just keep that in mind. Okay.

253
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,760
So here's our patient here.

254
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,450
So her admission weight is 60.5 kilograms.

255
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:13,870
So she's over her her ideal body weight. Here's her usual weight, 63.5 kilograms about four weeks ago.

256
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,700
So that's about a 5% weight loss over the last month.

257
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:27,850
And you can see that her BMI is 26.9. So we'll take about 3 minutes and see if we think this patient is malnourished.

258
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,070
All right. What do you guys think? Is this patient malnourished?

259
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,900
Yes. Okay. I agree. Is she moderately or severely malnourished, would you say?

260
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,900
Yeah, I would agree with that as well. Did anybody say not malnourished?

261
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,250
Not quite. It's okay if you did.

262
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,070
So this is how I'd write this patient.

263
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:33,340
And in malnutrition, moderate related to decreased all intake from taste, loss or alterations and early satiety.

264
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:40,759
So that's kind of the etiology there. We have evidence of a 5% weight loss over the past month and at least seven days

265
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:47,570
or greater than seven days with intake at or below 75% of our usual intake.

266
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,550
So that would be the kind of that definitely fits in that moderate criteria.

267
00:33:53,660 --> 00:34:02,739
Any other criteria that you guys have for her? Now.

268
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,950
What do you think we've identified? She's already moderately malnourished.

269
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,930
Today's day one of chemotherapy. What do you think's going to happen with her nutritional status?

270
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:17,409
Let's say if we didn't kind of flag her right away. Trump's probably going to continue growing not down.

271
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:23,410
Right? She's just diagnosed with this cancer. She's starting on chemotherapy, which has a lot of nutrition related side effects.

272
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,540
So that's just something to keep in mind.

273
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:32,740
Obviously, I do think she meets criteria for malnutrition and we want to probably monitor her pretty closely

274
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:39,070
because I would expect probably her nutritional status is going to decline from this starting point.

275
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:50,610
Okay. Let's do one more. Yes. So you just brought up the casinos and the customers and 75% travel cost.

276
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,290
So you're looking at what she's going to do next then?

277
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:02,100
Yeah. You see, I wouldn't use what you think is going to happen to like diagnosed it currently.

278
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,290
But I think based on the information we have, she does meet criteria right now.

279
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,780
Yeah, it's kind of like right after the cut, but it's still it's still there.

280
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,470
Yeah. If she doesn't have that, she also become. What would you say?

281
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,000
Same thing. It's her current state. She does meet criteria.

282
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:29,200
I would expect maybe, though, that her nutritional status will continue to decline if we don't monitor her closely.

283
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:36,070
Yes. We also know that she's had the. Yeah, maybe.

284
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:47,940
Often it's probably not specific enough to say that that's probably the evidence of the weight loss between then confirmed by her history.

285
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,560
But she wasn't able to tell us that we've got that previous weight under her chart.

286
00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:02,669
But if somebody tells you that, you might then, based on your subjective global assessment video next week, you'll kind of know where to look like.

287
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:11,280
There are certain areas of the body that have they have been proven to demonstrate either fat loss or muscle wasting.

288
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,270
You know, we can't just look at it. It's not anywhere. It's very specific part.

289
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:21,729
So if somebody is telling you that and they're in their down, you'd say, okay, can I just take a peek at your shoulders?

290
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,100
Do you mind if I look, you know,

291
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:34,320
there are some areas that don't involve too much showing up part the patient you can really assess it the in their gown but that that's a good point.

292
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,180
All right. Let's do this last one. So this is a six year old woman with a medical history significant for IBD.

293
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,790
That's inflammatory bowel disease. She's here for an acute exacerbation of her ulcerative colitis.

294
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:53,190
She's been experiencing worsening diarrhea and abdominal pain over the last seven days.

295
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,190
She's having bloody stools, which started two days ago, which prompted her to come to the emergency department.

296
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,010
Her CRP or C-reactive protein is markedly elevated upon arrival.

297
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,300
That's one of those positive acute phase proteins.

298
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,639
That's a kind of a marker of inflammation.

299
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,900
So sometimes they'll use that with patients with inflammatory bowel disease to see if they're in kind of a a flare and state.

300
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:25,680
So her CRP is up and she's also got the clinical evidence that her ulcerative colitis might be flaring.

301
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,490
She reports decreased intake over the last week, secondary to her worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea.

302
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,200
She's been trying to keep herself hydrated prior to the onset of her symptoms.

303
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,250
Her use, he was under good control. She was eating well.

304
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:50,190
But this past week, her intake has been about 75% of what she usually eats some days, maybe less, depending on the severity of her abdominal pain.

305
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:57,360
Okay. So you go and see her. She's been NPO for two days, so this is just nothing by mouth.

306
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:05,680
So she's been in the hospital and has had nothing for two days. Here's her admission weight 65.9 kilograms.

307
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,150
That was on February 1st.

308
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,690
So now her current weight is 64.6.

309
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:19,750
So she's been in the hospital maybe ten days. Here's her ideal body weight.

310
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:27,280
She's about 116% of her ideal body weight. And she's had about a 2% weight loss in the last 11 days.

311
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,510
So let's take we'll do like 2 minutes on this one, even though this one's a little bit more difficult.

312
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,410
Is this patient malnourished? So use the background we have in your criteria to to decide on this one.

313
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,700
Okay. I know there wasn't a lot of time on this one, but move along.

314
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:23,320
What do you guys think? Is she malnourished?

315
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,400
Yes. Did anybody think.

316
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,030
No, we don't really have good evidence of that yet.

317
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,770
Well, it's just like it says 1 to 2% in one week.

318
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,600
So I'm just assuming because 2% in 11 days, that would at least be 1%.

319
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,559
What do you guys think it doesn't like? I would agree with that.

320
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:55,170
That's what I want you guys to think about. Like our patients are not always going to fall perfectly into the criteria, percentages and whatnot.

321
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,440
So I think we do have a case that this patient is malnourished.

322
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:07,920
So I'd say moderate today really have severe, probably not a whole lot of evidence for severe malnutrition, but moderate malnutrition.

323
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,340
I think some of you if you didn't think she quite meant,

324
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:19,979
I think that would be fair to I bet we would get some dieticians if we presented this case that would say, you know, I'm not quite sure.

325
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:27,960
So malnutrition moderate or this is another example of a diagnosis inadequate oral intake related to ultra GI function.

326
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:36,250
She's had 2% weight loss in 11 days and she's report of consuming an average of 75% or less the last week.

327
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:45,950
So it's kind of like right on the cusp, but I would say you could kind of extrapolate that 2% in 11 days to kind of fit the criteria.

328
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,230
And based on everything else that's going on, inflammatory process,

329
00:41:49,590 --> 00:42:00,750
I think that the diagnosis would work better to some excess 0 to 2% in terms of her and to get 1.7, 1.3.

330
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,139
But within seven days you could.

331
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,970
I don't think you need to go that.

332
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:16,140
Yeah I but you know if this step helps you kind of process it a little bit better that she has diarrhea, she may have fluid loss.

333
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:23,760
Yeah, definitely. Some of that weight loss could be reflective of losses she hasn't eaten.

334
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,370
So it's not like a perfect measurement of weight is a very sensitive marker to pour into a fluid loss.

335
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:38,070
But given her whole clinical picture, I think we do have evidence there.

336
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,960
Yeah. Because she's had diarrhea for so long.

337
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,090
Is that not a. Like could it not be just assumed that obviously.

338
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,180
The nutrition is being absorbed. Yes.

339
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:06,490
So there could be like impaired nutrient utilization, which wouldn't be part of our criteria, but that would be probably related to the etiology.

340
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:12,899
Like she's having all these GI losses. She's probably not absorbing the nutrients she is taking in.

341
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,500
It's contributing to the malnutrition. Yeah. Okay.

342
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,900
Any questions on malnutrition?

343
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,940
We're going to go through this throughout the semester.

344
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:32,069
So I always kind of have that sheet handy, like when when we're practicing diagnosis or we're doing a case study, just have it there.

345
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:37,620
And if something kind of flagged, she's like, Oh, like this is starting to sound like this patient could be malnourished.

346
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,910
I want you to try and identify it. Yes.

347
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,150
What if a person is purposefully trying to lose weight?

348
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:57,420
Thank you. Yes. So baskets like they're kind of we'll do a session on like bariatric procedures like this, like intentional weight loss.

349
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,010
So that's going to take some clinical judgment.

350
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:08,420
If it's if it's intentional and it being done in kind of a healthy way.

351
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:14,219
Yes. A patient can be maybe losing too fast and potentially be malnourished.

352
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:21,870
But there's also if it's intentional and it's done in a healthy way, we would not capture that in a malnutrition diagnosis.

353
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,719
So that's a good question.

354
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,200
Like what if there somebody is on a weight management program, they're going to meet probably some of those weight loss criterias and intake criteria.

355
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:41,270
So that would be a situation where we probably would not want to capture that in a diagnosis because it's being done as kind of like a.

356
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,140
Almost like a prescribed maybe therapy for like an underlying chronic disease.

357
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:57,230
Questions. Okay. So let's switch gears south.

358
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,890
We're going to begin our discussion on repealing syndrome.

359
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:11,740
So we've talked about malnutrition, like starvation related malnutrition and talked about the metabolic stress related malnutrition.

360
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,390
So now we have our malnourished patient and we're ready to start giving them nutrition.

361
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:23,930
We have to be very careful when we do that and we'll talk about why and we'll get

362
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:28,249
into it in more specific detail and a little bit of interesting history on Thursday.

363
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:34,790
But I do want to introduce the clinical features of feeding syndrome to has everybody heard of ring feeding syndrome?

364
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:40,820
Okay. His have never heard of it. I wouldn't expect you to, but maybe.

365
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:50,629
Yeah. So this may be a new thing to think about, but if you think about somebody that's really emaciated,

366
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:56,120
very malnourished, we don't want to just give them a bunch of nutrition right away.

367
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,079
Right. We have to be very careful. And we're going to talk about why,

368
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:07,850
because there's a lot of physiological changes that happen in the body once we reintroduce nutrition, specifically carbohydrate.

369
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:14,090
So what I want you to be able to do after today, but also have to your readings,

370
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:20,329
is to construct that flowchart to illustrate the sequence of events that occurred during feeding syndrome.

371
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:28,070
So kind of like the main features, the pathophysiology that leads to the clinical signs and symptoms that we'll discuss today.

372
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:36,830
So this is a syndrome. We call it re feeding syndrome. What is that in comparison to like a disease or a disorder?

373
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:45,350
So just some background on definitions. A disease is a pathophysiological response to internal or external factors.

374
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:51,290
A disorder is a disruption to regular body, bodily structure and function.

375
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:57,680
And then a syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms associated with a specific health related cause.

376
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,650
So we talk about re feeding syndrome.

377
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:10,700
This is a constellation of metabolic disturbances that occur as a result of the reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are starved,

378
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,140
severely malnourished, are metabolically stressed due to severe illness.

379
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:25,390
Okay. Just some other quick definitions. If you see that referring to enteral nutrition.

380
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:29,420
So that's going to be the provision of nutrition into the GI tract.

381
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,460
So we're going to be feeding them and truly so somewhere in the GI tract,

382
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,220
it's either going to be in the stomach or the small bowel through a feeding tube.

383
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:48,430
Then we'll get into that next semester. But we sort of reference these things, whereas parenteral nutrition is going to be the person intravenously.

384
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:55,360
So we're not feeding the the GI tract. So that's bypassing the process of eating and digestion.

385
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,360
Okay. So just a quick review like we talked about on day one.

386
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:07,490
After prolonged starvation, muscle is going to be burned for energy.

387
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:17,209
We're going to have decreased lean body mass, decreased skeletal muscle, but also decreased cardiac and respiratory muscle mass.

388
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:22,160
So, you know, their actual organ muscle mass will decrease.

389
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,410
We see a decline in respiratory function and decreased cardiac output.

390
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:36,530
So prolonged periods without nutrition will also result in total body loss of electrolytes.

391
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:42,490
So we're not just losing muscle mass fat stores. We're going to deplete vitamin and mineral status as well.

392
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,960
So we're going to talk a lot about some specific electrolytes with re feeding syndrome.

393
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,940
So phosphorus, potassium and magnesium also touch on calcium.

394
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,590
And then vitamins in particular, we'll talk about thiamin.

395
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:05,830
Thiamin is an essential cofactor involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and it can be depleted very quickly.

396
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:13,210
Um, so why we touch on that is because of that involvement in the metabolism of carbohydrate.

397
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:19,430
Now we will see potential derangements in trace minerals, including selenium.

398
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:28,160
Selenium is a mineral that works as an antioxidant in the body, and it can help keep tissues healthy by preventing cell damage.

399
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,880
It's also important in the immune system.

400
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:45,100
Okay. So pathogenesis and clinical features of re feeding syndrome in our significantly or severely malnourished patients,

401
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:52,420
the initiation of either oral nutrition so somebody allowed to eat and full nutrition or parenteral

402
00:49:52,420 --> 00:50:00,850
nutrition causes an electrolyte and fluid shift that may precipitate disabling or worst case,

403
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,090
fatal medical complications. So it can be fatal.

404
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:12,070
That doesn't happen often because we're pretty good at identifying those that are going to be at risk for reheating and we can make those corrections.

405
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,770
But before we really knew what this was,

406
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:23,020
we would have some incidence of death occur if we had a malnourished patient who was then started on parenteral nutrition too quickly.

407
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:28,000
And you'll see that reference and I think in a couple of the articles,

408
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,050
but that wouldn't that would be the more severe outcome and that does not happen.

409
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,879
As much anymore. Okay.

410
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:44,100
So really, it's the reinstitution of nutrition into our malnourished patients that's going to cause significant electrolyte shifts.

411
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,460
Yes. Does malnutrition look different?

412
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,740
In other countries. Like would it be true? Would this be?

413
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,580
Could I go to another country with this information and treat.

414
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:57,590
The same.

415
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:10,669
So in terms of repeating, yeah, it would probably be very similar even if it was a different cause or form of malnutrition refitting syndrome,

416
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,390
that concept would still be applicable.

417
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:23,840
People have asked that before. So what about if you're going to like a country that's experiencing a famine and now we are providing all this food?

418
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:31,670
That would be something interesting to look into. Like, do they have protocols in place on how food is distributed?

419
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,879
I don't know. I mean, I think that that always kind of comes up.

420
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:43,850
And I think it'd be interesting to look at how potential re feeding is dealt with in other countries.

421
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:49,159
I will say oral intake.

422
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:55,760
So like a patient is healthy enough, let's say they're malnourished, they're able to do a diet and eat.

423
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:05,389
They tend to not have the re feeding response that we see when we institute petrol or parenteral nutrition like our patients with anorexia nervosa.

424
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:13,820
Let's say they get in for treatment. And we usually we have a plan that, you know, a nutrition plan like they have to eat so much.

425
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:21,940
They are at risk for refueling, but we don't really see it a lot or it's like pretty quick after like the first day or two,

426
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:25,510
we're able to get them back to like an unusual amount of intake.

427
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:30,670
So it is a little different. And I think that's maybe because the patients that are going to be on enteral or

428
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:34,659
even parenteral nutrition are just sicker and have so many other things going on,

429
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,900
like for feeding potentially that means we don't have a functional GI tract.

430
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:43,390
So and that's glucose and electrolytes right into the vein.

431
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:49,990
So you can see how it's it's very sensitive. So these would be our patients at risk for being malnourished that.

432
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:55,370
Are you started on fragile nutrition? Yes. Well, I think on our side.

433
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:09,969
Yeah. Like we're this is yeah, I'm having an adverse reaction to this because I know and I feel the process

434
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:14,890
it could be in Thursday because I'm interested in like the history of this.

435
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:22,030
I'll, I'll refer to a couple of historical references of evidence of repeating that were not captured.

436
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,260
We didn't know what was going on.

437
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:32,590
The Minnesota starvation experiment really laid the groundwork for like our understanding of what happens when we start beating a malnourished person.

438
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:38,710
So before that, we have historical evidence that this has happened and we'll talk about that.

439
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,660
We have seen that happen. We do missionary work and we go somewhere and do too much.

440
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,799
And those people have died. And I was thinking those people were some day.

441
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,640
The next day we didn't know it. But then. Yeah, I know.

442
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:56,630
We need to understand these things. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

443
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:08,170
So let's talk about why this happens. The driving force behind refitting syndrome is the release of insulin.

444
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,320
So we're reinstituting nutrition, which most often is going to include carbohydrate.

445
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:17,050
So we're switching back to carbohydrate is being our main fuel source.

446
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,280
When we do that, our blood glucose levels are going to rise and that's going to trigger our pain groups to release insulin.

447
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:33,219
So insulin in response to carbohydrate intake is the primary stimulus for the cascade of events associated with repeating syndrome.

448
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:41,560
So this is really the driving force. It's the shift from being in a starved catabolic state to going to a fed anabolic state.

449
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:51,040
Okay. So the hallmark symptom of repeating syndrome is hyper fast of aspartame.

450
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:58,510
That is a low blood phosphorous level. That's kind of like the universal marker.

451
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:10,729
So we will also see hypokalemia that too low blood, potassium, we'll see vitamin deficiencies, usually just a film that there's a thiamin deficiency.

452
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:17,020
We don't have to check the blood diamond, the water soluble vitamin A blood diamond levels not be super helpful.

453
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:25,390
We also may see heart failure or is sometimes referred to as congestive heart failure in the past.

454
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,080
Can you maybe think of why we might see some some heart failure?

455
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:37,350
Signs of heart failure? Then sometimes to putting too much in this game.

456
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:42,180
It's not the crossing mechanism that provides controls to the heart.

457
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,020
You have the electrolyte imbalances. Why else?

458
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,590
What do we talk about when a patient's coming in malnourished?

459
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:58,710
Remember, sometimes their heart is a little bit smaller and weaker because maybe it was broken down for for muscle, for gluconeogenesis.

460
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:04,020
So then once we reinstitute nutrition, there's some electrolyte imbalances.

461
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,200
Maybe they are retaining fluids. So it's going to make the heart work harder.

462
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,250
So an already weak heart then has to work harder so we can see heart failure.

463
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,520
These would be more extreme severe presentation.

464
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:23,009
Usually it's the electrolyte abnormalities. We catch it pretty quickly and we repeat that we can see peripheral edema.

465
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:26,250
So that's just some fluid retention in the peripheral extremities.

466
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,969
Some may experience rhabdomyolysis.

467
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:35,730
That's just a breakdown of muscle tissue that can release damaging protein in the blood that constrained the kidneys.

468
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,799
May see some neurological complications. Also, hemoglobin dysfunction.

469
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,750
Again, these are going to be more severe end points of re feeding syndrome.

470
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:50,819
But we take away the hypo fast routine.

471
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:56,070
Tamia This is in red for a reason that is the hallmark sign of re feeding.

472
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,890
Now people can have low phosphorus and not be repeated.

473
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:05,760
Okay, so it's in context of our patient that is malnourished, that we are reinstituting nutrition.

474
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:14,940
Okay. So why do we see hyper fast for Tamia. Well it's I think there is this is a it's also online.

475
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:24,510
There's a typo. I apologize. So it's it's multifactorial, but it's going to result from the cellular uptake of phosphorus.

476
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:30,480
So this is an important concept. Make sure when you look at your readings, you understand this trans cellular shift.

477
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:39,150
When we start eating carbohydrate, which is going to increase our blood glucose, that's going to result in an insulin release from the pancreas,

478
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:46,200
insulin is going to help drive glucose from the blood into the cell to be used as energy.

479
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:52,139
That's why insulin allows our blood sugar to go down because glucose is then going to go into the cell.

480
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,250
Our cells need glucose for energy, glycolysis, all that is happening.

481
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:03,980
In addition to glucose going into the cell, the blood electrolytes will go from the blood to the cell.

482
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:10,520
So it's going to leave our blood levels of these electrolytes very low.

483
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,049
Does that make sense? And they're probably already depleted, right?

484
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:19,010
Because we've been without nutrition for how long? So we're not going to have a really good source.

485
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:29,580
So hypoglycemia results from the cellular uptake of phosphorus, but also it's due to the need for phosphorylated intermediates for glycolysis.

486
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:37,040
So if you go back to glycolysis, that cycle, which none of us want to do, but if you were to read through those steps,

487
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:46,070
a lot of those enzymes, if you look at it that help release energy from glucose, have a PE and then just phosphate.

488
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:52,670
So that process requires a lot of phosphate, which we don't have because we're depleted on earth.

489
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,030
So. Reinstitution of nutrition.

490
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,550
Phosphorous acids from the blood into the cell.

491
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:06,090
And then all of these phosphorylated intermediates which we need for glycolysis are going to require phosphate.

492
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:11,220
So it's going to leave us very, very low in our in our blood phosphorus levels.

493
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:19,520
So what happens when we have low phosphorus or hypercholesterolemia that can result in decreased oxygen delivery

494
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:27,920
to cells due to decreased levels of these inorganic phosphates and it can impair oxygen release from hemoglobin.

495
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:34,790
Some other physiologic manifestations can include neurologic, respiratory, cardiac and immune function effects.

496
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:40,760
If it's not corrected again, the whole point of this is that we're going to see their phosphorus drop on their labs,

497
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:48,080
immediately, make some alterations to our nutrition plan. But most importantly, we're going to supplement phosphorus aggressively.

498
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:59,689
So whenever we do like a case study or on an exam, I'll always give you like the normal range of a lab level so you won't have to memorize that.

499
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:05,540
So normal phosphorus is between 2.7 and 4.6 milligrams per deciliter.

500
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,680
So we consider severe hyperglycemia less than 1.5.

501
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,259
You can see that can kind of peak around three, four, seven.

502
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:19,090
So it might not happen right away and it might continue to drop as we continue to feed the patient.

503
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:26,219
Okay. Hyperkalemia, why do we see low blood potassium really?

504
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:33,900
That's going to be that cellular uptake of potassium which is induced by insulin and that's in response to the nutritional level.

505
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,040
So we start repeating it's going to increase our blood glucose levels,

506
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:45,630
stimulate insulin that's going to drive these electrolytes from the blood into the cell, leaving us with a low blood potassium.

507
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:52,500
So effects of moderate hyperkalemia could be they could be very noxious, they could vomit.

508
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:59,580
Also, constipation and weakness could see here the normal range is about 3.5 to 5.

509
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,990
Severe hyperkalemia would be a potassium of less than 2.5.

510
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:09,780
And that can be pretty, pretty significant in terms of actual clinical.

511
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:18,440
Symptoms that can result from that. So they usually are very quick to address low potassium.

512
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:25,530
You'll see that that will be monitored very closely. Okay.

513
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,790
We also see hypo magnesium. Yeah. So low blood magnesium.

514
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:38,040
It's an essential it's essential for a number of metabolic pathways, including those involving ATP production.

515
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:47,940
So magnesium, if not if left untreated, can also complicate the treatment of hyperkalemia and low blood calcium.

516
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:56,220
So if a patient is not really responding to potassium supplementation, let's say, and their potassium remains low,

517
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:06,629
it's important that we make sure we're addressing the magnesium or monitoring that magnesium will be not part of our basic metabolic panel.

518
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:09,900
So it is a separate lab order on its own.

519
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:15,570
So sometimes they don't check the magnesium. So that's something that's important to keep in mind.

520
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:24,330
So hypo magnesium induced hyperkalemia is likely due to impaired sodium potassium atpase activity.

521
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:28,650
You don't have to really get into that level of detail.

522
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:35,310
Just know that magnesium can be depleted because it is involved in ATP.

523
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:42,480
There is a trans cellular shift, but it also may contribute to the low blood calcium if it's not effectively treated.

524
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,709
And you can see the reference ranges there. Okay.

525
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:53,750
We do see a fluid shift during the feeding. We've talked about this during starvation.

526
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:57,690
We have increased sodium losses in urine, followed by free water loss.

527
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,569
So there's a loss of total body water.

528
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:09,950
So patients are often dehydrated, even if they have some fluid shifts where they maybe have some fluid accumulation in the periphery.

529
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,219
But upon reintroduction, kind of the opposite happens.

530
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:23,090
So sodium is reserved or kind of like hold on to and so you hold on to sodium water.

531
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,220
Usually their your urine output will drop.

532
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:32,420
And sometimes when we have this atrophied heart, remember, our heart is a little bit weak after the experience of starvation.

533
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:41,150
Then we have this sudden sodium and fluid retention that's going to require our heart to work harder to get blood pushed out to our periphery.

534
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:48,200
So the increased level of fluid results in an excessive volume of fluid flowing through the circulatory system.

535
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:54,440
And this can overwork the heart and lead to heart failure in an already kind of weakened heart.

536
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,960
So those are kind of like the main features. Does anybody have questions on any of that?

537
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:13,960
Yes. Or when we start to receive these patients, like I remember I was talking about how during starvation we switched to like using ketones.

538
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:20,260
Like do we give them higher fat stuff in the beginning and like lower carb to help curb some of this or.

539
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,930
I was just wondering. That is a good question that comes up every year.

540
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:31,569
So like students like, well, why don't we just do like a ketogenic diet to repeat it?

541
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:44,770
It's valid, but we want to get these processes back on board that we can have, you know, protein synthesis and fat storage.

542
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:52,210
So we do want to still implement glucose, but we will do it very carefully.

543
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:57,580
So in the beginning, the calorie level, especially we do parenteral nutrition.

544
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:05,350
Next semester, we will be getting more calories from protein and fat as opposed to carbohydrate in the early days.

545
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:10,960
But then eventually we want to get to a more balanced, macronutrient delivery.

546
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,240
That question always comes up. I remember the first year. I don't think we do that.

547
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:23,590
I'm not really sure why, but we do want to get back to a more balanced approach.

548
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:31,240
But we have to be very careful in the one macronutrient we have to be careful with is what is carbohydrate, right?

549
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:36,230
That's what's going to stimulate this whole process. Yes.

550
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:40,190
So the liver and kidney functions are not yet assessed.

551
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,879
Composing was the first best way to get to the baseline.

552
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,450
And then you need to work on the protein and fat.

553
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,100
Yeah. And we won't be able to meet you. Yeah.

554
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:59,819
Gradually we won't be able to meet a lot of the nutrition just from protein and fat, of course.

555
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:06,600
So we do want to get carbohydrate back on. Yes, but that person didn't work to do like a keto diet.

556
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:14,440
Would they be at a higher risk for. They would probably go into ketosis.

557
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,820
Yes. Ah. You asked maybe about ketoacidosis.

558
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:26,700
Yes. Yeah. Potentially, depending on what their underlying risk factors are.

559
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,080
So we do have to be really careful of that. Okay.

560
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:35,370
We've got less than 10 minutes. I do want to just go into discussion.

561
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:41,170
We'll finish this up. How do we identify patients at risk and then how do we manage and prevent it?

562
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:44,910
So between today and Thursday, we'll go through all of this.

563
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:51,299
So we do want to be able to identify persons at risk for repeating from a clinical case scenario and

564
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:57,630
explain various approaches to prevent repeating in individuals that is going to be on the dietician.

565
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:06,209
Yes, physicians know what repeating syndrome is, but we are the ones that are really going to identify like this patient is at high risk.

566
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:11,940
To repeat, we need to be very careful before we start their activity, whatever it may be, that's going to be on us.

567
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:18,540
So it's really important we have to be able to identify patients who are going to be at risk for receiving.

568
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:22,920
So that's where that second paper, the nice guidelines come in.

569
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:27,960
So this is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is now the UK.

570
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:36,090
We don't really have specific guidelines for repeating syndrome. I think there are criteria is pretty good, so that's why I use that.

571
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:43,350
So this is based on the nice guidelines. This is criteria for determining people at high risk of developing and feeding syndrome.

572
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:48,810
Now certainly people can be at risk, but this is like these patients are at high risk.

573
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:57,119
Okay. So patients must have at least one of the following to be determined according to these guidelines, to be very high risk.

574
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,709
So just a BMI of 16, less than 16.

575
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:07,500
So that's just alone. That would be a patient would be at high risk for.

576
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:14,290
Unintentional weight loss greater than 15% within the last 3 to 6 months.

577
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:19,180
Little or no nutritional intake for more than ten days. Yes, you'll see this.

578
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:24,580
A patient has been admitted. They've been peel for procedures. Now it's been ten days and they haven't found anything.

579
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:29,980
And we're going to start some nutrition. Maybe they were well-nourished coming in, but they haven't had anything for ten days.

580
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,440
They could be at risk to feed.

581
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:42,190
And if they're starting with low serum levels of potassium, phosphorus or magnesium prior to feeding, that would put a person at risk.

582
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:47,020
We'll discuss that. A lot of times these are going to be normal.

583
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:53,169
These electrolytes will be normal. The body kind of does what it can to maintain homeostasis.

584
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:56,290
So often these are they look normal.

585
01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:04,120
Then we start nutrition and they tank. So if they're already starting with low levels, that could be a sign that they might be fit.

586
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:10,629
And then this would be situations where you'd have to have two or more to be considered high risk.

587
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:18,220
So BMI, less than 18.5 plus maybe unintentional weight loss with 10% in the last 3 to 6 months.

588
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:25,810
You can see this looks similar to like our malnutrition criteria, little or no nutritional intake for more than five days.

589
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:33,549
A history of alcohol abuse or drugs, including insulin, chemotherapy and acids and high diuretics.

590
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:40,810
These this just kind of puts the patient at nutritional risk, especially electrolyte, vitamin and mineral depletion.

591
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:47,790
So that could be part of that criteria. Okay.

592
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:56,360
So in order to prevent repeating syndrome, this identification should occur prior to starting nutrition.

593
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:59,549
So hopefully we've done our assessment. We've flagged that.

594
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:03,240
Okay. I'm worried that they might repeat that we haven't started any nutrition yet.

595
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,460
Sometimes that doesn't happen.

596
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:10,889
Sometimes they've already come in on Monday and they've started a patient and full strength tube feeds over the weekend.

597
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:15,330
And you see their electrolytes that morning like, oh my goodness, you know, we got to do something.

598
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:22,470
They're already very long. But hopefully prior to me, before starting anything, we're identifying someone that would be at risk.

599
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:31,550
So what are some considerations when evaluating lab values of especially of these minerals prior to initiation of nutritional therapy?

600
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:37,490
I kind of touched on this, but do normal levels mean there is not depletion?

601
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:50,680
Probably not. Right. So a normal serum or blood level of phosphorous is not really indicative of our phosphorus stores.

602
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:57,700
And if you think about the refilling process before starting any nutrition, we haven't really,

603
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:02,160
really reactivated that pathway that's going to drive the phosphorus to go low.

604
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,950
So a lot of times their electrolytes look great.

605
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:11,980
Before we started an operation, even if they're malnourished, they're their electrolytes are within the normal range.

606
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:20,530
So normal serum levels may not reflect their actual stores and these patients are likely to be depleted.

607
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:29,830
So what we'll do a couple days on biochemical assessment, nutritional related labs, not always as helpful.

608
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:37,299
You know, I get patients, ask me all the time, well, can I just get my labs checked to know how my nutritional status is?

609
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,060
And like I said, it's not really going to be helpful.

610
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:47,770
There are some situations where it will be, but you can't just kind of draw calcium level to know if you're consuming enough calcium.

611
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:58,450
We want to prevent repeating syndrome, of course. So once nutrition therapy is started, it is essential that we don't overfeed the patient right away.

612
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,160
Okay. So the rule of thumb is that we're going to start really low and go slow.

613
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,700
And that may sound counterintuitive because here we have the severely malnourished

614
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,320
patient that we only want to give like 300 calories to on the first day.

615
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:16,030
You know, you think, okay, we need to replenish this patient, but we we can't do that.

616
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,740
We have to start very slow and just gradually progress.

617
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:29,650
So day one initiation recommendations, according to the papers that we've read and this really pertains to folks,

618
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:36,490
we're going to start on to feedings or parental nutrition. It's a little bit more difficult to control, which is starting oral diet.

619
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:45,370
And again, those patients tend to tend to do okay and not show the signs of re feeding syndrome, even if they they eat well on day one.

620
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:49,510
So this is more intended for like our nutrition support patients.

621
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:56,950
So there's various recommendations, but we can start at about 25% of their estimated goal energy needs for day one.

622
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:59,250
So if they need, you know,

623
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:08,470
you think we'll calculate their calories that they would need as a goal and then maybe take 25% of that as our goal for the day one,

624
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,819
and then we gradually increase to that goal over 3 to 5 days.

625
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:14,260
Maybe that's a little bit longer.

626
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:22,480
And then any electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to starting, but also prior to advancing our nutrition.

627
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,660
Okay. Yes, go ahead. 25% of their actual volume.

628
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:38,350
So we would use in order to calculate their estimated energy needs, we are going to use their current actual value, which is probably low.

629
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:46,090
And then we'll calculate what their needs are based on that and then take 25% of that and we'll do some practice on this.

630
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:57,099
Okay. I'll stop after this slide. According to those nice guidelines, let's say the calorie needs for an adult, then we'll get into this when we do.

631
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:03,340
Estimated energy needs is about 25 to 35 pixels per kilogram of their current or actual weight.

632
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,610
If they have severe illness or they can inhale for five days, we can start at like half of that.

633
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:16,270
So if they need 1400 calories a day, we start at 700 as our first goal.

634
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:23,020
If they meet criteria to be at high risk for refitting, we're going to start even more conservatively.

635
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:31,360
So that might be ten cows per kilogram per day or maybe is that 25% of their estimated needs?

636
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:40,720
There's different ways we can do it. And if they're really high risk, this is like a situation with BMI, less than 14.

637
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:49,300
No one came for two weeks or more. We'll start very slow, like five kg per day for that first day.

638
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:57,940
So this is very specific information. Well, we'll practice this together, but this just gives you an idea.

639
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:03,920
We're not just going to start as if a patient needs 600, 6000 calories based on our estimate.

640
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:08,480
We're not starting there. We're going to work up to that probably over five days or a week.

641
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:13,460
And there are situations where we start really, really low and those first couple of days.

642
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:18,080
Does anybody have any questions about any of that for today?

643
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,960
Okay. So I know it's short turnaround.

644
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:29,060
Make sure you get your flow charts in before class on Thursday and then we'll go over that and make sure you guys all feel really comfortable with it.

645
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:33,530
Okay? Okay. All right. I'll see you on Thursday.
