1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,375
In this module, we'll talk
about criteria air pollutants,

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,350
but I want to highlight
every breath you breathe in,

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,745
you're breathing
in air pollution.

4
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,070
Sometimes more of
it, sometimes less.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,910
Not all air pollutants
though are created equal.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,695
Some are much more harmful
to our health than others.

7
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,720
So in this module that
we'll actually be talking

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,940
about some of the most
harmful pollutants and

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,380
what we've done over time to
try to reduce exposures and

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,470
subsequent health impacts
from these pollutants.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,050
We've talked in
other modules about

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,520
the responsibility that

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,170
the Environmental
Protection Agency,

14
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,690
EPA has for setting standards
related to the environment,

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,210
and so they are also responsible

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,250
for setting
air-quality standards.

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,410
So we have federal
standards for air quality,

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,850
but they're actually
implemented and

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,355
enforced by each
of our 50 states.

20
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,575
Now all of this was
basically enabled by

21
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:00,620
landmark legislation called
the Clean Air Act which was

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,110
passed in 1970 and
then amended in

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,295
1977 and again in 1990.

24
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:09,950
The Clean Air Act allowed us
to regulate emissions from

25
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,640
both stationary and mobile
sources of air pollution.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,230
This considers basically the

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,940
relative contributions of each of

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,680
those types of sources to

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,780
specific air pollution problems,

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,490
but also the relative capacity of

31
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,300
those different sources to
reduce their emissions.

32
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,780
So one result of

33
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,730
the Clean Air Act has been
the passage of what are

34
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,350
called the National Ambient Air

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,360
Quality Standards or NAAQS.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,115
So the next specifies six
primary or criteria pollutants,

37
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,050
but also provides a list of

38
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,050
air toxics or hazardous
air pollutants HAPs.

39
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,545
These were added in 1990 in
an amendment to the standards

40
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:49,805
and involve the addition
of 189 specific chemicals.

41
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,820
So let's look in a little
bit more detail at

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,920
these six criteria pollutants

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,380
plus these hazardous
air pollutants or HAPs.

44
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,885
The first one we'll talk
about is carbon monoxide.

45
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,135
So this is a colorless,
odorless gas,

46
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,880
that's a very common
byproduct of combustion.

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,150
The second criteria pollutant
is nitrogen dioxide or

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,710
NO2 which is actually

49
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,840
a highly reactive
reddish brown gas,

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,490
unlike carbon monoxide, this has

51
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,970
a very sharp and biting odor.

52
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,930
Ozone, specifically
ground-level ozone

53
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,320
or O3 is the third
criteria pollutant.

54
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,910
This is another
highly reactive with

55
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,450
colorless gas that has an
odor similar to chlorine.

56
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,210
The fourth criteria
pollutant is lead.

57
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,380
So you may already know, this is

58
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,240
a very toxic heavy metal that's

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,979
released either
through combustion

60
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,250
or through industrial
smelting typically.

61
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,050
The fifth criteria pollutant
is sulfur dioxide.

62
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,940
So this is another colorless gas,

63
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,400
but has an odor
like burnt matches.

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,530
The sixth and final
criteria pollutant

65
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,820
is particulate matter.

66
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,740
So as we've discussed
in other modules,

67
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,270
this is small particles and

68
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,140
aerosol droplets
suspended in the air.

69
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,790
So in addition to these six,

70
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,200
we have the 189 hazardous
air pollutants,

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,580
and these are a range of

72
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,265
chemicals with
varying properties.

73
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,310
So those are the criteria
pollutants and the HAPs.

74
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,860
Let's talk more specifically
about their health impacts.

75
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,750
So starting again
with carbon monoxide,

76
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,289
the key issue here is reduced
oxygen in your tissues,

77
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,960
and it turns out the impact
of carbon monoxide is

78
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,055
much worse on those with
preexisting heart disease.

79
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:21,830
Nitrogen dioxide aggravates
respiratory diseases and

80
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,095
especially asthma
and can also cause

81
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:27,260
other diffuse
respiratory symptoms.

82
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,740
Ozone is associated with
reduced lung function and

83
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,265
respiratory symptoms and
again, aggravates asthma.

84
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,920
For the fourth criteria
pollutant lead,

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,210
we're very concerned about

86
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,000
neurological learning
and behavioral impacts

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,220
particularly on children and lead

88
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,935
can also have
cardiovascular impacts.

89
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,200
Sulfur dioxide causes
respiratory symptoms,

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,515
difficulty breathing, and
again aggravates asthma.

91
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,200
Finally for particulate matter

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,760
the sixth criteria pollutant,

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,400
this is very harmful to
your cardiovascular system.

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,890
It's been linked to heart
attacks and strokes,

95
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,080
and again, is
associated with asthma.

96
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,850
So you can see that
all of these things

97
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,230
in some way are going to

98
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,940
impact either your respiratory

99
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,770
or your cardiovascular system.

100
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,750
Then for the hazardous
air pollutants because

101
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,780
this is so many different
kinds of chemicals,

102
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,025
it's difficult to
summarize their impacts,

103
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:17,600
but many of them do cause eye,

104
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,100
nose, and throat irritation,

105
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,170
or difficulty
breathing, and some of

106
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,185
them are linked to cancer
and immune effects.

107
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:27,500
So where do all these criteria
pollutants come from.

108
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
The image you're looking at

109
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,010
here is basically an inventory

110
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,510
of our national emissions here in

111
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,819
the United States
by source category,

112
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,970
and so the size of
the bars indicates

113
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,530
the fraction of
emissions coming from

114
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,710
the different sources
listed across the bottom.

115
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,030
So let's look at a couple
of these in detail.

116
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,010
If you look over at
the right-hand side

117
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,750
towards sulfur dioxide,

118
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,820
you can see the majority
of that bar is blue.

119
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,830
So most sulfur
dioxide emissions are

120
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,305
coming from stationary
fuel combustion.

121
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,420
On the other hand, if you
look at the left side at

122
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,760
NH3 which is one of the HAPs,

123
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,260
this is ammonia,

124
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,450
the primary source here is

125
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,135
industrial and other
types of processes.

126
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:06,890
So we have a couple
of pollutants that

127
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,900
mainly come from one source.

128
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,560
On the other hand,

129
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,780
if you look at carbon
monoxide on the far left,

130
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,210
you can see that this comes
from multiple sources.

131
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,190
The leading source
here though only by

132
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,295
a little bit is highway vehicles.

133
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,610
So again, the
pollutants are coming

134
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,900
from many different sources

135
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,595
which makes control
of those sources

136
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:26,600
somewhat challenging. Let's
talk a little bit more about

137
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,670
the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards.

138
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,730
So here is a table
summarizing the NAAQS,

139
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,500
both in terms of
primary standards

140
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,195
but also secondary standards.

141
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:38,300
Primary standards are intended
to protect human health,

142
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,950
and secondary standards
are designed to

143
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,635
protect the health of the
environment around us.

144
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,930
So let's look at a couple
of these in detail.

145
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,350
Carbon monoxide has
a level of nine ppm,

146
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,030
nine parts per million with

147
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,130
an averaging time of eight hours,

148
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,500
but you'll see there's
another standard of

149
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,940
35 parts per million

150
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,550
a higher level for a one
hour averaging time,

151
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,230
a shorter exposure period.

152
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,990
So immediately, we can
start to see that some of

153
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,030
these criteria air pollutants are

154
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,460
regulated based maybe on
more chronic exposures,

155
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,380
a longer exposure period and

156
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,735
some of them are based
on more acute exposures,

157
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:14,555
lesser or smaller averaging time.

158
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:17,210
For lead the next pollutant down,

159
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,440
you can see we have a level of

160
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,870
0.15 micrograms per meter cubed,

161
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,825
but that's computed over a
rolling three-month average,

162
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,639
and then for nitrogen dioxide,

163
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,230
you can see a 53 parts per

164
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,300
billion limit on an
annual, or one-year basis.

165
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,870
You'll also see at
the bottom here

166
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,870
particulate matter with
a course fractions.

167
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,595
So this is called PM10.

168
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:39,380
These are particles
that don't make it so

169
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,430
far into your respiratory system,

170
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,325
and the limit here is based
on a 24 hour average.

171
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:47,570
Then if we look at the
lower part of the table,

172
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,080
we have a different
limit for PM2.5.

173
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,450
So these are the fine
particles that can make it

174
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,770
deep into your lungs and may be

175
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,360
more harmful to your health.

176
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,145
So for PM2.5, we have

177
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,950
15 microgram per
meter cubed limit on

178
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,435
an annual basis and so on for
ozone and sulfur dioxide.

179
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:07,250
So again, six criteria

180
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,980
air pollutants with very
different limits specified

181
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,230
over different averaging
times and all that's

182
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,305
based on their anticipated
health impacts.

183
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,600
So now we know what
the pollutants

184
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
are that are of key concern,

185
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
how do we actually evaluate
air pollution exposures?

186
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,020
On the left here, you
can see a map of all

187
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,150
of the monitoring stations
that are looking for

188
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,880
PM2.5 in United States

189
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,655
and you can see all 50
states are represented here.

190
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:34,170
Zooming into Michigan
on the right here,

191
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,350
you can see we have a
number of stations here,

192
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,330
particularly in Southeast
Michigan where much of

193
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,370
the population is
concentrated and a

194
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,680
few monitoring stations that
are relatively close to

195
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,940
our campus here in the University

196
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,055
of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

197
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:49,040
I want to highlight that
pollutant emissions

198
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,540
have actually gone
down over time.

199
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,010
So this is is a success story.

200
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,125
So the graphic we're
looking at here

201
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,990
is basically laying
out trends for

202
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,750
a variety of different
criteria air pollutants

203
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,780
including PM2.5 and PM10,

204
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,125
and we're looking at the
total emissions on the y-axis

205
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,965
over time from 1990-2016.

206
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,855
So you'll see a
couple things here.

207
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:13,550
One is a few of these lines have

208
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,710
showed pretty
dramatic reductions.

209
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,059
So if you look at NOX,

210
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:19,670
the orange line on here,
that's nitrogen oxides,

211
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,065
or oxides of nitrogen,

212
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,960
you can see those have declined
pretty rapidly over time,

213
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,750
you can also see that sulfur
dioxide, the dark blue line,

214
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,940
has dropped off
pretty precipitously,

215
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,280
but you'll also see for a
few of these contaminants

216
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,390
at the bottom of the chart,

217
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,950
the trends have been
relatively stable.

218
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,980
We haven't made such
advances there.

219
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,500
We can look at the same criteria

220
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,300
air pollutants in a
slightly different way.

221
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,515
So in this graphic,

222
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,870
the dashed line at zero
percent represents

223
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,150
our most recent National Standard

224
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,150
for each of those
criteria air pollutants,

225
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,015
and here we can look at
trends over time in terms of

226
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,730
whether or not we're
achieving these standards.

227
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,900
So if you look at the dark
blue line sulfur dioxide,

228
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,980
you can see way back in 1990,

229
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,600
we were about 75 percent
above the current limit,

230
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,925
but if you follow that line
all the way forward to 2016,

231
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:10,130
now you can see we're
about 75 percent

232
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,765
below the national limit.

233
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:13,235
That's great news.

234
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:14,825
For some of these contaminants,

235
00:09:14,825 --> 00:09:16,250
the group along the bottom,

236
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,140
you can see that
even back in 1990,

237
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,700
we were actually below

238
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,370
the national standard and
our levels have continued to

239
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,890
go down though at
a much slower rate

240
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,855
than things like sulfur dioxide.

241
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,370
So all of these pollutant

242
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,110
concentrations have
declined over time.

243
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,060
That's great news, but
the specific trends

244
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,685
differ by the type of pollutant.

245
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:37,130
We can also think
about changes not

246
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,170
just in the six criteria
air pollutants,

247
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,580
but in concentrations of

248
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,895
these other 189 air
toxics over time.

249
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,560
So I'm just showing
you an example

250
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,150
here of the monitoring
network for

251
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,830
one specific type of

252
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,915
hazardous air pollutant.
This is benzene.

253
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,820
In this case, this
is an air pollutant

254
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,050
that actually is
associated with cancer.

255
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,480
So on this graphic,

256
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,730
you can see that for
each monitoring station,

257
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,230
we can see whether
trends have been

258
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,225
decreasing over time in blue,

259
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:04,205
or flat over time in green,

260
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,575
or increasing over time in red.

261
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:08,330
So the good news here,
you can see there are

262
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,980
many stations where
there has been

263
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,400
a decrease over time in
benzene concentrations,

264
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,870
and for the most part,

265
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,400
the rest of the stations are

266
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,860
either no trend or indeterminate.

267
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,860
So taking this
information collectively,

268
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,925
we can see that we have

269
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:25,115
a number of harmful
air pollutants.

270
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,840
We have limits for
those and we're

271
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,730
actually able to
monitor for those so we

272
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,830
can determine what
the exposures and

273
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,304
likely health impacts
are on the public.
