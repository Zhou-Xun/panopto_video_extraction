1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,670
I was doing it for you, but not for me. Oh yeah, OK.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,790
Yeah, yeah. And then, yeah, right.

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,470
So I want I want to hand you back your test, but I want to tell you a little bit about the grading.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,670
I don't know. Remember, I went through that. I looked at all that. I listed all the questions.

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,900
And mark how many people missed each one. And there were a few questions that a large number of people missed.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,890
I won't say everybody, but a large number. I took those out, OK?

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,490
And then I added in the extra credit points that people got. So the numbers are a little bit different than what you'll normally see.

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:50,100
But I think that's the way to do it. OK. So I want to hand this out, maybe at the end of the class so we can get going on the lecture.

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,420
OK. Great.

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,940
Yeah. Yes. I bet she'll have men fairly soon.

11
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,230
I just handed them to her. OK. We're talking about parasites today.

12
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:13,940
Now, if you're a clinical microbiologist, you will have taken at least one or two classes in parasitology.

13
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,260
So I'm trying to teach you all that in just a couple of lectures. It's going to be hard to remember it.

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,990
It's hard because it's a vast amount of information different from bacteria, different from fungi.

15
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:32,510
So if you can learn the main points that I talked about, there's going to be a lot more in your textbook.

16
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:39,020
But we have to two lectures on parasites instead of an entire term.

17
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,060
And so I'm just telling you, it's a lot. It's a massive amount of information.

18
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:50,380
OK, general characteristics of parasites. But first, we have to go over terminology.

19
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:59,000
Parasite is an organism that lives in or on a host and gets its food at the expense of the host.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,630
OK.

21
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:11,990
So parasite and parasites live in the host and cause infections, ecto parasites live on a host and can cause infections, so they're either in or on.

22
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:17,920
So and those infected was on, and the host is the species that harbors the parasite.

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:28,140
So if I go out camping and I have a tick attached to me, which I don't want, I am the host for that tick.

24
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:35,160
OK, so the the range of impact, it might be no harm whatsoever to severe disease.

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,730
There's a whole range. If it's a tick, get it off as soon as possible. Make sure the head's not left in you.

26
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,900
OK, so there are categories of of parasites.

27
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,930
So the first one are the protozoans. Those are the smallest. They are single celled parasites.

28
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,460
They are. You need to have a microscope to see them. OK.

29
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,440
Include Giardia, which I know you've all heard, heard of before, and to me, BA and Plasmodium.

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,570
Of course, Plasmodium species cause malaria. They can be free living, or they can be parasitic in nature.

31
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,820
Just to make things more interesting. They can.

32
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:21,070
They are able to multiply in humans and that contributes to their survival, but not maybe to the survival of the human and the permit.

33
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,250
Serious infections, very serious infections to develop from just a single organism.

34
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:38,210
So once again, the example of malaria one mosquito can infect a person and that that infection, that disease can be life threatening.

35
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:48,590
Next slide. So infections are due to the ones in zone infections in humans, so sarkodie India, these are the amoeba.

36
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,440
So Anthony Barr is in that group and we have a mess to master before.

37
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,830
I can't pronounce that one. Those are the flagellate. And that includes Giardia and Leishmania.

38
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:07,250
Then we have silly offers and these are the silly. It's a little bit easier to remember because of the name cilia and cilia.

39
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,540
And here we would think about the L.A. and then we have the spa ZOA.

40
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,550
And these are organisms whose adult stage is not moral.

41
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,910
OK. And this would be Plasmodium or cryptosporidium, so they don't fly and land on you.

42
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:29,580
They might you might acquire by eating or something like that or a mosquito bite.

43
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:38,670
Next slide. So let's talk about the categories of parasites, we have the helminth things, and these are the familiar form worms.

44
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:49,950
These are multicellular and macroscopic. OK, so you can see or they could be intestinal and these would have macro Fillory.

45
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,190
And that would include the roundworms, which would be nematodes or Astra's and then the flat worms.

46
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,610
And these are the flukes in the tapeworms, in the flukes we call flatworms their tree toes.

47
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:12,120
So here we think about Schistosoma Schistosoma and the tapeworms are sisters, and he would think about Tenia and tapeworms can get incredibly long.

48
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:21,030
It just incredibly long. And then we have the blood borne parasites and these are spread due to microfilm area.

49
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:30,090
And examples of this is lower, lower the disease, lower, lower and some of the parasites are bruyere and wutah area.

50
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,860
And now I will give you all a spelling test. No, not really.

51
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:43,920
Next slide, so here this is a chart that everybody does parasitology or teaches parasitology uses the same chart.

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:54,090
It was done by CDC years ago, but it hasn't changed. So here we have the size in micrometers and the size of the different parasites.

53
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,870
You can see that mittagong metadata animus is very small.

54
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,240
It's less than 30 microns, and they range all the way up to fescue labs since Blue Sky,

55
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,130
which is one of the largest and that's almost one hundred and fifty microns in size.

56
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:16,880
OK, so there's huge size range in this in the in the Parasite's.

57
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,620
And let me also say, if you want additional, if you're interested in Parasite, you want to look something up.

58
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:33,230
CDC website has a tremendous amount of information on parasitic diseases and really it really goes along with public health and parasitic diseases.

59
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,150
And that's a good place to start looking. OK.

60
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:48,490
Epidemiology and pathogenesis. They are more common in the developing world than in the developed world because in the developing world,

61
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,930
they don't have perhaps good clean water like we do.

62
00:06:52,930 --> 00:07:02,500
They may not have screened windows and so on to prevent acquiring parasitic diseases.

63
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,690
So immunocompromised diseases and therapies and the therapies for those diseases

64
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:14,200
that cause immunocompromised states occur more rapidly in the developed world.

65
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:21,890
And so we have some diseases in the developed world because we have more immunocompromised people.

66
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:28,100
Next slide, so. You can't do parasitology without lifecycles.

67
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:37,730
And I know no one likes to memorize life cycles. I don't like to memorize life cycles, so I will hold your need to memorize them to a minimum.

68
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,140
OK.

69
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:48,110
But you do need to know some general facts about life cycles, so life cycles involve the development and external environment in one or more hosts.

70
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,480
So there's parasites, so they have to be on the environment and they have to be on at least one host.

71
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,640
And this life cycle generally goes from growth and maturation to reproduction.

72
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:10,100
So there's more of it self transmission transmitted has to infect other people so that you can grow and mature and so on.

73
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:19,280
And that's a very, very simple life cycle. So when you study parasites, you learn about the life cycles.

74
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:29,480
But what is interesting is the number. The number of different stages in the lifecycle of the parasites varies depending on which parasite it is.

75
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,740
So you can never say it's got three three life cycle stages or eight life cycle stages.

76
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:40,550
It's all over the board. The number of hosts for the whole cycle also varies.

77
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:50,750
So if there's a direct infection, one host and the parasite spends most of its life in that host, OK?

78
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,140
If it's an indirect, it would be two or more hosts and the defendant in the definitive.

79
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:04,370
If it's a definitive host, the parasite reaches sexual maturity as an adult in the definitive host.

80
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,970
If it's an intermediate host, which is before the definitive host,

81
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,150
the larval or intermediate stages develop, but then it has to be transmissible into the definitive.

82
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:31,820
Also, it can get into that final life stage. So nobody likes to memorize life cycles, and I will try and keep it to a minimum.

83
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:38,610
But you do need to know about them because you need to understand how infection occurs and at what

84
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:46,370
stages of infection and disease can be prevented and where to apply those preventive measures.

85
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:53,720
So remember, these are parasites, so they're not acquired generally by someone coughing on you or breathing on you.

86
00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:00,020
But there can be acquired from contaminated food, water or even soil.

87
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:08,630
Handwashing once again is critical. Various vectors, such as mosquitoes, can spread parasites.

88
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,300
They can be acquired from vertically, from a mom to the fetus, which is something none of us like to think about.

89
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:23,670
But it can occur. And then also remember hand-washing fecal oral transmission.

90
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:30,120
Next slide. So here is a very simple life cycles for Antrobus, for pin worm.

91
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,670
And yes, I get these slides from CDC so you can follow.

92
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,840
I don't know if you've ever looked at these charts before, but they're numbered.

93
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,470
Where to start? So down here is number one. So the eggs are on the peri anal folds of the rectum.

94
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,060
The larva inside the eggs mature within four to six hours.

95
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,790
OK, so it should.

96
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:05,310
And then as disgusting as it sounds, embryo nated eggs are ingested by humans, generally by a lack of hand-washing and sanitary practices.

97
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:13,290
So you can see and hear the infective stage. His little eye in the blue triangle and the diagnostic stage has a little D.

98
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,940
So here is the infective stage up here and bring needed eggs ingested by a human.

99
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:29,340
But we can't diagnose it until we get a stool specimen or a scotch tape prepped from the from the rectal fold to see if there you can just.

100
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:36,900
Put Scotch tape around a glass like sticky side out and then put that against someone's rectal.

101
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,930
And then you've got material on that. You can put that on microscope and look to see if you see any economics.

102
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:50,350
Now that's hard to do because most places where they're getting the specimen don't have a qualified person to look through or a microscope to do it,

103
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:58,740
but that's one way of doing it. So and yet here it shows up larva have hatching the small intestine and the adults are in the aluminum,

104
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,070
the cecum and then the last stage, the grab and female.

105
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:09,700
The pregnant female migrates to the peri in a region at night to lay eggs because obviously at night, she doesn't want anybody to see her.

106
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,570
That was a joke. OK. That's an intro.

107
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:21,550
Yes. So here's a little bit more complicated life cycle with more stages.

108
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:27,250
This is for a fish table, and I fill a bathroom, lay them, and this is a very complex life cycle.

109
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:34,090
So we're going to start down here with unbranded eggs passed in feces.

110
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:42,880
And the eggs, embryos, eight in the water, which still sounds a little strange, but they do, then the course Syria,

111
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:53,080
which is this structure, this round structure hatched from the eggs and they're ingested by crustaceans such as crab and all.

112
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:01,360
Then the processor quite larva in the body cavity develops in the body cavity of the larva,

113
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,060
and the infected crustaceans are ingested by small freshwater fish.

114
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,960
The processor, called larva, are released from the crustacean and develops into a plural surfboard larva.

115
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:23,230
So it's it's second stage of a larva fly. But OK, so we have this predator fish, which is much bigger each the infected small fish.

116
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,800
The humans ingest raw or undercooked infected fish and they get infected.

117
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,490
And that's the life cycle here of D'Iberville, of the fish tapeworm.

118
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:42,130
And there are some parts of the tapeworm that you need to know the Skull X is the head, OK?

119
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,290
Then they have many, many different segments and a tapeworm.

120
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,780
And to really identify it, you need to head,

121
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,640
but you need to look at some of the segments to really see the structure and say, OK, I know what this is.

122
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:02,020
This is a tapeworm. And then, of course, is the problem it's releasing immature eggs here.

123
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,130
So even though there's a lot of material here, it's very complete.

124
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,750
And I would also guess that if somebody ate a crustacean,

125
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:18,720
not well cooked people like rough foods nowadays, they could get infected at that point also.

126
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,270
OK. Let's go to protozoa there a little bit easier.

127
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:34,670
Most of them have two forms. They have a trough inside, which is modal and actively feeds, and they have a cyst, which is a resting stage.

128
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:41,000
There are different classifications in the protocol, we have the amoeba here, we have the flatulence.

129
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,350
We have psyllids with the cat Cydia and then we have blood parasites, which of course are the very most serious ones.

130
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,980
You were talking about malaria and others.

131
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:07,570
OK, so ameba, Anthony, but his political causes amoebic dysentery, what is dysentery, profuse, watery diarrhea,

132
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:15,130
diarrhea so profuse that people can become dehydrated just from the amount of diarrhea that they're having.

133
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:21,770
It's acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Very simple life cycle.

134
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:29,150
They eat it. You get sick. That's it. So here is the life cycle.

135
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:35,570
As I said, it's very, very simple. So we'll start here with mattresses.

136
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:41,330
And that's actually what they look like, but they're not that big are ingested.

137
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:48,770
They're the infective stage, and they're also the diagnostic stage, if you can see it, they they're swallowed, they go into the stomach,

138
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:54,770
their stomach, they go into the liver, they go into the large intestine, small small intestine, large intestine.

139
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:03,920
Eventually, they're passed out through the feces. So but while they're in the intestine, they exist.

140
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,610
Point three down here, they become trophies, all whites which multiply the more trophies, all whites and cysts.

141
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,990
If conditions for a living aren't too good, not what they want to develop the system.

142
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:25,430
And it's a cyst form that is shared in the stools. So here is Anthony to his the political.

143
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:34,190
And I wish they were all that big, but they're really about five microns, six microns in size, something very, very small.

144
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:48,360
So you need to look with oil, which means you spend more time looking at the slides and you can see a nucleus and you can see an elementary body.

145
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,680
And here's another historic assist. And this is stained with dry chrome, which is a little different than the previous one.

146
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,540
You can see more more forms inside,

147
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:06,300
but if you see something that's that round and the right size and you have at least one nuclear nucleus and other forms,

148
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:18,570
you've probably got into, maybe just a little. And then here's an intimate collie trove, and this is done with a try from Stain,

149
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:24,690
and we generally don't think Anthony Coley as being an infectious and causing disease.

150
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:30,540
A person can have it and not be sick. OK, now the person's immunocompromised, they're going to be sick.

151
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,420
But many people have Anthony coli and are not ill.

152
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,720
So if we see it, we're doing parasitology slides. We see it.

153
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:50,030
We report it, and then it's up to the physician or the health care provider to determine what the next course is for that patient.

154
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:57,550
And you can see that they are much, much larger than his political. Next slide.

155
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,250
And here's an enemy to done with a try from, you can see multiple nuclei in it.

156
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:13,300
And the very large size and I wish the CDC had put measuring bars on these.

157
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:20,890
So let's talk a little bit about some other amoeba, Acanthamoeba and declaring a species, they're very closely related.

158
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:30,270
They cause keratitis, eye infections, but even more important meningoencephalitis, which can be life threatening.

159
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:36,060
How are they acquired traumatic full inoculation? So somebody is fighting somebody,

160
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:42,240
they get punched in the eye or they have an auto accident or they fall down on the ground and you know, their eyes injures something.

161
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,050
There's been damage to the eye. OK can also be acquired by inhalation of contaminated water.

162
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:57,330
You're out swimming. You don't know the water is contaminated and you breathe it in and you you breathe in contaminated water.

163
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:04,620
Or for those of us who wear soft contact lenses, not me, I'm still work hard lens inappropriate handling of soft contact lenses.

164
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,390
That's why it's so important. If are soft contact lenses, you wash your hands.

165
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:17,740
I just run under water, but wash your hands really well before you put them in or take them out.

166
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,370
Next slide. So here is an Acanthamoeba trophies.

167
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:31,300
This is an unstained wet mount and no, they are not that big, but they are true, so they don't have the same round form as the Swiss does.

168
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:37,060
OK, because you can see this one is a little elongated, actually looks a little bit like a bug in a beetle or something.

169
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:46,210
And then this one's round. They're both trophies, but you can see the nuclei and the other inclusions in them.

170
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:54,430
Next slide. And here are Acanthamoeba, since this is an unstained wet mount as it shows and they are fairly close to being,

171
00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:00,940
you know, there's a range in size, but there's not a big range. OK, so you can see some differences in size here.

172
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:13,250
You can't identify them without a stain. And if if they're all cysts, you have to stain also.

173
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:26,870
OK. Going on to the flatulence. So DRDO amplia, we have it here in Michigan and it's most other places, also causes diarrhea, profuse diarrhea.

174
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:36,650
It's acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water and then took most vegetables, which is an STD.

175
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:42,350
It can cause virgin. I was in them and they are both flatulence.

176
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:48,880
So you would be able to see the flagellum on them if you looked microscopically.

177
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,880
So here's a majority lambley, a trove, and you can almost see a tail on it.

178
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,820
I always think this looks like a face. Yeah, looks like face.

179
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:10,560
OK, and on the next slide, we have to imagine Alice in a wet prep, wet prep, so nice because they're easy, but you're not stealing anything,

180
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,600
so it's more difficult to see them,

181
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,380
but you can see them here and you can actually see a flagellum here and probably one right here, also one right here also.

182
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,050
You can look at them with phase contrast if you put a cover, slip on it.

183
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:36,080
And so there's not not as many layers to look through and be able to see it a little bit better.

184
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:43,790
Then we have the Syrians, OK, and here we would talk about balancing your whole life and it causes diarrhea,

185
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:49,850
and once again, it's from ingestion of contaminated food and water. How are you going to remember how it how it's acquired?

186
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,660
Remember the ones that are not due to ingestion of contaminated food or water?

187
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:06,540
OK, that's a much shorter list. And here's Bill into the fully, and it is huge, huge.

188
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:13,080
This is an iron hematoxylin state, so we use that also sometimes for Pearson to look for parasites.

189
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:25,610
And it has a big inclusion body, so it's a large cell with a large inclusion.

190
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,730
OK, let's go back to the Syria, OK, I already talked about Cryptosporidium.

191
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:38,390
Then we have that here in Michigan that causes profuse diarrhea. Cyclospora can kick in tendencies.

192
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:46,760
I have trouble saying that also causes diarrhea, but both acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water.

193
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,300
We don't see Cyclospora here in Michigan that often.

194
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,290
Perhaps if somebody is working on a farm, you might have a greater chance of seeing it.

195
00:22:54,290 --> 00:23:06,560
But Cryptosporidium is pretty common. So here's Cryptosporidium part, all this isn't new, we can stay in this with a modified acid fast.

196
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:16,790
So what makes it a modified acid fast? We don't use acid alcohol to this day in them, so we use a much lighter distain method.

197
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:22,640
And so you can see them and they do say very nicely with a modified acid fasting.

198
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:34,960
They're small, but with the acid fasting, you can see them among all the other organisms that are present in a fecal specimen.

199
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:43,280
And here are the analysis with another modified acid fasting, and you can see they don't all take up the same to the same level.

200
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,430
You know, you may have to restate and stay in a little bit longer, leave the stain on a little longer to pick them up.

201
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:56,620
But they will all be modified fast, but may have to increase this day and time on some of them.

202
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:11,530
Some of the specimens. So it's really bad to have horrible parasitic diarrhea, but it's even worse to have a blood parasite.

203
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:19,180
OK, so these are transmitted by arthropods, and so we're talking mosquitoes here.

204
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:25,090
First of all, we're going to talk about his Plasmodium species. That cause transmits malaria.

205
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:31,690
And so we don't see malaria in the continental United States.

206
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:38,080
Sometimes some of it crosses over the border from the Mexico Texas border.

207
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,920
But that would be about the only place that we would ever see malaria in the United States.

208
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:51,520
It's very rare to see it. It causes a fever in 48 to 72 hour cycles or a fever, then another fever and then another fever.

209
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
Patients not treated.

210
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:03,340
And it is a systemic illness that can kill the patient and can cause, as I said here, severe disseminated, fatal disease, if untreated.

211
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,760
Now, if you're thinking about sending a specimen to the lab,

212
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:19,750
if your lab doesn't do parasitology and your hematologist doesn't know how to read these slides, it has to go to a reference lab on public health.

213
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:26,300
And that's just something to remember. No, when you when you graduate here and you're doing infection prevention someplace,

214
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,100
place people in the lab know what they can do and what they can do.

215
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,660
What has to get sent out, OK?

216
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:43,780
The mosquito vector is Anopheles, and they exist in tropical climates, so we don't have much in continental United States.

217
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:57,040
The A. Mosquito movement, which is wonderful and has done a great job in getting rid of mosquitoes and any diseases that they carry.

218
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:07,650
So this is Plasmodium falciparum and certainly the most serious of the four types of malaria, and you can see the inclusions on these.

219
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:18,460
And as you're reading and studying the book, I would make sure that you know what kind of conclusions each malarial parasite creates.

220
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:28,450
OK, so if it's Plasmodium falciparum, there will be a higher level of infected red cells than with the other Plasmodium species.

221
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:43,530
It's a much more virulent organism. He felt it from sometimes you get me to say what are going to be two sides to another form.

222
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:48,300
You can see this elongated form that's a commuter site and you can see it.

223
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:54,450
This is a thick film from blood.

224
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:03,150
And this is Plasmodium vivax, and I think this is probably the most common Plasmodium species that causes disease while they all cause disease.

225
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,870
And it's a thin film. Stay with the himself.

226
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:15,690
And what you can see in these infected red cells are not only the ring forms with a single nucleus on each ring,

227
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:23,190
but also there's the the red cells look speckled and sometimes the buybacks will do that.

228
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:38,750
And then this is a good way site. Why so this is a with skis on also from buybacks, and it is it's in the red cell.

229
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,710
But look at the size of the red cell. It's bigger than most other.

230
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:51,410
While this was elongated, but it's bigger because the malaria parasite is multiplying in there and stretching the red cell out,

231
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:57,950
and eventually it will burst. OK, and then there will be lots of squeeze odds that can go in.

232
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:06,050
In fact, additional red cells. Oh, OK.

233
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:11,890
They have easier another blood parasite, it's spread by cities.

234
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:18,890
Is anybody know what else it is? Spreads. We'll talk about it later.

235
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,250
It produces the disease, a disease similar to malaria, but not as common.

236
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,470
It's in the northeast and in the Midwestern states in the United States. Now I grew up in a Midwestern state.

237
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:37,610
I don't think we ever knew about that. But it is there.

238
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:44,270
And these are the trophies always. They look like the rings of of malaria, OK?

239
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,650
They look like those rings.

240
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:58,280
But in a BBC, a section with their desire, there will be multiple rings in one red cell and they're generally smaller than the malarial rings.

241
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,140
And you can see a nucleus on each one. So you can have just one in the cell.

242
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:09,440
You can have multiple in a cell. Next slide.

243
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,840
So more blood parasite Trypanosoma, anybody has anybody here have been there, Africa?

244
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:23,870
Anybody. Awesome. This is Chagas disease, which is non-Africans in South America.

245
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:30,170
It's spread by a bug called the REDUCE-IT bug. And that is what you see over here.

246
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,950
That's a really good bug. And what does this causes?

247
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:42,020
Causes an acute illness with a high fever, generalized pain and swelling of all your extremities.

248
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,790
So walking around handling anything is going to be very, very difficult.

249
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:54,530
In the acute phase, you can have a very high fever, generalized pain and then all this swelling.

250
00:29:54,530 --> 00:30:01,430
And then if it proceeds on to the chronic phase, you can have inflammation of the GI tract and heart.

251
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:10,150
This is a very, very serious infection. And needs to be treated whenever anybody has.

252
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:19,750
Also spread by bugs, spread by fly is African sleeping sickness, and that, of course, is acquired in Africa.

253
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,760
It is a can be a mild nonspecific febrile illness.

254
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,810
But unfortunately, it can progress as an infection of the central nervous system, and that's where it gets very, very serious.

255
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:40,450
So as the name says, this is an African illness we don't acquired here in the United States, but we may see someone come back.

256
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,370
They don't know if they've been infected. They may get sick while they're here, back here in the United States.

257
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:56,790
So it's something to be aware of. It can happen. So these are a pair of Panasonic Triple M. Gold.

258
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:04,350
And if you see these, it's very easy to identify me and measure the length as best you can because really strong going all these directions.

259
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,020
But you measure the length and you look for the nucleus in the end in the tail.

260
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:18,510
And that will help you identify Trypanosoma. Next slide.

261
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:34,080
So going on with blood parasites like media, which we do not have in Michigan, I haven't in my 37 years of of drifting micro labs.

262
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,290
I think I only saw it once or twice, but people who had tried, of course, we saw it on proficiency specimens,

263
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:45,630
but we only saw actual cases a few times by people had travel and came back with it.

264
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:57,180
So spread by sandflies can cause a variety of different types of illnesses could be a cutaneous mucocutaneous or visceral fat in the deep organs,

265
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,650
depending on the species involved.

266
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:05,520
As you can see, it occurs just about around the world in Africa, Asia, Middle East, Europe, North America, South America.

267
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:14,310
But I think we're a little bit too far north for us to have the sandflies that can spread it.

268
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:24,390
So this is these are these very small cells around the the the white cells that you're seeing here are a mass to go.

269
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:40,200
And this is an HD stain of the spleen section, and you can see those tiny a.m. gold growing and multiplying in the spleen.

270
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,730
Now we're talking about parasites, I'm going through them fairly rapidly,

271
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:55,770
but you need to know how they're acquired from what type of a bite of what type of an animal or sting or so on where they exist in the world,

272
00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:04,130
what they how them, how the disease manifests in the human and how it's diagnosed.

273
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:08,330
So if we go into the intestinal helminths, we do see this in the United States.

274
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,320
These are roundworms and a variety of different types of brown words.

275
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,000
Ask us one trick a restricted area shrine to oyster corrals,

276
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:28,140
which can be disseminated in tissue or enter for McLaren, which is pin worms, which is unfortunately very common.

277
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,600
So this is an gross fertilized egg. And you can see it's a youth.

278
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:42,810
It has this bumpy nature to the outside of the of the cell and inside you can see various forms.

279
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,780
You can't really tell what they are, but you can say, see that they're in there.

280
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,180
And so they say, Gee, I think this is an ask, and it's large. It is large.

281
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,570
You will not miss it. If you're looking on on low-power, you'll see something go to Hydro's.

282
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:02,860
Oh, yeah, that's an asterisk.

283
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:12,820
So here's another ask Chris unfertilized egg in a wet prep, and you can get some idea how large it is in this bumpy exterior.

284
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:24,570
Now you can't see much inside. It is a non fertilized egg, so there's not much to look at inside that egg.

285
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:43,300
And here is a decor dictated. Yeah, it's lost the outer rim that's so bumpy, but very clearly you can see the worm developing in that in.

286
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:52,550
Oops! OK, so this is an actual worm, and you can see how large it is.

287
00:34:52,550 --> 00:35:01,620
So even doubled over it's it's probably close to five six six.

288
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:11,140
Inches, centimeters, six centimeters, probably eight to 10 centimeters, if it was laid out straight.

289
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:19,730
And just to think about that crawling around inside of you makes me, yeah.

290
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,560
So here's another easy to identify egg first by courier.

291
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,390
This is an iodine proof, so you get a stool specimen. You process it.

292
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:36,830
You get rid of the nuclear material and a lot of the cellular material, so you clean it up as much as possible, spin it down.

293
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,710
You don't get rid of everything because then you might get rid of the eggs also.

294
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:49,480
But try Curtis is interesting because it's got you can remember it because it's got a like almost like an eyeball at each end.

295
00:35:49,480 --> 00:36:00,340
So it's an elongated and with a clear bulge at each end.

296
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:08,650
And here's an adult nematode triggers adult, and it's much smaller than the Oscars that I showed you.

297
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:16,030
And look at the tail on it. Yeah.

298
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:22,860
So here's a lifecycle of strange ladies. And yeah, you do need to know something about it.

299
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,650
So if you start at number one,

300
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:37,020
number one is somewhere around here five four three two one right here you have the rep did a form can't sampling that number.

301
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:48,180
OK. In the intestine are excreted in the stool. OK, so there can be oral infection or there can be.

302
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:54,630
They can go on and develop into a free living adult worm. And that worm produces eggs.

303
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:01,920
They fertilize females. And then the rep did a form larva has for the embryo needed eggs.

304
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:17,570
It's out there now that. Hopefully that will.

305
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:21,540
OK, so we've got the eggs produced by the fertilized females,

306
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:27,920
the ready to form larvae hatch from the impregnated eggs they develop into the infective filter form,

307
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,380
so they're not infective when they're first hatched,

308
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:39,740
they have to develop into the infective flora form and the infected flower form larva penetrate the intact skin,

309
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:47,030
initiating infection so they don't have to be eaten. They can penetrate the skin.

310
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:53,960
OK, that's number six. Number seven, flower form larvae enter the circulatory system so they get into the blood.

311
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,740
They're transported to the lungs. They penetrate the alveolar spaces.

312
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:04,670
Obviously, this is getting very, very serious, and when they're in the lungs, they're carried to the trickiest trachea and pharynx,

313
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:15,110
and then they crawl up and then they're swallowed back down, which is totally disgusting and reach a small intestine where they become adults.

314
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:21,020
Then the adult worms are in the intestine. They lay their eggs in the intestinal mucosa.

315
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,300
The eggs hatch and migrate to the lumen of the intestine and then threaded a form.

316
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:32,660
Larva are excreted in the stool to start another full cycle.

317
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:43,240
And yes, it is disgusting, but it is what it is.

318
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:54,390
So here is a straw, Angelo's straw corrals for a beautiful lavender and wet prep, and I wish that they had size markers on here, but it's.

319
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,130
It's large enough to be seen without a microscope if you're looking for it.

320
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:08,970
You may see it wiggling around on the surface of a stool specimen, which is gross also, but it is large enough to be seen.

321
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:14,970
Microscopy helps, though. Every time you go here, here's an intravenous vermiculite.

322
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,890
So these are generally a little bit shorter.

323
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:26,800
They're much shorter, but you can see the adult and how many eggs are released, and all of these eggs are infectious.

324
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:37,740
So hand-washing is critical, as is personal cleanliness.

325
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:48,090
Next slide. Here's an intro is for retailers, and you can see the nucleus and how large it is, the ad itself is oval.

326
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:58,530
And if if it is acquired by a person, it can set up another infection.

327
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:09,270
Next slide. So now we go on to intestinal helminths, and here we have Sesto says toads are flatworms instead of being around, they're actually flat.

328
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:18,710
And a couple of things about our species. It causes intestinal tapeworm infections and then a kind of carcass.

329
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:26,210
And these form hydrated cysts, and I think this is even worse if this is a fluid filled sac that contains the various Scorsese,

330
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:31,430
the segments of the worm and can be in a variety of body sites.

331
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:41,500
So it's not just in the intestine. So here's the tenia year, tedious tapeworm female lifecycle.

332
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,170
So we start somewhere with number one, if I could find all number two number one down here,

333
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:55,690
we have the two forms with two species tenia such janata and tenia solium and the eggs or the grab.

334
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:02,740
This is the egg. And these are the grab it provides, which means they're fertile in feces.

335
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:10,330
They're passed into the environment and then cattle acquired such an order.

336
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:17,830
And pigs acquired tenia solium, so I've always found it easy to remember solium and pigs because it's a shorter word.

337
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,090
And pigs are smaller than cattle. I remember it anyway.

338
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:29,590
They become infected by ingesting vegetation contaminated with these eggs or grab it for gloves.

339
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,660
OK, so then the atmosphere is hatch.

340
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:39,430
And penetrate the intestinal wall and circulate around the animal.

341
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:45,790
But it's a pig or a cow. They circulate into the muscles and in the muscles.

342
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:51,820
The spheres develop and assist a circle that you can see a schematic of it right here.

343
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:58,390
Then humans get infected by ingesting raw or undercooked infected meat.

344
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:04,630
I know there's a move on to not cook meat so much.

345
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:11,110
Think about this. That's all I can say. Think about it because I don't think you want any of these infections.

346
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:18,760
So how do we differentiate such an order from solium? So if you look at the skull over here, they look totally different.

347
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:27,950
Slim is round, and it kind of looks like little eyes looking at you and said, Know is larger and it's more of a triangular shape.

348
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:38,390
So humans are infected, as I said, by ingesting raw, undercooked infected meat and the adults form the adult worms form in the intestine,

349
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:45,230
and the tapeworms can be very, very long, very long and many multiple fragments.

350
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:50,720
And indeed, after they've been in the intestine, then they can be shed in the stool.

351
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,130
And you can see entire worms, part of worms or individual segments.

352
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:03,800
This is also one of the easiest ones to identify in the laboratory based on the size and the difference in the size between said Janata and Solium.

353
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,460
And one of the things we count and I know you can't hardly see it here.

354
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:14,100
The number of cross cross arms coming off here versus seeing solium solium is much less sad.

355
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:30,730
Tonight is much more. And so the day this is the diagnostics stage right here, if we see any of these and all of this is the infective stage.

356
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:38,380
And any time, as I said, any time you want more information on parasitic diseases, go to the CDC, CDC, Dot gov website.

357
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,620
Excellent. And here's an actual worm.

358
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:59,630
And this is such an order. So it's the larger one. And you can see the individual segments and every segment is infectious.

359
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:04,430
Next slide. So this is Dr. Bobby Boynton.

360
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,670
He was one of my colleagues at Beaumont. He left.

361
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:17,000
He's now the director of pathology at Arkansas Children's Hospital. But we got a tapeworm in and he cut it up because he wanted to see him.

362
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,800
This is the cut up tapeworm. And he was looking at on the dissecting scope, looking at it to see what he could see.

363
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,140
I've kept of it, kept it in there just so I could mention them.

364
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:40,320
And as soon as we saw that, we called the emergency center and said, your patient has to report, really, how do you know?

365
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,770
Well, it's not hard and. OK.

366
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:54,280
Here's some more on the individual segments it was it was really big, and this was just part of it.

367
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:03,310
OK, I talked about the school being different on the solium versus sage and so on solium,

368
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:09,670
you can see this looks like this little thing is growing a beard and surgeon order does not have that.

369
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:19,030
Okay, so they all have these things that look like eyeballs, but look for this, if it's a solium, it'll be a solium if it has this school.

370
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:24,510
I mean, the entire head is the Skull X and then it has this little furry thing.

371
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,790
OK. I feel bad three later.

372
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:41,080
OK. These are the Pro Bowl ads. And this differentiates them from other organisms.

373
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:48,020
And the problem is that they fill the bathroom, laid them are big, you would never miss them, never.

374
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,180
Not something that you have to see on a microscope.

375
00:45:52,180 --> 00:46:01,660
So yet another parasite, you kind of caucus, so kind of caucus, we're going to start here at number one at the top.

376
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,490
The adult in the small intestine. Now the adult is not that big.

377
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:16,430
OK, it might be about this big. OK. The school, which is the mouth part, attaches to the intestine.

378
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:24,780
I am going the wrong way. Got to go this way. The adult in the small intestine sheds its embryo and eggs.

379
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,510
And the atmosphere has just from this egg,

380
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:35,730
this anxious fear hatches and then penetrates the intestinal wall gets into not just on the outside of the intestinal wall,

381
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:43,200
gets into the intestinal wall and then it forms a high hydrated cyst and a

382
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,090
high dialysis can be big enough that the patient's entire abdomen swells up.

383
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:54,450
That's how big they can be. And it can be in the liver, the lungs, wherever that worm is.

384
00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:01,080
That's where the high dialysis can form. If it's in the lungs, patient will have great difficulty breathing.

385
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,690
If it's in the liver, the liver function is going to be extremely abnormal.

386
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:12,750
OK, and it will not be missed. It will be large. It will not be missed from the hideout.

387
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:18,870
Insisted that it will release a personal X from the cyst.

388
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:25,570
Now, when the cyst ruptures, multiple other tissues can become infected.

389
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,110
OK, but then it will release a political exit from the system,

390
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:34,840
it's like this little heart thing and the school will become infectious on his own and

391
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:40,040
attach to the intestine and you go around again and you keep making more and more worse.

392
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,420
Yes. So I think the probably.

393
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:55,220
It's just that it's probably not in the center of the stomach where the food is being digested, it's probably in the tissues around it.

394
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:06,370
OK. Yeah. So I would never ask you a life cycle from from an animal other than humans, but you can see here we have gold.

395
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:10,410
We have ingestion of eggs and that can be sheep, goats,

396
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:20,230
swine and then ingestion of cysts by definitive hosts could be dogs, could be wolves, could be coyotes, whatever.

397
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:28,090
And it goes round and round and round again in nature. OK, not just in humans, but in nature also.

398
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:35,200
So this over here on the right hand side shows the ice shows you the different areas where OK,

399
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:44,350
so we can have it at its lowest in the brain and bone in the gallbladder.

400
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,380
We can have them all over the place here.

401
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:54,670
So you kind of feel kind of sick of this kind of psychosis is very, very serious because you never know where it's going to be in the body.

402
00:48:54,670 --> 00:49:01,240
Now, if it's in the liver patient's liver enzymes, liver tests will be abnormal.

403
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,950
If it's in the lungs, you will see a disturbance on a chest x ray.

404
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:11,080
Something there that should not be there and so on. Fortunately, we don't see this very often in the United States,

405
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:21,100
but we do have people coming in from other countries or who are not taking care of themselves and so on the ranch, they form whatever.

406
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:27,560
And then all of a sudden, they're incredibly sick.

407
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:43,890
So this is a hideout just high that it sends calming stay, so it looks like it looks right and you can see forms on the inside of that I sand.

408
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:56,750
So. Going on with intestinal helminths, we have three meetings and these are flukes, and I hope the many people here have heard about Schistosoma.

409
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:01,100
They can infect the lung, the liver and the blood.

410
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:09,350
OK, very, very important parasite. So there's.

411
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:14,980
Couple species are Schistosoma Schistosoma human terbium.

412
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:24,550
You can tell by the name they like likes the Blood Schistosoma japonica, guess where it was first identified in Japan and Schistosoma Manson am?

413
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:29,680
I have no idea how I got that name. I actually asked them and what was it from Charles Manson?

414
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,720
And they said No, it existed way before Charles Manson. So but they all look different.

415
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:43,990
OK, so look at Manson I. It's a large cell and it looks like it has a spike coming off one side that identifies it as Schistosoma mansoni.

416
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:53,910
If you look at hematoma, there's a spike coming off one end and japonica doesn't have any spikes.

417
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:58,980
So that's an easy way, if you're looking at a weapon, if you've got a very large egg,

418
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,240
you see a spike coming off one side, you say, Hey, where is this place you've been?

419
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:18,650
I think this is just the silver man's on. And even larger than this just arms, our first few laps, this blue sky and this is a petri plate.

420
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:25,170
Could you play through about it so you can imagine how big those eggs are?

421
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:34,130
OK. Clearly, you don't need a microscope to see them.

422
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:41,390
OK, we talked about a lot of different worms, parasites.

423
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:52,160
The ones in blood are obviously the most important military area, Bancroft low off anchor surface value less than three g of light.

424
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:58,100
And these are microfilm aerial nematodes that are transmitted by mosquitoes.

425
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:05,900
Another reason why we should get rid of all mosquitoes. We don't have these for the most part in the United States, certainly not in Michigan.

426
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:11,390
They may have them where there's a lot of rain and a lot of water, maybe in southeastern,

427
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:16,040
but I think pretty much we have gotten rid of these in the United States.

428
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:22,140
They may still be a few, but not very many, but other countries have a lot.

429
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:31,560
So this is Bruja. And I want to point out that the most of the body ends right here.

430
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:38,850
You can see this long tail with nothing in it. That is an identification factor.

431
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:47,190
OK? And what you would do to identify this is measure the length of the worm as best you could because it never laid out straight.

432
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:56,190
Measure the length. And when you look to see which stain. Where does the intestinal body and and how long is that tail?

433
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:04,060
OK. And that will help the laboratory identify it.

434
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:09,610
And this is a literary Bancroft, a flair for MRV, and you can see again,

435
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:15,040
you've got the head right here and you don't see the interior components right where they start about right here.

436
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:21,800
But look at this tail and here it actually stops, and then they've got this tissue that hangs down.

437
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:31,360
That's a filler form larvae. And so if you see something like this, you can measure the size if it's shed from a human.

438
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:39,670
Put it in a petri dish and you know, with a nightclub, you spread it out so you can measure the length and then do a stain using it and look at

439
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:50,500
it using a regular scope or a dissecting scope and see what you see at the tail end.

440
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,910
So with all these pictures, how do we diagnose in the lab?

441
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:59,620
Well, to be perfectly honest, we don't see very many of them in the laboratory.

442
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:05,260
We see a lot of proficiency specimens. We have to proficiency testing multiple times a year.

443
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:10,510
So we see them in proficiency specimens, so we know we can identify them if they show up.

444
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:18,250
But very few of them exist here in the United States, mostly in underserved areas of other other parts of the world.

445
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:26,110
So when you get a call and we get a call in the lab, as we did with that tapeworm, where do we send you?

446
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:33,040
Well, certainly the worm. How do you how are we going to send you that worm in a sterile container with a top that closes securely?

447
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,910
Put it in there, add a few drops of sailing and walk it to the lab.

448
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:45,160
Do not put it in the tube system ever because if it's not secured by.

449
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,320
Spread out like that.

450
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:56,140
So a specimen collection stool, because many of these are intestinal blood tissue CSF, it just depends on the clinical presentation.

451
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:02,180
I cannot tell you that this one is always in the stool and never any place else. It just depends.

452
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:06,350
Many parasites cannot survive outside of the host.

453
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:14,230
So once they're shed by the host, most of them are dead. We can still identify them, but most of them are dead.

454
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:19,930
Quickly, quickly transport to the laboratory, if you get somebody to walk to the lab, that's fine.

455
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:29,410
Or use transport. If you have to use transport, say, from a physician office, they have to be in preservative so they're killed.

456
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:35,110
So we have to make sure that when we get a call on that, you all call and say, Hey,

457
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:42,100
I've got a doctor told me about a possible intestinal parasite, maybe a warm remain.

458
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:49,570
We need to identify the organism based on the morphology, the structure of that organism, so we need to maintain that structure.

459
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:53,950
And if we need to, we need to ship it to the laboratory.

460
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:59,410
Have it shipped to the laboratory with in formalin that will kill the organism,

461
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:04,960
which is a good thing, and it will fix the morphology so that it doesn't change.

462
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:18,060
OK. So what do we do for specimen processing, we're going to concentrate the specimen to increase the sensitivity so that we can pick up more.

463
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:23,910
Now, if it's a stool specimen, we can't immediately concentrate the stool specimen.

464
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:29,430
There would be too much other particulate matter in the stool specimen so that we have.

465
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:33,450
There are procedures for cleaning up a stool specimen to do parasitology.

466
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:37,830
But for anything else, we're going to concentrate on the spinal fluid or any other body fluid.

467
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,470
We're going to spin it down to concentrate it.

468
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:49,860
We will stain to enhance the contrast and to differentiate it from nonpathogenic material because anything that with a parasite

469
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:58,860
is going to have other material from the body and it all in the in the specimen also and do a microscopic examination.

470
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,330
And I will tell you, sometimes this process takes a little bit of time.

471
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:09,990
Yes, we understand that the patient might be in the easy way to go home, but we can't.

472
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:14,370
The lab cannot report something until they are sure of the identification.

473
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:21,750
So sometimes it's just a little bit of a waiting game in the lab will tell you, Hey, we think this is what it is,

474
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:27,360
but we have to send it out to the state or to another laboratory to get a final identification.

475
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:36,170
Just depends on the lab and how much parasitology they do.

476
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:46,550
So how do we approach identification of these lonely organisms? So if it's an intestinal believed to be an intestinal infection,

477
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:53,120
we will get a stool specimen sent from the lab and the stool specimen will be sent to so

478
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,800
that it will kill everything the container standardized containers will have for year.

479
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:05,510
We can do a if we get a stool without formalin, we can do a direct worm out to detect any model organisms.

480
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:09,500
But generally all stool specimens come to the laboratory in formalin.

481
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,270
Now, if we get a call from the AEC, hey, we've got a patient. We think they've got parasitic infections.

482
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:25,130
How do we send this? We may say send it both in formalin and then just in a secure, capped specimen container so we can look at it both ways.

483
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:29,450
OK, so we're going to do a wet mount soon as we get it to see if we see anything,

484
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:33,170
particularly if anything moral of not in formalin, anything that's swimming around.

485
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:39,200
That helps a lot where they're going to process the stool specimen to get rid of all of as much

486
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,000
of the particulate matter as possible as we would for any stool specimen that wouldn't do,

487
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,160
first of all, John. And then we look at it with a wet prep and with a wet prep.

488
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,470
We don't, as you say, we use iodide to stay in the parasites,

489
00:58:54,470 --> 00:59:00,230
and that will help us visualize as it shows and says, the toxicity of the helminths and so on.

490
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,610
And then we'll do a permanent stain.

491
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:09,500
And that means putting some of that process store material on the slide, letting it dry generally for several hours.

492
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:16,070
So probably overnight and then fixing it the next day and staining at that day.

493
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:21,800
We may get it ready within 48 hours or something like that, but it's a process for fixing it,

494
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:27,260
making sure that it's totally dry before we do any staining.

495
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:34,400
Permanent stain. Okay, so the purpose is is to visualize protozoan cysts, capacity, eggs and larvae.

496
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,650
And then the permanent is usually a trifle or an iron hematoxylin that I don't think as many labs do.

497
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:46,440
Our human cancers do try, but either can be used. They both work very well to look for trophies awards.

498
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:53,610
OK, and then we're going to look for modified use, a modified acid fasting on another slide,

499
00:59:53,610 --> 01:00:01,140
which is like an acid fasting that we use for acid first bacteria, except it has a weaker de colorization.

500
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:08,630
OK. And that will help us look for cryptosporidium and cyclospora because they're both modified acid fast positive.

501
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:19,700
If it's a you suspect pinwheel on this little kid, they're scratching their rear end scotch tape prep to the laboratory sent securely.

502
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:28,790
It's a scotch tape. This basically you take a glass slide, Europe's scotch tape around the slide with the sticky side on the outside,

503
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:37,310
and then you use that to gather a sample from the anal folds and send that to the laboratory, generally in a specimen container.

504
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:42,630
Screw on cap so nothing can get out. These weren't pals.

505
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:48,950
If they have them, there have been shortages of them periodically.

506
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:54,920
There's shortages of everything nowadays, but the panel and panels are great, you don't have to wrap the tape around the slide.

507
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,810
If you have, definitely use them. Yeah, good point.

508
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:06,740
OK, so we can do a Scotch tape prep or a pin one pal of a Perry Inlet area to look for pin worms.

509
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:12,920
OK. So what does my ideal specimen collection?

510
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:20,870
We want a total of three specimens, but not collect at all one time, not collect it all in one day plus in every other day.

511
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:28,330
OK? Because there's a chance that the worms or whatever is in that patient are not being shed continually.

512
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:35,210
If you collect them on different times, on different days, you have a greater chance of getting a positive.

513
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:38,870
Don't use laxative on the first two. Patients say they can't go well.

514
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:45,560
Try eating fruit. The relaxes really in interfere with things.

515
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:52,550
But if patients had two specimens, they're not showing anything and we're not getting much fecal material either.

516
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:58,190
Then have the patient use a laxative unless, of course, unless they have diarrhea?

517
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:04,490
And if you're looking for esthetic 'cause sometimes it's hard to visualize, it's be very difficult to visualize.

518
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:10,400
And so instead of three specimens, not had a positive and three specimens collect another three,

519
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,940
but stop after six and do not collect one specimen and divide it into six containers.

520
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:24,990
That doesn't help anybody, does it right? Runs up the cost of doing it.

521
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:35,950
Next slide. So with different types of exams, we have a complete OMP now we're going to look for everything, OK, if they can,

522
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:44,460
the the provider can request special stains if they know about special stains most I.D. physicians do.

523
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:51,240
So if they're thinking about Cyclospora or cryptosporidium or head of this group.

524
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:57,580
Really, cryptosporidium is the most common one we would use and acid testing routinely the Paris.

525
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:03,720
The procedures are written to include an acid fasting. If you're looking for Cryptosporidium.

526
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:11,100
As well as I suspect disciples were, so if we have some idea of what the physician is thinking about,

527
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:16,920
it really does help in the laboratory and then a strong program, which is a variety of attractions.

528
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:25,440
We look for Microscope Meridia. There are other assets out there where we don't have to do all the maleka, all the microscopic.

529
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,750
There are a license to look for, particularly for DRDO.

530
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:37,110
The most common one. But now there are wonderful molecular assays for diarrhea,

531
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:45,810
and they may include multiple looking for multiple organisms, whether they're bacteria, parasites or viruses.

532
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:55,800
So some labs that have really gone into molecular testing big time, such as Henry Ford, U of M Detroit Medical Center, Beaumont and so on,

533
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:01,140
are using these assays molecular assays to look for parasites so they don't have to spend really

534
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:06,900
very expensive hours of technologists sitting at the microscope for hours every day reading slides.

535
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:14,330
They can do a microscopic thing. I mean, don't do it molecularly.

536
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:18,440
OK. So how do we want, we want.

537
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:25,840
We want to be able to diagnose what is the patient specimens, so we want optimal testing,

538
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:35,450
the best accomplished by collection of three stools on three separate days or alternate days, if necessary, one stool after purging with a laxative.

539
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:39,610
But hopefully that's not necessary because the patient, if they've got a worm or a parasite,

540
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:44,840
they should have some diarrhea three stools cluttered with within 24 hours.

541
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:59,380
Not all seen time, space amount and maybe one stool tested by a molecular assay or an enzyme immunoassay.

542
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:08,590
Excellent. So this is a picture taken of a Scotch tape, perhaps a camera, and that is what we would see.

543
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:14,470
And this was not the little panel, but the actual scotch tape because you had to be able to take a picture of it.

544
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:25,460
And these are all words. And that's an easy diagnosis, if you if you get a positive, it's really easy.

545
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:33,650
So how do we approach identification? There's organisms all over the board that the know people have to be able to recognize.

546
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:37,460
You ever go into an area of the lab where they do parasitology?

547
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:43,430
There will be pictures on the walls, pictures on the on the cabinets of different worms.

548
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:48,200
Different parasites. Just for reference and lots of reference material.

549
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:57,310
So for urogenital tract specimens. You were mostly interested in on us,

550
01:05:57,310 --> 01:06:03,340
and we want an unfixed specimen submitted in sailing because we want to identify

551
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:06,760
the mobile technologies that are there and if we could see them swimming around,

552
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:16,340
that makes it much easier. They have to be sent to the lab and they have to be looked at within one hour of collection because they start to die out.

553
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:23,840
They die out. They're not swimming around. You don't see them as easily. So that is a rapid transport to the laboratory.

554
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,100
If it's sputum, we don't see very many parasites in sputum.

555
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:35,180
But we may see the migrating larval stages of growth instructional ways which.

556
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:41,630
It really sounds gross to think that you can have a parasite come up and then be swallowed back down.

557
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:51,510
But it happens. So we would examine under a diagram state and look at it very carefully.

558
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:58,160
We don't have to use oil it clearly because their lives where we want them migrating larval stages, if we can pick it up that way.

559
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:07,670
That's an identification. Otherwise, we have to do a parasitic exam on the which we can do.

560
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:12,500
So what about blood, what about malaria or other blood borne parasites?

561
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:22,970
We use either games or hematoxylin. Hematoxylin is used routinely in your histology laboratory hematology lab, but we can do IMSA also.

562
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:30,680
We make a thin film and a thick film, and we don't just make one slightly combining two or three sides of each in case one doesn't turn out well.

563
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,310
We'll stay in them all and look at all the thin films.

564
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:42,620
We scan the whole thing at 10X, which is a low objective. And then we're going to review three hundred field minimum of three hundred,

565
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:50,870
count them under oil on the feathered edge, which is this is the feathered edge over here.

566
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:58,880
The thick films are what we see with just a drop of blood. On the slide, you scan the whole thing about 10X, which is your low power objective,

567
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:09,960
and then you review 100 fields going criss cross across these slides to make sure you didn't miss anything.

568
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:22,520
So. Something to think about microscopic exam of an unfixed first specimen is best for these groups of organisms for assists.

569
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:31,380
The eggs. Troves. Cysts, helminth, lava, they can be very long and helminth eggs.

570
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:38,880
OK. That's the the best things that we can see microscopically and unfixed and unstained.

571
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,040
Otherwise, we have to stay in them and they take a little bit longer. And when we when we do parasitology,

572
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:50,040
we'll look at on stage just make your smear with some sailing for the covers that want to see if you can see anything.

573
01:08:50,040 --> 01:09:02,490
We also make two other two or three other slides. Always an extra one one for another iodide prep and one for staining.

574
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:13,130
So if we if we see something anything and they're just convinced that we can look at the stain one and and, um, determine if anything is present.

575
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:23,510
So formulate ethyl acetate sedimentation is commonly used in the lab, used to be formal formal in either concentration, but we now use ethyl acetate.

576
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:28,220
It is the usual means of concentrating a specimen.

577
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:37,820
So we use both formula methyl acid formalin helps to decontaminate the specimen and makes it less infectious for the people who are working with it.

578
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:43,310
We do wear gloves, we do wear masks, a lab coat. We do it all in a, you know, laminar flow hood.

579
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:51,770
But still, it can be a problem. And then the Everlast tape traps particulate matter and debris and extracts the fat from feces.

580
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:57,200
And so then after you mix it up with the formalin everlasting, you let it sit for a little while,

581
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:03,080
then spin it down and you want to put your pipe hat all the way down into the bottom

582
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:09,830
of the tube of the microfiche tube and get some of this to make a slide with.

583
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:18,620
OK. That it is very easy to do this procedure, every lab doing parasitology will do this if they're not doing the molecular assay for it.

584
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:27,900
And so this is very easy to for optimal recovery of organisms.

585
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:38,160
So how do we approach ID? Well, for Acanthamoeba, it's not the stool specimens, so we have to do something else.

586
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:45,570
And what we do is we do cultures very carefully and what we do is we grow a lot of E. coli on solid medium,

587
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:53,940
just like on a regular Ozgur plate, but just does not have blood in it, just regular order.

588
01:10:53,940 --> 01:11:00,690
We grow some E.coli on it overnight and we put the specimen for Acanthamoeba.

589
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:05,820
Generally, it's fluid from the eye on that plate.

590
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:13,290
So we've had an entire line of E. coli growing there and we incubated the drop of fluid on that plate.

591
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:20,730
And if if it can't be was there, it will eat the E. coli and you can see no colonies there.

592
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:26,760
It's amazing. So the amoeba use bacteria is food, and then we can see that they there.

593
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:34,780
We can actually put the plate. It's a clear auger. We put the plate on a dissecting scope and see if there's anything there.

594
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:43,810
So we'll see how much you remember which of the following heads are not or percolated.

595
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:54,760
If anybody has an idea, speak up. I'm not going to tell you.

596
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:02,490
You have to go back and read your notes. OK, but you do need to know which ones are circulated.

597
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:07,890
Oh, look, gosh, I'm going to tell you right now, OK?

598
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:13,380
These are the ones that are percolating by size and Fashola and fashion losses are huge.

599
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:19,230
They're just huge. So corner office is the smallest. You can see the little column right there.

600
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:28,120
Then delete them. And then we see Paragon Imus, which is larger 90 microns.

601
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,470
And then Fashola, Fashola, hip hop and fans, she loves this sky.

602
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:37,620
You can see the perfume there. You almost don't need a microscope.

603
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:45,230
They're so large. OK, so those are the percolated eggs.

604
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:50,720
And once again, this chart from CDC, I keep using it all the time.

605
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:59,390
OK. Another example have question what purpose this formula to serve in the transport of specimens for parasitology A, B,

606
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:07,220
C or D stands organisms, enhances contrast, selects against contaminating organisms, preserves morphology and decontaminated.

607
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:16,340
The specimen provides nutrients during transport. If anybody answers do you or you have to retake the test, you take the class.

608
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:25,790
Which one is the sea? Yes, there is morphology and decontaminate the specimen form and will not stain anything,

609
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:32,480
and it may mildly enhance the contrast only by getting rid of other things that might be there,

610
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:40,160
but really, it prefers preserves, morphology and decontaminate. OK.

611
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,630
Let's talk a little bit about permanently stained smears meant them.

612
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:53,520
It's mandatory College of American Pathology who license laboratories to do different types of testing if you're doing told,

613
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,290
you have to do permanently stained smears.

614
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:04,430
Allows for confirmation of your wet prep, you may see things on a wet prep, but you will see the much better honest, permanently stained smear.

615
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:09,320
You examine it under oil and most oil immersion lens or a 100 X.

616
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:16,010
Sometimes there 50 X, but most of them are 100 X helps you to identify a giant amoeba fragilis and blast my see.

617
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:23,180
You will not see them without oil and be very, very difficult to see them. So the permanently stain smeared you can use other stains,

618
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:29,150
but the most is the one that's generally used most as a try from some labs like iron, hematoxylin.

619
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:35,930
Some, like you could say, but I think most of them like the try crochet, try chrome stain.

620
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:43,260
It's good. So here's another flowchart parasitic investigation of stool specimens, the algorithm.

621
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:48,900
So we're going to start here watery diarrhea in patients who have AIDS.

622
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,620
Happens very commonly in patients with AIDS. Have contact with farm animals.

623
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:57,780
Are involved in an outbreak of either a municipal water supply or daycare centers.

624
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:05,440
What are we going to look for? Cryptosporidium? If it's positive, you don't need to do any other work, you're done.

625
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:14,620
If it's negative, you follow this line and the diarrhea persists to a specific exam for micro Spreadtrum and or Cyclospora.

626
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:21,940
OK, come over here in the middle. Watery diarrhea in patients who are less than five years old are campers or backpackers,

627
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:27,940
are involved in outbreak in a resort community or daycare centers. There are a lot of outbreaks and daycare centers.

628
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:35,740
What are we going to look for? Is to RDA the most common? And here, if it's positive antigen positive, we don't have to do anything else.

629
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:43,030
If it's negative and the diarrhea persists, you probably want to look for some cryptosporidium also.

630
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:46,480
We also know you could just do an order a complete parasitic exam,

631
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:53,530
celestial specimen of the lab in parasitology, transport and the lab will do the full work up.

632
01:15:53,530 --> 01:16:03,910
I'll take a couple of days if a positive organism is identified and you're done if it's negative.

633
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,730
Probably no parasite there down here.

634
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:14,680
If we come down here from cryptosporidium and it's negative, diarrhea persists, you have to do a microscopic exam.

635
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:22,380
But this complete parasitic exam, if it is negative on one, you may want to have another specimen or two submitted.

636
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:28,570
Generally, the submitted two or three at a time, but separated by a couple of days for each specimen.

637
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:35,260
That would be the best way to go. Now, if the patient is a resident or a visitor to a developing country,

638
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:41,440
a resident or a visitor to an area of North America, a helminth have been reported.

639
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:47,050
You can also do a visual exam of the gross stool to see if you see any probiotics or any worms.

640
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:56,830
Now, the person ordering the test has to let the lab know that patients from a visitor from a developing country or something like that.

641
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:04,270
Otherwise the lab will just do their routine procedure. OK.

642
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:09,880
Those are internal parasites now, ecto parasites. How are we doing on time?

643
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:14,230
We have 10 minutes left times by 50 by 50. Yeah, yeah.

644
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:19,480
You know what? I'm going to stop right here from the stop with actual parasites.

645
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:26,160
You all are going to be on spring break studying for the entire week, I know and come back and take the test on Monday.

646
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:35,340
Yes. A few questions. OK, well, let's say we simply say, OK, come back to the test on Monday when you come back.

647
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:40,750
And then after that, we'll start at ecto parasites. OK. OK, your questions.

648
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:49,960
First question is, I believe somebody at the last election in the U.S. election examined who said you didn't know yet.

649
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:55,520
You know, you know, I didn't even think about that. I will put it.

650
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:02,050
It's not as though it's not the sole this I don't think I will. I don't think I will.

651
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:08,370
Next question, next question. OK. Should we memorize the life cycles of all the parasites and said you?

652
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:14,310
Not the entire life cycle, but if you have to diagnose it, what kind of specimen are you going to be looking for?

653
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:18,330
That's part of the life cycle. Where is it acquired? Is it in the United States?

654
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:26,760
Is it someplace else? But you can. That's probably the merits of know step one, step two step process in their own right.

655
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:30,950
Well, they used to be in time and everything else was. Seriously.

656
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:36,500
Yeah. Yeah. They're not on this exam, they're not on this exam that's coming up.

657
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right.

658
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:46,990
So they're so.

659
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:51,510
What about your question? Did I answered?

660
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:58,170
He said no. Yeah, the life cycle. You just need to know that if you look for what to look for and what would make the patient come in,

661
01:18:58,170 --> 01:19:05,460
what would the doctor think about where we traveled? You know what your job, you know, right?

662
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:09,630
Continue on in that area. And I never question, what are you guess?

663
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:16,570
Well, they have a. And he said, I can find one.

664
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:25,780
Feels like. Some of the fun here. The populated eggs, can you see this little room here is like a little opening.

665
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,620
It's like a little cap on the egg. You can see it really well right here. OK?

666
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:34,600
What does that mean just to have it? They have it.

667
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:43,510
They have it because there's very few arms that are from Morgan, very few organisms that have a percolated eggs.

668
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:50,160
So if you remember these five, you got it.

669
01:19:50,160 --> 01:20:03,280
Well, I was a little camper, actually. If you press down on the I will open up and God's will come out.

670
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:14,420
Any other questions? I mean, I mean, what you're up to this morning.

671
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:24,300
I haven't looked at the exam for this one, so I will put a note on the website, whether that includes parasites, I haven't actually.

672
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:38,400
Examined from previous years. OK, I'm trying to keep this the same as previous years, so I will look at it and I will put it on the website.

673
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:46,170
Any other questions? I hope you all have a wonderful spring break.

674
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:50,280
Please do not get sick. Please, please, please stay healthy travel.

675
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,940
Have a great time. Oh yes.

676
01:20:53,940 --> 01:21:02,520
Yes. Yes, yes. OK, gather your stuff up another party name.

677
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:14,400
OK. Mallika. Mohammed.

678
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:27,570
Genevieve? Scarlett.

679
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:33,090
Well, all right. Yes, thank you.

680
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:43,218
Libby.
