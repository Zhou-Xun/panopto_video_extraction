1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,290
It's a great lesson.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,880
I really like the first look.

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:30,030
You don't really like it, but I feel like you're not going to tell that to me.

4
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:38,250
I don't have to deal with everything I know, but at the end, it was the last time I saw you.

5
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,300
What do you get ready for your invitation?

6
00:00:44,310 --> 00:01:00,480
It's just, you know, I think I have a choice if I don't like it.

7
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:10,550
How long are you doing something else? It's not so easy to find someone like you.

8
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:28,410
What's going on? I have no idea.

9
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,780
What's this? Yes.

10
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:55,290
This letter looks like he's crazy, but it just looks so good to me.

11
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:02,300
Yeah, I like that. Oh, you see what I mean?

12
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,540
You playmaker. She's like, Well, okay.

13
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,429
Welcome back, everybody. I hope you all had a nice American Thanksgiving already the last couple of weeks.

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:20,129
Classes for me to finish up for this year. So let me start with something I usually would finish the pre-Thanksgiving question on,

15
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,160
which is this question So do you think the tryptophan in turkey meets you?

16
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,920
Sleeping is a very common thing. You give up on various kinds of things like that.

17
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:38,219
So yeah, okay.

18
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,170
So, so the answer is almost certainly no, but I'm going to walk you through this.

19
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,520
This is going to lead us into today's lecture and not for a lecture at next week's lecture.

20
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,870
So the fundamental basis for why people thought this in the first place was this so tryptophan which is here,

21
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:06,719
but here is the top lysed metabolized into a bunch of different things, including serotonin and eventually melatonin, which is which is down here.

22
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,170
And melatonin is very, very, very important for the onset of sleep.

23
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,740
So this is your global melatonin cycle. And so it's like one on one drops when they go off to the arises.

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,090
So it's important for the onset of this group. Here's a group that was visible development of the group that was kept in in lights.

25
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,660
And it's melatonin surfaces, particularly in the back.

26
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,610
So we'll we'll talk more about in this and asleep that's why people sort of

27
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,219
thought that maybe the melatonin event is just another reason that's not true.

28
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,610
And again, we'll talk about this in a couple of classes is for tourism.

29
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:50,249
So first of all, there actually isn't there's a little bit more on sorry tryptophan in Turkey than there is in other means, but not a slight increase.

30
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,880
That might not be. But the general thing is there's this misperception in general where people think that if you have enough of the precursor,

31
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,120
you're going to get more of the of the product. Right.

32
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,560
So you might read things about, oh,

33
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:08,040
you can definitely by piracy and they'll salt food store and they'll say things like piracy will improve your mood.

34
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,010
And that's because car seats a precursor. But what I'll tell you today and I'll remind you of the two classes,

35
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,290
is that usually this is not rate limiting on the amount of that amino acid, none of that amino acid, it would be eliminated.

36
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:27,690
But very few people have acid. Usually if you have the amino acid, this pathway occurs more closely for mechanism, not through a regulation of system.

37
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,760
So just the presence of trip and there's no evidence that increases the amount of serotonin or melatonin

38
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,280
in your in your body and should not make your sleep because you like 5000 calories of a pie and then,

39
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,450
what, 4.4, 7 hours or at least cents?

40
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:50,130
Okay. So moving on to today's lecture, which is protein, somebody noted very hopefully there is a pretty big error in the notes,

41
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,110
which I mentioned a perusal, but I don't know if you are always reading my comments on perusal.

42
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,940
So there's a line here that talks about kind of trips that attend and it's specificity, that specificity.

43
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,710
Is wrong in the notes it should be tiger seed penicillin encrypted, which are the large aromatic amino acids.

44
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:12,850
And then technically in Title Trypsin, a gene has almost no actually final trypsin the act of virtue of 19 that exactly.

45
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,630
So I could update that in the PDFs for future years but it will be wrong for you this year and this will come up for an activity later today.

46
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,070
So thank you for one letter. Okay.

47
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,210
So today we're going to talk about food, protein, digestion and transport.

48
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,169
As you know, we've got a lot of protein from our diet.

49
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:38,799
And what you may not think of is that there's also a lot of protein that we get from our bodies that we are recycling.

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,320
So I'm removing all of this as endogenous protein.

51
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,740
So every single thing that we've talked about this semester in the digestive unit where you secrete something in the gastrointestinal tract,

52
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,340
virtually every single one of those things except for vital salts, are protein.

53
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,940
Now those proteins can be recycled. So, for example, if you take gasoline, which is secreted into the stomach,

54
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,030
that gastric is a protein and that Catherine is eventually can be broken down in your digestive tract just because,

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,899
like every other protein, it can be broken down your digestive tract and it can be reused.

56
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,389
So this is one way that we maintain protein balance, is that we keep recycling endogenous proteins.

57
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,120
So this can be protein secreted into the gastrointestinal tract,

58
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,469
it could be cells in the gastrointestinal tract that are slopped up and then broken down.

59
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,420
They can be digested secretions. Mucus is a glycoprotein, so that is also an indigenous company.

60
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:33,700
So while we get about somewhere about 55 grams of protein per day from our diet, the endogenous exocrine is combined is about 115 to 200.

61
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,179
So some are similar to cholesterol and steady state.

62
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,690
The majority of our protein that we're actually absorbing is actually this endogenous protein, not necessarily the exogenous protein.

63
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,240
Now, of course, because these proteins are limited, we still do need a substantial amount of exogenous protein,

64
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,020
which is where it sort of differs from from cholesterol. So just kind of keep that in mind where we talk about synergy, that is how a protein,

65
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,340
once it's in your gastrointestinal tract, behaves like pretty much every other person you can digest, absorb and recycle.

66
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:08,290
If you couldn't, we would have to eat a lot more protein, about five times more protein per day, depending on the person.

67
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,709
Okay, so I mentioned this last class. There's sort of three different ways, I think, when you think about protein quality.

68
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,830
So one is, is this protein digest and I use that way versus case in example, what is the amino acid profile?

69
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,980
How complete is it and what is the reading part of the protein package?

70
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,730
Now, the protein package is pretty variable, right? So does it have iron? Does it have fiber?

71
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,930
Is there calcium there? Those are all things that maybe may or may not be a form of.

72
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,290
Those are pretty context dependent. The first two are pretty easy to quantify.

73
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,820
How digestible is the protein you can measure? And what is even wise is the protein you can also measure.

74
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,320
And there's a variety of metrics that have been used over the years to determine the first two of these,

75
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:54,720
the protein efficiency ratio of protein, digestible completeness, amino acid scale and digestible amino acid scale.

76
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,050
Yeah, I stands for maybe it's just not accessible, digestible, indispensable.

77
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,890
These are all metrics you can use for any given protein to kind of figure out the quality of it.

78
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,900
So the one that is the best one, the one that people use most often is the as a scale.

79
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,610
And so for eating, the way it works is you take each of the essential amino acids and really you can

80
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,479
limit it to the essential amino acids that are most limiting in the foods we consume,

81
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,850
which are lysine, tryptophan, treating and violence.

82
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:35,200
You figure out what is the requirement, what is the amino acid, how much of that amino acid is in the food times, how digestible it is.

83
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,940
So that's kind of how bioavailable is.

84
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,480
And then you take the lowest number of those and you compare it to sort of each dependent reference pattern, right?

85
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,430
Because what matters is what is the least obvious one.

86
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:53,500
So here's an example of a calculation of this value here where you can see that this is looking at milk powder.

87
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,500
Here's the levels of lysine, which is sulfur containing amino acids, which is binding 16 trillion.

88
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,990
And you can see they're at pretty different levels. This most proteins have a lot more lysine than they do tryptophan.

89
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,790
If you look at the digestibility, this is no powder, so that it's more like 95% digestible,

90
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,970
which means that if you look at lysine, 74 of the 78 milligrams of lysine are bioavailable.

91
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,070
So that's this column here. And if you compare that to the reference pattern for an adult which is down here,

92
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:27,160
you can see we only need 48 milligrams per gram of lysine as an adult.

93
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,510
And these ratios in numbers change as you grow. If you take 74 divided by 48, you get 1.54.

94
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:41,469
So that is the reference adjusted amino acid availability for lysine for that for that protein

95
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,400
source from a and then you repeat that with the other amino acids and you take the lowest number,

96
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,720
which in this case is the thiamin or cysteine, which is 1.43.

97
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,260
And that makes this the highest score 143.

98
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:59,620
Right? So that means 143, which is very, very good because this is a very abundant limiting amino acid, which is very, very digestible.

99
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,290
That's a very, very good quality protein source milk, good quality processes.

100
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:13,799
So here's some more examples here. So again, this is the protein content you can and shortly will be able to look this up on various food databases.

101
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,760
You can figure out how much of this and this is in milligrams will be utilized per gram of protein, not for a gram of food, but for brand of protein.

102
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:30,060
And you can see these very if you look here, for example, soy is quite digestible compared to wheat is not that digestible.

103
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,440
So when you multiply this by this, you can see these numbers now very mostly for wheat.

104
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,440
This is driven by the very poor digestibility. Then you look at the reference ranges which are the same for all adults,

105
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,159
and now you can see if for wheat the limiting amino acid is lysine 25 because it

106
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,360
is not that abundant compared to the other ones and also not that digestible.

107
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,190
So this has a very low. Yeah, right.

108
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,590
So that score is 25. You always take the lowest number is the overall score.

109
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,440
Now Kodiak, I know if you've seen these Kodiak pancakes, whatever, they're like protein rich pancakes, they use wheat protein.

110
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,780
So even though they have a lot of protein, it is the lowest quality protein of the four that I'm showing you here.

111
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:18,590
So you can pick that up a little bit. But I was curious because I had those packets for the Thanksgiving weekend and that is their different sources.

112
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,409
So hopefully this can give you a sense of how to calculate this.

113
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,870
And with this you should be able to calculate the score for every single any single protein.

114
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,200
So that's what we're going to spend the next 15 minutes on here.

115
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,010
So if you go to this link, which is a link we used last class as a group, what I want you to do is pick a protein source that you're interested in.

116
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:44,020
You'll pick one of the most likely to go to the answer to these, pick something else, and then you're going to calculate the score for that person.

117
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,760
For the way I recommend you do it is have the group start figuring out the composition.

118
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,910
The other half of the group do some Google searching to try to figure out an estimate

119
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,350
for how digestible it is and then spend about 5 minutes on those two parts.

120
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:02,730
Then together, come together and then run through the calculations based on your protein composition and the protein digestible,

121
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,120
and then calculate the dyad score for the unit.

122
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,560
Now if you really want an extra challenge because it seems too easy for you,

123
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,090
try to pick up with two complementary foods, like maybe you've got a 5060 mix of beans and greens.

124
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,390
You can do this for any any combination of foods or single food as well.

125
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:27,510
So to do that, I will circulate around while you work on that and try to spend 10 minutes or so on this on this activity.

126
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:41,990
Let's look at that. If you want to use a longer period of time.

127
00:12:42,880 --> 00:13:10,880
I was just not going need to be able to do this at this point, which is one that we're going to use to squeeze the story of this goes around.

128
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:21,980
We need to know what it is.

129
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:46,440
I don't know, because I think the reason why I don't know it out here, I think this is what I'm trying to show.

130
00:13:47,430 --> 00:14:03,930
Also, it's not like you might say, yeah, well, that's it's like restaurant time either tries a different one,

131
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:10,900
look at this video or if you can't buy it all.

132
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,610
So I will do. The U.S. plus three are going to find the digestibility the rest.

133
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:26,130
I'm going to say we need to have just, you know, Greek yogurt and Greek yogurt.

134
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:37,380
Greeks are pretty angry with you because there's a lot of really amazing things

135
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:46,860
about how the Netherlands could have come from seeing where that was going to be.

136
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:59,130
So we just want to make sure that we try to.

137
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:07,030
Which means we have to go. Yes, I think about it.

138
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:41,870
You don't have to just say, oh, I'm not going to do about 20% of those so normal or you know, how much time want you to tell your digestive enzymes.

139
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,500
It truly is how we don't have any particular reason.

140
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:05,920
It's the same with coffee. If we find something that I'm not going to do.

141
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:18,490
So one thing that's interesting, but that's the number is 4500.

142
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,900
But maybe we could find one, I hope the average out there.

143
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,240
I did you find a thing just on there?

144
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:46,750
I don't know. I know you're not.

145
00:16:47,330 --> 00:17:02,640
I just think I just have to talk to someone.

146
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,970
Yeah. And then what am I going to say?

147
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:21,230
Yeah, just giving up. He has never really had two years.

148
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:34,580
We will see how this works.

149
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,250
Yeah. Yeah.

150
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:57,830
So how are you guys doing? Composition. Which is why we write something that seems a little bit weird, but.

151
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,540
So are you going to do. You found one that has great sound.

152
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:15,440
It's just that I think it's a very sound, like a specific a thing.

153
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:25,450
Like how much about I don't know, what kind of yourself, how many three songs.

154
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,850
She's like, Yeah. So I was thinking about that.

155
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,510
So got 71. 71.

156
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh, I forget you don't you definitely don't want to do it because again, if you just did 771 milligrams kg,

157
00:18:53,210 --> 00:19:02,090
I think there's no way around right now for like when I was going into the criticism.

158
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,520
Yes. You're just going to in the way it's usually I think that's why over and over if you can't find it.

159
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,440
I believe there is some general things like that which would be nice.

160
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:26,089
But if you can find one that's actually doesn't really exist, if that's all you can do,

161
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:42,440
you think it should be able to just say, I'm usually, you know.

162
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,190
Yeah, I think so.

163
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,860
Yeah, think so.

164
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:02,130
Everything is protein. When she comes across.

165
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:09,590
I love this one. I do.

166
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,090
And you write that you can't find any. Meanwhile, he's someone else.

167
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,450
Do you want me to write? Yes.

168
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,860
Are you guys doing okay? That's fine.

169
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:40,540
Let's start with that one. So you're looking for a way to get this thing to happen right now.

170
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:53,840
So she's she's coverage right here, right?

171
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,500
So that's where they are.

172
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,080
So you need to do that.

173
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:23,710
So that would be 777.5 divided by one.

174
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:32,810
So we do this now as an annual thing. Like I said, right now.

175
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:48,400
Here we go. Oh, so if that were 45 divided by five, that's in America.

176
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:55,030
So are you watching the war?

177
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,930
So I've got tired of that.

178
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:16,710
Okay. Okay. So we were discussing what we wanted to do, but places with them.

179
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:34,600
Well, so some of the seriousness of the mystery, trying to figure out something like this.

180
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:44,130
Yeah, that causes a lot of momentum.

181
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:57,020
It's usually this is sort of like I just I just I just feel like this.

182
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,400
And you take this to the.

183
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,070
Yeah, I think so.

184
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:18,979
Yeah. That's pretty much what is the best that we know.

185
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,660
How are you doing tonight. Yeah.

186
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:33,950
So, I mean, I think that's the best advice as well.

187
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:42,770
So yeah, it's hard. It's like I was stuck in the 70 seconds.

188
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:50,600
So like most folks like that, they can adjust ratios.

189
00:23:51,320 --> 00:24:08,560
It is so we are using force in the order of those emails but like not all of these things.

190
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:24,770
Okay. Yeah, I guess sometimes I just feel like, you know, I mean, you know what I mean?

191
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:46,100
Yeah. I mean, I think it's very fitting that it was very specific.

192
00:24:49,310 --> 00:25:08,940
So we have these are we have like maybe that's like a confidence interval, you know, I think yeah, I was asking it's a one criticism point.

193
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,070
So you hear every single one from 1992.

194
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,890
Yeah. Now we can sometimes I'm trying. .39 is our number.

195
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,750
All right.

196
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:47,920
So let's get started with all the number one that's going to be using consequences for the good guys using this digest.

197
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,850
You've got bacteria, microbiome. It's not you weren't using it for energy.

198
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:17,830
So that's why it's not going to find it in 90% or just multiple, I want to say.

199
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:28,390
Yeah, well, I was so excited.

200
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:43,090
So you guys are under the calculations. I guess it's not that if they got the drugs and trying to clean my cheek to cheek.

201
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,350
How are easy to use?

202
00:26:50,350 --> 00:27:08,410
The same since she decided to quit, which is not technologically not oriented.

203
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,130
Everyone's telling a different sort of, you know, okay, I got it.

204
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:32,770
He's put on that. So I've just realized it's 0.3 milligrams per gram something.

205
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:46,050
What was your a.k.a doing the math. So that's 3000 with the by.

206
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:56,380
But then that has to be thought. You know about that.

207
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:11,190
Yeah. I don't know how you like that I guess. I don't know what you're exactly.

208
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:20,390
But also it means a lot of energy.

209
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,700
But I just like. I just it's like that with a three.

210
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:43,170
That's what you want is digestible. What are your kids are responsive, you know, just another thing.

211
00:28:43,280 --> 00:29:02,740
Yeah it's really a free because some people like like because somebody stole my house for 5 minutes online, you know?

212
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:16,180
I mean I think I know, I know the first four is 61.

213
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:47,770
I said, okay, so here's how do you really do with I the principles that you've got to and that's why, you know, like, what are we going to be like?

214
00:29:48,490 --> 00:30:00,930
So just like your son has a pretty good, just digestible, you know, just what is the class and you want it.

215
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,480
So it might be they have it somebody that I just want to have.

216
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:17,680
But if they have a little outlook by that time that like know.

217
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:44,880
You know, for some reason, this film here is like what we saw three times in countries like Turkey, which is amazing.

218
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,950
Okay. All right. So I realize not everybody's done.

219
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:58,100
So I will look at these tonight when I get home. And if it looks like there's a problem, I'll put comments on this doc and I'll try to tag two people.

220
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,560
If I figured out to where if you went wrong.

221
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:25,350
Certainly. Hello everyone.

222
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,280
So I will say anything. My little mini presentation.

223
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,479
And it's about a secret. Just a quick survey.

224
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,580
So how many of you will ever know things?

225
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:50,350
Me? And how many of you ever eat something very subcompact.

226
00:31:51,300 --> 00:32:00,470
Why? People are no reason some soybeans through some easy fermentation we all kind of which.

227
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,900
And as you can guess, the piece originally from Indonesia, my hometown,

228
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:17,200
the earliest reference I think I was following in that nation on the street in Central Java and if within it is called Sargentini.

229
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:25,240
And since then they've been historically been consume as an affordable staple search of the land in Malaysia.

230
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:43,200
I played that in 1922, I think Moon was brought to Japan and in 1936 it was working in India and fortunately in 1958 the Indonesians didn't.

231
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,340
Yet we were researching in collaboration with religious at Cornell University.

232
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:57,250
So maybe that's the reason why you guys have not been in the university.

233
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:05,080
So in the past. Indonesia has been in Indonesia,

234
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:14,979
labor has been considered as low class protein because it is cheap and abundant

235
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,080
supplies and accessible accessible by lower income people who cannot support me.

236
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,809
But there is like an initiative to change the mindset about the place.

237
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:31,570
So it has become more of a viable, sustainable and healthy land based product.

238
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:40,300
And one of the initiative is the Indonesian people movement, which promote the green marketing of the paper nationally,

239
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:47,410
and also Indonesian government plan to reestablish people in the school as an intangible cultural heritage.

240
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,850
So they're trying to show that the production methods are actually very friendly.

241
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:01,980
But these. My boss is the general one.

242
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:08,670
So the first one. Hmm. There is a process in sucking the soybean.

243
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,920
So this cooking process aimed to make the host easier to build.

244
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:26,340
So then in the other process, we can begin to use the soybean and also literally just acidification can happen in this process.

245
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:38,990
And Near the Edge will be his 4.8 to 5 in this process to prevent the growth of other unwanted organism of their dead.

246
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:49,160
This idea will be home manually by hand or mechanically, mechanically by all, some machine.

247
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:59,090
It is important because the resents also soybean hall in the finish think there is considerable feminine of their done.

248
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:09,070
The soybean is full for 20 to 45 minutes in the boiling process removes the role

249
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,790
flavor from the soybean and also eliminates pathogens in spoilage organisms

250
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:22,499
and then inoculate the soybean may reason was swarms and break into the minimally

251
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,020
anything or prepared that make an incubator before harvested membranes.

252
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:38,990
So the fermentation of reservoirs or easier in then is very very important because its facilitate the group of is a was.

253
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:51,150
On his own in the UK and there are many effects of the fermentation they made, for example, digesting or the amino acid.

254
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:58,260
They just leave it in the valley as it and reduce and nutrient levels like right then.

255
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,940
And producing vitamin B12 choosing doses.

256
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:18,970
So traditionally they would be wrapped in a banana leaf increase and they are signing activities and it means they think they reach the peak of the

257
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:29,459
definitely content earlier compared to other other materials required and also more about seven content and provides healthy and meaning aroma.

258
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,080
But in the modern day before that plastic bag is used to wrap,

259
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:42,390
they may because it is more convenient and it is accessible in multiple non tropical countries like United States.

260
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,139
Example in also in Brittany and now Sydney.

261
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:59,910
I think it is, but it is more slower to reach the peak of the known family and it provides cereal like and this

262
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:10,770
is the nutritional values of baby every 100 grams of them contains 20 40.3 grams of protein.

263
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:20,799
And as you can see. And people things are although the is is an essential amino acid.

264
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,380
So it is it can be considered to be completely.

265
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:40,030
So another one in the only is the Olympic Games because I think they also contain other genes that are present alongside the protein.

266
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:48,550
For example, the mineral I ran was for the young and also by the beginning of.

267
00:37:50,860 --> 00:38:00,550
Releases only one in animal or math. And also they be considered to be a good source of homeland security.

268
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:11,049
Many innocents. Denali debut was made with soybean.

269
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:20,170
But there are many variations. For example, between pay and looking.

270
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:30,989
We think because of these ingredients there is many differences in the nutritional content.

271
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,030
For example, GP They may have more fiber content.

272
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,430
You may, they may miss more amino acid lysine content in them.

273
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,729
I mean they may miss more family as well as in the onset.

274
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:50,110
And if you. For the health of people.

275
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:57,739
So it is related to the original content of their favorite simple things like calcium.

276
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:05,629
So you know like give the benefit to our one health and they pay has ice so they

277
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:14,060
fun they like mobility so it has protection effect to our device killer disease,

278
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:25,550
cancer, diabetes and obesity. And for its reading content, they make and give benefit to malnutrition and muscle recovery.

279
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:35,930
One of the most recent clinical trials in the May is the effects of think they produce these on elderly with cognitive impairment.

280
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,490
The study design is a randomized controlled trial with 93 subjects divided into three groups.

281
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:56,930
So the participants were elderly, more than 60 years old, and the value of the protection of or at least memory, you may recall, is under seven.

282
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:08,049
And the method is so neat is a jarring make acrobatics from the impact and give that to the participants.

283
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:14,660
For 12 weeks, the ABC provided the podium in the Sultan's agreement to only one.

284
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,360
Ramirez provided the order me and my sword.

285
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:29,320
Since Media and Control received Maltodextrin on the end, participants were urged to consuming any fragmented work to prevent bias.

286
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:36,079
And the result is they found that there is an improvement in memory.

287
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:49,299
Episodes is due and there was an intervention group and the way we receive that me from anything nearly anyone had

288
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:56,860
lower overall news or confirmed intervention on how their information they had a more significant effects for me.

289
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:07,850
And so maybe you thinking, but why why this is going to happen?

290
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:16,080
Because you're thinking that providing something better and it will help.

291
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:21,149
I learned that group. I am not. And since I learned mostly STEM motivation.

292
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:35,070
So that's the reason why maybe this can improve the cognitive ability and thinking about sustainability.

293
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:49,200
So it has the positive contribution to climate change compared to animal based products like meat or chicken and egg and milk.

294
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:59,040
So you can see from the video we can learn that I think that every business in this world pays around for one of them.

295
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:08,650
Me I'm doing fine. 2.5 fold that of chicken and around two fold that of eggs and also protein delivery,

296
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:20,310
efficiency greenhouse gases score of the when they do for me that of chicken in six and five point.

297
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:30,730
In Indonesia. We enjoyed the impact in our many of our fish farms.

298
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,190
So for example, we have the pipeline, which is, I think Bay,

299
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:44,220
and we also think between fish table and coconut milk because it's Labor Day and also we have the them.

300
00:42:46,520 --> 00:43:02,620
Okay. And any question. I have a question about kind of like the energy graph you showed, how it's better for the climate.

301
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,680
What did you see more specific about the climate?

302
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:15,850
But do you know what kind of measurements they used to see how they compared versus beef in terms of like output for farming or like water use?

303
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:31,630
Okay. So for example, I read the monthly, the second period, this new house ness emission, they calculate it by comparing the,

304
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:41,710
you know, like how many water meals on road is used for think me compared to the beef and also then they use something.

305
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,850
So the higher number means they're using less water. Yeah. Yeah.

306
00:43:48,850 --> 00:44:03,950
Because, you know, it compares to many, many reasons like how many grams of protein compared to be how many can get is produce from these.

307
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:17,200
I have a question. So you mentioned that in the preparation that normally it's permitted.

308
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,540
But then the study was looking at, I guess because it was like testing the effects of different probiotics.

309
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,100
Was it typical but it's fermented and stable? Or is it something like.

310
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:32,480
Sometimes it's fermented, sometimes not. I think a lot of the debates fermented, sort of impetuous.

311
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,490
That's what I was saying. Well, is it normally pasteurized?

312
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,750
Pasteurized? Why is the rice all the best? The rice? Oh, yes.

313
00:44:45,960 --> 00:45:08,100
So it is. I think it is. Not only will we be voting yes to remove the rolls, never will be as we need to be before we even finish this.

314
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:18,910
Mr. What?

315
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:39,479
Oh. So to the to that question about the protein in the CO2 compounds, there's an activity that a lot of people would like to do.

316
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,740
It's like right at the end of the semester,

317
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,600
things are very much in the original thing where there's databases for people looking for any good looking CO2.

318
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:53,070
So that activity is you take a menu, a food menu, any topic for that menu and then try to out because they're waiting for it.

319
00:45:54,690 --> 00:46:00,570
And mostly I think focuses on CO2, which is both water usage and CO2, but there's other databases to look at.

320
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,670
They tend to be not exactly as possible.

321
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,149
Okay. So so with all that as an introduction,

322
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:15,330
I'm going to spend the next 20 minutes or so kind of doing and walking us through all the various steps of digestion.

323
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:19,020
So there's really six different steps overall in digestion.

324
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,470
It's going to start in the stomach, then there's going to be digestion, hydrolysis,

325
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:27,150
and then transport is the entire site, a little bit more digestion and then transport.

326
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:37,980
Okay, first thing, oral cavity digestion, there is absolutely nothing excreted except for the juices and and ingested.

327
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,130
So what I'm not going to do the floor here. Why is that the case?

328
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:48,150
Why do you this was also the case for cancers like us, for when you wondered where we go like is a secreted in the mouth but not active in the mouth.

329
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:56,530
Same with this. Why do you think that's the case? You have to be in the right environment, which is in the stomach.

330
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:04,950
Yeah. The activation. So that's right. So in the case of lingual, like I said, we did secrete something into our mouth.

331
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,890
It was just inactive for proteins. We don't need to create anything in our mouth.

332
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,130
Now whether we did or not is going to turn out to be lots of irrelevant.

333
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,170
But I'm just wondering, why don't we start the digestion in the mouth? For.

334
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:23,890
Is it because of the level of testing it is required to make sure the proteins are just too harsh for that environment?

335
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:29,170
So that's part of it. So part of the digestion is going to require a lot of acid and that would that would damage the petitions in the mouth.

336
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:34,470
But there's another reason as well. You can absorb whatever you digest in the mouth anyway.

337
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,920
That's true. But your stomach doesn't really absorb that much either. And we do quite a lot of digestion in your stomach.

338
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:46,020
It's because the cell surface in your mouth is largely made of fats and proteins.

339
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,770
Right. So if you had proteases, acting your mouth, you would just chew away and you're calling them everything, right?

340
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,960
So. So you can't start look at a protein digest.

341
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:58,740
That's not the case for carbohydrates to celebrate alpha amylase.

342
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:05,660
It's fine in the mouth. Okay. So going step all the way down to the stomach and we're going to skip down to these particular cells here.

343
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,640
So the key difference here is throughout this class,

344
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,040
we've been talking about acid secretion in the stomach being acidified and then portant for important variety of things.

345
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,680
And we've talked about how that's important for activation of the enzymes,

346
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:21,360
but it turns out acid secretion is really, really, really important for the denature creation of proteins.

347
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:26,910
So lipids don't really need to be denature, they need to be emulsified. Carbohydrates generally don't need to be denatured.

348
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,590
You just need to get rid of the outer shell of proteins because they come with this very complicated secondary,

349
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:34,139
tertiary quaternary structure that needs to be denatured.

350
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,700
Otherwise we don't have access to the peptide bonds that the digestive enzymes are going to need.

351
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:42,090
So here we're going to have to have a lot of acid secretion here,

352
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,620
and that acid secretion is going to occur primarily in a type of cells here called parietal cells.

353
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:54,240
And these exist in these gastric pips within the stomach. So that makes hydrochloric acid, which is secreted.

354
00:48:54,250 --> 00:49:02,880
This is an active transport method where you're going to transport protons from the Prado cells using bicarbonate into the gastric pits here.

355
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,450
And then the extra onions by carbonate is going to be transported down for acid balance in blood.

356
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,760
So this happens and this is stimulated by a variety of hormones.

357
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,120
We've talked about Gastric before and we've talked about acetylcholine, which is the primary effector of the parasympathetic nervous system.

358
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:28,530
But histamine for now is is a little bit new. So all of these hormones sort of pull in through through the parasitic histamine and gastric.

359
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,300
They all work directly on parietal cells,

360
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:36,600
but they also work independently through a second set of cells that are called extra chromosome like cells here.

361
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:41,639
They're not super well named. That's just Hollywood. So these are the cells that actually secrete histamine.

362
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:48,480
And you can see that that both gastric and the any acetylcholine work on both the

363
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:54,090
extra frozen like cells and directly on the pride of cells to secrete that acid.

364
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,800
Now, it turns out this is really important. You may think, well, this seems really redundant. You're activating here and you're activating here.

365
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:05,960
These cells here in the histamine released by these cells is is really, really, really strongly potentiated of this attack.

366
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:11,980
In fact, many, many drugs that impair acid production there.

367
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:16,610
And acids are histamine receptor blockers. You can kind of think of this as an amplification.

368
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,940
So you're working here and you're working here, although these cells are quite important.

369
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:30,060
The other major secretion here out of the out of the stomach or to the gastric pits is pepsin or technically more pepsin again.

370
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,569
So pepsin again is the second enzyme again we've talked about.

371
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,440
The first was called by phase and is always secreted. You'll see there's a trend here.

372
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,260
Also, all of these are always secreted in the inactive form. So that's the way that our body can kind of control it, regulate digestion.

373
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,130
You make the proteins, the proteins are ready and the proteins are in inactive form.

374
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:52,320
Now, again, the reason this happens is you imagine you're a cell and you've made a bunch of have synergy.

375
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,200
You want that to be inactive. It's kind of sitting, waiting to be secreted.

376
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:02,040
If it was already active, if you just made Pepsin directly, it would then chew up all the other pepsin while it's waiting to be secreted.

377
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:07,559
Right? So that's why you have to make it in an inactive form. You can store it in an inactive form and then secrete it.

378
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:13,710
And then this is the first activation we've seen in this case. It is activated just by the acid and the presence of the asteroid.

379
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:21,780
Sort of the acid is going to cause the chemical activation of pepsin antigen to pepsin by cleaving off at multiple sites here,

380
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,780
which is going to happen once it's active. Pepsin can go off and start the digestive process.

381
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,530
Now,

382
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:37,439
we've talked about GERD before in terms of a very common digestive disease and a whole variety of ways that we might want to combat acid production.

383
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,420
It's the jury or the physician and the re broken down into three different types.

384
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,549
So the first type are antacids.

385
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:51,840
So antacids are just purely neutralizing agents seems to be carbonates by carbonates and citrate aluminum calcium promethium.

386
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,499
These are things like your tums, your biologics, milk of magnesia, Pepto-Bismol.

387
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:02,129
All of these just work as antacids. So they take the acid that's there and just neutralize the same way that you had bicarbonate to vinegar.

388
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:11,130
You'll need to neutralize the acid of these tend to have more or less of a side effect, but also tend to be sort of least effective.

389
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,400
If you go up a level of more detailed, there's histamine blockers.

390
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:23,520
Specifically, these are histamine receptor two blockers. There's another type of antihistamine which is histamine on on auto immune cells.

391
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:30,600
Those are generally used for allergies. These are at different receptors that are the agricultural like cells, sorry, on the gastro cells.

392
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,139
And so some of the histamine blockers you might have heard of our Pepcid, Zantac.

393
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:39,350
So these are antagonists to the histamine signaling system. And then the last group of people.

394
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:46,490
Proton pump inhibitors. These directly chemically inhibit the the acid pump and this is Prevacid, Prilosec or Nexium.

395
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:53,570
And so all of these work to various degrees. They'll work by either directly or indirectly affecting the acid production.

396
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,810
Now, of course, these come with a variety of side effects.

397
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,240
They reduce acid production, which is good if you have GERD, but also cause all sorts of other effects here.

398
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,929
So let's kind of go through these sort of one by one.

399
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:13,280
So let's pick. We'll start with gas. Why might having an antacid increase flatulence or gas production?

400
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,070
Maybe because it's motivated by indigestion. So we can.

401
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:27,170
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So because the house is not there, the proteins aren't denatured because the proteins aren't denatured,

402
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,469
they're not going to be effectively digested because they're not can be effectively digested.

403
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:35,810
They're not going to be effectively absorbed and they're going to end up working as prebiotics in your gut bacteria,

404
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,000
which can cause for gas, constipation.

405
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:45,110
And we'll talk a lot more about intrinsic factor and B12, but you need the acid for absorption of B12, iron and folate.

406
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,489
We'll talk about more of this in 631. And then protein malnutrition for the same right.

407
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:55,729
You're sort of somewhat intentionally allowing yourself to indicate not identical proteins very well.

408
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:00,710
So if you're already at risk of protein malnutrition, then you should be careful with with these antacids.

409
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:08,750
And then these are generally the contraindications for I got these for the papers, but again, this is largely due to mineral absorption.

410
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,730
These are, of course, hugely, hugely common abuse. Okay.

411
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:18,200
So moving on from the stomach to the small intestine, we heard to talk about K a couple of times,

412
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:24,319
but CC K is stimulated when peptides and fats primarily are detected in the small intestine.

413
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,840
It's going to cause release of bile, which we've already talked about,

414
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,579
but it's also going to stimulate the ace in ourselves and pancreas to release some of the pancreatic nitrogen.

415
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:36,020
So a lot of the digestive enzymes that we're going to talk about here are secreted from the stomach,

416
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,300
from pancreas into the small intestine in response to its response to help.

417
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:47,480
Okay. So there are several pancreatic. Zeta-Jones Alzheimer's genes look like this.

418
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,050
They are all something again or probe something.

419
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:56,239
That's all you can tell is the inactive omega. That's a pro. And again, at the end there's some sort of activator.

420
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,910
And then once you have the activated thing, you can activate the enzyme.

421
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,569
So all of these are produced in an inactive form and they are in your pancreatic

422
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:08,180
juices now they're activated by this cascade of proteins is sort of illustrated here.

423
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,350
So the first one that is going to come across is entero peptides.

424
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:18,530
Sometimes it's called integral kinase. This exists, this is made up by the small intestine exists on the brush, part of the small intestine.

425
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:26,060
So what's the all these other things are we'll start with Tripp's antigen is released by Prince Energy and gets to the brush border.

426
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,170
If there is internal properties there, it will turn into crimson. Right.

427
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,520
So that's the key first. Then you don't have interrupted the entire cascade.

428
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:39,050
It doesn't happen. But then once you've activated trypsin, trypsin can go on and activate more trypsin agents or it can self activate.

429
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:42,410
And then trypsin is the activator for all of the other the other enzymes.

430
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:48,890
So internal peptides or whatever kinase is essential for initial digestion, but then trypsin is the one that is also work.

431
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,610
So again, trypsin activated by internal peptides is on the brush border of some terminology

432
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:59,089
and no peptides need to cut in the middle of a protein exalt peptides which is

433
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:03,680
either a carboxyl peptides or amino peptides work from the end and do peptides is

434
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,750
generally make a look at peptides and x rays is always release a free amino acid.

435
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,810
So in this case here we're starting with trypsin again, which is not active,

436
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,920
it comes in contact with integral peptide is and then you get active trypsin.

437
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,820
Once you have active trypsin, you can go ahead and activate all of your unknowns.

438
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:27,620
Now you can imagine if you had a general, a genomic or a functional defect in either troops antigen trypsin or internal peptides,

439
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:30,860
you would have really, really dramatic protein malnutrition risk.

440
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,960
And again, this is something that's tested for blood clots.

441
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:41,110
EASTON America, the defect in it is if you have that, if you still survive, but you're gonna have to supplement broadly with criminal assets, right?

442
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:46,400
And you want to start that, you've got to neutralize the difference.

443
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:51,409
Okay, so here are the key enzymes.

444
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:54,760
So trypsin is going to fight next to the are basically license plates.

445
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,839
And if you have a person, as I mentioned,

446
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:04,940
just beginning is going to to to hydrazine and finally and then the carboxyl peptides is going to cut from the setembro amino acid.

447
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,040
So if you look at these for one thing,

448
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:15,050
that might not be apparent right away but might strike you is there's only five places we can cut with these two enzymes on a protein.

449
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:20,330
We can cut before energy before slicing the orchard and before it starts, you know, before phenylalanine,

450
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:26,060
which means that there's 15 other amino acids where we don't have a digestive enzyme that can cut before it.

451
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:30,810
Right. So imagine of the 20 amino acids we can only cut of four, five, right?

452
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:35,570
So only about 20% of the bonds that we can digest are bioavailable.

453
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,220
And that's why when we do digestion, we end up with a lot of these die and try peptides, right?

454
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,839
On average, you're going to have with two or three on the alliance and that's why it's so important to have amino practices and

455
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:51,350
capacity raises are those if you have a stretch of amino acid that doesn't have any of these five amino acids,

456
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,450
you can't digest it with any of the other enzymes. So you're down probably rely on the amino in the core boxing peptides.

457
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:59,270
There's also one of the reasons why the digestion is so inefficient.

458
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,940
You can imagine a scenario where we evolved to have a peptides is that cut at every single amino acid

459
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,200
and then case we would efficiently be able break all proteins down rate to amino acids pretty directly,

460
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,200
but for whatever reason we've not adapted to do that.

461
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:19,340
We can only cut in about 20% of locations, which is again, that's one of the reasons why protein consumption is so difficult.

462
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:26,450
There's a couple of. Unique structural proteins. These are both in connective tissue, lactase and collagen is.

463
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:33,260
So as you might expect, a last phase is specific to the structure of elastin and collages is specific to the structure of culture.

464
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:40,760
So most collagen is called in as a very different, unique, sort of twisted alpha helical bundle structure.

465
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:46,219
It is restrict, it is hard to break down by acid and doesn't have any of these amino acids.

466
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:50,150
Right, because it's going to be a lot of latency as we talked about.

467
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,880
So it needs a specific enzyme just to break down collagen and also a specific enzyme to break down elastic.

468
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,679
And again, both of these are made as pro enzymes.

469
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:07,430
And so these are sort of unique to see those two specific proteins, all of the other ones work on basically all the other proteins, more or less.

470
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,000
More or less. Okay.

471
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:18,650
So once you go through this digestion, the tricks into the kind of trypsin and carboxyl peptide is to be working on your denature protein chain.

472
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,070
What you're going to be releasing is a lot of free amino acids.

473
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,890
That's going to be largely from the collapse of peptides.

474
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:29,530
And you don't have to resist, but you're also going have a lot of dive and try peptides left over again.

475
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:32,210
These are certain bonds that you just cannot cut next to.

476
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:38,120
So fortunately when we absorb amino acids, we can absorb free amino acids, but most of the amino acids we absorb,

477
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:44,300
we can absorb in the form of dietary peptides using a system called the kept one system.

478
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,860
There is further digestion.

479
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:52,880
Once you get into the germ sites, once you're in the entire site, these trying times inside have to be further broken down into free amino acids.

480
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:59,480
But then to get out of the entire site, it has to be an amino acid. There is no packed one transport system on the base, a lot of membrane.

481
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,299
So to get out of the entire site, you probably need to get all the way down to amino acids and then those amino acids are free

482
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,830
and then they go off through your blood supply to to go to everywhere else in your body.

483
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:15,620
Okay. So that was a lot of glut of different enzymes that we've gone through.

484
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,140
So there's another group activity. I want you guys to spend a little bit of time on here, so I'll spend about 10 minutes on.

485
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:27,860
This is just a summary table kind of summarizing everything we've that I've talked to you about the different enzymes,

486
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,180
where they come from, what they work on,

487
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:38,570
and then I'll spend the last 10 minutes on absorption of it and then again make sure you submit your brain for this before you do that,

488
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:42,350
before you submit your order and you just make one table for.

489
01:00:54,190 --> 01:01:06,420
I didn't get a chance to practice this because, you know, care.

490
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:41,750
Just to make sure that, you know, that this activates types of things and that I want to show that a lot of people that have seen this.

491
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:47,260
But let me tell you how you can go ahead if you really want.

492
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:58,570
Yeah, no, that's not good. You know, if you like to use.

493
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:29,430
Dateline is also small businesses and this is what one in the Northeast right now.

494
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:56,600
Sorry to say. Well, I also know that there.

495
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:00,940
Oh, I know.

496
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,440
I don't care. Well, she does not want to go.

497
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,070
Oh. Thanks.

498
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:31,860
No, that's not good enough. Sometimes, you know, I just haven't been able to give up occasions, but.

499
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:51,860
Good. Really hope to get better.

500
01:03:53,140 --> 01:04:01,660
Okay, so what do you think?

501
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:47,250
Because now. If you read this case, the president says it will not be so difficult to do things I think you can't like next year.

502
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:55,530
But I think that you should start over.

503
01:04:56,710 --> 01:05:02,070
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.

504
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:11,260
Like I said in my ear.

505
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,030
Correct. Well, you know, they just the millennials.

506
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:34,350
Yeah. This is four or 5.42, so this is like 31.

507
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:48,630
I don't know what it was. So for the hundred grams of material, 29, 31, 1993, it was the First Amendment.

508
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,520
But isn't this what you did with my vote?

509
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:25,410
Yeah, and I think that's one of the reasons we just go through this is I think you get to where you are so that it's just you and me.

510
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:32,430
I do not know the I don't know what activists who watch on the other side.

511
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,000
Yes. Oh, yeah.

512
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:46,080
I mean, you know, I don't even know why I'm here for four years.

513
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:51,390
You know, it's not like I can't memorize.

514
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,750
Yeah. Oh, yes, I do.

515
01:06:54,890 --> 01:07:00,660
But I don't memorize. Just, like, any numbers. I think he was.

516
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:05,970
What is it? No, I don't think so.

517
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:14,940
I just know because that you could hear anything like that had the same number is not going to change in like two years about my girl,

518
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:26,280
you know, that's completely my that's a [INAUDIBLE] raised here. So it's like, okay, this is this is this is history.

519
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:32,760
I would think so. Because them to tips and advice.

520
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:57,480
Yeah, but it's also existence while you're at work here at least twice as much as the chief.

521
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:11,730
But yeah and I think someone like me, he was on the class because it's, it's only one.

522
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,889
It's not even a lot of. Okay, all right.

523
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:23,220
So hopefully that's going to be useful staple for the last the final which is only on the proteins units seems like a lot.

524
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:27,300
Okay. So I've already talked about some of this already.

525
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:31,620
So amino acids auction as two steps to get into the Internet site,

526
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,429
which is going to be able commemorate and it's only interested in the circulation you

527
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:40,410
because there's not a hopefully relevant amount of protein that ends up in the limit.

528
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:47,190
All devices are going to go directly to the river like once you know, there's a couple differences.

529
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:52,259
The absorbable units here are normally you would die and try peptides through this.

530
01:08:52,260 --> 01:09:00,329
Absolutely and most amino acid I'll take but not all of it is isn't appropriate and I'll talk about what is going to matter as well.

531
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:03,510
The cat one system is how we can get these. Still not.

532
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:15,640
Completely digested peptides in your body. So this is a protein called transporter that allows DI and tri peptides into into the inters where they

533
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:21,010
can be further hydrolyzed into amino acids and then can go back out of the cell into the blood over here.

534
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:24,640
Now, there's a lot of different amino acid transporters. They are classified.

535
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,760
I think there's at least 70. They're classified into these different systems,

536
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:35,530
depending on whether or not they are neutral or basic and whether or not they require sodium or hydrogen as a transporter.

537
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:40,030
I don't need to memorize this. I have to look at this. And I have this actually on my desk all the time.

538
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:44,430
But there's a whole bunch of different transport systems. They're generally somewhat redundant.

539
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,479
So you can see like glutamate exists in a couple of different places here and so does neutral.

540
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,280
Amino acids are here, here and here.

541
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:57,760
And again, that redundancy is so that if one transport system isn't working or you don't have the right active transport to drive that system,

542
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,490
you can still get the amino acids into your body.

543
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:09,100
These same classification of transporters exist not just on the basal lateral membrane of the of the entire but all throughout your body.

544
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,689
Right. So heart, lung, kidney,

545
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:17,950
all of these have different transporters and that's what's going to allow the amino acids in or not into a particular cell freeze.

546
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:25,680
Okay. So there's a couple of things and hopefully I'll come across somewhat indirectly in in terms of amino acid digestion in transport.

547
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:29,979
So the first thing is we're generally limited by the number of transporters we have,

548
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:36,700
even though there's like 60 or 70 different transporters because almost all of them require some type of active transport or transport.

549
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:42,940
They are both limited in capacity and limited in number, especially relative to carbohydrates.

550
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:51,250
And as I said, with fast food in the building transporters, but generally proteins are not absorbed as effectively as as other things.

551
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:57,820
You can look here, this is the absorption rate per gram, 12 grams of protein per hour of a different protein.

552
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:02,470
You see some of the like whey protein is absorbed quite quickly. That's because it's quite easily digestible.

553
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:07,810
Other ones such as my eggs are not digested at all, but even that is not that many grams per hour.

554
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,310
That's only eight grams per hour that can be transported across the base a lot.

555
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:17,620
Remember, and that's partially because it's hard to digest things, partially because we have energy dependent transport.

556
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:22,930
The reason we need energy dependent transport is the entire sites themselves are full of amino acids.

557
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:29,110
Right. So you just relied on passive transport, which is going to go down a concentration gradient.

558
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:32,680
You would always only be able to absorb up until the concentration of the sun.

559
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:37,450
Inside the sun and cells are packed full of lots of meteorites and there's tons of amino acids inside salt.

560
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:43,030
Right? So that's why you need this constant active transport system. And that's going to cost energy and it's going to limit the capacity.

561
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:44,980
Now, in general,

562
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:53,379
most of a lot of protein that we consume per day is not a so the average is about 10 to 20 grams per day for every individual is not good for path.

563
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:56,380
It's going to vary due to a lot more proteins. The higher if you've got your meals,

564
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:59,860
it's going to be higher and those can be fermented into a variety of different

565
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:03,070
products by the same gut microbes we've been talking about throughout the year.

566
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:09,070
So there's a couple of sort of unique substances. So the short chain fatty acids we've talked about before, the gases we've talked about before,

567
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:14,980
but there's a couple of different types of proteins are compounds in dark and they're all compounds here.

568
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:20,020
So these compounds are probably bioactive as well. And these can get into our bodies somewhat as well.

569
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:24,430
And so there's been a lot of recent work on how the microbiota makes these type received

570
01:12:24,430 --> 01:12:30,400
federal alanine and tryptophan derived byproducts and what they might do biologically.

571
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:34,510
And then anything that is not absorbed or fermented is excreted within the feces.

572
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:38,829
So I like this diagram here. This kind of summarizes everything we've talked about.

573
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:45,910
Yeah. So if you consume about 20 grams of protein, only about half of that ever even gets out of the entire site and into the blood.

574
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:53,320
Right. That's because of limited transport capacity and the fact that the interior sites themselves need a lot of amino acids and for function,

575
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,830
they need amino acids to make all these proteins are secreting they need amino

576
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:00,790
acids for energy and they need amino acids to send to the rest of the body.

577
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:08,530
Once you get out of the gastrointestinal tract, about 40% of the remaining stuff can be used for energy and then the rest is established.

578
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:12,040
So once you've gone through all the way through the catabolism, the amount that's used by the gut,

579
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:20,150
only about 10% of the total amino acids is generally left to be available for, say, for example, protein synthesis in the muscle, right?

580
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:24,159
So a lot of people think what they want to build for muscle tissue just consume a huge amount of protein.

581
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:32,110
We can see only about 10% that you can still get through all sort of the regular systems and it's free for protein synthesis in total.

582
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,679
So this is kind of another diagram sort of showing the same sort of thing.

583
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,000
So this is a study where they took generally healthy, young, but not resistance training men.

584
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:48,010
They did some resistance exercise and they asked them to consume increasing amounts of protein powder and looked at the muscle actual synthetic rate,

585
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:51,760
which is the amount of protein synthesis over the over time.

586
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:57,880
So you can see it's not linear, right? So there is an effect of whey protein going from zero to about 20 to 25 grams.

587
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:03,390
There's about a 30 to 40% increase in muscle protein synthesis, but it maxes out somewhere around 25.

588
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:07,780
Over 30 grams. So why do you think this might max out at 25 or 30 grams then?

589
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:16,480
This is per per ingestion. And why is it that this line doesn't just keep increasing linearly?

590
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:20,390
Because we can't store, you know, like a storage form of protein. Right.

591
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:26,200
So all of the excess protein that we absorbed all this, first of all, at this moment is available for protein synthesis.

592
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:32,640
But then there's no we don't have a level of protein synthesis, as we'll talk about in the next class generally gets metabolized pretty quickly.

593
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:36,550
Right. So it's not bioavailable. And so this is showing the same thing.

594
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:42,070
This is just a meta analysis, looking at a whole bunch of different studies where they did resistance training and looked

595
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:48,010
at that at certain resistance training and then looked at total daily protein intake.

596
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:52,209
So measured right at the beginning of this unit that the recommendation for protein intake is right here,

597
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:55,000
which is point eight grams per kilogram per day.

598
01:14:55,180 --> 01:15:02,829
But in the context of resistance, training is pretty good evidence that there's a linear increase up to about 1.6 or two grams of protein per day.

599
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:11,379
So supplementing above the 0.8 up to about 1.6 is helpful in the context of resistance training, but above 1.6 is not any more helpful.

600
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:15,670
Right? So if you're, let's say 100 kilograms, that would be 160 grams of protein per day.

601
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:22,090
Anything more than that is generally not going to be effective beyond that. So people who eat purely carnivore diets are probably way over here.

602
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:30,219
That's not that effective. But there is a range here above the DRI, but around 1.6 where extra protein can be used for muscle.

603
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:33,670
But again, this is in the context of of resistance training.

604
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:39,010
So that's why some people think that in the context of resistance training, the DRI should be it should be much higher.

605
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:46,929
Now, if I couple that fact with this fact, the problem is, let's say you want to consume, let's say you're a hundred kilograms,

606
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:51,220
you want to consume 160 grams of protein per day to meet to meet this level,

607
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:55,960
you're still hitting this 20 gram limit for most people, this 20 to 30 gram limit.

608
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:01,930
Right. So if you're trying to optimize protein delivery, what you want is a lot of 30 grams circuit, right?

609
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:06,870
Because anything more than 30 grams, you're not able to absorb it. Anything less than 30 grams is not be as efficient.

610
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,700
So if you're trying to get 200 and 6070 grams, you're going to need to have 4 to 630 grand servings.

611
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:16,629
Now, the whey protein industry has already figured this out. What are the little scoops that come in?

612
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,850
White powder is exactly right.

613
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:25,300
And so that's why that scoop is 25 grams, because if you put two scoops in the other hand is probably just going to be wasted for the average person.

614
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:30,879
So that's the spacing in between those 46 meals is going to take some 8 hours to digest.

615
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,950
So yeah, so generally 2 to 3 hours between.

616
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:38,740
Yeah, there have been a lot of great studies, but we do know that like after about 2 hours you can read those again.

617
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:45,800
So see some of that again sort of depending on the person in person because of the 30 grams or the size of the person.

618
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,200
No, it has to be just 30 grams in general. Right.

619
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:54,070
And so when when they did this study, they did try to re stratify this with protein grams per size of person and actually turned out that didn't.

620
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:58,990
Right. And that's probably because a bigger person or a smaller person, their digestive tract is about the same size.

621
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:03,180
So it's quite more basis of of sort of like the size and the absorption capacity.

622
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:11,520
But I suppose there was. There's no other questions than will provide a protein synthesis.
