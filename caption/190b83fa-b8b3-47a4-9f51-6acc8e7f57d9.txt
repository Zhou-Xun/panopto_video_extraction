1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,676
So, this is gonna be how this talk is organised because it's gonna be a lot of

2
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:08,370
storeys about different types of things that can go wrong but

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,861
it's gonna be organised in terms of the basic premises.

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:16,264
and then examining sort of to the extent to which we can actually, so

5
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:18,440
carry out these premises.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,216
So first, market incentives can improve the quality of care,

7
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:27,076
obviously that's sort of one of the things that underpins a lot of measurement.

8
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:31,265
I felt that both insurers and consumers can use this information to be able to

9
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,212
select the higher performing institutions to go to,

10
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:37,365
just the way that you select what kinda car you gonna buy.

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:40,415
We can take into account patient differences not under the control of

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,152
the providers,

13
00:00:41,152 --> 00:00:44,266
obviously different providers take care of different populations.

14
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:48,820
But there's some sense that we can measure a lot of things that are different about

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,945
those population.

16
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:54,013
Third is that individual patient data can be used to identify key outcome or

17
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:55,571
process of care indicates.

18
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:58,289
So we have certain things that we think should be done or

19
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,485
certain outcomes that we're on a monitor.

20
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:05,540
And we have to, one of the premises is that we can use, the individual level

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,615
data that's generated or we pay to collect in order to measure those days.

22
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:15,151
And fourth, that we can aggregate this data to measure quality of

23
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,294
delivered by providers or to disease group.

24
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:21,587
You have this individual level data and

25
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:26,476
there's some idea that we wanted better the care of either

26
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:31,184
groups of patients or groups of providers or over time.

27
00:01:31,184 --> 00:01:35,470
Yeah, so all of those things involve some kind of aggregation over one of

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,015
the dimensions that all this data occurs.

29
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:42,191
So some of the issues are gonna talk about basically relate to all of these four

30
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:44,261
premises so we'll keep coming back.

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,744
So first, the market incentives to improve the quality of care,

32
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:53,583
basically there's sort of three approaches in here I'll talk about.

33
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:57,740
What is the idea that you give consumers information about quality.

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,354
That's something that, there's been a movement for that,

35
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:05,384
consumers say they want this and whether or not they actually use it,

36
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:08,042
but they say they want it or have access to it.

37
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:12,146
And then on the other side, you can, generally the idea as well, you sort of

38
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:17,240
linked incentives meaning salary and budget, in most cases to quality measures.

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,160
And it's policy, the way that's been operationalized in the policy is through

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,070
various types of pay for performance.

41
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,561
So, this is not unique to health care, exactly.

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,867
Great Britain has been kinda getting involved in this sort of providing

43
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:35,037
information to consumers for longer than we have,

44
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:36,861
started back in the Thatcher government.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,430
And so this is an example of something that's produced for

46
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,533
the public, to give them some sense of how the policing,

47
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:51,254
which they're paying for, is how successful or unsuccessful.

48
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,320
The police forces in their area of the country, which is highlighted on

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,472
the map and it's got this nice pentagram here and a bunch of statistics.

50
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:04,965
You look at it, there were a lot of good data to be giving back to consumers.

51
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:11,361
But, oftentimes the result is not exactly what you intended.

52
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,574
You think it makes sense or

53
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:15,781
maybe you didn't even pay very much attention to how it makes sense.

54
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:20,115
But, on the other can be really hard to actually convey sophisticated high level

55
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:23,492
information back to people in a form which they, no it's not so

56
00:03:23,492 --> 00:03:25,739
much that they couldn't understand it.

57
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,536
But they don't want to invest the time,

58
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:31,671
you don't invest the time to understand it.

59
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:34,984
And you get this kind of baffling charts monitor police performance.

60
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:40,073
So it turns out to be harder than, yeah, it's been a harder challenge

61
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:44,475
than you might have expected given people in the form in which

62
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:49,240
they find actually useful and surveys and other types of things.

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,906
Other types of way of looking at how the public is using these

64
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:56,157
things suggest that looks.

65
00:03:56,157 --> 00:04:01,453
Using this very much they're relying on to a large extent on there for

66
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:06,948
the way they've always like to carry asked their neighbour [INAUDIBLE].

67
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:12,342
Furthermore in terms of the pay for performance, as is often the case

68
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:17,742
in healthcare, we seem to sort of be catching usually the last wave.

69
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:22,670
And again, the business world pay for performance was,

70
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,377
was a big wave in, in the corporate world.

71
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:30,345
And then there was a lot of service examination of it in the sense that maybe

72
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:33,553
pay for performance wasn't delivering what they wanted.

73
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:38,569
Now we've just seen the philosophy of give everything to the guy on top 83%

74
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:43,742
of companies with some type of pay for performance programmes, throughout their

75
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:48,861
workforce say the approach is only somewhat successful or not working at all.

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,416
2004 Wall Street Journal article right around

77
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:58,086
performance is really ramping up, okay.

78
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,891
And, I mean, this is the basic problem.

79
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:05,653
This is the way a lot of practise of dark steel and explain foreign system to you is

80
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:11,431
that I couldn't come up with something a little more sophisticated than this.

81
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,655
It doesn't feel like that Good morning when you get.

82
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,857
And I'll tell you from experience having gotten, but

83
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:21,137
I feel to me like ridiculously large cheques sometimes.

84
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:25,673
And then pretty small cheques other years, even in a system that doesn't do a lot of

85
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:30,031
paper providing, I don't know, I can't tell at all why and getting bigger.

86
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:30,851
That's a shame [INAUDIBLE].

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,315
And incentive system is not gonna work.

88
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,517
You feel like that and furthermore, it can actually work,

89
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:46,768
it can be counterproductive in a big way.

90
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:50,416
So, this is sort of a satirical in great Britain where again,

91
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:55,256
even in the health care system, they went much bigger in the pay for performance,

92
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,361
than we have anywhere in our healthcare system yet.

93
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,949
A lot of people feel like it's a slot machine and

94
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:10,433
worse they're actually a documentation of some pretty significant.

95
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:17,940
Even worse than borderline ethical behaviour in response to it.

96
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,683
if you have poor performance in domains where the performance is not measured,

97
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,656
then they'll because they draught in extra staff to

98
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:28,506
sort of buff up the area that is being measured.

99
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:32,262
And end up leading the other areas short.

100
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:34,896
There's, what they call hitting the target and missing the point.

101
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,938
Patients are kept waiting in the ambulances, so

102
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:42,624
they don't hit the When the clock starts for how long they wait in the.

103
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:46,871
I mean, these are actual documented instances of this happening bye,

104
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:47,663
hospitals.

105
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:52,338
Ambiguity and reporting of data the level reported to the Department of Health in

106
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:53,851
2004 was 96%, but

107
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:58,685
an independent survey of Patients reported only 77% of some measure being met.

108
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:03,459
When this one ambulance category a calls, there's a lot of allegations and

109
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:08,086
ambulance trust relocated depots for world urban to achieve the target at

110
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:11,160
the expense of worst service in the rural areas.

111
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,107
So ,more of their volumes in the urban area, If they shift resources there,

112
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:21,359
a greater proportion of their calls will be done in the time that it's a penalising

113
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:26,400
the rural areas where there's fewer calls but, their calls get even longer.

114
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,107
So again, I mean you can go on, but these are,

115
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:32,996
these are not just things that could happen, these are things that

116
00:07:32,996 --> 00:07:37,661
were documented to actually happen with pay for performance metrics going in.

117
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,772
So, basically start what with those that are pitfalls or

118
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:48,308
can be sort of condensed into, if you give people information,

119
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:52,091
they might ignore it or it's too hard to understand.

120
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:57,882
And then the pay for performance, one of the big problems is gaining as it's,

121
00:07:57,882 --> 00:08:00,867
there's sort of a natural incentive for

122
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:04,228
people who, are not so responsible to game.

123
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:07,159
But even if people are trying to be responsible,

124
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,445
if there is no possible way for them to hit the target and

125
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:14,104
you're putting intense pressure on them to hit the target.

126
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,752
And they can easily gain it.

127
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:21,308
You're creating a situation where you're essentially almost forcing

128
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,031
people to gain the target.

129
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:23,531
And this is that
