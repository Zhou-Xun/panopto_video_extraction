1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,559
Good morning, everybody. All right.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,350
So the last two classes we talked about cancer in the United States.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,849
Right. Which I think is is where a lot of us are focused.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:22,250
But as I mentioned in the intro lecture, global cancer is becoming a bigger problem as countries move through the epidemiologic transition.

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,149
And so we're going to talk quite a bit about that for the next two lectures.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,420
And we're going to do kind of the same sort of thing that we did with the U.S.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:34,460
cancer statistics and find out where we go online to find global cancer statistics.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,830
Okay. So I'm going to read these to you, but here they are. So this is the World Cancer Report.

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,480
This all comes out from the World Health Organization, from Iraq.

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,980
So International Agency for Research on Cancer is I ask it as part of the show.

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:59,600
And so if any of you are really excited about cancer and you'd like to go get an internship in France,

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,649
you can go work in and you have people I have friends who did that.

13
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,229
They went and got a post-doc in France and I was like, Oh, okay.

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:16,730
So they put this out every so often. And this one stated Cancer morbidity data are essential for planning and monitoring cancer control initiatives.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,910
Population based cancer registries play a central role in cancer control programs because they provide the means to plan,

16
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,380
monitor and evaluate the impact of specific interventions in targeted populations.

17
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,590
Okay. So this is just basically saying we really do need these data.

18
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,030
Like if you want to do anything about cancer, you have to understand the scope of the problem before you can do that.

19
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:42,460
And that remains an issue globally. So these are the definitive sources of global cancer information.

20
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,820
You have sci fi and global care. So sci fi five is cancer incidence in five continents.

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:59,120
And then there is global cancer. The basic difference between these is that sci fi includes data from high quality population based cancer registries.

22
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:08,320
In order for your data to be included in sci fi. You have to have a certain level of quality of your data has to meet certain requirements.

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,690
What that means is that a lot of like developing countries do not have population based cancer registries that meet these requirements.

24
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,110
So their data is not going to be in here. Global can, on the other hand, kind of takes the other approach of like, okay,

25
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,570
we're going to do the best we can at estimating cancer for the most places that we can.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,460
So they will take like if there is one hospital based registry in the country, they will take that data.

27
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,240
If there's only mortality data, they will take that and extrapolate from it.

28
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,370
If there's no data in a country, they'll use data from neighboring countries to estimate, right.

29
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,350
So global can gives you more places.

30
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,420
But the quality of the data is not as high and a lot of it is estimated.

31
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,200
See I five is real data from high quality cancer registries, but you're not going to get that from every place.

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,570
Does that make sense? And we'll talk a little bit more about how the data is collected for C five excuse me for global can later.

33
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:17,020
There's also this ACS, the American Cancer Society, where we went last time and looked at the facts and figures.

34
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,720
They also put out a global global they're a global cancer facts and figures, which is nice.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,319
And Cancer Research UK also pulls together some of these statistics, but their data is coming from the same place.

36
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,660
Right? They're still using the Iraq data, the global CAD data, to put together these publications.

37
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,110
It's not like they have different data behind it.

38
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,120
It's just they have nice pictures and put it together in a readable format.

39
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,970
Right. Okay. All right.

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,890
So global carbon, 2020.

41
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,430
This is the definitive global reference source for national and international agencies and setting priorities for cancer control.

42
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:04,200
It has information on incidence and mortality for all major types of 36 cancers for almost all countries of the world.

43
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:13,020
185. Remember, it's not the same quality of data for every place, but you get a number for every place, right?

44
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,500
So they use the best of all available data from cancer registries worldwide and or estimates based

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,240
on the most accurate of accurate alternative sources together with W.H.O. Mortality Databank,

46
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,210
they provide reasons estimates. So this is not a substitute for sci fi.

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,850
They have this nice, user friendly web interface that you guys are going to get to play with, and they built on the successes of previous releases.

48
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,360
You'll notice that like cancer facts and figures and SEER data comes out on this kind of regular schedule.

49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,220
The last time that it was 2008 2012, I think, and then they did 2020.

50
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:00,540
So it's all a little bit like, I don't know, maybe just just I'm not in the know, but suddenly they're like, Oh, look, there's a new global care.

51
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,290
Usually when in my case I'm preparing the exercise for this class or from my graduate level class, and I'm like, Oh crap,

52
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:14,009
there's a new global can I didn't know and suddenly I have to update, but it's not like on a regular every two years kind of thing.

53
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,770
I think it's whatever they can get enough updated data from around the world to justify doing it again that makes sense.

54
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:30,690
Okay. So according to these 2020 global estimates, there's 19.3 million new cases and 10 million cancer related deaths worldwide.

55
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,460
54% of new cancer cases and 65% of deaths occur in developing regions of the world.

56
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,399
Okay, so that's not the US and westernized highly developed countries.

57
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
We're talking about places that are still undergoing development. Right?

58
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:58,370
More than half currently. So global cancer is a big problem, although the permits do rates.

59
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,970
I don't know what's wrong with me today. I'm so sorry. I keep saying two words at the same time.

60
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,780
I think my mouth is not the coffee hasn't happened yet or something.

61
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:16,409
I apologize. So although rates remain high in the more developed countries, they are plateauing or decreasing for the most common cancers.

62
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:24,540
Right. Because we've kind of reached the plateau of age. But the age structure has has topped out basically in developed countries.

63
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,920
So we're not adding more cases because the population is aging.

64
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,750
We're also not like having major changes in the upward direction.

65
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,890
And a lot of these risk factors, right? Smoking is decreasing.

66
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,330
People are trying to eat healthier and decrease obesity and all these kinds of things.

67
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,510
We're catching a lot of cancers earlier where we have pretty good treatments, right?

68
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,889
So rates are high, but they're not increasing exponentially generally.

69
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:58,470
And they're kind of coming down for a lot of cancers. However, in less developed countries, it's still going up.

70
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,030
Okay. So these projections are from 2020.

71
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:16,020
We expect by 2040 that there will be 30.2 million new cases and 16.3 million cancer related deaths, which is a big increase.

72
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,810
This is a little picture and you're going to make a picture sort of like this as one of your exercises.

73
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,540
But basically, you're seeing a 32% increase in more developed countries between 2020 and 2040,

74
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:37,060
and a 60.6% increase in the less developed countries, much bigger increase.

75
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:45,770
And also just look at the numbers. We're growing like 9 million to 3 million and adding 3 million here.

76
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,580
We're going 10 million. Adding 6 million. Right. So it's just more people.

77
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,750
More people live in developing parts of the world.

78
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:00,400
You're going to have more cancers, especially as they start to age. Okay.

79
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,970
This is just showing you the age structure.

80
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,890
This is the projected number of people, 65 or over. So the people who are likely to get cancer by more and less developed regions.

81
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:22,709
Comparing 2000 to 2050. And you can see that in more developed regions, the population is not aging that much over this time period.

82
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,750
Right. Because we have already undergone that epidemiologic transition, whereas in less developed regions.

83
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:37,380
Oh. And so just the age, just the demographic change alone is going to be a reason for lots more cancer cases in these countries.

84
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,580
Even leaving aside any of the changes in risk factor profiles that are going on.

85
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,860
All right. So that's a little intro. Now, in your groups, I'd like you to work on questions one through three for today's exercise.

86
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,180
These are going to get you into global can play around with the website.

87
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,730
I'll walk around and keep an eye on where you guys are at.

88
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:05,240
And when we're getting close to the end of three, we'll talk about those questions and then move forward in time.

89
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:22,550
Is that possible? Think.

90
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,799
Who with a news article. Presentation called you.

91
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,980
Did you? Did you know what? I thought we could do it after this.

92
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,930
Let's go ahead and do the news article. Presentation, because I thought it was so good.

93
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,980
I remembered my recording and everything, and then I just hopped right in and forgot the news article.

94
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,120
So I apologize to you guys. Let's go ahead before we start the work.

95
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,099
But before we start the group work, we're going to do the news article.

96
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,950
Presentation. I actually. No.

97
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:10,530
I don't want to subscribe. No, no, thank you. Okay.

98
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,820
I also don't want to. I don't want that. I know if you have.

99
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,830
All right. Well, you can just tell us what the title is. Okay, good.

100
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,910
The title is Johnson and Johnson will discontinue torque based baby powder globally in 2023.

101
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,110
So as you can tell from the title, they're just continuing to outpace baby powder.

102
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,210
This comes from kind of a long build up of the baby powder.

103
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,880
There was concerns about asbestos being contaminated with the talcum powder.

104
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:04,530
So they recall that they had many recalls back in 2019 for this reason and many others,

105
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,500
which led to them discontinuing the product in North American sales in 2020.

106
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:18,060
They had over 40,000 lawsuits, mostly from woman with ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.

107
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,010
And then cornstarch is the new substitute for the top base powder.

108
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:30,420
They know that this has been a substitute for a long time, and yet it's been like a very drawn out and long replacement.

109
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,130
Of course, I want to mention, like, this article is like a little biased.

110
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:42,360
There wasn't any discussion on as to whether like the top base powder was like preferred by more clients or what if there was any differences,

111
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,350
but they made it sound like there wasn't any and they still weren't really doing anything about it.

112
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,730
So there was this claim that it was then taken off the North American market.

113
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,290
But there's been evidence to show that that was just kind of them taking it off the high end stores,

114
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,680
whereas if you were to go to a 99 cent store or one of those supermarkets, they would still find the top base powder there.

115
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,230
So then it kind of goes into public health, of course,

116
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:10,770
and how those who are fortunate enough to shop at the higher end stores would not be exposed to this

117
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,950
possible contamination as well as this discontinued product that they're still putting out on the market.

118
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,360
So there was this main quote that says they took it out of high end stores but kept it at the 99 cent stores.

119
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,750
And so there's a lot of confusion because of that,

120
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,980
just because they know that their cornstarch has been effective replacements, extremely cheap, so efficient and it works.

121
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,690
And then we know that now they are going to be discontinuing it globally by 2023.

122
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,490
So they are making a change. But as we've seen, it's taken a while.

123
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:57,030
Yeah. And like it was interesting how Johnson Johnson is like really defending themselves on this and really isn't adding to cause any harm,

124
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,280
which I guess makes sense because they're a business.

125
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:07,620
But also like from a public health perspective, it also makes you like you question all of the big competitors in the pharma industry.

126
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:14,400
And like we said, there were plans to take the top base baby powder from the global market by 2023.

127
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,630
But actually the JNJ shareholders voted against this, which was really interesting to us.

128
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:35,760
And also it says in one talc baby powder case, Johnson Johnson was ordered to pay $4.69 billion to 22 plaintiffs in like a personal injury lawsuit.

129
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,589
And it's interesting because this health based baby powder is like a really,

130
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:46,980
really small portion of actually dangerous products, but it's like a huge, huge portion of all of their lawsuits right now.

131
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:53,430
So it's still interesting how like, it's they're moving slowly to take this off the market and fighting against it as well

132
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,030
and really defending themselves when it's like such a small portion of their market,

133
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,650
but a huge portion of their legal fees.

134
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,890
But like we said, like they are still fighting back. The shareholders voted against taking that off the market.

135
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,380
And also they're like kind of like involved in this like kind of like really sketchy lawsuit right now.

136
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,010
They, like, got clearance from a judge to go ahead with this,

137
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:26,310
like it's called this Texas two step procedure where they're like starting to like partition their assets and like sealed them from creditors.

138
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,549
Like, it's a little bit confusing to me personally, but I think what they're trying to do is like make it look like they have like less

139
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,410
assets so that they have to pay less to the people that they might have endured.

140
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:45,299
Which is, again, interesting because like you would think like Johnson Johnson, like at least they tried to be a leader in the vaccine.

141
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,370
Like we all know it and it was like a little iffy.

142
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:54,479
But they tried like you would think that they would be like really out like help that help a lot of people on their commission and

143
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,030
passion driven and they are like seems like they're really looking out for themselves and not the people that they kind of injured.

144
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,550
So yeah, it's was really interesting just for that reason too.

145
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Yeah. We also chose this article for like a few reasons.

146
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,680
Obviously, Josh and Alex both touched on this a bit, but like the pristine image of Johnson and Johnson,

147
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,259
I feel like it's definitely been tarnished over the last few years, which is very interesting because I remember being little and Johnson Johnson

148
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,190
being like the face of like like tear free shampoo and just like all this stuff.

149
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:30,330
And so it's interesting to see like how such a large corporation can, their image can change so drastically, even just by like a few things.

150
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,370
One product such as baby powder or like obviously the COVID vaccine,

151
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,410
which kind of was a flop, although that obviously has a lot of different sides to it.

152
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:44,470
I also like Alex. I thought it was very interesting about the social determinants of health aspect of it.

153
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,370
So the fact that it was still left in these cheaper stores, so who is being exposed, overexpose these toxic chemicals?

154
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,240
Obviously that's something we already know. But this is like hard the cold, hard evidence of that.

155
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:03,490
It also was a really interesting example of like how putting pressure on a big corporation can actually elicit change,

156
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,459
although they are like being sketchy still obviously with like these lawsuits and trying to pay less and and things like that.

157
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,700
Like there was a ton of pressure from like nonprofit organizations and public health organizations to remove this talk face powder.

158
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,950
And it did work to some degree, like it will be discontinued globally by 2023.

159
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:27,879
So I think that's something that we should all like remember and it can work in pressured in large numbers does actually work sometimes.

160
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:36,420
So yeah. Yeah.

161
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,520
We still on our questionnaire right now for my here's our putting on like did you ever use talc

162
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,050
for women like did you use common central area kind of a thyroid because that's what it is.

163
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,860
It's like if you put it on your genitals that it can potentially cause ovarian cancer.

164
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,560
I don't know. I just. I'm with you. I don't understand. It seems like an easy fix.

165
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,650
Like, why would you fight this so hard? And throughout, like, the whole.

166
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,830
Like all the lawsuits they've been maintaining the entire time, like, it does not cause cancer.

167
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,510
And they're like, Our product is safe. We're just changing it because like, the trends in the global markets are changing.

168
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,489
Like, that's what they keep saying. That's like their explanation, even though they're like it's almost as clear cause and effect.

169
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,139
So it's very interesting. It's really odd. Yeah. Um, I was curious.

170
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,320
You mentioned, like, it could cause, like, ovarian cancer and.

171
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:32,110
Women. Is there any, like, studies or did you guys see like how it impacted does it affect babies as well?

172
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,120
Or is it mostly just like the women that are like eventually developing cancer?

173
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,290
It didn't say in this particular article, I'm not sure.

174
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:48,200
I'm assuming it probably does affect anybody that's using it in the way that has been shown to cause cancer.

175
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,610
So it is sort of rare is the thing, right? Ovarian cancer is rare.

176
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,640
It took a bunch of time to figure out. This link.

177
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:05,500
It may just be that women who have ovarian cancer, you can ask them, hey, did you ever as an adult put this on yourself?

178
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,670
Right. And they can be like, Oh, yeah, I totally use that every day. Or, No, I've never done that.

179
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,660
Why would you do that? Right.

180
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:22,629
So it might be that, like if you have an ovarian cancer as an adult, you wouldn't know if you were if your mom used to baby powder on you as a baby.

181
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:30,790
So I don't know. Or it could just be that like the window of exposure is such that like using it as an adult is when it's bad, I don't know.

182
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:41,469
So I think it's just, it's, it's clearly not so commonly used and such a common exposure that ovarian cancer, it's not like smoking of lung cancer.

183
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,840
Right? We're like it's such a common exposure and there's been this huge increase in this cancer.

184
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:53,379
Right. Ovarian cancer is fairly rare. So it kind of hovers around pretty low on the list.

185
00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:00,580
And so it's not like we've seen some huge epidemic of ovarian cancer, which is potentially why it's been so hard to get them to take,

186
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:07,090
although the tobacco companies did their darnedest as well to like not take any responsibility.

187
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,540
I think the only thing with that is like tobacco. That was their product.

188
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,120
That was the way it is, as it seems like such a small portion that it's like very strange, it's very odd.

189
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,640
And there's a way to to keep the product on the shelves without it being just changed to like, I don't understand.

190
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,430
It doesn't I agree. It doesn't make a lot of sense.

191
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:32,860
There must be some money reason by like selecting the assortment to manufacture it this way or like the cornstarch itself is cheap,

192
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,519
but perhaps somehow making the product is hard.

193
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,830
I don't know, because a different formula or whatever it is or they'd already bought like a million,

194
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,390
million dollar and it was all sitting in the closet. They're like, We just cannot use it.

195
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,459
Yeah, just to respond to that, even because it might also just be a brand perception issue.

196
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,610
So they might be thinking that like if people are seeing that it's like cause cancer and freaking out about it,

197
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:02,950
they're worried that it's going to tarnish their reputation so that they're being like, no, no, it doesn't cause cancer.

198
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,790
So it just I know, I agree. I agree.

199
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,639
Just like in the in retrospect, don't you think just like putting these people in chocolate quiet, like,

200
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,590
and then changing your product would have been better because now it's all over the news and everyone's yelling about it, know?

201
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,460
I mean, like, you can have just been like, oh, so sorry, here's your money.

202
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,329
And then, like, changed it to cornstarch and, like, no one would have.

203
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,980
No, in the end, they could have pretended it was like, I don't like they could have made up any story for anything.

204
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,959
So we're going to change this for a start. You know, I don't know their reason for turning into cornstarch.

205
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,650
They have not said said it's because of like I said, they kind because I never went out in a way done that without like.

206
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,130
But it's fine, you know what I mean? I don't know. It was weird.

207
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,350
And, like, there was like a huge emphasis in the article about how, like, corn starch, that whole, like, it's like cheap air.

208
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,329
It's like, it's cheap, it's super efficient.

209
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:59,260
Like, it's not like it's like and I, I guess it would just be like the price of, like getting rid of the top on the shelves.

210
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,740
Must be like some huge cost to them. I don't know.

211
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,560
Weird. Well, I think we all know companies,

212
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,700
no matter how much we remember them with their tier list shampoo and their nice commercial, what they want is our money.

213
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,280
And if it's cheaper to let a few people die of ovarian cancer than to change the product,

214
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,150
I guess that's what they're going to fight to do, which is very upsetting.

215
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,060
Yeah. Well, on that note, let's also look at global cancer statistics.

216
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:51,210
Thanks, guys. I was going to. Yeah.

217
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,460
And again, if I forget about your news article and I just want to just.

218
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:02,350
You can interrupt me. You can just be like, wait, wait. We have a news article now standing on ceremony here when I do something dumb.

219
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,530
Yeah, I share it. But I'm not sure how.

220
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:33,250
Right. I have no.

221
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:52,900
Just a. Yeah.

222
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,590
Yes. I get in here? I am sorry.

223
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,970
Know you didn't run out there in that seat around? No.

224
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:10,300
I think you and some of them have five people. Some of the for you know, they don't get worse.

225
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,409
You were Jake. I am welcome to cluster in group eight.

226
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,010
Where's group eight guys. That right there I got.

227
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:36,730
Screen. Yeah, I just.

228
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:42,140
Over and over and over.

229
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:59,220
We don't. Oh, my jam.

230
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:05,050
And you're going to go to college. And.

231
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,790
Oh, yeah, I. Oh, so.

232
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,460
So I saw this, and it was about me and, you know.

233
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:32,720
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I know a lot.

234
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:46,560
Never heard so many voices as do it or it was small towns a little.

235
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,270
Yeah. Oh.

236
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,260
Oh. So first you do the first few more. You do more?

237
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:11,840
Yeah. These places are basically we're just going through the questions we just heard.

238
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,170
And also those are both.

239
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:28,560
No problem that. It's not unusual for. A number of reasons, but I think that's the number.

240
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:49,200
Yes. That's exactly what we don't want.

241
00:25:49,850 --> 00:26:02,440
You know what I'm really approving here?

242
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,540
Let's not go there to go through that.

243
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:19,419
That's just how it works out, is that you can interpret the normal standard theater.

244
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:27,720
They're very high. Out of the race that there is nothing in this case.

245
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:35,010
I would like you to institute more competition, but you've got it shows back up here.

246
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:46,140
All right. I have literally the number on it.

247
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,540
Okay. All right.

248
00:26:51,140 --> 00:27:16,100
So, yeah. In development, we can do high frequency analyzes of the population and then you can use your other methods and you can live with it.

249
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:25,350
I believe that happens. I feel like one of the things. I go to the island.

250
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:33,450
So if you want to do what you want along the left hand side.

251
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:42,080
Okay. So you want to pick where the buildings are sites and then you can choose a population here.

252
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,660
For others, like others are metals found by various things, including income levels.

253
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,180
First rate rise that makes athletes.

254
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:06,500
So now you're going to see which cancers there are. We're going to make a high income line.

255
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,070
So this is what they're going to do. Another one, some low income.

256
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:22,860
Oh. Oh. Sorry. It's very difficult to talk like I.

257
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:35,040
Okay. We're going to have to ask you also because we're ready.

258
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:43,420
It's not cool. There's nothing else that. Mr.

259
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:58,040
If you like. Think everybody is.

260
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,690
Yeah, I don't like it.

261
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:11,580
If you want to do more like oh, I just never thought of as acceptable in developing countries, which is great, you know, but also yeah.

262
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:23,910
Going out to other developing countries and different because I wanted to around I like to have.

263
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:28,970
Yeah, yeah yeah I know.

264
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,380
Because of it. I like that stuff in it. Yeah.

265
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,570
Yeah. So. Yeah.

266
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:49,130
Well. You know, I.

267
00:29:51,650 --> 00:30:00,890
I. Yeah.

268
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:06,610
Was like a totally different place.

269
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:18,350
Realize it was like Michigan. So what is your view about the country?

270
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:29,990
Not so much of your life anywhere in the world?

271
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:36,250
Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,510
Oh, yeah.

273
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,980
Know I was reading from.

274
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

275
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:04,960
Mr. President, it is very high energy, and I.

276
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,230
I've been doing that too. It's just hard to remember.

277
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:25,970
Yeah, I tried. I just feel like I just.

278
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,600
The way I. So I just let her do it.

279
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,070
Yeah. So it works and it's cool.

280
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:51,020
American immigration officials reinforced. So you don't have to do it.

281
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:59,380
But I do because I spend time in the world.

282
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:26,900
I haven't looked. I don't know where.

283
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:42,980
Yeah, that's. Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

284
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:52,190
Yeah. So then there.

285
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:05,900
Yeah. Yeah, I saw, you know.

286
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:14,690
Yeah, maybe it's just not. More than that in developing countries.

287
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,750
That's right. Yeah.

288
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah. They may have diplomats, but not in here.

289
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,320
Autographs. Out of my office. Yeah. Yeah.

290
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:39,800
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But if you have any good.

291
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,510
It's kind of random. He's really high.

292
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:02,080
For Heidi J. And then it goes down.

293
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,070
I think. Everyone smoked as well.

294
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:32,690
But. All.

295
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:48,060
France and Germany have. For.

296
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,440
Interesting stuff. So that was the.

297
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:23,460
And so I was very disappointed that you would say that this was not the.

298
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,340
I know. There's no question as.

299
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,480
We would one guy. You know?

300
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:44,560
I mean, how are you gonna. But the purpose of the question.

301
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,120
And. Right here.

302
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,800
Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Is there anything else?

303
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:11,210
You. I.

304
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,260
I. Yeah.

305
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,560
Yeah. Hey, guys, I've mentioned this to a couple of groups, and I think a lot of you have found it on your own body.

306
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,730
Just want to make sure it's clear. Like for the question there's not a right or wrong way to group these.

307
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,149
I just wanted you guys to note that you can group them in different ways.

308
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,380
You can look at HDI, you could look at income like you could choose a lot of different ways to look at this.

309
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:09,590
But if you're here in this like by population, you can click on like if I already have selected very high and then I click on pie,

310
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,280
now it's showing me for the very high and high groups.

311
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,730
Does that make sense? So like you can put you can group them together that way if you want.

312
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,589
Cool. I'm not saying that's I think when people do it, I have seen in a lot of publications,

313
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,190
I see people compare very high HDI to all of the other ones grouped together.

314
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,300
Now it seems to be kind of a standard way to do it. I'm not telling you to change your answer and do it that way.

315
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,930
You guys do it however you feel or however you've already started to do it is totally fine.

316
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,430
But I think when people do it, often they'll do it that way. Cool.

317
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:53,750
Carry on. One word.

318
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,630
So. I know my dad was a.

319
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,810
And yes, I was just reading.

320
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,650
I mean, how many groups are still working out? Number one, is somebody around to anybody on three.

321
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,340
All right. For one into two, because I love you.

322
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:43,800
The best one. It's interesting. There's a lot of.

323
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I have to. I don't know.

324
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,300
From now on. Oh, okay. More than you've ever done in, like, America.

325
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:10,250
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, you'll do by this time.

326
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,090
So are these all feelings? That's just the range of.

327
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:26,510
Hi, guys. Okay. Sure I'll take care of.

328
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,300
So how did it work with the user hold up.

329
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,950
Yeah. So, you know, if you go to canvas, you know, I already saw this account.

330
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,430
Did you see the sign? Graduate is pick around and I'm assigned to those people. Yup.

331
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,130
If there's one day they have fewer people.

332
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:51,290
Like if there's something that they don't like, have to, you know, I'm trying to limit it to 2 to 3 per day,

333
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:59,270
but if you have to go and visit before then, but essentially you're just going to pick a news article that's out there.

334
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:04,009
Yeah. And it's only in the past 30 days that catches your breath.

335
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:12,400
And so we've seen they did that. I've had people do like this trial pain treatment.

336
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:23,450
And there was a couple of years ago there was a woman at an Australian who had probably during her pregnancy had some kind of cancer.

337
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:31,490
She could be treated for it. So she had to make a final decision about whether she wanted to terminate a pregnancy, but she decided it was the right.

338
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:39,290
You know, I mean, so that kind of it can be kind of anything like I've had people do one about like a news article about like a kids camp,

339
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:45,740
a summer camp for kids for cancer and just really anything that's really anything that's really important because it always sparks good discussion.

340
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:54,000
No, I didn't. I think it's interesting to see what you guys find and the something like that.

341
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:15,060
Yeah. I'm just like Susie.

342
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:22,580
I've been through something. Because we did have a contact and like, you know, you never grow up.

343
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:38,540
And I'm sure there's like a really it's just so surprising like, like the highest by like looking for was in Australia and I was just amazed.

344
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:51,390
Yeah. Like. So what if I suggested?

345
00:41:53,110 --> 00:42:03,140
I think it's a very, very interesting one because it is a civil war or even just a dream.

346
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:17,690
Oh, I think they have something that is so like if you're looking at the U.S. compared to like sub-Saharan Africa,

347
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,980
where the huge pressure is building for developing countries, where the U.S. is.

348
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,850
Right. You would expect more higher rates, you know?

349
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,520
Right. When you were just visiting the population size,

350
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,600
those U.S. is always thinking of counting the number of cases by the number five of the population poverty.

351
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:43,460
So it's like the number of cases per X number were adjusted for each country.

352
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,190
The. We have.

353
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:05,280
We care about news but certainly most of what charred me is this okay to can eat

354
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,280
your vegetables and but like when you turn the meat that makes it easier for the.

355
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:17,560
I know you get stuff like that too. I think we aren't clear on whether it's the nitrates or.

356
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,829
Most people can fry their bacon and it's got a little bit of charm.

357
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:24,490
And so as far as what tastes good, I know it's the yummy part.

358
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,930
I think it's because we get to be really good.

359
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,770
So doing very well.

360
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,270
But it's been really good actually.

361
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:46,740
But you know. I don't know if you like your hands, but at the same time, you say that he's very much of.

362
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:59,720
He's going to make it sound better. What is that like?

363
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:10,510
I'm not really. Yeah.

364
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,270
Yeah. Like has cancer or something.

365
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:22,800
And I think it's that's something that I think is associated with reduced risk of cancer.

366
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,930
Yeah, I just.

367
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,910
Enjoy your campaign. No cigarets with that.

368
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:49,690
Right. If there's any other.

369
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:26,600
I see. On question free.

370
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,440
Is anybody done? Is anybody still in one?

371
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:40,050
We're all on two and three. All right, let's do, uh, seven more minutes.

372
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,779
Five more minutes. Let's do five. Do. Let's come back at 1025, 1020.

373
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:53,450
We'll talk about the answers, however much you get satisfied. Oh, you'll hear why I don't.

374
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:31,300
I'm like. Lower cigaret sales have up very very.

375
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:42,410
But once you get to something a little bit above ground here in South Sudan.

376
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,510
Yes, right now the government's over there.

377
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:53,720
So that's a good place to be.

378
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:16,320
She thinks like the first place they're very selling or some of the things that we don't have here ahead of me on tobacco because.

379
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:25,070
Yes, absolutely it is.

380
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:25,990
That's the only way we can.

381
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:35,750
But like people like Kerry and we're pretty young, like not that he was other, you know, like, well, voting for, like, the guy, for goodness sakes.

382
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:43,110
So anyway, there's nothing that I think is really clear.

383
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:54,080
Sometimes one of the better diet related parties.

384
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,430
But generally I would say I don't like that I.

385
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:06,430
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

386
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:11,050
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I think yeah, I it.

387
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,510
But then once you get to the U.S. in a different place, I would like to see everything.

388
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:32,510
Yeah. Yeah, actually, I just like trying to get in contact with violate the law, but like.

389
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:37,940
Yeah, and I think, yeah, I feel like I could see.

390
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,320
I would just like to. Yeah.

391
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:48,430
Actually, I heard separately from the singer.

392
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

393
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,220
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So fast and everything for like, for example.

394
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:01,720
Okay, so maybe I was just thinking about the questions I have sort of like.

395
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:13,479
You know what you say when I said I like you, I just think it is.

396
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,540
So there's something like, oh, really mean.

397
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,140
I miss my hair for fire.

398
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:30,729
Oh, I thought yes, I know that something like another but yeah.

399
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:34,330
So I think that's like oil.

400
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:44,220
Like to take it to oil. It's very confusing. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

401
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,230
It's not like there's like a data, right? Yeah. Okay, let me.

402
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,710
That's what this endures.

403
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:00,200
But it's not the only way. Yeah.

404
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:07,370
Yeah. So it turns out that inhaling the product is bad, cooking with it or smoking happens.

405
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,970
Let's see. All right, guys.

406
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:19,740
Wherever you're at is fine. Let's go ahead and go over this.

407
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:27,599
So the first thing I asked you to do was to look by development.

408
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,140
So who did anybody do an income in their group or did everybody do the HDI?

409
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:39,930
You did income. Okay. So I think usually when people do this, they compare sorry, the compare very high to all the rest.

410
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:44,700
So here's the very high picture that I got. What do you guys see here?

411
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:54,760
And this is men. So there's no breast. But it's, you know, kind of what we see in the U.S., right?

412
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,100
For our top cancers,

413
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:04,150
you also see a lot like lots of prostate cancer incidence because the U.S. is included in here and other places that do PSA screening,

414
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,719
but not much mortality. Same with colon.

415
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,830
Like you're doing a pretty good job of like doing colon.

416
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,830
You know, the people who do get colon cancer survive pretty well.

417
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:27,090
Did you guys notice anything different? And then if we stick the rest of these together and take this one out.

418
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:38,170
It's still pretty similar for men, but if we start going into the even lower who suddenly we end up with lip in oral cavity,

419
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:45,460
you still end up with a fair bit of lung. But what you start to do realize is that the mortality catches up, right?

420
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:55,480
And especially if you look at low HDI separately. Then we start to get liver cancer, for example, which of course is a infection associated cancer.

421
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:02,830
And you start to see pretty high mortality. The mortality bars are almost the same as the incidence bars, right?

422
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:10,520
Did anybody do this differently for men and what to point something out that they saw?

423
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:15,940
Or did I skip over something that you guys thought was interesting?

424
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,860
Yeah. We noticed you guys did an income, right?

425
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:32,150
Yeah, we did. So we did like high middle income or high end?

426
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,180
Upper middle and then low, middle and low together. Okay.

427
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,140
And so for that, we noticed the difference in the top three cancers.

428
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:48,139
Prostate is higher in lower and lower middle countries because when we rate because like PSA screening just

429
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:53,030
came a little bit later tonight in Saudi incidence rate shoots up similarly like it did to the U.S. rates.

430
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,120
So that's actually a good a good idea.

431
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,400
I don't know that that's true. Most of most places do not do population based PSA screening in the world.

432
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:08,000
It's really like the U.S. and Australia, even like European countries,

433
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,440
don't do it for some of the reasons why, like the overtreatment kind of reasons.

434
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,270
Right. That we are a little bit that we backed off on it for a little bit.

435
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,470
But um, yeah, so I would say that's probably not it.

436
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:30,290
That's a really good thought though. I think probably what you have is a lot of, um,

437
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:36,290
so there is a genetic component to prostate cancer such that black men are more likely to get prostate cancer.

438
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,600
They've even done like case control studies in, like Western Africa and seen quite high rates.

439
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:49,040
So even like men of African descent in the US, African-American men have 2 to 3 times the risk,

440
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,249
actually three times the mortality of white men, which is probably partly a lot of the socio social reasons that we've talked about.

441
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:02,059
Right. But also, if you look at men in Africa, there is there is quite a lot of prostate cancer.

442
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:06,110
Right. So probably some of that is just including African countries.

443
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:11,360
And that and that the the there is a genetic component in black men to prostate cancer risk.

444
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:22,290
Anything else? Let's look at women real quick just for fun.

445
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:30,740
These. So here we are, where we're still using low and middle income countries.

446
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,150
You still see a fair bit of breast, but lots of cervix, right.

447
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,640
And as you know, a lot of cervical mortality as well.

448
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:59,820
Anything else you guys noticed for women? Okay.

449
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:04,330
So then question two. I think I you do the same thing except by region.

450
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:12,880
So I had suggested. Excuse me.

451
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:19,180
I had suggested that you sort of look in a play with how you defined region or population.

452
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,930
So what did you guys decide to do? After the World Health Organization regions.

453
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:29,970
Okay. Oh, indeed we do.

454
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,770
So let's see. What did you. Let's pick, like W.H.O. Africa, just for fun.

455
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,210
We're looking at women. So lots of survivors, lots of breast.

456
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:49,810
If we do something instead like the Americas. Lots of press again, lots of servings.

457
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:55,210
So this is a little interesting because America's includes like Canada and the U.S.,

458
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:02,320
but it's also going to include like Mexico and all the Central American countries and South American countries.

459
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,709
Right. And cervical cancer is, of course, a huge issue.

460
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:14,350
And a lot of those more developing places, less so in the U.S. So you're kind of mixing in a way that I'm not sure is as meaningful.

461
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,530
It depends on what you want to do, right? Like if you're figuring out where you want to put like these are these W.H.O. regions.

462
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:23,799
The W.H.O. defines these regions. They put people in charge of these regions.

463
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,730
Right. This is how they're defined. There are W.H.O. offices that cover these regions.

464
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:33,420
So if you're trying to figure out kind of like what's going on in your region that you're in charge of, this might be really important to know.

465
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:41,260
Right? But if you're trying to understand what's going on in the world, I don't know that mixing us with Central America makes a ton of sense.

466
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,550
So many times. Did anybody choose a different way of putting it together?

467
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:55,540
Anything else you guys noticed or want to talk about? Okay.

468
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:03,440
And then for question three, I think I asked you to go to. Cancer tomorrow.

469
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:12,340
I always lose. I have to go back here and I want to go to cancer.

470
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:19,380
Okay. Yeah, that's what I want. And then I asked you to do Sweden and Uganda right now.

471
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:25,950
What's happening? This. So did I say I want to?

472
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,760
What did I say? I wanted rates. Uh huh.

473
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,580
That I want incidence. Incidence rate or incidence numbers or absolute numbers.

474
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:42,720
Okay, let's see. Let's do both sexes, all cancers.

475
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,640
And we're going to do. How do we do it?

476
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:57,140
Oh, choose populations. That's right. See, I always forget year to year how we do this.

477
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:06,350
Europe. That's where Sweden. And so you can see we're going to get like this 24% increase by 2040 compared to 2020.

478
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,370
Right. But if we go down and instead pick.

479
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,290
Uganda. What do.

480
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,330
140% increase. Huge difference, right?

481
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:31,470
So this is a cool thing to be able to generate and put in like the intro or conclusions of a talk, that kind of thing.

482
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:37,570
It's good to be able to do this kind of thing. Any other questions?

483
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:44,550
But this. Okay.

484
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:53,760
In that case, we will go on to group work for where we talk about major causes of cancer.

485
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:59,790
So just briefly, before you go talk about this. Does anybody remember what the population attributable fraction is?

486
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:11,250
Have you guys learned about this? Does anybody know about this? Okay. This is a statistic that people will calculate essentially.

487
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:17,580
What it tells you is what proportion of the disease in the population can be attributed to a particular exposure.

488
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:24,749
Okay. So when we did those, when we saw those pie charts in the introduction class and I said like 30% of cancer smoking,

489
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:29,280
30% is this and that those were essentially population attributable fractions.

490
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,370
Okay. And this is how you would calculate that.

491
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:42,660
But essentially it's the proportion of a cancer in our case is the proportion of a cancer that is due to a particular cause, a particular risk factor.

492
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:48,210
Okay. And that's kind of what you're going to find in this question for.

493
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:53,220
All right. So let's go ahead and work on that.

494
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,370
And question five. Okay, so let's do four and five.

495
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:09,520
Let's finish up four and five and then next time we'll go over those answers.

496
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:14,930
Okay. So we got about 20 minutes. We'll finish up the group work today and then we'll discuss it.

497
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:28,660
Not. How many companies? Yes.

498
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,700
How was. Yeah.
