1
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:09,385
Our first all class meeting was a was a welcome where we talked about the course in a little bit about the format.

2
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:15,595
Today's are the previous forum. The second forum talked about writing assignment number one.

3
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:20,965
Really give you an outline of that and what you would need to be successful on writing assignment number one.

4
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:28,615
Today's forum is more of a conversation. It's with an expert at the School of Public Health, Dr. Marissa Eisenberg,

5
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:35,605
who you already saw and got an introduction to in the recorded online lesson about infectious diseases.

6
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:43,915
So she's going to join us in a couple of moments to answer some questions about infectious diseases that broadly,

7
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,935
but really with a more targeted focus on COVID 19.

8
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:54,645
For those of you who have completed that online lesson, you could tell that it was recorded pre-pandemic.

9
00:00:54,655 --> 00:01:01,705
And as you can imagine, there have been some pretty big changes in the world of infectious diseases in the last few years.

10
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:08,424
So we've invited Dr. Eisenberg to have a conversation with me and to answer some student questions so

11
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:14,215
that you can hear about what's changed in the world of infectious diseases in this post COVID space.

12
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:19,225
So we will dove on in. Marissa, thank you.

13
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:24,685
First of all, so much for joining us today and for being a consistent member of the public health.

14
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:31,764
200 guests speaking crew. All of the students have should have by now watched your infectious disease

15
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:36,715
lecture and said they're familiar with you and infectious diseases broadly.

16
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:44,275
So I'm just going to go ahead and start our questions. I will invite students to submit questions via the Q&A at any time.

17
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:50,574
We have some guys who have joined the call, and at a couple of different points in our conversation,

18
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:54,685
I will ask them if they could read things from the Q&A. So, Marissa, you and I don't have to worry about that.

19
00:01:55,405 --> 00:02:00,595
We'll leave that to my co teaching colleagues that students, please feel free to submit questions when you have them.

20
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:13,585
So the first question that I wanted to just to pose to you, everyone on this webinar is intimately familiar with coronavirus confession.

21
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:20,175
My family finally fell last week for the first time, three out of five mild cases.

22
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:29,305
Everyone's vaccinated to the hilt, and my middle son and I got to enjoy a little vacation at a hotel while the other ones did Thursday.

23
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:34,795
So, yes, we're intimately familiar with COVID and its impact on our lives.

24
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:40,975
But can you tell us a little bit more about COVID 19 as an infectious disease,

25
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:47,185
maybe comparing it to other infectious diseases that we are more familiar with historically, like the flu?

26
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:52,584
Yeah. So, I mean, as everyone knows, it's a respiratory it's a viral respiratory illness.

27
00:02:52,585 --> 00:03:00,205
So it is like the flu in that way. And that flu is also a virus that is a respiratory illness or that causes a respiratory illness.

28
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,034
They both have pretty similar symptoms.

29
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:08,725
So, you know, COVID causes, as many of you are probably familiar at this point, but, you know, commonly the sort of coughing,

30
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:14,515
sneezing, runny nose, fever, fatigue, sore throat, all the usual respiratory illness, types of things.

31
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:20,935
They both are spread through the air, through large and small droplets of all various sizes.

32
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:24,204
And so there's an there's an like an airborne piece to it.

33
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:28,015
There's also some degree of, you know, you can find them both on surfaces and things,

34
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:33,235
but it doesn't seem to be as much of at least for COVID, it doesn't seem to be as much of the mode of transmission.

35
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:41,905
I think the big differences in terms of between COVID and flu, I mean, so COVID but spreads a lot more easily than flu.

36
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:47,485
I don't I guess they probably haven't seen the basic reproduction number or any of those kinds of concepts yet.

37
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:50,725
Well, I guess you saw it in my talk. I did in my lecture.

38
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:54,385
Excellent. That's awesome. Makes life easy for me. Yeah, exactly.

39
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:59,335
But so, you know, like, flu typically has a basic reproduction number.

40
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:06,535
So an average number of people that one infected person will will spread to in a totally susceptible population of like one point something.

41
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:11,305
And COVID is well above that. I mean, it started probably around two and it's gone up since.

42
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:16,165
So so I think, you know, COVID spreads more easily than flu.

43
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:22,075
It can also cause more severe illness than flu. And so those two things are pretty big differences.

44
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:26,095
It also people with COVID can take longer to show symptoms.

45
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:31,915
They remain contagious for longer and they can start transmitting earlier before symptom onset.

46
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:38,035
And so COVID also tends to have more superspreading events. So it ends up the COVID is just a lot harder to control.

47
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:44,185
Not that we have exactly controlled flu in the past anyhow, but you know, than flu, it tends to be more transmissible.

48
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,665
It can be more severe. That was longer than you probably needed. But anyway, there are.

49
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:55,454
So how has this knowledge of the previous knowledge about infectious diseases and

50
00:04:55,455 --> 00:05:00,795
how is that aided and how infectious disease specialist have thought about COVID?

51
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,134
And you touched on this a little bit,

52
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:10,545
but what are those factors that really do make COVID uniquely challenging to tackle from a public health perspective?

53
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:16,575
Yeah. So I mean, COVID is I mean, so certainly knowledge of past infectious diseases has helped us a lot.

54
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:24,765
We have for a long time had data streams and metrics that we use for respiratory illnesses more broadly.

55
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:30,675
You know, the ways that we think about how to sort of triangulate between cases testing percent positivity.

56
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:37,295
To understand when you see a change, is it because more people are testing or fewer people are testing all those?

57
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,955
Or is it a real change in transmission?

58
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:45,165
All of those things were things that respiratory infectious disease epidemiologists had been thinking about for a long time.

59
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:49,365
So it's definitely informed how we track and how we understand COVID.

60
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:57,225
It's also like, you know, we've we've had some experience, you know, whenever there's been pandemics before.

61
00:05:57,255 --> 00:06:00,705
Right. And so we've seen how that played out for 1918.

62
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:04,215
We saw how we responded to H1N1 in 2009.

63
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:11,534
People have put together sort of pandemic playbooks that, you know, got followed to a greater or lesser extent once something actually happened.

64
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:15,735
But, you know, I think it gave people at least a starting point for thinking about how to respond

65
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:21,585
to this kind of thing and not just for the sort of the respiratory illnesses,

66
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:26,835
too, but vaccine rollout, too. I mean, I know there was a lot of looking at how did rollout go?

67
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:32,745
How long did it, you know, for other vaccines in the past, measles, polio, you know, all kinds of different things.

68
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:37,155
And, you know, there's a lot of things that are common when you roll out a new vaccine,

69
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:43,995
that initial uptake and then the slow trudge to try and get everybody, you know, the coverage all the way there.

70
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:48,885
And so, you know, there's a lot of that that I think did help inform the response.

71
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:58,935
But COVID is kind of in this sort of sweet and not a sweet spot, bad spot, perfect storm, whatever the right word is where it spreads easily.

72
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:02,085
It has asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission.

73
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:08,444
And but it also has these potentially serious effects where you can have more severe illness that make it,

74
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:15,345
you know, particularly difficult to tackle, I would say, compared to a lot of other infectious diseases so far.

75
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:22,095
More so it's such a I think this is the third time you've joined us in this conversation since the pandemic has started.

76
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:27,555
And there's a there's a geeky part of me that wants to get all the videos and just like watch them side by side,

77
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:35,855
because, you know, the conversation that we had around about prevention and vaccination and even just that,

78
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:41,085
that question that I just asked about how has the knowledge of how has the infectious

79
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:45,735
disease community really looked at COVID and how our information has changed?

80
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:52,025
Your response to that has changed over these three years and in really fascinating ways.

81
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:57,135
Students, I can put the old forums on here so you can see them not just now,

82
00:07:57,135 --> 00:08:01,515
but just how, you know, and we'll get to some of these these changes over time.

83
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:06,165
But but I'm going to move to our next theme because I think the role that you have

84
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:10,545
played with the state government in the last few years is is really remarkable.

85
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:19,335
So you've been involved throughout the pandemic advising the state of Michigan, Department of Health and Human Services.

86
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:25,214
Can you talk to the students a little bit about what your role has looked like?

87
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:27,555
And as an infectious disease specialist,

88
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:35,625
some of the contributions that you've made to shape the state of Michigan's response to the pandemic over the course of the last two and a half years.

89
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:40,725
Yeah. So, I mean, I should emphasize first that I'm not a policymaker.

90
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:45,465
You know, my role is to act as an advisor, but I'm not the one who decides policy in any way.

91
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:54,704
But but I guess, like as a quick timeline so early in the pandemic, I hilariously I was like dead set that I was not going to do COVID.

92
00:08:54,705 --> 00:09:03,255
I was like, I'm not going to do it. I had I had like had I worked for a while on, like responding to emerging outbreaks and different, you know,

93
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:07,784
I'd worked on cholera in Haiti and I worked on the ball and I was like, I've done too many of these things.

94
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:08,895
I'm not going to do it anymore.

95
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:15,465
And then, of course, that went right out the window as soon as this thing really got going because there was, you know, whatever.

96
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:21,495
But it needed to happen. But so I guess I started off early on.

97
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:29,025
I was I started off actually working with Washtenaw County and then we had had previous collaborations with DHHS on Hepatitis A and some other things.

98
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:32,564
And so I started working with some of the folks at my DHHS,

99
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:39,345
which eventually led to me helping to advise the governor on some of her early pandemic response.

100
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:47,975
And I was doing a lot of modeling and analysis to do forecasting and projections to understand where there might be hot.

101
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:52,794
Efforts to sort of build metrics and dashboards and tools and all kinds of things.

102
00:09:52,795 --> 00:10:04,135
And so sort of helped to build a lot of the initial like metrics and modeling kind of infrastructure for, for, for that sort of thing.

103
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:13,135
We've been involved in an advisory capacity, but been involved in a lot of the policy decision making just to help give some data,

104
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:17,784
to help, you know, policymakers in their making as they're making decisions.

105
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:26,935
So the stay home, stay safe, initial sort of shutdown that was sort of happening in the first wave of the epidemic or of the pandemic, rather.

106
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:29,725
And then also the pause to save lives and things like that.

107
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:37,585
We've done a lot of analysis just to sort of provide some data to help inform what might happen, what if scenarios, that kind of thing.

108
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:39,655
So it's been a lot of that kind of stuff. That's right.

109
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:45,265
Because you really started working with the state government prior to the rollout of vaccines, right.

110
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:48,985
When there was this conversation about how long will it take for vaccines to come online?

111
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,944
What will those look like? How long will they take to get into arms?

112
00:10:52,945 --> 00:11:01,465
And so you were advising the state at this moment when really the best protection that we had was to stay home and to stay away from each other.

113
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:08,245
So it was a really different. Yeah, it's been two and a half years, but it's sometimes it's hard to kind of get back into that mindset of how,

114
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:15,564
how limited we were as a public health community and being able to prevent transmission or we had so many fewer tools.

115
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,905
I mean, we didn't have vaccines, we didn't have good treatments.

116
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:23,605
You know, the health care system hadn't had a chance to adapt and kind of get their infrastructure in place.

117
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:28,005
It was a very different yeah, it was a, it was a wild time, but yeah,

118
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:32,805
it was a wild time and something that we're, we're not going to talk about a lot or it's,

119
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:34,435
it's not in my presupposed questions,

120
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:40,375
although students might have some things they want to ask but am very different space about our knowledge, about masking.

121
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:45,654
And that's like that was a whole, you know, now two years ago we had a lot of conversations about that.

122
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:50,034
We don't even have a complete picture of like, you know, at that at the very early stages,

123
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:53,635
we weren't sure if Fomite, you know, surface based transmission was playing a role.

124
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:59,395
There was a lot that we just really didn't know. So we had to wrangle with a lot of this uncertainty.

125
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:05,154
Yeah, which is a huge challenge. Yeah. Yeah, you mentioned uncertainty.

126
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:09,384
I was wondering what were some of the other kind of big challenges that you faced

127
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:14,155
as you were serving in this advisory capacity to the governor and her colleagues?

128
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:23,395
Yeah, so uncertainty was a big one. I mean, in the early now it's funny like now when we talked to folks in the governor's office or at HHS,

129
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:28,685
they're super comfortable with if I show them a confidence region, they know exactly what that means.

130
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:35,545
Like they've seen it a bunch of times, like, you know, but in the early days, there was a lot of like, wait, which what is going to happen?

131
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:41,545
Like, you know, there was a sense of like, we're supposed to get one number and you have to kind of be like, that's not a thing.

132
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:47,395
We have like a range. That's all we've got. So, like, you know, so I think uncertainty was certainly a challenge.

133
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:53,485
I think like balancing, it's not even really our my challenge,

134
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:58,855
but it was interesting to watch balancing what's possible versus what our recommendations were,

135
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:04,404
you know, the politics and the reality of what people are willing to do and all of those things.

136
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:11,025
You know, it was very interesting to see, you know, the the MDA,

137
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:16,315
HHS and the governor's office, too, were very engaged and wanted to understand the data.

138
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:23,605
But the the actual policy and kind of how it shakes out, it's an interesting thing to see kind of how the sausage gets made.

139
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:30,655
And that, I think, was certainly a big challenge, was to kind of balance what's possible with what you might want to do if you could.

140
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:34,044
And, you know, you don't always have the resources to do what you want to do, right?

141
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:38,155
If people aren't enabled to be able to practically stay home, you know what I mean?

142
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:41,615
There's a lot of things that it's hard to. So that I think is tricky.

143
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:50,364
There's also, as an academic, there's a challenge in when you're working with policymakers,

144
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:56,455
there is a limited window in which they need the information or they have to make a call, and that's that.

145
00:13:56,755 --> 00:14:04,105
So like my as a methods person in particular, a lot of what my regular research is is on like modeling methods.

146
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:12,865
And so I my instinct towards rigor has to be balanced with how long if it's going to take three weeks to run those simulations.

147
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:17,875
Maybe we should come up with something a little more quick and dirty, but that can at least inform something, right?

148
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,815
And so that, I think, is also kind of a big challenge.

149
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:29,425
And like, yeah, I guess one sorry, I'm answering your questions very long, but one last challenge for me personally and you know,

150
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:38,935
just as like a day in the life, whatever, I also had a kiddo during 2020 and so I had my my daughter in May 2020.

151
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:42,595
And so there was a lot of work life balance challenge to work out there too.

152
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:46,585
So I'm really glad you added that last one, because I think that the.

153
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:53,685
He knew it with this group of people and up there with it with the governor and pregnant.

154
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:58,935
I remember feeling so proud of you as a colleague and as a parent.

155
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:02,954
I was thinking, I didn't know you. I didn't know that it was a daughter at the time.

156
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:09,315
But like now I was like, That's soccer mom kick ass in this really amazing high stakes moment.

157
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:17,895
You really came through for the state. So you've said before, you're not a policymaker.

158
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:21,915
You are. You're an infectious disease specialist. You specialize in modeling.

159
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:27,265
So I'm going to ask you this question. But but, you know, with those caveats.

160
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:35,595
So the state of Michigan has had kind of a consistent leader and Governor Whitmer,

161
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:43,575
but the federal government had a couple of different couple different heads of state here in the last few years.

162
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:51,374
And so I'm wondering about a little bit not so much the politics of it, but where that kind of interplay was,

163
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:59,114
or if there is anything you noticed with how the state kind of rolled out their policies or the support they had in their

164
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:05,085
interactions with the federal government across the board or in the conversations with the two different administrations?

165
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:13,784
Yeah, I do think there was definitely a very different like there were some differences in the sense of like in the relationship

166
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:20,265
between I mean like there were some public like things that happened between Governor Whitmer and president at the time.

167
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:27,224
Trump You know, like so there was some tension in certain ways that, you know, that that I think probably impacted the relationship.

168
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:36,345
But the between the public health agencies themselves, between CDC and state public health, that was not as like, you know,

169
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:43,244
the the bigger picture, the sort of like political environment that they were operating in shifted a huge amount.

170
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:49,574
But the the actual real relationships between CDC and state public health didn't change that much really.

171
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:55,245
I mean, they've had like the US public health system is like a weird, interesting kind of.

172
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,405
Decentralized, maybe kind of fragmented system anyway.

173
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:03,485
And so those relationships kind of, I think, were not as.

174
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:07,315
As different over the course of the time. Yeah.

175
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,874
I don't know if that answers your question exactly, but. Yeah, I don't know.

176
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:18,395
But I think it's a it's an important point to the that, you know, we there are political there's a political element to this.

177
00:17:18,395 --> 00:17:23,405
But in the end of the day, we talk about in this club kind of the foot soldiers of public health, right?

178
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:29,705
Those people who are working in their local state, how their local health department, even at the state level,

179
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:37,954
people have been doing this work in a very non politicized environment for most of their lives and anon and,

180
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:46,025
you know, public servants but not very, very much in the public eye and how much that that shifted things and how much that shifted in the pandemic.

181
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:51,964
Yeah, the increased politicization of public health, I think was something that I don't know.

182
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:58,355
I think a lot of people, particularly in local public health, had not experienced to the degree that they saw there.

183
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:03,364
And I mean, in Michigan, we've seen pretty intense fallout of some of that in certain cases.

184
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:07,655
I mean, like so like Lisa Peacock, you know, was the you know,

185
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:14,134
was a public health officer in one of the sort of, you know, sort of northern kind of counties.

186
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:21,784
And like there's the that she, you know, when she tried to sort of follow what she felt were the best public health practices,

187
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:29,045
she got like ousted in a very intense and kind of scary way by you know so there's been some real

188
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:33,455
interesting like I think that piece has been really tricky and I don't think public health.

189
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:34,914
I don't know.

190
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:40,635
Like there are pieces of the public health infrastructure that have to deal with the politics all the time and are very sort of used to it.

191
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:49,735
But the intensity of the way that polarization interacted with the sort of public health powers here, I think was strange.

192
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:52,735
And I don't think everyone had prepared themselves for it.

193
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:57,204
Yeah. Yeah. The the students on this call all submitted a paper last Thursday,

194
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:03,305
and they had an opportunity to analyze one of three different public health policies and students,

195
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:07,135
you know, having spent a lot of time on one specific policy,

196
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:14,575
I would imagine it's hard to even conceptualize the idea that that policy would garner, you know,

197
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:21,115
would someone would lose their job or they would garner death threats like the Kent County Health Department Department lead face.

198
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,955
So, yes, normally public health does not have this this visible,

199
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:30,745
highly contentious space even of the issues that we address are controversial or can be contentious.

200
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:40,374
And the policies aren't always widely supported. But but this really was an outlier in terms of the public outcry about things like masking policies,

201
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:44,155
specifically as the one that seemed to be the most contentious.

202
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:50,365
Well, I'll I'll ask one more question before I invite some questions from the students.

203
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:55,135
So as of now, I think when I looked earlier in the week,

204
00:19:55,675 --> 00:20:02,454
there have been over 96 million confirmed cases and over 1 million deaths in the

205
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:07,405
US that are related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the virus linked to COVID 19.

206
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:18,445
That gives the United States the highest death rate in the world. So Marissa, from your perspective, why is the US look so bad?

207
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:26,755
Why are our numbers such an outlier compared to the rest of the world or the developed world and moving forward in the pandemic?

208
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:29,665
Are there things that we can do to improve our circumstances?

209
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:39,865
Yeah, so I think the pandemic really exposed a lot of the cracks and weaknesses in both our health care system and our public health system.

210
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:43,315
The US has this very individualistic culture, right?

211
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:50,515
And we don't have any kind of universal health care or like universal system like we have or whatever.

212
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:55,555
I mean, you can have your opinions about this, but we many people do not have access to care in a sort of easy way.

213
00:20:56,335 --> 00:21:03,925
And our public health system also is decentralized in a way that can mean some interesting innovation and local leadership,

214
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:06,804
but also means there's no central organizing.

215
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:14,515
I mean, the CDC provides central organizing authority, but a lot of the day to day policymaking is set by states and counties.

216
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:27,235
And so we we don't have a kind of central structure to when we have faced something like a pandemic, it requires collective group action,

217
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:34,165
like in a in a in the sense that the early interventions in particular and many of the kinds of policy,

218
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:38,135
they're not just at the individual level if you want to protect your population.

219
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:42,895
And so I think this kind of, you know,

220
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:47,935
exposed a lot of the vulnerabilities that have been causing a lot of the problems

221
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:52,015
that we've seen in terms of health care and public health in the US for a long time.

222
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:59,364
But then they they led to kind of these like fault lines that that opened when we were faced with the pandemic.

223
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:10,194
So I think a lot of it is is that kind of thing. I mean, so, you know, to to to tackle a pandemic, you need sort of three things, right?

224
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:16,015
You need early, strong action to stop, spread and flatten the curve and do all those kinds of things,

225
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:18,475
build up your infrastructure, give yourself buy yourself time.

226
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:24,325
But then you also need like willingness and ability to actually stick with it in the long term.

227
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:25,855
And by ability,

228
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:32,425
I mean people have to have the resources to be able to do things like take time off work and stay home and take care of their kids when they're sick.

229
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:38,305
So that you don't kind of keep exposing people by putting them back into, you know, spaces with others.

230
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:42,174
And so and then we need effective treatments and vaccines and that kind of thing.

231
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:48,444
And so, you know, I think I don't know, going forward, I think we need to think about how to do this sustainably.

232
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,245
We're not it's not going away.

233
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:59,355
And we need to build you know, we need to build both people's immunity through vaccines to ensure that we don't have as you know,

234
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:02,935
we reduce severe illness and severe outcomes like death and hospitalization.

235
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:10,375
And we also need to build real support systems that ensure that people can manage the ongoing,

236
00:23:10,825 --> 00:23:15,774
you know, sort of like the ongoing burden of COVID that's going to continue to be here.

237
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:25,105
So yeah, yeah. It feels like in many ways there's it's become the expectation has been about kind of individual

238
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:30,204
risk tolerance and those individual sessions that people make at this point of the pandemic.

239
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:33,925
But I know that in the discussion sections later this week, the GSA is.

240
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:39,705
We're going to talk about vaccination broadly and have just a couple of slides that addresses COVID 19 and where there really still

241
00:23:39,705 --> 00:23:47,175
are some important efforts that need to be made by the public health community to increase vaccination and to help folks get boosted.

242
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:52,285
There's still a space for public measures there. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

243
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:57,194
I mean, you know, we're only at, what, 60 something percent, even primary serious, much less boost it.

244
00:23:57,195 --> 00:24:05,885
Right? There is definitely room for that. There's also I just walked into my chair, but there's definitely room for improvement and places to talk.

245
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,455
Keep working. Yeah, for sure.

246
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:18,115
Well, I'm going to invite one of our guests, De La Torre, to just share if there are any questions in the Q&A that she wants to pose to Dr. Eisenberg.

247
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:21,745
Yeah, I'm going to start off with the first one we received that says,

248
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:27,984
I've been told one of the identical identifiable features of COVID 19 has been the prevalence of scar tissue

249
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:35,274
build up in the lungs is an area of concern as we look forward to chronic diseases caused by COVID like COPD.

250
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:40,645
And are there other SaaS viruses that this cause that cause the same type of scar tissue in the lung?

251
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:43,045
That's an that's an interesting question.

252
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:55,435
So so I don't know I don't know as far as sort of other other scars, you know, other coronaviruses and things like this,

253
00:24:55,435 --> 00:25:02,845
whether they cause that same kind of scar tissue build up there are the yeah.

254
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:11,455
So that that piece I'm not sure about, but I do definitely think that the sort of longer term view of like what you're getting at is kind of like,

255
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:16,435
do we need to like what are like what's what's going to happen with long COVID in some sense, right?

256
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:23,454
And like thinking about like not just, I mean, long COVID has many forms, but among those like lung tissue damage and things like that.

257
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:31,885
And I think we don't yet really know the answer in terms of, you know, are, you know, will will some of those things.

258
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:37,345
I mean, it's certainly an area of concern. Yes, absolutely. And it's something that we're going to need to be thinking about.

259
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:40,824
Like, you know, COVID, I think, was now added to the list.

260
00:25:40,825 --> 00:25:46,374
The U.S. like disabilities, the things that are covered under the Disabilities Act list.

261
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:53,125
You know, I think we're going to be wrangling with this for a long time and it's going to take a while for us to really understand,

262
00:25:53,635 --> 00:26:00,204
like the chronic view of COVID and sort of what the long term impacts are and how that interacts with other chronic diseases.

263
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:04,855
But it's definitely an area of concern for sure. So kind of switching a little bit.

264
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:08,815
So thinking about the US response to this, the 2009 swine flu,

265
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:16,135
why do you think that COVID had such a different level of collaboration and engagement between epidemiology policy,

266
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:22,075
social response and thinking about that collaboration between those or those different aspects of health?

267
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:31,085
Yeah, I mean, I think. 2009 was there was a lot of collaboration that sort of happened.

268
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:39,515
You know, when when that was ongoing, there were, you know, collaborations between epidemiology and policy and things like that.

269
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,785
But the social response was not sort of marshaled to that.

270
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:48,095
And even the collaboration between policy makers and infectious disease epi folks and stuff like that, it wasn't,

271
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:55,525
I think the the pandemic when it became clear just what the scope and how intense it was going to be,

272
00:26:55,535 --> 00:27:05,405
it was a very all hands on deck kind of a moment. And and so, you know, it's it's it's good in a way to see that we can do that when we need to.

273
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:09,964
Sometimes it'd be nice if we could do it more often, but but yeah.

274
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:17,705
So, so I think, I think the there was a, as the, as 2009 unfolded and it sort of wasn't as.

275
00:27:19,045 --> 00:27:22,975
Not to say that it wasn't severe. I mean, it was a huge it was a huge issue during the time,

276
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:31,284
but it didn't like this pandemic turned into such an enormous challenge that I think it prompted this very all hands on deck.

277
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:34,385
Everybody work on it now together. Yeah.

278
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:43,475
There's some questions about what made COVID so political compared to, like, swine flu.

279
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:52,265
And maybe could you talk a little bit about the faculty of encouraging persuading

280
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:59,435
individuals to engage in specific health behaviors like taking vaccines or wearing masks?

281
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:12,215
Yeah, I think the the so in terms of why it was so much more political, I think there is there's a couple of things happening here.

282
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:21,274
So one, the it was a much it was much more heavily in the spotlight than many previous public health,

283
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:27,635
you know, challenges or emergencies that we faced. The other thing I think is that our political.

284
00:28:28,705 --> 00:28:37,675
Sort of system or like ah, the background sort of politicization was different than it was in 2009 or in other circumstances.

285
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:44,004
I mean, we've seen there's been a lot of data showing increasing polarization even since 2009.

286
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:50,845
Like, you know, since I think I saw a talk today actually about this that showed that like politicization, you know,

287
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:56,755
the kind of like sort of split between Republicans and Democrats has increased

288
00:28:57,355 --> 00:29:01,945
a bunch even just in that sort of ten year span between 2009 and 2019 or so.

289
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:11,185
And so I think, you know, we were in a different kind of political environment that meant that a lot more things were getting politicized.

290
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:24,924
And then, you know, when when the pandemic hit, I mean, there was to some degree, I don't know, there was a failure of our political leadership.

291
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:29,185
In some sense. There are certain things that probably should have been kind of kept.

292
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:34,524
Deliberately kept neutral, but it's advantageous politically to politicize them.

293
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:39,745
And so that, I think, is something that happened there that was a real missed opportunity for us.

294
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:47,045
Thank you. Well, then let's type let's go back to our script a little bit here.

295
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:53,655
Marissa and I, one of the obviously the most contentious or most controversial issue was mask wearing.

296
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:58,965
You had to do it when they had to do it, what the consequences were of not doing it.

297
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:01,935
So let's bring it back to the data.

298
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:09,015
What have you seen or what is the data really tell us at this point in time whether that's data from campus or from the state of Michigan?

299
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:14,025
What do we know about the effect of masking on preventing COVID infections?

300
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:20,445
Yes. So masking is a is a really effective way of preventing COVID infections.

301
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:25,335
I'm going to share a couple of slides. I threw some things together, if that's okay.

302
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:30,785
See here. Oh, can you make me fancy? There you go.

303
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:34,165
Thank you. Okay. So.

304
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:37,905
So I wanted to share this is from fall 2021.

305
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:42,185
I just thought this was kind of an interesting I'll show some more general masking stuff later.

306
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:51,064
But there was a there's an interesting example with schools masking in schools, which was what one of the sort of contentious topics.

307
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:54,265
And I thought this is some Michigan data that I thought was interesting to see.

308
00:30:54,275 --> 00:31:01,895
So this is from fall 2021 when there were there were still like quite a lot of

309
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:08,015
counties that or district school districts that were requiring masks in in schools.

310
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:17,674
And so in fall 2021, we had the Delta wave and you can see that the 5 to 18 year olds so that's our school age group really takes off during the

311
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:24,995
first days of school in Michigan and and takes off and has kind of this increased case rates compared to other age groups.

312
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:27,724
Interestingly, you can see like the 31 to 50,

313
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:33,274
which is probably like parents taking off sort of shortly thereafter, which I thought was kind of interesting.

314
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:44,165
But so if you look at these 5 to 18 year old cases and you break them down by districts that required masks versus those that didn't,

315
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:53,345
I just this is what this is what you see. The districts that had mask requirements or partial mask requirements are these blue and

316
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:58,355
orange lines and districts that did not have mask requirements are these red this red line?

317
00:31:58,355 --> 00:32:03,184
And so there's a real difference. Now, there's a lot of other things that are probably different between those districts.

318
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:10,834
So we did do some modeling where we used a regression model to adjust for things, other kinds of behavioral patterns,

319
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:19,265
testing, vaccination, social contact, as much as we could get that through proxies with mobility data and things like that.

320
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:28,865
And it you still see this effect actually. So it does seem like districts that did not have mask requirements saw higher case rates.

321
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:32,494
But if you look at other data from other places,

322
00:32:32,495 --> 00:32:40,565
there's a lot of data showing that masks are effective at preventing, you know, sort of COVID transmission.

323
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:45,515
Maybe. Actually, I have like a pile of slides, but maybe I'll I'll not worry about it too much.

324
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:54,725
But there's there's a lot of different estimates that have suggested that mask wearing, you know, is a useful way to to prevent transmission.

325
00:32:54,725 --> 00:33:02,284
I mean, it does it does seem to work. So, yeah, that that that that graph really a picture is worth a thousand words there.

326
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:06,545
I mean, that's a that's a really start, a really, really interesting finding.

327
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:14,615
Um, so moving to I'll allow students to ask questions in the Q&A if they have more questions about masking.

328
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:20,435
But why don't you move a little bit to talking more about vaccine or the vaccines?

329
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:29,405
So could you talk a little bit about vaccine efficacy and thinking both about preventing all infections,

330
00:33:29,855 --> 00:33:39,274
preventing symptomatic or the role of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and then their efficacy in serious infections and by serious infections,

331
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:43,115
those that would require hospitalization or could lead to death.

332
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:50,705
Yeah. Yeah. So so vaccines, I mean, so first off, yes, they are they are very effective particularly.

333
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:56,704
I mean, you know, at this point, they're perhaps like we've had they you know, the immunity wanes over time.

334
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:58,325
And this is why it's important to get boosters.

335
00:33:58,325 --> 00:34:06,034
But they particularly against serious infections, against preventing hospitalization or death, they are incredibly effective.

336
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:09,395
And I actually I'm going to share my screen again.

337
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:18,485
I want to show one another thing. This one is just just just from the CDC data tracker.

338
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:23,915
Hang on just a second. Um, here we go.

339
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:28,695
Okay. So I wanted to just share this.

340
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:33,304
I thought this was this is a the CDC has this on their data tracker.

341
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:36,725
You can take a look at this. You know, they keep it up on their data page.

342
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:44,435
But I think this is really useful as an illustration of how much of a difference it makes and how it changes over time.

343
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:53,105
So you can you can see here. So in the in the in July, which is the most recent data they have there, you know,

344
00:34:53,255 --> 00:35:01,384
unvaccinated people had 2.4 times the risk of testing positive in August, 2.7 times the risk.

345
00:35:01,385 --> 00:35:05,795
So but a much greater reduction in the probability of death.

346
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:10,415
So it really prevents, you know, severe outcomes especially well.

347
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:16,355
So five times the risk of dying from COVID 19 if you're unvaccinated compared to if you're vaccinated

348
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:23,404
and here's deaths per population over time in the unvaccinated group and in the vaccinated group.

349
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:29,735
And you can really see when you're in a surge and you're in that kind of crunch where there's a lot of transmission happening, the.

350
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:35,825
So like right now in July, there's a little bit less of a difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated.

351
00:35:35,825 --> 00:35:41,314
But if you look during Oma KRON, you know, it's a huge I mean,

352
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:48,454
I don't remember what it was but it was like 20 times the risk of death if you were unvaccinated compared to if you vaccinated.

353
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:53,705
So it is preventing, you know, severe outcomes to an enormous degree.

354
00:35:53,705 --> 00:36:00,675
And even for cases, you know, it's you can see the curves are tighter, but it's still lower if you're vaccinated.

355
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,045
And if you're wondering about boosters, just for Fonzie's, here's another one.

356
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:14,885
So the the this is individuals who are so deaths if you're unvaccinated primary series only and with at least one

357
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:21,305
booster and so you can see you know why it's important to both get vaccinated and to get go get your booster.

358
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:25,775
So yeah, so that's I think that's kind of a useful illustration.

359
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:30,515
Well, let's stay on the topic of boosters. There's a new booster out.

360
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:36,215
What's different about this most recent one? And who should get a booster with this new vaccine?

361
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:39,935
Not a medical opinion. Just a no, no. I'm not an M.D.

362
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,324
Yeah, but but yes, there's new boosters that are available.

363
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:51,725
They target two strains of COVID, SARS-CoV-2, the original strain, and the Omicron variants, which include a four and a five.

364
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:58,565
Everybody over 12 can get at least one kind. So I think Pfizer is 12 plus and Moderna is 18 plus.

365
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:04,565
If I'm remembering right, then everyone can if you are eligible to get a booster, you should absolutely get one.

366
00:37:04,835 --> 00:37:10,895
It builds broader immunity. It boosts the immunity that you had if you already had a primary series or one booster already.

367
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:14,794
You can also co administered from with the flu vaccine.

368
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:19,505
And so you can get your flu and you're covered all in one, one stop shop kind of situation.

369
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:25,444
Yeah. So so definitely that's that's really I have one more vaccine thing really quick I'm going to share if that's okay.

370
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:32,195
Sorry. I'm like busting out with all these random things, but I wanted to share given that this like,

371
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:38,375
given that it's a, we're in a, in a at a university audience, I thought this was really cool.

372
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:47,075
So the National Bureau of Economic Research just recently released a report looking at the impact of college vaccine mandates.

373
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:53,855
So they show that college vaccine mandates actually reduced cases and deaths in the surrounding communities.

374
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:59,135
So when we think about how vaccines protect not just you, but the community around you,

375
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:04,775
they looked at four year colleges and the surrounding counties over fall 2021,

376
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:09,304
and they found that they reduced cases and deaths in the surrounding counties,

377
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:14,195
not even just among the vaccinated population, but the the community around them.

378
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:24,935
And it turns out that actually they estimate that college vaccine mandates likely reduce total COVID deaths in the entire U.S. by 5% over autumn,

379
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:32,314
2021 5% doesn't sound like a lot, but that's the entire U.S. like, not just the places where the colleges, you know what I mean?

380
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:36,214
And so I think I just I feel like just well done, everybody.

381
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:38,615
I'm glad we all got vaccinated, you know, all that kind of thing.

382
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:43,805
But so I just thought that was an interesting side point, given that we're at a university,

383
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:50,584
if you wanted to get a sense of what the impact of some of that is, you know, you take on town gown relationships there.

384
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:50,915
Really?

385
00:38:54,485 --> 00:39:01,774
Well, the last specific vaccine related question that I have for you touches on a concept that that I believe you talked about in your lecture,

386
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:07,205
and that will come back up again in our discussion sections this week, which is on herd immunity.

387
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,405
So in kind of from your perspective or in your own words,

388
00:39:11,405 --> 00:39:19,025
can you explain the concept of herd immunity and how it does or doesn't apply to our current pandemic?

389
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:26,795
Yeah. So the idea of herd immunity is that when you if you if you reach a certain level of immunity in your population,

390
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:35,584
you can make it so that even if there are unvaccinated individuals, infection can't really take off within that population.

391
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:40,685
And so you won't really be able to see sort of new big surges or things like that.

392
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:49,175
The, you know, you've kind of blanketed enough of the population that even those who aren't vaccinated are protected by virtue of their contacts,

393
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:56,015
mostly not being sick because they've been vaccinated. And so the tendency for any new introduction will be that it tends to die out.

394
00:39:56,525 --> 00:40:02,615
Not to say that you can't have sporadic outbreaks or pockets of unvaccinated individuals, but for the most part that's kind of the idea.

395
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:08,464
I've been more I think this will be a departure perhaps from my previous years.

396
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:15,335
I to some degree. I mean, I think in the early days, we really hoped that eventually we would be able to achieve herd immunity.

397
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:26,914
And I think because of the speed at which immunity wanes for COVID, I'm not really I don't really think that that's very likely for us in our future.

398
00:40:26,915 --> 00:40:30,065
I mean, you know, the it's there's. Too.

399
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:36,185
It's too easy to get reinfected. It's it's, you know, like, now you can still get infected.

400
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:41,075
There are breakthrough infections, as they call them. You know, where you might be vaccinated, but you still.

401
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:47,255
Even though you're way less likely to have severe disease, you might still get sick and you could still transmit it on to others.

402
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:52,324
And so I don't think for us, herd immunity is likely in the near future.

403
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:58,384
I think it would mean we would need to have a big new a new vaccine that, you know,

404
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:04,415
really gives us sort of longer lasting immunity for us to be able to have that, which would be wonderful.

405
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:07,475
But yeah. So thank you.

406
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:16,115
I'm going to switch our focus a little bit to talk about another important theme and Public Health 200, which is focusing on health inequities.

407
00:41:16,565 --> 00:41:25,444
Hmm. So there's been kind of different levels of emphasis and attention around the issue

408
00:41:25,445 --> 00:41:30,455
of health inequalities and the differential impact of COVID on different communities,

409
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:33,875
whether it's in the state of Michigan or across the US.

410
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:42,754
It seems like particularly early in the pandemic we saw that particularly among older people, even now,

411
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:51,365
people with compromised immune systems, people with multiple chronic illnesses, they were at greatest risk for some of the worst outcomes.

412
00:41:53,015 --> 00:41:57,274
But there have also been reports of higher rates of infection and at some points the pandemic,

413
00:41:57,275 --> 00:42:00,665
higher death rates among racial and ethnic minority groups.

414
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:06,215
So I wonder if you could just speak to these variety of health disparities that we've seen

415
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:11,675
and offer some kind of insight or explanation on why why we're seeing those differences.

416
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:15,155
Yeah. So that those are.

417
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:23,134
Yeah, I mean, that's a great summary of a lot of the different disparities that we've seen in terms of risk and outcomes for COVID.

418
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:31,475
I mean, we have definitely seen higher rates of infection and higher rates of death and other severe outcomes too,

419
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:40,735
in, you know, in a range of, you know, racial minoritized, ethnic race and ethnic groups in the U.S.

420
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:48,845
I mean, I think there's an interesting so there's there's two interesting studies on this that I'm going to share my screen again.

421
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:52,954
And I guess I'm like more share screen on this year's one than usual.

422
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:55,444
But so mathematician likes data.

423
00:42:55,445 --> 00:43:07,955
I'm sure I know who knew exactly but so this is one from John Zellner group in the I'm going to narrow a study I'm sorry I screwed that up.

424
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:20,255
And Nina Masters put this together and and so they looked at incidence age, standardized incidence by race.

425
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:29,675
Oops. Sorry, my mouse is overactive in in the first race and ethnicity in the first couple of waves of the pandemic.

426
00:43:29,915 --> 00:43:37,985
And you can see here that in the early part of the pandemic, black Michiganders had much higher incidence rates,

427
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:42,874
and then it was sort of more similar in the next wave, and it's changed at various points.

428
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:50,915
Subsequently, if you kind of track on how this has shifted, it has different groups have kind of been at higher risk at different times.

429
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:55,114
And similarly you can see, well, it's a bit different actually.

430
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:58,715
So Latino incidence versus white incidence here.

431
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:04,655
So you can see kind of a consistent difference between them sort of throughout.

432
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:13,235
They found that it was that a lot of this early stuff was probably to do with exposure.

433
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:25,024
And so if you if you if you look at sort of the fraction of black and Latino individuals who are in essential jobs, you know,

434
00:44:25,025 --> 00:44:32,855
those kinds of things where they would be at higher exposure, that seems to perhaps be part way to explaining what's going on.

435
00:44:33,455 --> 00:44:42,845
When they look at the death rates, adjusted for these differences in exposure, they didn't find as much of a difference in death rate.

436
00:44:42,845 --> 00:44:44,645
And so if they felt like it was probably is better.

437
00:44:44,885 --> 00:44:54,005
Now the Micra study which is Nancy Fischer study here also in Michigan they found since then this is newer data than that initial early data.

438
00:44:54,755 --> 00:44:58,714
Also some health disparities that are related to kind of a lot of different things.

439
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:05,735
So more severe symptoms, worse access to care, more social stressors, more social stigma.

440
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:10,505
And so there's been I think it's a pretty multifaceted thing, essentially.

441
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:14,494
But but so the short answer is, yes,

442
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:22,745
there definitely been have been disparities by race and ethnicity as well as by age and immunocompromised and all of these kind of other things.

443
00:45:22,745 --> 00:45:29,464
But but it's and it's shifted, I think, over the course of the pandemic and gone in kind of different ways, if you want to know.

444
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:38,515
Sort of. What it's looking like now. These are the rates, case rates by race and ethnicity currently.

445
00:45:38,515 --> 00:45:44,835
And you can see they're kind of more similar, although black individuals are still seeing the highest case rates right now.

446
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:48,414
But you can see it's kind of wobbled around in the in recent months.

447
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,835
So it's kind of more similar across different groups. So yeah.

448
00:45:52,945 --> 00:46:00,355
Well what it looks like your data show it is really draws nicely on a concept that we've talked about earlier in the semester,

449
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:06,054
which is the social determinants of health or where people kind of work, live and play,

450
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:12,615
how that shapes their ability to maintain health or to improve their health.

451
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:17,125
And I think that worker data that you showed was of those places where people were exposed.

452
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:20,605
You mentioned people have to be able to make safe choices.

453
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:28,555
And if they have to go to work, if they are not protected by a mask or if there's not an ability to do that, if they can't access those things,

454
00:46:28,795 --> 00:46:34,975
then that really looks like particularly early in the pandemic, really shaped some of those racial disparities.

455
00:46:35,485 --> 00:46:38,545
Yeah. And social determinants of health are playing a huge part here.

456
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:44,005
I mean, the other thing, I didn't collect slides on this before, but there have been a bunch of studies that have shown that.

457
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:47,395
So I don't know if you all have talked about the social vulnerability index at all.

458
00:46:47,395 --> 00:46:53,665
So this is okay. So this is an index that tries to get at social vulnerability through a lot.

459
00:46:53,665 --> 00:47:03,204
So it's got 16 different factors about your, your like transportation access, your socioeconomic status,

460
00:47:03,205 --> 00:47:09,775
disability status, you know, your like race, ethnicity of the, you know, all these different things.

461
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:18,355
And they, they, they've come up with sort of an index that across these 16 factors gives a sense of sort of how much social

462
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:25,765
vulnerability a particular county or even census tract might or state even they have it at different granularity.

463
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:30,925
My experience and oh there's been a bunch of different studies that have all shown that

464
00:47:30,925 --> 00:47:35,904
higher social vulnerability is correlated with increasing increased numbers of cases,

465
00:47:35,905 --> 00:47:38,214
hospitalizations, deaths, you know.

466
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:45,715
So I think that is playing out has been playing out throughout the pandemic and is something I mean, you know, there in Michigan,

467
00:47:45,715 --> 00:47:52,015
there's a there's a like a racial disparities task force and a number of different groups that have been really working on trying to

468
00:47:52,015 --> 00:48:01,074
improve this for Michigan and trying to make sure that social vulnerability and that other kinds of factors like this are used to help,

469
00:48:01,075 --> 00:48:05,304
you know, target things like where should mobile vaccine clinics go and stuff like that.

470
00:48:05,305 --> 00:48:07,105
So that to try and mitigate some of these issues.

471
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:13,345
But but yeah, it's definitely, definitely something that is still playing out and yeah, we're going to need to work on.

472
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:19,815
Well, I'll use this moment to invite students to continue to submit questions in the Q&A.

473
00:48:19,845 --> 00:48:22,935
I know that we have a couple that I'm going to bring into the conversation later,

474
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:31,285
but students continue to submit those questions for Dr. Eisenberg while they're thinking about those are taking a few moments to type us out.

475
00:48:31,305 --> 00:48:37,875
Take those out. I'm going to go forward thinking we've got about 30 minutes to talk about the future.

476
00:48:39,615 --> 00:48:49,185
So in the past 50 years, I've made a short list of some of our new infectious diseases and things that we didn't talk about 50 years ago.

477
00:48:49,515 --> 00:48:58,125
HIV AIDS maybe not Ebola, Zika, Swine Flu, SA's Murres, etc. Most recently Monkey Pox.

478
00:48:59,385 --> 00:49:07,515
So there's a lot that we could go into on that. But the question that I wanted to ask first is what should we be doing to better to be better

479
00:49:07,515 --> 00:49:14,745
prepared to deal with new infectious agents that will surely emerge in the years to come?

480
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:21,404
Yeah. So I think the first thing is that we have to like so it's funny in my lecture I think I bring

481
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:25,394
up that I can't remember that Surgeon General report from like 1950 or something or that.

482
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:30,465
Like we've closed the book on infectious disease, it's done and it's like, so I think we need to,

483
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:35,655
to just like first recognize that it is not done and that this is going to happen again.

484
00:49:35,655 --> 00:49:41,355
And it might. In fact, there's studies that suggest that it may, in fact, happen more often because of climate change,

485
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:49,405
because of our the expanding footprint of humans and our interactions with other, you know, with animal populations and all of those kinds of things.

486
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:56,534
So this this is not the only time. And it's and all of the examples you listed are, you know, illustrate how this is going to keep happening.

487
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:56,805
So.

488
00:49:57,105 --> 00:50:05,654
So, like one thing that I think, you know, public health is aware of, but that we will need to remind ourselves and keep thinking about going forward,

489
00:50:05,655 --> 00:50:13,245
is that the is the interconnectedness of humans now and our society global health is is local health.

490
00:50:13,455 --> 00:50:18,525
You know, we like infectious diseases are you know, we're very interconnected.

491
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:26,024
And so something that appears in one spot on the globe is probably going to appear in many, you know what I mean?

492
00:50:26,025 --> 00:50:32,565
So I think we need to be thinking about that. And that has impacts on how we think about disease monitoring and surveillance,

493
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:36,735
how we think about, you know, public health response and what's in our best interests.

494
00:50:36,735 --> 00:50:41,145
Our best interests might be bigger than, you know, those kinds of those kinds of things.

495
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:49,755
But more sort of specifically, I guess, I think, you know, in terms of being able to be prepared for new infectious diseases that emerge,

496
00:50:51,135 --> 00:51:00,345
we I mean, we saw how this pandemic has exposed a lot of the flaws and vulnerabilities in our health care system and in our public health system.

497
00:51:00,675 --> 00:51:05,654
Those are obvious things that we should fix because for the next time that this happens, right?

498
00:51:05,655 --> 00:51:07,845
So we need to strengthen our public health system.

499
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:17,114
We need to strengthen our health care system and, you know, make it so that, you know, those systems are ready and robust when the next thing emerges.

500
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,235
And I think, you know, there's also surveillance systems.

501
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:25,485
There's there's things that we learned in terms of how we do disease surveillance, you know,

502
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:32,655
so like we built an entire wastewater surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 that now we're using to track influenza,

503
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:37,304
RSV, monkeypox, now polio, all these different things, you know, in the US.

504
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:41,175
So there's like, you know, innovations that happen that we should build on and expand.

505
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:45,284
And then there's also innovations around like, I don't know, it's weird.

506
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:54,255
Like since the pandemic, the public is a lot more conversant in public health and in how public health data works and the expectations around

507
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:59,775
being able to have a dashboard where you can see what's going on with all kinds of different public health conditions.

508
00:52:00,045 --> 00:52:06,495
And I think that's like that's a good thing. We should we should in terms of transparency and data sharing and all that kind of thing.

509
00:52:06,705 --> 00:52:12,944
I think we should continue to like maybe it should change the standard of what's expected around access to data and being

510
00:52:12,945 --> 00:52:18,285
able to see what's going on in your neighborhood or your state or whatever for a lot of different public health topics.

511
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:24,374
So, you know, Marissa, I've said to the students, I've been teaching this class for over a decade now,

512
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:29,835
or I've been associated with it one way or another, and you have been a part of it, I believe, every time it has been taught.

513
00:52:30,165 --> 00:52:36,884
And so I can remember being in the classroom pre-COVID and you talking about like it was coming, right.

514
00:52:36,885 --> 00:52:41,225
You could you just knew like you did it, like you didn't have a crystal ball.

515
00:52:41,535 --> 00:52:45,555
But the things that you presented in the lecture the students watch when you talked about the

516
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:50,204
our closer proximity to animal species or the interconnected interconnectedness and travel.

517
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:56,745
And so, you know, the infectious disease community, you know, I'm sure there were there were many surprising things about COVID,

518
00:52:56,745 --> 00:53:00,525
but that many things that could have been predicted or were predicted.

519
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:06,975
And so I guess I'm wondering. Of some of those things that you mentioned about being prepared.

520
00:53:07,215 --> 00:53:13,245
Some of the innovations that have happened, the data sharing, the culture, the collaborations that we've seen.

521
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:17,265
What makes you feel optimistic that we will be better prepared?

522
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:23,775
Where do you see that? There really have been some advances that we're going to be better off the next time this comes around?

523
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,314
Yeah. I mean, so I will admit that I am not. Hang on.

524
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:32,905
I'm going to hang on. I'm going to scoot my computer. The sun keeps moving and there's one very hot spot, so I have to kind of scoot.

525
00:53:33,195 --> 00:53:38,685
But so, I mean, I there are times that I'm not super optimistic.

526
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:47,054
And so there's that, too. But. But I do think that a lot of my optimism has come from seeing how engaged people have been

527
00:53:47,055 --> 00:53:52,454
in understanding public health and the bigger interest now in other public health threats,

528
00:53:52,455 --> 00:54:01,005
too. So like when the polio, you know, there was this circulating vaccine derived polio virus that was introduced in New York and,

529
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:04,025
you know, detected through wastewater or in monkeypox,

530
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:09,585
like, you know, a lot of these things that probably in the past they would have shown up in the news,

531
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:12,055
but they wouldn't have gotten the attention that they've gotten now.

532
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:18,015
And so I think there is an opportunity to like public health has always operated quietly.

533
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:24,374
We've never really been one to kind of be. There's no there's no E.R. for public health.

534
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:30,645
There's no shows that document the like life of an actual I guess contagion there is contagion.

535
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:36,314
But so. So there was one. But like, you know, we typically tend to not be in the spotlight.

536
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:44,024
And so, I don't know, maybe it would be it's a good thing maybe that people are more aware of how public health works now and what it does.

537
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:49,125
And, you know, that can get people more engaged and more willing to.

538
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:53,795
You know, kind of tackle some of those things. So I think that that's maybe a good thing.

539
00:54:55,205 --> 00:55:01,535
And and if if the I think the other thing maybe is a reason for optimism is that.

540
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:12,105
Because I mean. It's it's awful that the pandemic has exposed all these vulnerabilities in our systems,

541
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:17,415
but it has put them up in on a spot, in a spotlight in a big way.

542
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:24,075
And if that motivates us to change them for the better, then, you know, I mean,

543
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:29,115
it doesn't offset the awful things that have happened, but it is a good thing that could happen.

544
00:55:29,505 --> 00:55:32,445
So, you know, that I think gives me reason for optimism, too.

545
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:37,935
I'm glad you ended there, because I do think for those of us who are in the public health community,

546
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:47,114
this has been such a active time of research, of feeling like things that we have been training for or have been studying for years.

547
00:55:47,115 --> 00:55:54,135
There was just this big spotlight moment and that can really obscure the human side of it, right?

548
00:55:54,155 --> 00:56:00,944
That that we all know people who have lost their lives and lost family members or who are suffering from long COVID.

549
00:56:00,945 --> 00:56:04,215
And so it's important not to let that be overshadowed.

550
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:08,185
I'm wondering, you know,

551
00:56:08,695 --> 00:56:17,245
and thinking about that and thinking that there are there are have been and will continue to be cases of COVID and deaths related to COVID.

552
00:56:18,325 --> 00:56:22,135
How do we think about kind of a new normal moving forward?

553
00:56:23,485 --> 00:56:27,204
What would be an acceptable number of COVID deaths?

554
00:56:27,205 --> 00:56:30,565
And who or who defines that or how do we work towards that goal?

555
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:36,925
I guess how do we kind of think about the new normal, specifically around COVID 19 moving forward?

556
00:56:37,465 --> 00:56:40,845
I think that is a very, very good question and kind of a tough question.

557
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,064
I mean, it's a it's a societal question. It's a question we all have to answer. Right.

558
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:54,435
And so, like, you know, so like the you had mentioned before that the number of deaths from flu per year has been around 36,000,

559
00:56:54,455 --> 00:56:57,835
sometimes maybe up to 50 or something in a really bad year. But.

560
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:05,415
But so the last 12 months from COVID, we've seen almost 400,000 deaths.

561
00:57:05,565 --> 00:57:11,445
I mean, it's really we are not if if flu is what we view as normal, we are not there yet.

562
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:17,425
And so I think for the foreseeable future, I don't know.

563
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:21,884
I mean, a lot of people have gone back to normal. A lot of people are no longer really masking.

564
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:24,915
They're kind of just operating back to normal.

565
00:57:25,785 --> 00:57:29,025
I think it's going to be. Tough.

566
00:57:29,085 --> 00:57:38,045
I don't think we're back to normal yet. I think we are likely to have COVID as a top ten cause of death for the foreseeable while.

567
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:47,045
I think, you know, I've seen estimates that we might expect to see something like 100000 to 250000 deaths per year or something like that,

568
00:57:47,345 --> 00:57:50,135
which is I mean, that means COVID.

569
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:56,974
We now took all of our top ten causes of death and we just added another one of a similar size on to, you know what I mean?

570
00:57:56,975 --> 00:58:01,805
That's a big increase in the number of deaths that were in our mortality that we're seeing in the US.

571
00:58:02,135 --> 00:58:10,294
And so I don't know. I mean, I think, I think some degree of masking and social distancing is probably here to stay for a while.

572
00:58:10,295 --> 00:58:16,985
And I think it probably hits disproportionately on different people depending on issues of like people who

573
00:58:16,985 --> 00:58:22,775
are immunocompromised and then also questions of who has the resources and wherewithal to continue to,

574
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:27,154
you know, I don't know. So there's a lot of nuance to kind of how that hits.

575
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:30,875
I think some of that does stay, though. But I also.

576
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:35,335
I don't know. I am very curious and.

577
00:58:36,335 --> 00:58:43,414
A little worried to see what our society thinks like.

578
00:58:43,415 --> 00:58:48,275
I think we will fall into something maybe without thinking too hard about what we actually want.

579
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:50,675
And that's what humans tend to do.

580
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:58,625
And I'm worried that we will do that and land somewhere that like we would be horrified by if you'd asked us five years ago.

581
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,574
And so I hope that doesn't happen.

582
00:59:00,575 --> 00:59:06,325
But I mean, I don't want to sound dramatic, but like, you know, I think we're seeing I don't think we're I don't think we're there yet.

583
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:13,114
And so I think really what this is kind of reflecting is that to some degree, so humans, whatever,

584
00:59:13,115 --> 00:59:18,155
I'm just philosophic philosophizing now, but like humans are I don't know if we're good at it,

585
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:26,884
but we at least can do things when we have an acute emergency and a pandemic that hits right now, a hurricane, an earthquake, those kinds of things.

586
00:59:26,885 --> 00:59:34,715
You know, we are bad at the slow moving emergencies like climate change, you know, the opioid crisis,

587
00:59:34,745 --> 00:59:44,704
things like this that are they they they don't they're not in meat they're it's hard for us to hold and stay long term stick to a strategy.

588
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:48,425
And some of that is that we don't resource ourselves to be able to do it in the long term.

589
00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:52,525
But I think that's something we're really going to have to grapple with over the next few years.

590
00:59:52,805 --> 00:59:57,125
And so I don't know. I mean, it's possible that we'll build up enough immunity.

591
00:59:57,305 --> 01:00:01,895
You know, our death rate has been dropping. We're at the, you know, and other severe outcomes.

592
01:00:01,895 --> 01:00:04,265
We're seeing the lowest you know,

593
01:00:04,265 --> 01:00:10,384
if you take the fraction of hospitalizations with COVID and you look at what fraction of them are in the ICU or on the ventilator,

594
01:00:10,385 --> 01:00:13,985
on a ventilator, we're at the lowest percentages that we've been the entire pandemic right now.

595
01:00:14,255 --> 01:00:16,384
And the death rate has also been dropping.

596
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:23,675
So, like, it may be that we build up enough immunity that we get down eventually to something kind of more like flu eventually.

597
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:29,645
But at least for right now, if you look at even kind of like recent numbers,

598
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:35,614
we're probably looking at something like 100,000 deaths a year at least, if not maybe more.

599
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:39,725
I mean, if you look at the last year, which includes the first Omicron spike, you know, it's a lot more.

600
01:00:39,995 --> 01:00:47,555
So I don't know. I think it's going to be I think the flu data is a really, really good context for people to just have something to grapple with.

601
01:00:47,565 --> 01:00:58,415
You know, if 3500 to 50000 is or 35000 to 50000 is an average, a bad year of flu, then the last 12 months of COVID have been 400,000.

602
01:00:58,415 --> 01:01:07,385
I mean, I think that gives credibility to people who are resistant to say that the pandemic is over or that everything should go back to normal,

603
01:01:07,565 --> 01:01:10,015
as most of us want us to. Right? Yeah.

604
01:01:10,415 --> 01:01:17,404
I mean I mean, on the one hand, like so I'm also sympathetic to there are people everybody has to balance a lot of different things.

605
01:01:17,405 --> 01:01:24,905
There are real mental health consequences. There are all kinds of you know, so it's a it's it's difficult and nuanced.

606
01:01:24,905 --> 01:01:29,644
So like, it's not like I'm sort of I don't want to, like, wag my finger and be like we, you know?

607
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:34,265
But you know. You know, I think it's it's tough.

608
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:37,295
So I think everybody is kind of grappling with that right now.

609
01:01:37,565 --> 01:01:40,595
And I think holding those contradictions can be challenging sometimes,

610
01:01:40,595 --> 01:01:46,835
especially for those of us in public health or those students who are in the class who might not think of themselves as in public health, but who,

611
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:49,234
whether prior to this class or because of it,

612
01:01:49,235 --> 01:01:56,524
have some kind of appreciation for looking out for society as a whole or thinking about society as the patient,

613
01:01:56,525 --> 01:02:00,755
and how can we keep the patient healthy and prevent illnesses.

614
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:08,825
So trying to hold that care for the population, but also I think at an individual level, what your risks are,

615
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:13,895
what your tolerances are to kind of navigate those spaces, I think can be really challenging.

616
01:02:14,405 --> 01:02:22,445
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Well, I'm going to use our last 15 or so minutes together to talk more about you specifically,

617
01:02:23,045 --> 01:02:30,605
because I think that your your research has shifted quite a bit or your role in the in the certainly

618
01:02:30,605 --> 01:02:35,105
your visibility in the school and in the state has shifted a lot in the last couple of years.

619
01:02:36,095 --> 01:02:39,605
Many students are interested in public health research,

620
01:02:39,605 --> 01:02:44,615
and I just wondered if you could share with them a little bit how your research has shifted since COVID.

621
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:50,735
You talked about an initial reticence to study to study it before diving in headfirst.

622
01:02:51,545 --> 01:02:56,795
So how has your research changed and how is will COVID shift the trajectory, if at all?

623
01:02:57,215 --> 01:03:05,345
Yeah, so my research has shifted hugely. I mean, I, I mean, almost everything I do now is COVID related in some way.

624
01:03:05,345 --> 01:03:11,464
And so, you know, I've definitely shifted strongly towards and it's also not just COVID,

625
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:15,215
but it's also I think my research has shifted a lot more towards public health

626
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:19,565
practice and towards interacting with policymakers and those kinds of things.

627
01:03:20,555 --> 01:03:29,524
And so I think that will stick. I mean, I, I, we've built a lot of great ties with policymakers, and I hope we can continue to do not just for COVID,

628
01:03:29,525 --> 01:03:34,055
but good, useful things for lots of different public health problems.

629
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:38,855
And so so I think I think that will shift continue to shift going forward.

630
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:44,855
It also has shifted my perspective a little bit as a like I was like my training is much more math

631
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:50,885
than engineering and I was a much more abstract kind of methodological person in a lot of ways.

632
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:59,794
And I think I've shifted in that to be a lot more sort of like, okay, you know, that's nice, but let's get something done.

633
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:08,614
Like kind of, you know. And so I think not, although I've been picking up my methods threads a little bit again in the last little while.

634
01:04:08,615 --> 01:04:14,105
So I think it'll it'll be a blend. But you know, it has definitely shifted kind of my focus to some degree.

635
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:18,665
Yeah. So I think it'll, it'll stay that way probably for the years to come.

636
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:20,145
I'm yeah.

637
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:28,595
As student asked the question was there a moment or an experience that really stands out to you in your and your time working with the state,

638
01:04:28,605 --> 01:04:33,335
working in that advisory role, something that you're proud of? Yeah, something I'm proud of.

639
01:04:33,515 --> 01:04:44,794
I mean, I think I don't know that the the I think when I've seen or even worked on like estimates

640
01:04:44,795 --> 01:04:49,114
of lives saved as a result of policies that I helped advise on or things like that,

641
01:04:49,115 --> 01:04:52,385
that has been you know, it's hard to estimate those things.

642
01:04:52,385 --> 01:04:58,145
It's hard to you know, you can't rewind the tape and redo it as though that intervention hadn't happened.

643
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:02,555
But that sort of stuff, I think has been very valuable and meaningful to me.

644
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:08,255
Experience was I mean, I think so like giving it the like the press conference,

645
01:05:08,465 --> 01:05:14,735
doing a press conference with the governor is like a wild experience and a totally different thing than I had been in before.

646
01:05:14,735 --> 01:05:19,054
And so that kind of stuff certainly certainly sticks out in my head as,

647
01:05:19,055 --> 01:05:24,245
as something kind of so different than what I had sort of thought I would be doing.

648
01:05:24,345 --> 01:05:28,144
Yeah, probably so a little bit surreal and. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

649
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:31,444
Exactly. And some of it weird too.

650
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:35,795
Like the some of those meetings, a lot of that stuff happened, you know, it was all during that.

651
01:05:35,795 --> 01:05:40,595
So like it was all there were so many meetings with like important people that was all on Zoom.

652
01:05:40,595 --> 01:05:46,084
And so, you know, like this is weird, the number of people you build these really tight relationships with and then they're like,

653
01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:50,044
Oh, I've never actually I'm finally meeting you in person. I don't know. It's funny the way these things.

654
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:57,395
Yeah. Yeah. Well, what advice would you have for students who were interested in getting involved

655
01:05:57,395 --> 01:06:02,075
in chronic or infectious disease research or who might look at you and think,

656
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:07,475
I want to do what she does. I want to clear like hers, the ones that if you're saying, I want to be this when I grow up.

657
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:13,565
Yeah, that I think I think there are.

658
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:19,715
So one of the things I love about public health is that there are a million different paths into public health.

659
01:06:19,715 --> 01:06:27,364
Public health is an incredibly interdisciplinary field. So you can have people who went up through sociology,

660
01:06:27,365 --> 01:06:31,445
combined with people who went up through mathematics, who, you know, all different kinds of things.

661
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:41,945
And so I think one of the things that that has driven home for me is don't discount knowledge that you get from all different fields.

662
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:44,185
You will find it ends up being useful.

663
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:52,525
So, you know, like for instance, I when I started my undergrad, I thought I was going to major in art and I wanted to do animation.

664
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:59,985
And the number of times that that has turned out to be useful for making quick figures that you can kind of doodle out a dashboard and show somebody,

665
01:06:59,995 --> 01:07:05,124
you know, things like that that you're like, I didn't think that was going to be relevant at all, but it turns out that it is.

666
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:13,965
And so. So if you have so don't discount how lots of different fields can end up being super important and helpful in your career.

667
01:07:13,975 --> 01:07:18,925
So I guess that's, I guess maybe my small bit of advice. And then yeah.

668
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:24,564
And that also means that if you're interested in doing something like this, you will bring your experiences,

669
01:07:24,565 --> 01:07:29,425
will bring a particular trajectory that's a distinct perspective, which is really good.

670
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:33,324
And so that's great. Please go for it. You know, we need more people, so that's good.

671
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:42,175
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I was personally hoping for a low key plug for the undergraduate program or tha I well I couldn't agree more with you that,

672
01:07:42,175 --> 01:07:47,795
that I think sometimes students, you know, we talk about public health as being a big umbrella or a big tent, right?

673
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:55,714
Where everybody's welcome and like there's a way, there is a connection between what your interests are and the work that we do in public health.

674
01:07:55,715 --> 01:07:59,575
And you people are sometimes skeptical. Just be like, Oh no, you just want to make everything public health.

675
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:05,575
And that could be true too. But but I think your, your iteration example is a great one.

676
01:08:05,575 --> 01:08:14,124
That, that there's a way to use your skills and abilities and talents and interests and to find a way, a space for them in public health.

677
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:20,045
So great example. Well, I well, we've got just a few minutes left.

678
01:08:20,065 --> 01:08:25,345
I'll do one last call for questions from students, but we got a lot of them answered throughout our time together.

679
01:08:28,575 --> 01:08:33,825
So while we wait for any lasting for students, anything else that you want to say to this captive student audience?

680
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:41,565
Any any last plugs for prevention or tell them not to worry about monkeypox or actually to worry about monkeypox?

681
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:47,804
I mean, let's be honest. Well, monkeypox, I think monkeypox. So there is I think monkeypox is one of those awkward things.

682
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:51,585
I think it's it is probably going to be here for a while to go.

683
01:08:51,615 --> 01:08:54,645
On the other hand, it's you know, we've seen it been declining.

684
01:08:54,645 --> 01:08:58,034
The you know, the vaccine supply is getting more.

685
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:01,545
You know, there's like good ring vaccination campaigns.

686
01:09:01,545 --> 01:09:06,485
You don't really have to worry about monkeypox too much. On the other hand, don't like just like whatever, you know.

687
01:09:06,685 --> 01:09:12,105
Yeah. So yeah, I guess. What do you do to prevent monkeypox will prevent so many other things.

688
01:09:12,135 --> 01:09:16,214
Exactly, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So it's, it's it's a good plan regardless.

689
01:09:16,215 --> 01:09:21,415
But then yeah. And then I guess other things, I guess, uh,

690
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:30,095
for I think there are a lot of like exciting directions that are developing in terms of, you know, I don't know.

691
01:09:30,105 --> 01:09:30,945
So like I've, I've,

692
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:39,465
I've been working with a lot of folks in the School of Information and thinking about like tools and technologies and apps dashboards.

693
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:44,895
I think there's a lot of exciting developments there. I think there's a lot of I don't know.

694
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:52,605
I think there are a lot of things that people had to innovate on the fly with the pandemic that then well, like that.

695
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:58,064
There's a lot of cool room to figure out ways to translate some of those lessons into other things.

696
01:09:58,065 --> 01:10:02,385
So. Yeah. And a lot of great work still happening in my colleagues at Michigan.

697
01:10:02,775 --> 01:10:06,465
So I will offer to students that there are ways that you're interested in getting involved.

698
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:09,795
I can definitely send you some studies and things that are happening.

699
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:13,154
Whether or not that'll translate into a research opportunity, I'm not sure.

700
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:17,625
But definitely to be a more aware of what's happening at the University of Michigan,

701
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:23,865
certainly we've been a leader in the state response, but really having work that has some national implications as well.

702
01:10:24,075 --> 01:10:29,855
You talk about the wastewater sampling. That's another cool thing that some of our folks, our colleagues in environmental health sciences have done.

703
01:10:30,495 --> 01:10:35,715
It's really amazing to see how the public health community has mobilized in really important ways.

704
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:38,625
Yeah, the wastewater thing has been super interesting.

705
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:46,215
So I work with Wu and the group there, you know, Al, that whole gang, you know, on their building level wastewater.

706
01:10:46,215 --> 01:10:51,405
And then, you know, Krista, there's a group that does community level wastewater as well.

707
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:59,205
I mean, that I really do think that is going to shift how we do a lot of our there's there's so much you can track in wastewater.

708
01:10:59,445 --> 01:11:05,445
And it it I think it's there's I mean like there's going to be a lot of research that needs to happen to kind of get that all together.

709
01:11:05,445 --> 01:11:10,335
But, but I do think that's going to become a regular part of our disease surveillance going forward.

710
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:15,524
So there has been one question. There are a couple of questions that come in.

711
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:20,205
One that seems like it would be better for a medical doctor. So I will close on that one.

712
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:23,565
But I will. The one that I will ask you is,

713
01:11:23,835 --> 01:11:32,505
what's your position on using community based participatory research or those methods to better understand infectious diseases?

714
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:41,175
Interesting. Okay. So I guess I wish I wonder I wonder if this person like I'm curious what what they're like.

715
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:47,265
I wish I could get more about what they what they mean here. I mean, so I.

716
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:52,395
Yeah. As a mathematical modeler you are not intimately that community based pitches.

717
01:11:52,605 --> 01:11:56,234
Our research is not your typical methodology. Yeah, exactly.

718
01:11:56,235 --> 01:12:02,505
Exactly. Although I do think like more like so community based versus surgery research and more community engagement,

719
01:12:02,505 --> 01:12:05,654
broadly speaking, is certainly a good thing.

720
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,705
And, you know, I think is something that we we ought to be doing. But I wish I knew.

721
01:12:09,915 --> 01:12:13,515
I feel like this person is asking like a more specific question that they want to get at.

722
01:12:13,515 --> 01:12:19,454
And I don't know what it is, but so I mean, yeah, just off of the the opening question, yes,

723
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,665
I think we should use a lot of different ways of look of a lot of different

724
01:12:22,665 --> 01:12:25,815
tools and everything that we have to understand how infectious diseases work.

725
01:12:26,565 --> 01:12:32,555
But yeah, yeah. And I think really in thinking about there's, there's places where, you know,

726
01:12:32,635 --> 01:12:38,145
the methodology kind of what you're getting at should be that message should drive what you're trying to get at.

727
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:41,295
So certainly I think when we think about something like the vaccine rollout,

728
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:46,935
thinking about robust community engagement and working with community stakeholders,

729
01:12:47,175 --> 01:12:51,614
those types of things are really valuable where if we're just doing some disease checking thing,

730
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:55,155
there are other methodologies like the Sweetwater sampling that we've been doing,

731
01:12:55,155 --> 01:13:02,985
like routine testing where maybe those CPR methods aren't are aren't going to get us the same kind of answers that we would be looking for.

732
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:07,725
Yeah. Yeah, I think that. Yeah, exactly. So well, we will end it there then.

733
01:13:08,325 --> 01:13:11,804
Thank you so much for joining us today for being part of the conversation.

734
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:19,155
You kept the students rapt for quite a while, so thank you for your time and I hope we can do this in-person in fall 2023.

735
01:13:19,515 --> 01:13:22,724
Awesome. Sounds good. Thank you very much. Thanks, students.

736
01:13:22,725 --> 01:13:23,685
I'll see you on Thursday.
