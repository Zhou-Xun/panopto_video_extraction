1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,700
I think we can go ahead and get started here or we're going to jump right in to our guest presentation.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,270
I couldn't help myself as I was thinking about today.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,870
I kept thinking of like these kind of old timey cartoons I know folks watch, like Looney Tunes or The Simpsons and stuff like that.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,330
There they're always things like where like a big anvil comes and smacks the person on the head or like the the coyote on the head.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,140
And I see the stars as coyote or whatever.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,020
I'm guessing Dr. Braulio here is going to tell us that maybe not the best thing to have animals and other things smacking our heads.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,860
And when we see stars, it's it's probably a lot worse than depicted in cartoons in the movies, which is all well and good.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,760
But I am delighted to have Dr. Rodeo come from school kinesiology.

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,810
It's going to be talking to us about very traumatic brain injury and concussion.

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,739
I don't have my slide up with all of the credentials, but there are a lot of things.

11
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,980
He does a lot of work on campus. But I think one in particular is director of the Concussion Center, and he's going to talk a little bit about.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,480
We shared some readings about some of the, I guess, kind of the guiding article around how to be approaching concussion that was available

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,240
for folks on campus and what's directing educational research in this space.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,900
But thank you, Dr. Bruyere, for joining us. I'll just turn it over. I'm very excited to hear what you have to share.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,559
Thank you, Justin. Appreciate the invitation. And thanks for coming to class today because it's called out.

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,950
You should just take that zoom in or something regarding the the coyote and the animal.

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,960
I still laugh. It's it's still funny. And I'm rooting for the roadrunner to win.

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,910
So it was just it said my name is Steve Braulio. You can call me. Steve is totally fine.

19
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,550
I do direct the concussion center here on campus. I'm going to give a kind of a brief background about myself.

20
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,540
Talk a little bit about the center and then talk about the care consortium, some of the findings from our national study.

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,130
And I think that was the methods paper as in over just you have an understanding of how that project works.

22
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,750
Happy to take questions at any time. So if you have something like raise your hand, shout out through something that mean something.

23
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,940
So I'm plan okay. Okay. So Eastern Seaboard.

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,480
I grew up in West Virginia. Both of my parents are still there. My mother was a social worker, spent 30 some odd years working at the local hospital.

25
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,999
She wasn't a counselor. She was a medical social worker.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,280
So I remember as a kid describing in my kid, like I was like six, seven, eight years old, describing to other people what my mother did.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,310
And I was like, Oh, my mom puts people in nursing homes, which really was like, she was facilitating that process for people that need it.

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:40,500
My dad was an attorney. He did a lot of contract law around real estate deals, sort of like small stuff,

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,120
houses, and then kind of worked into malls and coal mines and that type of stuff.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,440
So went to school there. High school there. Please do not cringe at the next thing you are about to see.

31
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,660
I did go to Ohio State for two years as an undergraduate student.

32
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:05,249
I went right kind of like Jurassic Park, the original very first address, a park really had come out.

33
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,910
I wanted to be a genetics major, not to build dinosaurs, but actually had an interest in diabetes type one diabetes.

34
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,620
It turns out when you're no good in organic chemistry, you're not going to do genetics for a living.

35
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,450
So I actually dropped out of school for a couple of years, transferred to North Carolina,

36
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,270
ended up there largely because my sister is in school in Winston-Salem at Wake Forest.

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,810
You may come from western North Carolina. So I was like, I would be nice to be close to my sister.

38
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:43,620
So ended up down there. We got into the athletic training program down there and over time kind of worked my way into a research lab.

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,339
My advisor who ran the lab, he was a concussion guy and it was like he's all concussions.

40
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,479
Don't do concussions. And so I have long said, you know, if he was a Parkinson's guy or an Alzheimer's guy or a diabetes guy for that matter,

41
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,900
like that's probably what I would be doing today. I don't I don't have a personal connection to concussion and never had one.

42
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:13,350
My family's had one that I'm aware of. But what I love the most is the scientific process, and that is taking a super complex problem,

43
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,170
chopping it up into individual questions, answering those questions, and then moving on to the next one.

44
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,360
So that's where I got my start. I did an undergrad project there, went up to Pittsburgh and B from Pennsylvania.

45
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,800
Is anybody from out of state? Let's go with that. All right.

46
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,390
Two, three. Colorado. Nice. Where? Colorado.

47
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,630
Denver. My girlfriend grew up in Parker. You go.

48
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,590
It is not from Connecticut. Where? Connecticut.

49
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,750
But I like. I like the New York border area. Oh, okay.

50
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:59,100
I got recruited by UConn. I went there undergrad. Did you have you work up on any of the weapons in Michigan that.

51
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,649
Okay. So where to? Pittsburgh.

52
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:12,010
Spent two years there kind of building that research portfolio, went to University of Georgia in 2002 and got my doctorate down there.

53
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,580
I can also say National Champions, which was great last year because everyone's like who you're rooting for?

54
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,920
And I don't care because one of my teams is going to the national championships.

55
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,130
I took my first job in oh six at University of Illinois and Champaign, spent five years there.

56
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,530
My daughter was born there. She does not remember at all.

57
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,969
We moved up here in Michigan when she was three in 2011 and have really loved it from the first day,

58
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:44,260
but just so ingrained in the community now and just loving it even now when I'm like walking across campus and I'm like,

59
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,459
Oh my God, it's like the Arctic tundra, because it just feels that way this time of the year.

60
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,610
But when it's 40 degrees in March, I'll be like shorts weather.

61
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,320
So, okay, so what did I start off with?

62
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:03,520
So when I was an undergraduate, I started off when this idea of around soccer heading and long term,

63
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,549
you know, neurological decline was like the big topic.

64
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,520
So my very first project was around that. Then as I moved to Pittsburgh, I kind of stuck with it a little bit,

65
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:19,599
but transitioning more to acute affects less around long term issues that then sort

66
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,459
of parallel line as I went in to get my doctorate and then as I went into Illinois,

67
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,280
I transition away from sideline assessments and more into biomechanical studies.

68
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,040
So we spent about ten years with helmets in terms inside football helmets for high school athletes and tracking impact locations and magnitude.

69
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,230
At the time that I stopped that work, we had the single largest impact database in the world.

70
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,220
It's since been surpassed but and done that work in seven or eight years.

71
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,999
And then now with my work here, we spent a lot of time and I'll talk about this a little bit,

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,080
but some of the acute effects but we're really interested in is what everybody's interested in is what are the long term effects of a concussion,

73
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,910
right? Whether that's CTE or Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's or Pick's or Nina.

74
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,270
So I say everything is everything that's old is new again, is you know,

75
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,920
where I started 20 years ago, I'm back doing the exact same thing for the most part.

76
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,190
I will also say that this guy was at Florida when I was at Georgia and he was making our life miserable.

77
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,300
And then I came here and then he went to Ohio State and he made our life miserable.

78
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,640
And then he did things and he's making his own life miserable. So, yeah.

79
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,630
Okay. So what is the center to the concussion center?

80
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,160
We sort of view ourselves as like the hub for all things concussion on campus.

81
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,930
And we we operate around. Well, let me back up.

82
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:51,630
We were funded through the former presidents, he who shall not be named by the Sciences Initiative in 2018.

83
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:58,120
We've kind of had the official launch of 19 and we structured ourselves kind of around three course,

84
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:06,159
the research core, which sort of speaks for itself, the clinical core, where we don't we don't specifically provide clinical services,

85
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,580
but we partner with a lot of people across campus that do provide services.

86
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,280
Our primary clinical outlet is the Neuro Sport Clinic, which is based in neurology.

87
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:21,670
We do a lot of work with adult and pediatric emergency medicine, and we work very closely with athletics.

88
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,600
We work with student health, rec, sports, family medicine.

89
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:33,160
I feel like I'm bleeding somebody out, but those are the big ones. And then outreach, engagement, which probably speaks to you guys the most,

90
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:40,080
it's taking what we learn from the clinical experience, from the research world and disseminating that knowledge out.

91
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:48,970
And as you can imagine, as rapidly as all science changes, but concussion science, there's a lot of misnomers and myths around it.

92
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,740
Right? So, for example, I asked this question after a concussion, how what should you do other than seek medical care?

93
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:04,170
What is the immediate treatment? Post-concussion. Um, when I had my concussions, I was told I was playing.

94
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,139
Yeah, wrong. Bad C, bad outreach. Negative outreach.

95
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,950
Engagement. Okay, I feel like I'm criticizing your position.

96
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,879
I was told the same thing, and I'd like to lay back. Yeah, right.

97
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,000
That information. You have to sit down. Yeah, yeah.

98
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,420
So. Right, so this is the you guys know this firsthand, right?

99
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,410
Like there's so much misinformation and you were talking about reliable sources because

100
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,310
all the information that comes out of Twitter or Facebook is spot on accurate.

101
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,330
There's never bad information in. Exactly right. Please read the sarcasm in my voice.

102
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:43,450
Right. So we spend a lot of time taking what we learn, distilling it down into like really easy messaging and then pushing that information out.

103
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,799
And that's not only to like the general public moms, dads, kids, athletes, but that's still like physicians,

104
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,210
athletic trainers because they like you're your primary care physician, they're responsible for like a full, wide array of issues.

105
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,690
And so they need like. One or two sentences that they can digest. Right.

106
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,500
And I've said this many times, and I know you're recording. So if my primary care physician happens to capture this video, he will agree with it.

107
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,830
But every year when I go in for my well visit, he's like, what's new in the concussion world?

108
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,500
Right. And I'm like, I'm going to send you a bill because you're coming.

109
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,290
I'm so sorry. I'm not. Oh, my God. All the good jokes were in the first.

110
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:31,030
Like, by now I am recording. Right. Okay. So anyway, so we worked with Michigan Health and Human Services, Brady Association of Michigan,

111
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,880
Michigan High School Athletic Association, Detroit Public Schools.

112
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,409
We're starting to work with pediatric emergency medicine.

113
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,970
They have public safety towns. And there's a there's a TBI concussion like subsection of that.

114
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,680
They also do opioid overdose, attending to firearms and dental hygiene.

115
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,270
So we're trying to get our message out in various ways. And we have the usual stuff.

116
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,230
Twitter accounts. No, I just like your gun.

117
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,030
Okay. You approve thumbs up. Okay. Okay.

118
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,950
So within our research core,

119
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:12,200
the way we view it is we are trying to conduct research projects that allow this personalized or individualized approach to injury management,

120
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,659
is the phrase my advisor said this morning after I left his shop.

121
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,600
But he said it quite publicly. If you've seen one concussion, you've seen one concussion, they are all different.

122
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,390
Right. And part of that is the injury itself is a little bit different.

123
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,040
And everybody the psychology of that individual is different than everybody else.

124
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,430
And the sociology. Right. The things that they bring to the injury.

125
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:46,580
Right. All those things are different. So, for example, we have papers right now that we're working on that are looking at concussion recovery,

126
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,950
some of which return to the classroom, some of those returned to sport. But we're looking at race and socioeconomic factors.

127
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:01,370
All right. And I'll just give you the punch line. White student athletes take longer to return to sport in black identifying student athletes.

128
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:07,280
And I see the quizzical look on your head and what we think is white student athletes tend to come from

129
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,519
more privileged backgrounds and they know that they have resources available and they know to go get them.

130
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,860
This is what we're putting in the paper. We'll see what the reviewers say, but that's kind of what what we're going after with that stuff.

131
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,860
The other thing is how they do that.

132
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,190
So we we approached this personalized approach kind of in four kind of big buckets.

133
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,700
So one is injury prevention from the prevention, the best way to handle things, right?

134
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,479
If we can prevent it, that's the best one is injury assessment.

135
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,740
So we think this person has an injury. What is the quickest and best way to evaluate?

136
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:51,920
Historically, way back when I started in like 1999, 2000, this is how many fingers am I holding up my finger?

137
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,420
Do you have a headache? If you if you're good, you have good answers to all that.

138
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,190
It's like same day return to plate, right? That doesn't really so much happening more.

139
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,020
And we've got good data to show that now we're thinking more about computerized testing.

140
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,940
We're thinking about blood biomarkers. Are there imaging MRI scans that we can use injury management and have the injury?

141
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,780
Do I tell you not to sleep? You have to sit up. You can't lay down.

142
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:28,370
That's ridiculous. Right now, the guidance is more 24 or 48 hours of just like just kind of chill, hang out, don't do anything that makes it worse.

143
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,970
So that's TV. And Facebook uses Facebook anymore.

144
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,560
Your parents use Facebook. I'm old enough to be your parents, so maybe I'll use Facebook.

145
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,430
But anyway, if that's Twitter or Instagram or whatever, that's all fine.

146
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,210
But if it starts to make your headache worse, then after about 48 hours, like, okay, we're going do some light exercise.

147
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,120
And light exercise is not like go run a5k light exercises, like let's walk around the block and see how you feel.

148
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,129
And then we start to review up over time. Then it's outcomes, right?

149
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:04,610
So what's the short term outcomes? How long does it take you to recover and can we kind of make that faster, safer?

150
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,929
And then what are the long term outcomes?

151
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:15,950
And I'm going to talk about care long as the we're not talking about too much today, go back to our clinical core.

152
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,600
Like I said, this is largely around like what is we put the patient first, right.

153
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,950
And this is quite particularly the nurse for clinic. It's quite a multidisciplinary effort.

154
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:36,950
So neurology is the primary. But we also have we also have physical medicine, rehab involved, social work, psychiatry, psychology, if we need it.

155
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,760
So totally depends on like what's going on. And they'll bring in different specialties in that.

156
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:51,730
For the most part, they see about 4000 or so patients come to that clinic every year, and that clinic integrates really well with the research core.

157
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:59,120
And I just listed a couple of the studies that are going on, but using patients as associate research subjects.

158
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,810
And not in a creepy, weird sort of way. But just like, hey, we had this study going on and if you want to be involved, you know,

159
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:12,660
here we are, things that we're starting to work on for all things bad that were covered.

160
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:19,080
I think the one at least one good thing that will come out of it other than like better vaccines is telemedicine.

161
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:27,330
And so we are starting to explore the option of telemedicine, not only to expand our footprint across the state,

162
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:34,320
because you can imagine if you're in the CBD from like the upper like the farm and other very rural.

163
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,080
Right, not a lot of hospital facilities around doubt.

164
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,560
You have a specialty that deals with concussion. But if you could telemedicine to one of our people, that would be great.

165
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,250
Right. So we're trying to expand our footprint in that way.

166
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:55,769
The other thing we're trying to do is do telemedicine visits from the school kinesiology building with a similar base up to Domino's Farms,

167
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:01,620
which is where the pole clinic is based. So the rationale here is I'm a student, I'm a student athlete.

168
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,520
All my classes are on main campus and I don't have a car.

169
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:13,980
All right. So for me to get up to my 2:00 appointment at Domino's and then get back for my 4:00 class, probably not going to happen.

170
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,830
But if I can walk to the ecology building. KILMEADE Out of convenience.

171
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,729
And so we're starting to kind of have those conversations. Yeah. How soon would that be?

172
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:30,360
Because my thought is I have a question in my classroom or maybe with technology.

173
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,060
I don't know if there's research on it. And I showed that if you are like, am I going to get a headache?

174
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,930
Well, yeah. So we can I don't know.

175
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,130
I don't know the exact scheduling time it nurse for it. I feel like it's within 48 to 72 hours.

176
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,310
And I think extended screen time, you're totally right right.

177
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:56,550
If you're staring at a screen when we're in full lockdown and everything was on Zoom right 8 hours a day, like that's a problem.

178
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,700
But to do a 20 or 30 minute visit, unless it like you're in the middle of it, you're like, Oh, my eyes are really bothering my headache.

179
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:09,900
Then they shut the appointment down so they no one would force you to get through the visit to make it because that makes sense.

180
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,180
The other part of it is on the tail end, when you're starting to feel better and you clearance to go back to your sport,

181
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,830
that then you should be totally fine at that point. But then it also save you the trip as well.

182
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,560
Follow up question very. If I'm focused more girls sports,

183
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:32,620
is it very at the level of urgency for return and like treatment process those

184
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,940
in theory the way we manage it should be identical at let's say like you know,

185
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:45,810
the high school athlete, the D1 athlete, the pro athlete. What differs are the resources around that question?

186
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,410
Right. So, for example, a high school athlete, you probably have an athletic trainer and then, you know,

187
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:58,110
you might have like a team doctor take a volunteer or the family, family dog that may have some exposure.

188
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,310
Right. You get to a place like Michigan, you have and they can just football.

189
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:09,450
They have like four staff, athletic trainers, one team doc and then a whole slew of specialty plus like they can go to our

190
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,099
people and then you get to the pro level and then it just the neck gets bigger,

191
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,640
right? Like so if been they followed the to a case from a couple weeks ago.

192
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,860
We can talk about that if you want. But you know, there are the people on the ground.

193
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,710
But then when it was I think he's playing this weekend because of it. Right.

194
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,820
I know he came to another clinic here in Michigan and one other place, and I can't remember where to get like the final clearance.

195
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,710
Right. So they had the resources that they can go anywhere in the country and do that think.

196
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,530
Yeah, yeah. But I'm beginning to think that he was cleared within the first four days.

197
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,800
Yeah. Yeah. So it is not,

198
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,790
it is not clear to me that the first injury against the remember Bengals whether that was actually

199
00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:01,340
a concussion and um do you remember it was in May around and if you remember the Shane Morris okay.

200
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:07,120
Yeah right right. Yeah. So it was sort of though it's very it's eerily similar, right?

201
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,880
Big hit guy stumbles.

202
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,690
Did he stumble because of like the two escapes, the back injury, Shane Morris, the ankle injury, does he really have a concussion?

203
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:26,070
And what I would say is none of us were on the sideline. I and if it meant here's a medical provider who here has a clinical degree and I'm a doctor.

204
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,780
Okay, so maybe you could have some like clinical experience in the space, right?

205
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,450
But like, who else has a clinical degree that became cover? Right.

206
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,060
And you're going to get that right. But so those were on the sideline.

207
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,350
None of us were in the locker room at halftime as they did to out.

208
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:53,399
And I would say that if he clears all the tests and the athlete is saying, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, you have nothing else to go on, right?

209
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,070
Like I talked about it, we didn't have a blood test. We don't have a scan. There's no 100% accurate testing this.

210
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,710
This is a clinical diagnosis. An extension so that the limitations of the bill.

211
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:08,120
Absolute. Yeah. Yeah. So.

212
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,290
Okay. And then outreach. We'll talk about this a little bit.

213
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,259
So, you know, we spend a lot of time focus on health equity. I talked about the pop up safety towers.

214
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,260
This is industry. Carla here fitting a helmet at one of our events at Mary Grove.

215
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,770
This is a couple of months ago and our friend Dana Nessel,

216
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:34,130
who came by to our booth and signed our position that we had offered, generously offered up a quote for us to use.

217
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:41,810
And these are just some of the materials that we've created. This top one here is just a poster for locker rooms just to raise awareness.

218
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,080
This one is for Detroit Public Schools. Specifically, it's kind of a flow sheet flowchart.

219
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:54,680
If you suspect an injury as an administrator, as a coach, like what do I do to walk this student athlete, you know, to get them health care?

220
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,979
And I would just say the Michigan High School Athletic Association and I think Wyoming are the

221
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,440
only two states that have free concussion insurance to every student athlete in that state.

222
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,399
So if you have a suspected injury, you can go to a clinic and not all clinics take it to insurance.

223
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,920
But it's most and it's no out-of-pocket expense.

224
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:24,530
They build the insurance directly and they take care of it. So that was put in place long before I came to the state.

225
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,890
So I can't claim any credit, but kudos to the people that did that work.

226
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,590
And then we created this kind of just infographic for parents and athletes.

227
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,370
Okay. So just some of our progress since 2018, when we started,

228
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:48,020
we had about six or so faculty members that had signed on as members of in the initial push that we had.

229
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,190
We've just about tenfold. I think we're actually closer to about 150 right now.

230
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,300
We've pushed out over 200 publications over the four years.

231
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:03,110
Our listserv is actually just shy of about 5000 because it's just shy of 5000.

232
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:10,490
And then we we created an online training module for student athletes, administrators and coaches.

233
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,339
That's not our module.

234
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:20,450
But annual concussion education is required by the High School Athletic Association, and we've reached over 37,000 people with that module.

235
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,799
So we're pretty proud of all that work. I just put this map up.

236
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't have any specific numbers,

237
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,710
but these are all locations around the world that our faculty have gone in pursuit of on various research related topics.

238
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,910
So we're pretty, pretty excited that we're getting this type of reach. Got going back to the outreach section.

239
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:47,910
I remember in high school growing up, we had a form of the question for is that a part of like the awareness aspect too because it broke down.

240
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,710
Yeah. So every state in the country has a concussion law and Washington, D.C. has concussion legislation.

241
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:03,860
Washington state was the first state to do this. We were 37 or 38 and Ohio was one behind us.

242
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:11,390
So just another reason was that in Ohio, you know, we don't like Ohio, know of the state.

243
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,959
So within the laws vary a little bit state by state.

244
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,370
But broadly, there's some sort of education that is required.

245
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,860
And then probably the form you had was just recognition that you did the training and that type of thing.

246
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:33,350
Okay. I did want to ask because you know so much about this, after my concussions,

247
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,540
I was told like you can drink water, do not eat a lot because you might throw up and you might choke up.

248
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,810
I'm wondering, like, aftercare, it's okay to be eating and drinking.

249
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:51,860
Yeah, right. Yeah. What we normally tell concussed individuals is like, just do your normal things unless it makes it worse.

250
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:58,310
So probably what they were like worried about is more severe TBI like moderate

251
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,709
severe brain bleeds type stuff where you can have kind of this kind of reflex.

252
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:09,070
But do people throw up after concussion? Yes, but like, do you, Asprey?

253
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,290
Like, not that I've ever seen or heard. Thank you. Yeah.

254
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,370
So there's a lot of different polls out there, but right now we're ranked number six in concussion research.

255
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,250
Somebody sent me something this morning that was like, you know, we're like number eight, but I'm not sure what eight six is better.

256
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:31,880
So, you know, and then we do have the number one subject matter expert in this case, which we're super proud of.

257
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,380
Hopefully I can come back in a couple of years and we have a couple number ones up there. Okay, good.

258
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,430
On just general structure of the center. Okay. Okay.

259
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,540
So I'm going to talk about the care consortium. This is the article that I sent over to Justin.

260
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,570
Just the general structure of it. So I'm not going to go through it too much on infrastructure.

261
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,980
It's more in the findings. But what I want to start with is just recognition of all the people that have worked on the project.

262
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:07,370
So it's 30 sites across the country since 2014 and we don't have a hard numbers, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood.

263
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,010
350 people have worked on this project, their full time capacity over the years.

264
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:20,890
So this is like the true definition of team science. And this is kind of like the primary people at the 30 sites who just want to put their names up.

265
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:27,549
I'm sure in the back room has got a telescope because what I read is so small timeline.

266
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:40,090
So the NCAA and the DOD, probably around 2012 ish, maybe early 2013, they started having conversations about doing a joint project,

267
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:45,280
and it largely centered around the recognition that for sea level athletes,

268
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:54,370
college students and military service academy members particularly, that the cadets at the academies basically are the same type of person.

269
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:02,920
Right. So they're 18 to 20 to 25 years old, super physically fit to push themselves to mental physical excellence and at high risk for injury.

270
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,870
Right. So on the varsity side, like sort of make sense, right?

271
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:16,180
Like versus athletes are a lot of outside of but really low risk sports like engage in activities such as performances on the cadet side.

272
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,110
And every academy everybody on those campus campuses are required to participate in either a varsity

273
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:29,380
sport or they're required to participate in a quite right sport and such a requirement of the campus.

274
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,600
In addition, they also engage in combatives and boxing and kind of military drills.

275
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:47,860
That kind of leading into this, there was this joint or simultaneous civilian interest in concussion that largely stemmed around CTE.

276
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,850
And then you had a military interest in concussion stemming from the war in Iraq, in the war in Afghanistan,

277
00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:03,370
where IEDs became the signature weapon and tbis became the signature injury right to the battle armor actually was working really well.

278
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,260
People were not dying. But the blast and the things that come with blast were causing brain changes.

279
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,200
And so that's where the idea of the D.O.D. side came from.

280
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:20,830
So they put a call out late 2013 or early 2014, myself and a couple of colleagues joined up.

281
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:28,660
Mike McCray, Medical College of Wisconsin, Tom McAllister at Indiana, put in a joint application we reviewed, we were selected.

282
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:38,620
We got a notice of award, I think, in early May, and we had to be up and running by early August.

283
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,990
We did not launch all 30 sites the first year. I think we launched 12 or 13 in the first year.

284
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,740
But you want to talk about like not sleeping and getting things done.

285
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:56,080
And I very clearly remember calling the IAB office and it was like, I have a grant coming in for $25 million.

286
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,030
I need this IAB approved in a week and they rose to the occasion.

287
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,200
I did. So as we all know, money talks.

288
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,160
So. So that took us through about 20, 2018.

289
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:16,840
The largest idea around that was to understand the acute effects of injury in all athletes and service members.

290
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,210
So the work up to that point had largely been in male contact in collision sports.

291
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,690
Right? Football, ice hockey in Boston, probably the big three.

292
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:37,030
The rationale, at least up to that point was if you're going to do research, which is time intensive and costly, get the biggest bang for your buck.

293
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,890
So go to the highest risk forms. And I remember as we were kind of developing the protocol,

294
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:51,370
sitting next to my undergraduate advisor who went on after I left North Carolina, went on to get a MacArthur Genius Award.

295
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,090
So like this tells you like the level that this guy operates. I do not operate at that level.

296
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,589
And I was like, We need to do all sports. He's like, Why would you do that?

297
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,669
I said, Does the golfer recover at the same rate with the football?

298
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,280
And he was like, I don't know. I'm like, my point exactly right.

299
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:13,659
We need to answer these questions. So everybody varsity athlete at the 30 sites is eligible and then these two are kind of in the middle there,

300
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,560
the service academy augmentation and then the green one, which we call Salter's,

301
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,320
that was designed to get all the non varsity athletes at the academies.

302
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,350
So at a place like Air Force or West Point, there's 4500 cadets on campus.

303
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:32,919
They were all eligible to participate. So that that kind of you can see we've got some overlapping timelines here.

304
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:41,140
But through 2018, we did kind of acute studies. In 2018, we started a little bit with the Q2, we started getting what we term exit evaluations.

305
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,620
So we had baseline. Somebody walks in as a first year student.

306
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,520
We know what you look like.

307
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,550
We evaluate you again as you're walking out the door as a graduate student or leaving maybe if you're going to go professional.

308
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,920
We also started to transition to do post-graduation surveys.

309
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:07,120
So after you have left your institution up to five years after we do a survey of those individuals that got it as a general structure.

310
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,479
Obviously the long term, the big goal here is the long term effects. Right.

311
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,600
So I'll touch more on that at the end.

312
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,660
So these are the 30 sites, every site completed in what we call the clinical study core.

313
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,660
They all did what we term these level eight tests. So this is probably if anybody played a sport in high school, what you.

314
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,470
Your baseline test or your post injury test look like? So it's a symptom evaluation.

315
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,030
It's a balance test and it is a computer test, right.

316
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,380
We added in a couple other things, but those are two big buckets. We did baseline.

317
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,000
If somebody had an injury, we got them within 6 hours. We got them again within 48 hours.

318
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,809
We get them when they no longer are reporting symptoms, we get them again.

319
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:52,850
Writers are getting ready to go back to their sport full time and then we got them six months later.

320
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,080
All right. Lot of work going on. And then we baseline them again the next year.

321
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:04,520
The Advanced Research Core, there are six schools that participate in that four civilian to the academies.

322
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,990
This was kind of a deeper dove into a subset of the athletes.

323
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,440
So it was only the high risk athletes on those campuses that participated.

324
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,120
But this is the blood draws, the genetic tests, the advanced imaging type of stuff.

325
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,660
Right. So very much more narrow focus, much deeper.

326
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,209
And the money is about the same in both of those, the clinical state coordinators much more.

327
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:32,930
So it just kind of gives you a sense. Okay, so I mentioned we started in 2014.

328
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:41,480
This is our enrollment. Since we started, we have enrolled over 60,000 individuals across all of these sites over the years.

329
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,850
About 40% are female. And just to address like Title nine issues, if anybody's thinking that way right now,

330
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,660
if you look at just the varsity athletes, it's virtually identical.

331
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:59,479
5050, the academies, because we have all cadets in the academies, tend to be very male, dominant.

332
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,740
It kind of drives the overall percentage down, but I can't fix that problem.

333
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,090
And then about 40% of the sample come from those service academies.

334
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:16,940
Oh, I also say that we had about it vary by site, but I think on average it was about 90% participation across the board.

335
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,069
Right. So in a place like Michigan, we have about 1000 or so student athletes. We had 900 of them, which is great.

336
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,400
Every year is great. Okay.

337
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:34,560
Good. Maybe not so good. We've also been fortunate to capture just shy of 5700 concussions.

338
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:41,310
These are sport related concussions. So I'm a cross-country runner and I tripped and I hit my head.

339
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,840
These are service academy members doing their boxing or combatives training,

340
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,300
and these are just university students that do university student related things.

341
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:58,800
Right? So for example, we have the classic I sleep on the top bunk and I woke up to quickly hit my head on the ceiling.

342
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:05,060
We had a sneeze, hit my head on the desk and we get slips on the ice.

343
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,700
We get car accidents. We got we get bar fights.

344
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,910
The one that I am dying to do a case series on but will probably never do.

345
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,450
Is you military related? Okay, so at West Point, at the end of the first year,

346
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,760
all that endeavor kind of done due to the end of the first year or the end of basic training in the first year.

347
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,890
All of those first year students, there's a big pillow fight out on the parade ground.

348
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,840
Right. It's been going on forever.

349
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:44,670
And one year while we were collecting data, it got a little out of control and they were dropping battle armor into their pillowcases and helmets.

350
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,729
And there were like 25 concussions. Yeah, it got from not from page.

351
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:54,650
It was in The New York Times. Right. Like people say, they want to be in The New York Times.

352
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:00,900
You don't want to be The New York Times really covering bad stuff. You don't want that. So I remember being on the phone.

353
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,580
Ken Cameron was the site guy and I was like, Ken, how many of those 25 concussions did you guys capture?

354
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,890
I think we have about 18. I desperately want to do a paper this like pillow fight, concussion.

355
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,110
The doctor's been super supportive. I don't want to embarrass them.

356
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:21,959
I would never do that. But those data are in there. I'm going to talk about how our data are publicly available.

357
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,940
And maybe somebody in this room who feels ambitious can go find those data and do the reporting from it.

358
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:37,020
Okay. Our findings we've published, I think, somewhere in the neighborhood of 110, 115 papers out of this project.

359
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:44,100
I've only laid a handful of them, but I would say to soapies and doc students and master's teams,

360
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,990
for that matter, have done the lion's share of the work here getting these data out.

361
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,900
And we just feel really lucky that it was a very slow start.

362
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,899
I remember being very angsty about like, we got to publish, but my colleagues like, Call me down.

363
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,740
And it's been it's been pretty amazing. So I had just talked about a couple of them.

364
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:12,600
I did lead on this one. This was kind of the primary aim of the clinical study core is to understand the natural history of concussions.

365
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:23,220
So in the literature, the way it was described is the average student athlete or the average athlete should say returned to play within two weeks.

366
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:32,040
Anything over two weeks is abnormal, right? So you would get athletes that this is where like talking to your clinical partners is super important.

367
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,930
You would get athletes that would come in. It's like you hit day 15, 16, 17, and all of a sudden they're labeled abnormal and they're like,

368
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,590
the psychology starts to really ramp up at that point, right?

369
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:49,320
Like because you think about a student athlete that's super type-A, particularly a student athlete at a place like this or Princeton.

370
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,030
And it's just pressure, pressure, pressure. And then you're starting to tease apart psychological symptoms versus concussion symptoms.

371
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:03,120
Right. So we were trying to understand what does it really look like so immediate and asymptomatic?

372
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,680
So this is when time from injury until they say, I have no more symptoms, just shy of seven days.

373
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,700
And then our median time to unrestricted return to play just shy of two weeks.

374
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,240
So our data is lining up perfectly with kind of what was in the literature.

375
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:24,060
But as we started digging into it, we see that it is 50% at one week, 16% at one week on return to play.

376
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,009
But it's not until we get out to one month that we see 85% of what we kind of turn.

377
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,190
The vast majority of people have unrestricted return to play.

378
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:37,470
And so we're proposing that normal concussion recovery may take up to one month.

379
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,130
Right. So, yeah, the average is 1440 days.

380
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,670
Right. But that's average, just a 50% time. Right.

381
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:52,170
The other half of the people and for example, if somebody has a cold average time to recover from cold is, what, nine days?

382
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:59,040
Right. Right. But if you were like 13, 14, you would be like, oh, that's an abnormal cold.

383
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,330
You never say that, right? You just like, oh, it's just a little bit worse than normal recovery happens.

384
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,450
So we've tried to reframe this a little bit.

385
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:16,080
There's a ginormous meeting next week that I'm headed to where we're going to kind of sets the stage for concussion care internationally.

386
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:22,530
I'm really going to try to push on this. It's like, yeah, 40 days is definitely the average, but normal is one month, right?

387
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,240
And then as we get past one month in some. Individuals have persistent symptoms that they have.

388
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,000
I will say that we as you as you start to look at other factors.

389
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,180
So our our female athletes are maybe a day longer,

390
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:43,950
those with significant concussion history by like three or four prior injuries before this one a day longer.

391
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:49,050
ADHD diagnosed with ADHD a day or two shorter.

392
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,710
So they might can explain that to me. Let me know. I literally in the paper, I'm like, this happened and I don't know why.

393
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,080
Like, I can't explain it. I don't know.

394
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:07,440
I'm trying to get some other factors that we looked at to kind of drill down, oh, a day or two faster with more frequent visits to your provider.

395
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,110
Right now, most of these individuals have access to an athletic trainer, or they can do it every day or multiple times a day.

396
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:20,940
So it's a little bit unique to just a general population, but that is a factor in kind of getting better recruiting like mental health.

397
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:30,389
Yeah. So summarization people that are high, some out of Pfizer's they get longer recovers like more internally introspective.

398
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,690
Like you really dwell on that headache. You really dwell on the dizziness, you dwell on those types of things.

399
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:43,750
They're slower and slower by a couple days. And the biggest predictor of time to recovery is initial symptom burden.

400
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:50,170
Right. So how bad for your symptoms within the first 24 to 48 hours is the single biggest predictor for how often?

401
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,950
This next one was led by Tina Masters. She's a physician at Penn.

402
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:05,440
She was interested in just specifically male, female, but kind of removing non sex compatible sports, right.

403
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:13,510
So football athletes make up like a third of the concussed sample as a big chunk and they can really sway like guidance or statistics.

404
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,600
Yeah, right. So you got one group that's like really swaying like a mean, you know, it changes a lot.

405
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:28,030
So she pulled out all the non sex compatible sports. So wrestling, football, field hockey which I like what else.

406
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:34,180
But she left in like soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, track and field exercises.

407
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,520
And in her analysis, there's actually no difference in the return to play time between males and females,

408
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:44,739
which pushes against a lot of dogma that you won't hear. Right.

409
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,299
There's this pervasive idea that female athletes take longer.

410
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,280
We need to be this is not the right word, but more gentle in our management.

411
00:39:54,910 --> 00:40:00,850
You can talk about all the sociology around that, which I disagree with and we have data now the fact that right.

412
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:08,350
Get largely managed in the same um and you know but you are still accounting for the individual differences as you would with anybody, right.

413
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:14,140
Oh you have like a worse headache. Well we're going to manage that like we manage all people with the worse, right?

414
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:20,130
This next one led by Spencer Leavell. He was a postdoctoral fellow here.

415
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,700
He's now on faculty at the University of Utah. He was injured.

416
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,670
He was interested in individual sport recovery rates.

417
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:32,910
The idea being kind of a little bit around the to a case where it's like, oh, football, I bet they have a seven day recovery period.

418
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,840
Right. Injured on a Saturday and back on the next Saturday. Right.

419
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:42,480
So are there certain sports that we cut recover faster based on your schedule?

420
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:51,090
And we were trying to look for clusters or groups of sports that kind of fast recovery, medium recovery, slow recovery type of thing.

421
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,049
And what he found is that while there is definitely a gradient here on time, do asymptomatic and tend to return to play.

422
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:06,600
There's no statistical difference between them. And football, for what it's worth, sits right kind of in the middle on both of these.

423
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,800
All right. So they're actually right around a two week window.

424
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:19,740
If you go back and you look at data from the early 2000, the AP moving to guess what the average time to return to play for a football match people.

425
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:32,430
23 days. So it was literally like having concussion on a Saturday and back at unrestricted practice Monday.

426
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,489
Right, which is just unheard of. Now, a lot of things have changed around protocols and policies and etc.,

427
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:42,660
but some good data to like be able to compare the difference between the two.

428
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,360
I actually skipped the slide because I'm going to just switch over to this one.

429
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:52,830
This is one I'm currently working on, looking at how fast people recover on individual,

430
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,090
the individual tests that we use and how that can inform clinical practice.

431
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:05,310
So we talked about the symptom evaluation and the balance assessment and then the computer tests and then how that lines up with the recovery process.

432
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:11,550
So you can imagine somebody has an injury. We let them rest for the first 24 to 48 hours.

433
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:18,370
And then right around the 48 hour mark on best is a test that we see recovery on that day.

434
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:25,470
We see multiple components that there's another marker of the bounce test that recovers.

435
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,840
PSAC is like a nurse that is screening some of the other computer based tests start to recover on day three.

436
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,510
The final balance portion starts by day four. VCI is the brief symptom inventory.

437
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:43,560
This is like anxiety, depression, immunization. So we see some of that recovering psychological score.

438
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:52,200
And then as we go out somewhere around day seven, kind of the last test comes back to normal and then we start progressing that athlete back.

439
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,200
So this flies up day 12, day 13. Therefore somebody we have an unrestricted return pool.

440
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,009
So this is kind of what clinicians, my physician in the back, I don't know what type of medicine you practice,

441
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:07,800
but in practice I'm referring training preventive medicine in public health.

442
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,910
Okay. Very different from families in certain certain. Oh, okay.

443
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:16,080
So yeah, these athletes are unconscious so they're not done.

444
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:22,620
Yeah. Yeah. So, um, so anyway, but this is kind of the normal thing that the clinician can expect along the way.

445
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,709
Okay, I'm going to transition out of like clinical type of findings and go more to the advanced

446
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,840
research core and some of the things that my colleague Mike McCray has been working on.

447
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:42,450
The idea here behind the the advanced research core is to understand if the neurobiology what's happening at a cellular level,

448
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,320
if that matches up with what we see at a clinical level and if those two things line up, great.

449
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,719
We can keep managing concussion the way we've always managed the concussion if those things don't line up.

450
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:02,430
And for example, clinical recovery occurs on day seven or eight, a neurobiological recovery doesn't happen until 14, 15, 16.

451
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,700
We need to rethink how we're managing the concussion exams. So this is how long does it take for the brain to recover?

452
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:17,819
And then are there markers that we can use to identify the injury as well as identify injury recovery diagnostics?

453
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:24,480
In this first one, this is diffusion picture imaging study done by Eugene Wu in Indiana.

454
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,660
Did you know DTI roughly how it works now?

455
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,210
Okay. So DTI is a type of MRI.

456
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:40,650
And what it does is it looks at white matter track integrity by looking at kind of how water moves through the track.

457
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:47,129
Right. And we use this term called mean diffusivity. The lower the mean do see, the better.

458
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:54,840
So imagine like water going through a straw, it just flows in a straight line and everything else basically higher.

459
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,790
Mean diffusivity is more like water trying to move through a spot. It goes everywhere, right?

460
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,510
So more focus better the more diverse script.

461
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,350
So Eugen took a group of concussed athletes.

462
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:17,249
They did post imaging, post injury imaging on them, on DTI, and then bucketed bucketed them based on the degree of media passivity.

463
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,149
And that's the lines. Right. And you can see that just don't worry so much about the numbers.

464
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:27,960
Just kind of know that they're on the lowest media passivity on the left in the reddish color,

465
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:35,070
the highest, worst injuries on the right, and then correlated that against kind of asymptomatic play.

466
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:44,010
And what she was able to show is that the burden of media passivity correlates with the time to asymptomatic and the time to return to play.

467
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:54,660
And you may be going, duh, of course. Well, prior to this, we sort of thought, oh, concussion is just a functional injury, meaning you get hit,

468
00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:00,510
the neuron stretches and just the ions shift over the membrane in an uncontrolled sort of way.

469
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,650
But over time those ions restore to homeostasis.

470
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,780
The body's always trying to seek homeostasis. This is the first to really say, Oh hey, by the way,

471
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:16,320
there's also some structural injury that's going on here and that gross structural energy that's going to show up on like standard 22 MRI,

472
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,800
but more of the micro cellular level. Right.

473
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:25,020
And so being able to show that for the first. Time and to put some this is kind of prognostic, right?

474
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:30,719
So if somebody comes in and we do a DTI on them and we say, oh, your mean DIFFUSIVITY is 820,

475
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,440
therefore we think your return to play time is going to be at 27 for you.

476
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:42,030
Right? This is all research now. This is not there's no clinical application to this yet, but like you can see kind of guiding in that direction.

477
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:47,470
The other one I want to talk about for blood biomarkers.

478
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,730
This has come up in the media somewhat recently.

479
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,220
You may have heard it where like the FDA has cleared blood biomarkers for concussion diagnostics.

480
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:04,120
True. The FDA has cleared concussion has cleared biomarkers for CT scan.

481
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:13,480
Yes. No. And so we do a lot of work with poorly in the adult in medicine that here is a big biomarker guy.

482
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,309
People come in, it's a motor vehicle accident. You're like a head injury.

483
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:24,050
Do a CT scan this person or not, because like do I won't expose them to like a ton of radiation, you know,

484
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:29,290
to maybe one out of every hundred people I'm going to pick up something or do we just kind of like let it pass?

485
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,590
So the blood biomarkers that have been approved for FDA use are whether this person needs a CT scan or not.

486
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:44,550
So now what we're talking about here, the data here are collected within six tournament, what the time was,

487
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,260
maybe it's 3 hours post injury and whether or not we can use biomarkers as diagnostics or not.

488
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,670
So there's four primary biomarkers that people are kind of honing in on.

489
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:03,249
G Fat glory of popularity, acidic protein, NFL film, red light tau,

490
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,270
which you've probably heard of around CTE, which is kind of a structural protein in the brain.

491
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,900
And you see each one, which I don't remember which cancer or so don't ask.

492
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,469
So what we see here is we see this big spike in fat, this big spike.

493
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:21,700
And you see one NFL seems to pretty much flat tail goes up.

494
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,660
But this kind of a wonky profile, we're not sure what's going on there.

495
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:35,440
So you're like, oh, these things are diagnostic. We can use these things within 48 hours, 24 hours to to evaluate the problem.

496
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,540
Is any of these in isolation or even combining them when we talk about very

497
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:44,650
under the curve are no better than a clinical exam and a symptom evaluation.

498
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,200
Right. So they're just not there yet.

499
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:56,620
Fred CORLEY, I mentioned a second ago he has a study right now in nursing that you can have like 1200 patients and they're going to do biomarkers.

500
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,780
And they're they have a much more sensitive panel than what we had at the time.

501
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:04,540
So people are trying to work backwards to basically it'd be really amazing if we could

502
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,519
have something that's like the size of the diabetes glucose monitor on the sideline,

503
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,870
pinprick, stick it in 20 seconds later, you've got like, you know, 100% accurate.

504
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,070
That'll be amazing when we get there. I hope.

505
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,820
How long is it going to take? I mean, I tell you, ten years and it will probably be 20 years.

506
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,040
Okay. So that's super high level.

507
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:35,920
I like some findings I mentioned just a bit ago about our data being publicly available to all of our data gets uploaded into the database,

508
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,950
which is a joint effort between the NIH and the Department of Defense.

509
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,830
We currently make up 40% of the entire database, and I'm just putting that up there to brag.

510
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:51,910
So we have 137 million data points that we could push into the dataset.

511
00:49:52,690 --> 00:50:01,690
And if you do a quick back of the envelope calculation, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of like 22 or 2500 data points per person in the study.

512
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:08,350
So these individuals are very well characterized from just basic demographics,

513
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:13,420
but also personal medical history, family medical history, sports history, concussion history.

514
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,360
He's trying to get ulcers in a medication use like we have a lot of data on these individuals.

515
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:26,620
That leads me to the next kind of point in this idea around long term effects.

516
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:36,380
So we were funded late last year for a third round of funding by the NCAA and the DOD to do what we're calling it.

517
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,540
It's called Care SOTOS Integrated or Care Long. It just depends on who you're talking to.

518
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:47,890
The idea here is we're done with everybody kind of on campuses and now we want to start tracking them after graduation.

519
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:57,550
So one phase of this study is looking at online evaluations twice over a five year period for anybody, up to ten years after graduation.

520
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,790
And then a subset of those individuals will be brought back either to Medical College, Wisconsin or Indiana.

521
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:10,740
To do in-person evaluations like a full day evaluation is what draws imaging 6 hours of neuroscience testing,

522
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,560
clinical exams, lunch flights and flight time.

523
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:15,090
Right.

524
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:26,499
It's a very robust type of study because ultimately what we're trying to do is inform clinical practice that then goes into documents like this,

525
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:34,390
which are like the position statements, the consensus document that drive clinical care and whether that's to help athletes,

526
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,440
military personnel or a lot of this gets translated over into the civilian world.

527
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,980
And so just kind of doing the best that we can do before. Those cases.

528
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:49,280
So with that, I want to thank the people in the center that really do all the work.

529
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:55,060
Are actually over there working right now. I get to come talk to you guys and I just had to put this picture up.

530
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,729
So athletics was very generous right before the UConn game.

531
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,070
And to see it up through the Maryland game,

532
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:08,120
they gave us the billboard in like 20 seconds of it as it rolled through other things so we could promote our spotlight certificate.

533
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,129
So I was quite proud. So thank you very much for your time.

534
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,160
And I got all the time you want for questions. Thanks.

535
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:33,410
Yes. When developing a home for football and all that, over time the material has changed to better the shock absorption.

536
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,970
Yeah. How do you touch that? Because I can just, like, put a helmet on something. Yeah, there's a lot of people that call me.

537
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:45,050
They say, like, I've got a new helmet, let's put it in the athletes. And I'm like, there's a whole set of series of tests that have to happen.

538
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:52,520
So typically what happens is somebody, let's say right now, they come up with some new material that they're going to use.

539
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:58,940
They'll probably do some in-house testing. But there's a organization called Knock See the National Organization.

540
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:05,620
It's like I can't remember. It's like safety and athletic or preventive care or what the C stands for.

541
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:12,550
Um, and they, they have standards on how they test sporting equipment.

542
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:18,880
So they're, the helmet has dropped it to different heights under, I think three different temperatures.

543
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:26,630
So like ambient air. Extreme heat. Extreme cold. And it has to fall below whatever.

544
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,959
I remember what the threshold is that there's a threshold. It's called the severity index.

545
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:39,010
It was actually developed at Wayne State and it has hit below that threshold on all all the drops under the different temperatures.

546
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,090
And they do different angles like so from the helmet back on the sides. And then if it hits that,

547
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:53,020
then they certify the helmet and then they can go inside and to stop people from having uncertified helmets out on the field.

548
00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:02,259
I know the NCAA mandates this and I would imagine all the High School Athletic Association do, too.

549
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,770
But they basically say you can't have a non Nazi certified helmet on.

550
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:15,190
You can't do that. The NFL has their own testing that they have developed and they actually mandate

551
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:19,600
that you cannot use a helmet that is more strict than the Nazi standards.

552
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:24,700
And they actually every year they kind of say like these are like green level helmets.

553
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,090
They're fine. Um, they have yellow level permits. Okay?

554
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,700
And then they have sometimes it's like you actually cannot wear these even if they're not certified.

555
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,070
Yeah. Yes.

556
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:42,070
Oh, the little person. Lily, is my daughter.

557
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:48,920
Uh, she is 14. Um, I, as every parent probably does.

558
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,310
Maybe you're just like, I want my child to do something tangential to what I do because I love it so much.

559
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:02,739
And I had this dream that she'd be a neurologist or something, and my dad got shot down, and then I was like, Maybe I should be a researcher.

560
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,940
And that's not happening. Um, but she is.

561
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:13,120
I'm just going to brag a little bit. She wants nothing to do with science. She's good at it, but she just doesn't want to do it.

562
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:18,070
She can. She is so creative in ways that I could only dream of.

563
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,120
And so she at 14 wrote like a 100 page book.

564
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,879
Um, I'll put a caveat on that.

565
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:33,820
You know, we use 18.5 and like two and a half line spacing and like, you know, you fill the pages but um, draws all the time just like crazy creative.

566
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:40,670
She wants to be a screenwriter. Know, um, so kind of like my childhood nostrum.

567
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:44,710
Okay, well, I'll let you guys.

568
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,820
That's her. So she. She drew Brainy. Um, she was actually in the office.

569
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:57,790
I can't remember why, but she came to the office one day. She was pretty young, I think maybe like ten ish.

570
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,430
And just like, um, like a whiteboard picked up markers and.

571
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:06,880
And then we took a picture of it and had it digitized and is kind of like the unofficial mascot.

572
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:25,390
Q What sorts of maybe not protocols, but kind of either barriers to entry or barriers to not being able to do this work anymore.

573
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:32,000
Would you encourage either starting at like high school level in college within the age

574
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,210
group of try and Dickie like is there a minimum age before you start certain sports?

575
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:46,190
Dr. Well, like, yes, so I'll answer this from a couple angles.

576
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:56,180
So it is very clear that individuals that start a sport at a very young age, and that is the only sport that they play,

577
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:01,250
they burn out more frequently, they have more injuries and they burn out more frequently.

578
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:08,630
Right. So for example, you hear these stories of like, Oh, I started playing basketball when I was two and then I went on to the NBA.

579
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,240
That is the absolute exception to the rule.

580
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:20,480
People that participate in a number of sports and develop multiple physical skill sets are more likely to go on to play.

581
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,820
You know, you start to narrow like as you get into high school or college.

582
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,920
So they're more likely to play it at the college level and then professional if that's an option, that makes sense.

583
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:37,960
Um, I think maybe the question you're driving at is, is there a minimum age to play contact or tackle football, that sort of thing?

584
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:45,020
Yeah. So there is this idea has been promoted that you should not start tackle football before the age of 12.

585
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:54,860
And we have done a series of maybe six papers now that all around this idea of age, first exposure.

586
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:01,910
And we can see no difference between people who started before or after the age of 12, whether it's football or any contact sport,

587
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,440
and how they perform on like our baseline evaluation,

588
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:11,870
how they perform if they have longer or shorter recoveries after concussion, and how they look at exit.

589
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:16,170
We don't have long term data. What you get at, we're trying.

590
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:25,870
What's your process when you're assessing an athlete in determining if they are not physically able to return to their school?

591
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,340
Like, do you need to retire that person? Yes. Yeah.

592
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,069
So Julien Schmidt at University of Georgia did a study on this and I don't remember all the details,

593
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:43,970
but he medical disqualification for concussion occurred maybe 100 out of the 5500 injuries that we have, something like that.

594
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:50,570
And you have to remember all the factors, but I know it was like three or more prior injuries.

595
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:55,190
Um, there was like alcohol use. Marijuana use was in there.

596
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,570
Um, like initial symptom burden. I don't remember.

597
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:08,250
I'm sorry. Um, part of the reason it's very fuzzy is there are no clinical guidelines for that decision.

598
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:13,670
It's a judgment call. It's a conversation between the physician, the athlete, and probably their parents.

599
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:18,379
Um, and it's sort of this kind of ambiguous type of thing.

600
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:26,060
And some of it is you have this injury, you're not really returning in a way that we would expect you to.

601
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,940
Um, and this is like, I'm making this up, but, you know, this is your fourth, fifth, sixth injury.

602
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,350
Is this really the sport you want to do? What are your long term goals?

603
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,669
What is your risk for another life if you're a golfer and you just have a long recovery,

604
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:46,100
but it's your first one, like your risk of a second one is nil, as opposed to like you're a football athlete.

605
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,650
This is number six. You're not going to get drafted. Is this really worth it?

606
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:59,450
Does that make sense? So it's a sort of like, I don't have a solid answer for you because it's a really it's a clinical judgment.

607
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:05,600
So I've never had to do it. Maybe that's part of the reason I'm getting around is I've never had it like have that conversation.

608
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,520
Yeah. So you're talking about concussion, neurobiology and how you can use the DTI to test for.

609
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:25,440
Yeah, I know. Like, uh, like what access to for one period day care for people's like an MRI because something like that can be adjusted.

610
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,780
Yeah. So that's a research tool right now and you're absolutely correct.

611
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:36,090
Like, you know, MRI's are not on every street corner, um, until Walgreens decides to put one in.

612
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:42,360
But, um, I, I don't know if it will ever be a widespread clinical tool.

613
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:46,830
Um, one because they're super expensive just to have for the hospital system.

614
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,239
Um, a scan. I don't even know what an MRI costs.

615
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,290
Probably $1,000. I'm guessing if you had to pay out of pocket 5000 to get that pocket.

616
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,860
Is there something that you could talk about cost of a little bit?

617
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,970
Okay. I'm guessing on that. I don't actually know. Like if you didn't have insurance and you're like, I need an MRI.

618
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:08,370
Um, so my guess is that it will never be a widespread thing.

619
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:12,090
I think when we think about stuff that could be widespread,

620
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:19,960
I think this idea around a blood test and whether it's like a standalone glucose meter or whether it's I'm looking at smart, right.

621
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,780
Like an add on particularly for medical professionals to have.

622
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:32,129
I could see that being a thing but you pretty much hit the nail on the head like, you know,

623
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:37,020
if we developed this amazing thing, but it's $1,000,000 per test and like, so what, you know, right?

624
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,469
Like, great. So Michigan can use it and the lions can use it.

625
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:44,040
But what do we do about like the kid that's in here?

626
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,900
It's not an object. And they do the blood tests, like having the side of the.

627
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,340
Right now, it's still research.

628
01:01:54,120 --> 01:02:01,769
So in this one, we'll pull them out and then they'll probably like go into like a medical like an athletic training room,

629
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,980
a medical facility right away and do a blood draw.

630
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:12,720
But that's veins puncture, right? That's not pinprick. The one that Fred's doing, I think that's still Vegas puncture, the one that he's going into.

631
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:18,180
So, yeah, it's not very it's coming, but it's not.

632
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:25,780
So I'm intrigued by this thought of like ADHD playing an effect with how people recover.

633
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:33,460
And so I've been wondering since ADHD can like show like differences in brain structures.

634
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:42,460
Have you done like a study? Is there a study? The question where they like, oh, we have a ton of athletes who actually have ADHD,

635
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:50,590
much as can they play their sport, take them again and seeing if there's any physiological changes over time.

636
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,870
I know there's a ton of factors and yeah, that's it. In theory, yeah.

637
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,700
I'm not aware of anybody that. So there are people that have looked at.

638
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:09,670
There was a group at Purdue that was looking at high school athletes and they were doing like baseline scans,

639
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:14,590
pre-season or mid-season scans, and then in the season scans and they were seeing some changes on MRI.

640
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:19,870
There was a group at Dartmouth that did it and hockey athletes, same sort of thing,

641
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:27,790
but they they did them the next season and the changes as they saw post season had recovered by the next season.

642
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:36,030
That's just general. I don't know. They're probably some ADHD student athletes mixed in there, but it was kind of framed as like just general student.

643
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,800
I'm not aware of anybody this ADHD specifically.

644
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:54,940
Yeah. Good question. With your cases of concussions that are I'm feeling totally like there's like casual

645
01:03:55,150 --> 01:04:00,350
space like you can begins to like why things are great like the pillow fight thing.

646
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:07,959
Like it's like it's a tradition, right? Right. Right. Or like in hockey, brawling is very much like a thing.

647
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,800
And I know that's not accounting for like a mass amount of concussions.

648
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,340
And it's really like I'm sure it doesn't help either.

649
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,110
I feel like I someone outside of those spaces, I can look at your data.

650
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:26,290
I'm doing okay. You people like that's 18 or 25 concussions for me, I'm sure not good.

651
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:34,959
Right. But if that's part of your tradition and like the sense of community, how are you taking your data and having those conversations?

652
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,610
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotcha. So the pillow fight thing is kind of a free one time, right?

653
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:45,700
Yeah. So and fighting and hockey is actually not allowed at the NCAA level.

654
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:53,319
You get ejected. So it doesn't it doesn't happen a child actually so you know out of the international like if the Olympics and it's

655
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:59,860
like well yeah I get I get what you're saying they're like how do you how do you like change the culture of sport,

656
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:07,900
right? Yeah. I mean, yeah, very particular. So I didn't talk about it, but I'll use this as an example.

657
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:13,510
We in the advanced research core with the helmet sensors in the football athletes,

658
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:21,010
we were looking at head impact exposure in the preseason in the month of August relative to the rest of the regular season.

659
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:29,290
So September of, let's say, be in November and the number of concussions, I remember the numbers here,

660
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:34,060
50% of all concussions in football occur in the month of August during preseason.

661
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,329
And then the other race at one month.

662
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:45,290
And then over the next three months, that's when the next 50% of the head, in fact, exposure rates are about the same.

663
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:50,540
So we wrote a paper in the NCAA.

664
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,980
We worked closely with the NCAA, and not that they do not see anything until we publish it,

665
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:59,150
but we were we said like, this has been accepted, it's coming.

666
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:04,880
Would you give them a heads up? And they changed the rules to preseason practice.

667
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,780
So there are no more two day practices and preseason football.

668
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:17,120
And they I think this is right they have gotten rid of inmate play football Oklahoma drill not allowed anymore.

669
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:21,860
Yeah. So Oklahoma drill is like lineup across from each other.

670
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,790
Go ahead. No head to head, but like hit the other guy. Yeah, right.

671
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,910
Can't do that. And then I feel like they made some.

672
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:33,680
Oh. And then they changed the frequency of contact practices over the preseason period.

673
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,750
So it used to be that you can have like basically as many.

674
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:42,290
Yeah, there were a total number of contact days that you could have, but let's say you lose five over 30 games.

675
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:46,190
You could have five in a row if you wanted. And now I think you can't have more than two in a row.

676
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:56,210
So they made some changes to try to reduce the rest. We then we also just published a paper looking at concussion rates in the spring football.

677
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:00,440
Spring football concussion rates are the same as the month of August.

678
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:05,660
So to have those data published, so I we'll see what they do.

679
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:12,080
The other one we're working on right now is what is the preseason concussion rate in all sports?

680
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:22,820
Do we want to take a guess at what the highest is? And it's not football, rugby, non NCAA sport rugby is not in case.

681
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:26,450
Well, it's not hockey.

682
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:31,220
What judo is it. Cheer and cheer. Cheer is not either.

683
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:35,030
But it's a brutal sport. Yeah. Women's gymnastics.

684
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:41,330
So we are. We're working on it and we'll do the same thing.

685
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:44,510
Will submit for publication. If it gets accepted, we will let them know.

686
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:49,280
And then it's up to them to make. I can't tell them to make rules changes, but it's up to them to do it.

687
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,190
On the military side, we have been working with them on their concussion evaluation protocols.

688
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,180
What assessments at what time points out that type of thing. Right.

689
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:03,080
So as much as I would like to ban war, I don't have that power.

690
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,570
So those things are going to happen.

691
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:12,319
And I am supportive of combatives training and boxing training because the first time you get punched in the face,

692
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:21,430
it shouldn't be when it's life or death. So I have a completely newfound respect for military personnel based on like what I've seen.

693
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:25,040
The training that they do is just insane. So it makes sense.

694
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:30,080
Yeah, it'd be interesting. Like your partnerships with people, we yeah.

695
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,350
I mean, we had very good relationships with the NCAA and duty.

696
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:39,979
Yes. I was going to ask, is that why the NFL had them wear the extra padded helmets?

697
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,370
And it was not nothing that we did.

698
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,620
But yes, they're trying to reduce injury rates.

699
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:52,970
So in the NFL, in all professional sports, like there's it's always a conversation between the league, right?

700
01:08:53,150 --> 01:09:02,870
The sporting body and then the players association. There's a give and take near the NFL for all the bad things that happened in the NFL.

701
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:09,530
Once they acknowledge that they have been the most progressive. Right, they put a lot of money into research.

702
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:14,540
They were the first one to have a spotter in the box. So the first one with the tent, they have a very standardized protocol.

703
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,799
They make changes as things happen. Do mistakes happen?

704
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,660
Absolutely. We can debate the two case.

705
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:31,189
But, you know, medicine is not perfect, which is why I am I'm not going to criticize the Miami Dolphins medical team because we weren't there.

706
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:39,530
We don't know. And I care. I want to believe that they are doing the best job that they can with the information I have at the time.

707
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:45,319
Right. And I would also say that if anybody in here was like, oh, yeah,

708
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:51,770
I went to see my primary care and they put me on some blood pressure medication and I looked you straight in the eye and like, they're wrong.

709
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:58,990
You don't know my case. They're wrong. That's the wrong medication. I don't know the case.

710
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,280
You don't go to this case, right.

711
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:07,810
And what makes sport very unique is it happens in front of 100,000 fans in the stands and 5 million people on live TV.

712
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:16,880
So like I'm interested in the follow up from like after your career.

713
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:24,889
Yeah, obviously. And the think you just knowledge of that style of play in the NFL professional sports.

714
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:30,260
It doesn't I don't see the same level of follow up and resources provided

715
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,850
because we see a lot of athletes with CTE in the community committed suicide,

716
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,879
domestic violence and things like that. Like, why is that?

717
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:42,820
Why is there more of a focus on the college versus the pro?

718
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:46,730
Yeah. Um, so there is a study called NFL Long.

719
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:49,190
It's being run out of Harvard, the beginning of this study.

720
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:58,459
And they are looking at former NFL athletes, I think in the 5060s and seventies to try to understand some of the same questions that we're asking.

721
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:09,200
But it's a different group of people. So that's happening. I will also tell you that, um, the risk of suicide among NFL athletes,

722
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,280
depending on the data you look at, are either the same or lower than the general population.

723
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:23,149
So the media may have gotten it wrong. Um, CTE cases.

724
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:31,970
While CTE is definitely a thing, it is not 99% that I nobody knows the number, but I can guarantee you it's not 95%.

725
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,840
It is 99% of the brains that got donated to the Boston group.

726
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:39,440
And why do people donate? Because they have questions.

727
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:50,390
Everyone, um, I have also seen, um, we had a former Michigan athlete who passed away in his nineties who I, I didn't know him well, but I knew him.

728
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:57,110
He lived alone. He was exactly what you would expect a 90 year old man to act like, right?

729
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:59,030
Like, did he say some stuff that's a little crazy.

730
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:03,980
Yeah, but, you know, he was born in, like, 1930, so I'm going to give a little generational cushion on that.

731
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:10,790
Um, but not impulsive, like, really warm guy, totally coherent.

732
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:15,280
His brain got shipped to Boston after he passed away. Stage three CTE.

733
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,540
I'm like, Yeah.

734
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:28,550
Fenway So when I talk to pathologists outside of the Boston group, they're like, the way they are slicing and staining, you'll find everything.

735
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:37,590
I feel like I just challenge everything that you think. So keep going and we can keep going.

736
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,920
As someone who played sports, all sports and everything like that,

737
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:52,020
and looking at the recent news and a lot of coming out with CTE cases have been their behaviors and listening to the story you describe.

738
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:59,400
To me, it sounds like an understanding of the affects or the behaviors that something is still involved that.

739
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:06,450
Yes. Absolutely right. You can not go look at my sergeant in the back and I'm just fine.

740
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:12,720
If you slice the brain postmortem, scan it and there's a spot of whatever does that.

741
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:16,590
Is there a 1 to 1 correlation between that spot and some clinical presentation?

742
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,760
No. Right.

743
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:25,170
So you have. And how many people in the room are over 30. Hey.

744
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:32,820
Okay. We all have California and Oregon over 30, actually.

745
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:38,430
There are talent, but there's documented cases of power deposits in, like, five year old housing, naturally occurring protein.

746
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:42,600
But it can break loose and it can deposit, right.

747
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:49,650
Any tail deposit anywhere in the brain is classified as stage one CTE, which is ridiculous.

748
01:13:51,090 --> 01:14:00,390
So definition. I love those. So how many people have ever had a fast food hamburger in their life?

749
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:07,650
Right. There you go. I'm a reformed Mediterranean and recent vegetarian enjoying it.

750
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:11,100
But we've all got tomatoes gross. As people are, we all have heart attacks.

751
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,090
No. Now. Do we know?

752
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,750
Yes. You get what I'm saying?

753
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:31,620
Yeah, there's a lot of sometimes the media gets a little ahead of itself if things are going in the right place.

754
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:39,090
I think, too, if you want to look at the prevalence of CTE when you're looking at collegiate level athletes versus professional athletes,

755
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,489
I think, you know, one thing you have to consider that the competition is obviously stiffer.

756
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:52,470
So like the athletes themselves at the professional level, but they're more of like kind of peak human conditioning, like a future athlete.

757
01:14:53,670 --> 01:15:05,040
But the reason that they're playing as well. Yeah. Like those kind of athletes in college, like 15 to 22 and then like that they can be from 22 to 40.

758
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,490
Yeah. Right. Unless Tom Brady and you can be like 95.

759
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,759
So what we really what we sort of think around the risk of CTE and like I say,

760
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,530
we do not know the real number is if you play a high school football because football

761
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:23,850
is front and center of everything and it's also probably the highest risk sport.

762
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:31,440
It's the most had, in fact, exposures to high school customers. So he plays some high school football, like from what we know now, not worried at all.

763
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:38,129
If you play some college football and then as you go on, like obviously your risk goes up.

764
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:44,580
But when I say your risk goes up, you're probably if you look at all neurodegenerative diseases, I think their risk goes from.

765
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:53,350
I may get this wrong, but I think it goes from like 0.05% to like 0.2%.

766
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:03,610
That's all neurodegenerative diseases. Don't quote me on the percentages, but these fraction practical.

767
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:12,850
I didn't mention that the founders worried about training, but you know, like a lot of this, like the NCAA ends up.

768
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,840
I was wondering if anyone's doing this work with like me or anybody like that,

769
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:25,090
because I feel like anecdotally as a physician, I like people I like a lot.

770
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:29,070
Yeah. Yeah. So the no is the short answer.

771
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:34,670
Not that I'm aware of is the short answer. The very, very first we can look back in the literature.

772
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:43,899
The very, very first reported cases of CTE were dementia, pugilistic, which was 1929, the guy's first name.

773
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:51,160
But Martin was the last name. Speaking of, he's actually more famous, as you may know, Radium Girls, the show.

774
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,300
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, there's a line in there, like Marlon.

775
01:16:55,570 --> 01:17:01,410
Marlon was a I think he was a coroner in New Jersey and he was the one that connected so slightly.

776
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:10,360
Back up, Radium Girls is a story story about a watch factory in New Jersey that they would hand paint the dials.

777
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:14,260
And it was right when glow in the dark dials were coming out.

778
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:19,240
And they use radioactive paint and they used a very fine tip brush.

779
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:29,830
And you would dip in the paint, paint a number or two, and then, oh, your thing is not super fine tap to put it in your mouth, put it back in.

780
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:39,130
But nobody knew that radium causes cancer, right? So these women that were in the factory, they would get mouth cancer and all sorts of nasty stuff.

781
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:42,010
Marlon was the first one that made that connection,

782
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:47,500
and then he was also the first one that described to meet your pugilistic uncles and former boxers.

783
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:57,040
To your point, I have a problem with boxing because the intent of boxing is to hurt somebody, right?

784
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:01,090
The goal is to knock them out, to give them a brain injury. I have a problem with that.

785
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:09,400
I'm not a huge fan of enemy like the original intent. If you go back to like when I was your age, it was like voice crazy and that was knockout.

786
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,479
Like that doesn't because you don't knockout anymore about powerhouse knockout happened

787
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:23,080
but that's not what happened really switch to football at least I can go like the ball.

788
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:27,950
The intent of the game is to like get the ball over the line. Maybe I'm just rationalizing.

789
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:34,330
One of them is like sports, entertainment. Like I don't like going out.

790
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:38,960
Like the first thing that comes to mind is first.

791
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:48,850
Yeah. Like, is there like a correlation between anabolic use and, like, sustained brain damage or sustained brain injuries?

792
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,450
I have not seen any related.

793
01:18:51,460 --> 01:19:05,020
So I think the, as I understand anabolic steroids, um, they don't, they don't result in kind of like manic depressive suicidality, as I understand.

794
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:15,040
But I'm not going to claim to be an expert in that space. However, just the mix between anabolic steroids and head impacts and potentially CTE.

795
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,799
Do those interplay? I don't really know. We did ask early in the project.

796
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,360
We did ask about anabolic steroid use, performance injury in general.

797
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:27,820
And the numbers were so low, they were unbelievable.

798
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:34,770
You know, like one out of like 10,000 people and like more people are using it than this and it's just not believable.

799
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:38,520
So. But I couldn't.

800
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:53,120
You guys are asking three questions, right? And are there any activities that as a parent you would have?

801
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:57,690
This is obviously like a personal choice, but as a parent,

802
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:06,630
you would have either advised your friends to tell their kids they shouldn't or should do, or from personal experience.

803
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:14,460
So I'll start with my daughter. She played a little bit of soccer when she was like six or seven years old.

804
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,320
And that lasted like a year. And she has since sat on the couch.

805
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:29,610
So if you can go pro and iPad, we're good. Um, so I don't really so much, you know, and I just have one daughter, the one kid,

806
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:32,820
so I don't have to I don't think about it from a personal perspective.

807
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,620
You sort of touched on it.

808
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:43,080
I do think it's a very personal choice between the the child, the parents or the parents or guardians and then what's available.

809
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:49,710
All right. So there for a while and it has happened so much recently, there was a conversation around like Ban football.

810
01:20:50,940 --> 01:21:02,280
And I'm very much against that from the big level because in many communities that is the one spot a child can go after school to be safe.

811
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:09,480
And I do think there are a lot of life lessons that come from just sport participation in general.

812
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:17,220
Right. Teamwork, working towards a goal, learning how to, you know, you get knocked down, you have to get back up again, not quoting the song.

813
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:23,760
So and then I think if you say like, well, we're going to ban football, then like, what's the next thing up?

814
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:28,680
Like ice hockey and then lacrosse and then cheerleading and then like, where does it stop?

815
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:34,200
So I'm not in favor of that type of thing. I think it is an individual choice that you want to make.

816
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:44,510
Although she appears, you get such a lot about her, a little bit about like the helmet testing that they do forget about helmets.

817
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:50,060
Has some of that testing also like for like the military's like the helmets that they have to wear?

818
01:21:53,780 --> 01:22:01,640
Not that I'm aware of, although I can tell you that the first first football helmets were tank helmets.

819
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:10,640
So just an short history. I do remember the exact year, early 1900s, before I was on the verge of being banned.

820
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:18,200
The NCAA did not exist. Football was on the verge of being banned because there were I think in one year there were like 12 or 13 deaths on field.

821
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:26,120
And Teddy Roosevelt and whenever he was in office, basically got the presidents of the I think it was all the Ivies at the time together.

822
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,540
And you like fix the problem or I'm going to ban this. So they made some rule changes.

823
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:36,680
Helmets were introduced, but they were like the padded leather ones, which are actually more for one type of.

824
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:46,970
Let's go. All right, Aspen. So now we're done.

825
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:51,760
So I feel like. Really, because this guy applies covers, right?

826
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:56,800
Like right areas or topics with an injury. WEBER Earlier speakers talked about prevention.

827
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:05,720
Bedside time might be about 20 years. And the analogy is so sports seems to have just an opportunity here.

828
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:09,590
You have the interest of funding to make that transition a lot quicker.

829
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:13,330
Can it be applied to other forms of injury?

830
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:18,380
Do you see analogies or is it just because sport is just one of those things in our culture, in our society,

831
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:26,990
that allows for more opportunity than otherwise would be possible to have your science get to a sideline within a couple of years, ten years, I think.

832
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:33,260
I don't have the answer for other injuries. I don't really know. I think I'm going to quote Jeff Barr here,

833
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:39,440
who many people credit as like the starting modern concussion science and he

834
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:45,079
was UVA neurology and get the first studies in football athletes in the early

835
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:51,530
nineties and he he labeled it as sports as a laboratory and I think he advantage

836
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:57,590
is you have a population with a known risk that is captive as it were,

837
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:01,430
and you can get baseline evaluations on them and then track over time.

838
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:09,310
So it's very unique in that way. You know, I think about general medicine like I don't know.

839
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:14,020
So I going back to you, do you know, like what the percentage of people that have like an annual 12 is?

840
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:17,740
It is essentially a baseline. I don't know that.

841
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,809
Yeah, I'm sure it's not that great. Yeah, right. But like,

842
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:25,550
I can baseline test 100 and 120 people on the Michigan football team and a couple of days and

843
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:31,639
we have a snapshot of neurological functioning before it and interacting daily after injury.

844
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,530
So it's very unique in that way.

845
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:46,220
I think the other thing about sports medicine broadly is that it developed around very it's designed to be very fast, right.

846
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:53,450
So for example, I remember when I was in Pittsburgh, I think Jerome at blew his knee out and like,

847
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:58,910
you know, it's all over the headlines and like, you know, he's got an MRI like that night or the next day.

848
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:05,629
And then meanwhile, like covering a basketball game, talking to a father and he's like,

849
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,840
oh, my daughter blew out last week and it's going to be two months before you get.

850
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:16,010
So it's just designed to be very fast and you can give a kind of quick return to that thing.

851
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:20,120
There's it gets fuzzy, though, right? Like an ankle sprain.

852
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,510
Like I'm an athletic trainer by trade, by the way. I don't think I mentioned that.

853
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:27,650
But like, you have an ankle sprain, like I can get you back on the field in seven days.

854
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,820
Just brought it right now. I'm going to tape you, break you do the rehab, all that stuff.

855
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:39,910
But I'm not I'm not so sure I would recommend that for a sports team, they've got a unique aspect.

856
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,970
Good. All right. Thank you, guys. You guys were great.

857
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:52,200
Yeah. I appreciate you coming over.

858
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:57,530
Of course, for the time and for everything we talk about the graduation all.

859
01:25:57,890 --> 01:26:01,820
Thank you. Yeah. I'll give you my daughter's email.

860
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:05,930
You can pressure her, change your career path, keeping hers.

861
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:13,370
Right. The next movie about concussions. Maybe that's the middle ground. Or at least two things I would do.

862
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:20,380
So, yeah, right there.
