1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,570
Any problem with that?

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:15,060
I'm just like, okay, we're going to go ahead and get started for today.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,060
So we're going to be doing another in-class activity today.

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,590
It should be posted on canvas, and there are some hard copies up here of it.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,590
I'll give you guys about 20 minutes to work on it and then we'll go over the answers together.

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:49,650
Sans. Right now.

7
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:07,780
Absolutely. I don't know.

8
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:19,420
It's just doing like the. Now.

9
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:32,340
You know, it just makes sense.

10
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:47,910
He's right. You know? Joining us to.

11
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:14,480
There's. I never realized.

12
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:25,360
Oh, yes. Yeah.

13
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:33,300
I think that's a huge. I suppose I.

14
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:58,110
That was not. He didn't.

15
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:21,500
You just. Or you.

16
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:48,370
Like a lot of other.

17
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:13,320
Anything. What's the trouble?

18
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:26,000
When you home. You know, as soon as we get.

19
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,590
You know, you started crying crazy, you know?

20
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:47,260
If it turns out. People.

21
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:58,510
Yeah, yeah, I.

22
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:32,530
I. Yeah, I agree.

23
00:05:38,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Yeah. Oh, my.

24
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,340
But it wasn't. This is going into.

25
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:12,000
In this instance. Yeah.

26
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,910
Yeah, that's. If I could, that.

27
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:22,950
Well. Okay.

28
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,060
Which Bush? It's.

29
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,040
I'll. How you. It would be.

30
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:22,230
Well. It.

31
00:09:30,580 --> 00:10:00,730
We don't do that. You were in.

32
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:27,350
This. Something.

33
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:58,000
Just to make sure you. So.

34
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:14,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:29,730
You know, kind of thing that.

36
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,710
Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:07,490
So over the top it says, we are monitoring your searches by association of the socio demographic.

38
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,670
So is that the exposure or are we looking at age?

39
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,670
You're looking at 18. It's.

40
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, that's. I think it's.

41
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:24,780
Yeah. I want to give you a little bit more.

42
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:52,390
And listen, I'm sure that when I heard. I don't know about how.

43
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:07,530
I'm. So I.

44
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:54,440
We're talking about. Joining us now from Capitol.

45
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:19,920
You know, when I write about something, I never really.

46
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,260
If you could.

47
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:56,970
Your. The.

48
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:11,170
You know, I don't know.

49
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:26,800
Yeah. Yeah. We?

50
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,060
I'm not going to be the apples and oranges in the mountains.

51
00:16:48,820 --> 00:17:04,840
That's not right, because not everybody wants to.

52
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:24,670
Yeah. Let's do that. I saw that.

53
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:56,440
President. But.

54
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:33,140
Think. That's where.

55
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:51,550
Good. But I.

56
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:18,050
We're gonna need. Is there anything?

57
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:47,400
I didn't. We're still.

58
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,820
I was no secret.

59
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,960
Or are people ready to start going over answers or do you need more time?

60
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,080
Are people going to start going over answers? Okay.

61
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:49,149
So it says we're looking at a cross-sectional study which was conducted in 5861 Mexican Mexican subjects aged 11 to 24 years to

62
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:58,600
investigate the Association of Sociodemographic and Behavioral Characteristics with the Seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection,

63
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,800
a stomach infection involved in the ideology of gastric ulcers and cancer.

64
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:09,040
So it says seropositivity to H pylori was defined as having antibody blood levels greater

65
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,410
than one in a sample that was collected on the same day as questionnaires were administered.

66
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:31,090
And it tells you the distribution distribution of participants for age groups 11 and 14, 15 to 17 and 18 to 24 was 2478 2163 and 1220 respectively.

67
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:41,860
And then the number of participants with positive H. Pylori tests for the same groups was respectively 1007, 1052 and 730.

68
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:49,510
So Part A asks What is the prevalence of H. Pylori sero positivity in the study population overall?

69
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,830
So does anyone want to share how they got the prevalence overall?

70
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah. So what did you end up with? Yeah.

71
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,690
So to look at the prevalence of H pylori, we want to look at what is the probability of the outcome.

72
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:35,980
So if we look at the probability y equals one, we know our outcome is the seropositivity for h pylori.

73
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,960
And they tell you for the different age groups you have.

74
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:49,540
1007 in the 11 to 14 age group.

75
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:07,460
You have 1052 in the 15 to 17 age group and you have 730 in the 18 to 24 age group.

76
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:12,480
And then you're just going to divide that by your total population. So combine that.

77
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:38,190
2478 in your 11 to 14 age group, your 2163 and your 15 to 17 age group and your 1220 and your 18 and 24 age group.

78
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:51,790
So if you divide that out, you should get. 0.4.476 or 47.6% for your prevalence overall.

79
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,620
So a lot of times you'll see a prevalence of this percent's either.

80
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,360
Either is fine. Perfectly fine. Yeah.

81
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,510
So then for part B, it asks, Is this a point or a period prevalence?

82
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:27,210
Does anyone want to see what they got? Point.

83
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,520
Yeah. So it's a point prevalence because they tell you that they h.

84
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,630
Pylori antibody levels were collected on the same day that the questionnaires were administered and so that they were,

85
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,770
they got their age, the exposure at the same time that they had their antibody levels collected.

86
00:24:46,770 --> 00:25:02,940
So it's going to be a point prevalence. So then first see it says set up a table with a data provided in describe the Association of age with H.

87
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:08,560
Pylori Seroprevalence using prevalence, identify exposure and outcome variables.

88
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,680
Describe the Association in terms of direction and shape and magnitude or other strength,

89
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,300
using absolute measures of association and relative measures of association.

90
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:23,130
So I think we already identified our exposure as age.

91
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,250
And so that's going to be your categorical ordinal variable.

92
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,570
So you're going to have three exposure groups.

93
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,700
Your outcome is going to be the pa h pylori SEROPOSITIVITY and that's that dichotomous.

94
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:46,500
Either they have the outcome or they don't. So then why does anyone want to come up and set up a table for everyone?

95
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,910
Probably won't have any takers, but thought I'd ask.

96
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:05,940
Okay. So I can set it up. So we're going to do a two by three table since we have three exposure exposure

97
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,060
groups and then we have our outcome as dichotomous so we can set it up.

98
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:41,159
So we can have or equals zero category, which we're going to say is age 11 of 14 or eight equals one category is going

99
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:50,310
to be age 15 to 17 and we're going to have our equals two category is age.

100
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:04,000
1824. So then we'll have.

101
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,840
Y equals one. So those who are positive for H.

102
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:22,790
Pylori and. Those who don't have a positive test for H.

103
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Pylori. And then we'll have our problem totals.

104
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,570
So it tells you that the number of participants with positive H.

105
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,000
Pylori tests for the age groups or 1007 for the youngest age group.

106
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:48,870
It's 1052 for the middle age group and then 730 for the highest age group.

107
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,890
And then they tell you the exposure group totals.

108
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:01,710
So we know there are 2478 people in the age 11 to 14 group.

109
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:11,670
There is 2163 in the age 15 to 17 group and then 1220 people in.

110
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:28,170
Our 18 to 24 age group. So then if you wanted, you could go back and subtract the total minus those who are positive to get those who aren't,

111
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,690
who are negative for the H pylori. So if you fill it in, you should get.

112
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:45,450
These numbers. So then that is our table between age and age.

113
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:53,040
Pylori Infection. So then we can go and calculate, calculate our prevalence in each of the age groups.

114
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:01,980
So we're looking at the probability of the outcome given their age, 11 to 14.

115
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:20,660
And does anyone want to share what they got for that? I think that's a different for the highest age group.

116
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,640
Yeah. So it should be the 1000.

117
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,460
Seven divided by the total population for that specific age group.

118
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:41,780
So 2478. So that should be 40.6%.

119
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:51,940
So then we can find the prevalence so of the outcome among those who are 15 to 17.

120
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,610
And that should be a similar calculation. Does anyone want to share what they got?

121
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:24,600
Yeah. So that should be the 1052 people who are seropositive in that age group divided by the total population for that age group.

122
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,950
So that should be 48.6%.

123
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:43,260
Then we can do that for the final age group. And that should get you.

124
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,320
59.8% prevalence for that age group.

125
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,760
So then based on this, we can say what the direction and shape of our association is.

126
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:16,720
Does anyone want to give it a try? So first off, we'll go with direction.

127
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,550
Do we have a positive or an inverse association? Yeah.

128
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:31,040
So it's positive. So you have 40.6% in the equals zero category versus 59.8%.

129
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,930
And you see it's increasing as age increases.

130
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:42,910
The prevalence also increases. So then for the shape, does anyone want to see what the sharpest.

131
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:51,890
We have linear monotonic, strictly monotonic, non monotonic.

132
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:09,910
So in this case, it's going to be strictly monotonic. But because in between each of the exposure groups, it's increasing.

133
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,090
So from 40.6% to 48.6% to 59.8%.

134
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,710
But they're not all equal increments for the increases.

135
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:37,570
So it's going to be strictly monotonic. So then we can describe the association in terms of magnitude using absolute measures and relative measures.

136
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,880
So does anyone want to share how they did that?

137
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:00,770
Yes. Yeah.

138
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,080
Yeah. So you're going to pick one group as your reference group.

139
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:13,549
So most of the time you'll pick your lowest exposure group and then you'll subtract the

140
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,970
prevalence in your lowest exposure group from your two a equals two and equals one groups.

141
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:26,060
So for. Absolute measure.

142
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:44,180
We're looking at a prevalence difference. And so we can look at the probability of the outcome among those in the highest age group.

143
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:50,989
And then we're going to subtract the prevalence of the outcome in our reference group.

144
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:59,750
So we pick that as our youngest age group. So then we found those in the previous slide, so we can just subtract them.

145
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,750
And we'll do that also for the non of middle age group.

146
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,420
So then that should be our. Prevalence differences.

147
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:35,750
So then we can also do our relative measures. So does anyone want to say what they did for to calculate the relative measures of association?

148
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:59,610
Yeah. So you can kind of compare any of them.

149
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,550
So like if you're going to actually interpret what this means.

150
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:12,910
So for the top one, you're comparing the probability of the outcome in your highest exposure group compared to your lowest exposure group.

151
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,700
So you can say the prevalence of H.

152
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:28,330
Pylori is 19.2% access and those who are in the age 18 to 24 group compared to those in the age 11 and 14 age group.

153
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:38,380
You can also do the same with the second one. So that would just be the prevalence of H pylori is 8% in access among those in

154
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:44,470
the age 15 to 17 age group compared to those in the age 11 to 14 age group.

155
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,580
So either those interpretations would be acceptable.

156
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,510
So. Should you include all of them?

157
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:16,540
Yeah, you should. So then back to the relative measures of association.

158
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,960
Does anyone want to say how they calculated those?

159
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,100
Yeah. So we're going to look at prevalence ratios now.

160
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,020
So our relative measure is our prevalence ratio.

161
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,210
And like what was said, we're just going to instead of subtracting equivalencies, we're going to divide them.

162
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:10,290
So then these would be our relative measures of association and a similar interpretations to before.

163
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:26,190
We could say that the prevalence of H pylori is 1.47 times higher in those in the 18 to 24 age group compared to those in the 11 to 14 age group.

164
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,930
We could also say the prevalence of H.

165
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:39,570
Pylori is 1.2 times higher in the age 15 to 17 age group compared to the 11 to 14 age group.

166
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,490
So then part D it says provide two non causal explanations for the association.

167
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,880
Yeah. How do you do this? It's like.

168
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:14,340
Yeah. So I mean, like in the literature, a lot of people use ratio measures and,

169
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:20,189
and explain those either is correct prevalence difference or prevalence ratio.

170
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:26,519
It's kind of that however you want to present your data and what makes more

171
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:34,320
sense in terms of the data and like in terms of if you want to like interpret,

172
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:40,950
you know, the probability of the highest age group versus the lowest age group or the middle age group with the lowest age group,

173
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:49,000
you can kind of interpret any of them. Whichever makes the most sense for presenting the data.

174
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:07,130
So then back to Part D, did anyone come up with any non causal explanations?

175
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,389
Yeah. Yeah.

176
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:25,080
So you're looking at H. Pylori infection.

177
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,830
So if you have like a test that's testing the positivity,

178
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:37,020
you'll see increased prevalence in older age groups just because they're accumulating accumulating new infections as they age.

179
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,000
So yeah, your prevalence would increase with the higher age groups versus the lower age groups.

180
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,400
You could also have if you're looking at H.

181
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,240
Pylori tests, it could just capture fewer cases in the younger age group versus the older age group.

182
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:11,429
That would lead to a higher prevalence of H.

183
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:15,420
Pylori in them in that higher age group versus the lower age group.

184
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:22,110
You could also look at reasons for why the two or the groups might not be exchangeable.

185
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:32,340
So there is not exchange ability. There could be something you see more in the younger children versus the older adults.

186
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,390
So like say something like living in crowded crowdedness.

187
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,349
Adults are more likely to live with more people.

188
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:47,750
So that could represent a reason for not exchange ability between the groups.

189
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:58,800
So you could kind of come up with many reasons for why the prevalence might be different depending on the age group.

190
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,990
So then that should be all the questions for the in-class exercise.

191
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,360
Are there any questions about this before we end?

192
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:30,410
My it's not lifetime prevalence which is like what is lifetime processed.

193
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:36,410
Okay. Yeah. So like he uses the example of birth defects.

194
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,180
So you either have a birth defect at birth or you don't.

195
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,900
So it's not something you can get later in life.

196
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,030
So that represents a lifetime prevalence because there aren't going to be new cases.

197
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:58,860
And so that point prevalence is also kind of like your lifetime prevalence because you can't get new cases the same.

198
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,620
Yeah.

199
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:13,460
So like they can be the same again if someone has like the outcome you're looking at and say there's like a specific age they can develop it beyond.

200
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:20,390
So if you take that prevalence at that time point, beyond that, there can never be any new cases.

201
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,379
So then that's kind of like your point prevalence you take at that point in time is kind of

202
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,580
your lifetime prevalence because your prevalence is never going to increase or decrease.

203
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,120
It's going to be the same at that time point. Yeah.

204
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:43,200
Does that make sense? Yeah.

205
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:49,340
I mean, yeah.

206
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:58,710
So if you think it's like your dad. Yeah.

207
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,640
So in this case, I have no idea.

208
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:10,870
You don't want something, you say something.

209
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:24,000
I think it's good that it's no longer related to.

210
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,050
You know, like through the happening.

211
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:41,180
Yeah. So that's. So I was like, I love you.

212
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:51,400
And I, you know, so I.

213
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:03,910
So, like, what do you think is like. Yeah.

214
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:41,420
Yeah. So, like, so, I mean, like I said, looking at what people are testing and it's more like, okay for you and me, but this is different.

215
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:53,090
And like, yeah, so, you know.

216
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:02,450
Right. Yeah. Like, yeah.

217
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:11,630
So it sounds like it's because you're thinking that, you know, so you don't know.

218
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,060
Oh, that's up to you.

219
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:29,089
So you really, you don't have that kind of an aggregate score to actually talk about then?

220
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:44,970
Yeah, not only is it kind of like this from not being able to have a talk, right?

221
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,470
Yeah. So, yeah. So I guess.

222
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,190
Yeah, I think you just want to. Yeah.

223
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:59,420
So it's, it's so it's like between, huh.

224
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:04,010
Yeah. It's the percent increase.

225
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:11,090
Yeah. Each group. But they're not increasing things, but they're still increasing.

226
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:20,340
So that's because they're increasing by the same strictly monotonic they're increasing anyway.

227
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:31,070
So like that's one in 8% and then it goes the 11.2% versus one it is, some of them are increasing in the summer.

228
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,510
So that's another age.

229
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:43,730
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:53,120
That's monotonic and then that's monotonic increase in between something.

231
00:48:53,960 --> 00:49:12,570
But over time you still have okay so like it would be like 0%, 2% for example, if you have like zero before and then you're like,

232
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:44,600
yeah, you said you didn't think it was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

233
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:53,910
Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:07,290
Has. I got a little more serious.

235
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:17,400
Look, you don't have to be like this, okay?

236
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:24,300
I mean, you can see if this was going to work. My own view is that you cannot treat it.

237
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,280
Yeah. So, like, would you say that that would be lifetime? Yeah. So you treated year?

238
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:42,270
Yeah. Oh, yeah. So that you can call to let me give you an example of that.

239
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,000
This was such an easier philosophy. It was very confusing.

240
00:50:50,680 --> 00:51:25,610
Oh. I know the explanation.

241
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,280
Yeah. So that's why he's on this. Yeah.

242
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,440
So the second one, we are all confused.

243
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,220
So, like, one of the other reasons, I mean, so like,

244
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:43,510
I think one of the other explanations I gave was if you have a test and you're testing for this

245
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:51,860
antibodies and if the tests say we're more sensitive for a certain age for like younger kids,

246
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,880
so like it be more likely that it's not detecting antibodies in younger kids versus older adults.

247
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:06,680
So that could be a non causal explanation of why those prevalence are different depending on what the person's ages,

248
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:14,360
because the kids are more likely to test positive because the test is more sensitive to that age group.

249
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:27,309
Does that make sense? So why this? We are less likely to doctor the prevalence of lower yeah in and yeah because we did a positive

250
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:32,240
association the prevalence is lower in the younger age group versus the higher age group.

251
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:48,920
So what's the relationship between the lower prevalence and the most sensitive?

252
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:57,070
So if you have something that's more sensitive and it's more likely to detect that antibody,

253
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:03,580
you're going to probably have a higher prevalence in that age group versus if the test wasn't as sensitive.

254
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:12,830
I mean, all these are kind of hypotheticals. The reason why the prevalence are different, but only have one.

255
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:26,120
Yeah. Okay. Cool. So I mean, you can kind of come up with a lot of reasons why in theory, the probabilities can be different.

256
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:40,170
That was just one of the examples of why that prevalence is could be different in terms of been more strongly.

257
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:47,309
Yeah. So that gets back.

258
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:55,650
It's not exchange ability so that overcrowding this variable is not the same in the different age groups.

259
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:59,340
So that could affect the prevalence.

260
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,989
You could think of like examples like diet or something like different age group.

261
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:10,110
People have different diets so that they're not going to be everyday people in terms of diet.

262
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:17,489
So you're not going to have a causal interpretation. So you can kind of come up with different reasons why the prevalence is might be

263
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:29,550
different depending on what their ages test positive and is also relevant to

264
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:43,379
the critics and also the ages is also and drivers it is a combined yeah well

265
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:50,760
if you're doing sliders then you're saying like in your dad I yeah I got it.

266
00:54:50,910 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah. But it's not called out so it can be a plausible explanation.

267
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,340
Yeah. I guess you could say that older adults are more likely to be diagnosed with gastritis first as a kid.

268
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:14,570
Probably isn't. So that could be an explanation of why that that's a higher priority.

269
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,770
So yeah. Think.

270
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:35,920
Yeah. Yeah.

271
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,760
Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:55:48,340 --> 00:56:04,420
Yeah. So, yeah, so it seems think about the U.S. So let's say the prevalence of the decade among those is 1.5% or less so in this age group.

273
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,580
So instead. Yeah. So. Wind Direction Association or.

274
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:21,450
Yeah. So it'd be inverse because higher exposure is related to lower prevalence of outcome.

275
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:29,040
Yeah. So that makes sense. Really?

276
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:36,130
Yeah, I think so.

277
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:47,209
Oh do we also. I think I do want to know denominator.

278
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:51,350
So your prevalence quite prevalent at the beginning of the year,

279
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:59,390
it's going to be how many people have that outcome at that time divided by the population.

280
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:07,830
So we'll be able to decide just in terms of.

281
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,170
So you're going to get a so this is going to get you a.

282
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:24,610
And that's. Your prevalence, if you want it per 1000, you're just going to multiply it by 1000 and then that's your prevalence per.

283
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,480
Yeah. Just to get it on a different scale.

284
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:43,680
Instead of just. I said, it's just, you know.

285
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:52,390
So then, yeah, you're looking at a point of prevalence, which is still the total number of cases divided by the total population at that point.

286
00:57:53,160 --> 00:58:04,430
So it would be, yeah, so if you have 80, so if you have that same 80 cases at that time point population.

287
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:14,320
So it's enough to speak for the public at the most the weakest.

288
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,700
So it's going to be everyone in the hospital at that time.

289
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,060
We're going to see what it could be out there.

290
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:31,490
These are the numbers. And then somewhere down. Die doing nothing.

291
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:38,800
So they knew what they were. With Y equals one at that times.

292
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:50,970
So you do. So we don't have to think about. But the total population, yeah, it would be that population at the end of the year.

293
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,420
But we have to change. And in this case, we.

294
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:03,820
No, I guess it doesn't say. Yeah. No, I think.

295
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:20,070
Do that. There will be some sandwiches.

296
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:28,510
The solution to. They cleaned out.

297
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:36,130
I am here to see. Either you.

298
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:49,260
I'm watching people. I can only imagine myself.

299
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:58,900
Yeah. I mean, basically, it's an infection and you can't get.
