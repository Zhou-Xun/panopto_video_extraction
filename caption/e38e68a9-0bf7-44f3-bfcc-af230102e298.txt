1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:10,690
And so that was a fantastic summary of this week's reading.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:21,760
So this week we're really going to focus on the two idea or maybe the main idea that's going to come back this week that we talked about.

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:32,580
The idea of earlier in the term is around the distinguishing features of distinguishing what is the diagnostic criteria and what you're stressing,

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,920
right. Reliable estimates right there.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:43,080
All our only purpose is to provide reliable estimates from what we really care about, which is like what is depression?

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,889
What is the truth of that syndrome? How do we understand that?

7
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:56,580
And so that readings that consensus that that Joe Gallo did, which was sort of a beginning,

8
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:05,370
like if you took the criteria of major depressive episode and and sort of relaxed them using this late variable approach,

9
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,049
then you can identify depression among older adults.

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:16,590
But the criteria themselves are limiting our ability to actually identify that appropriately because of this requirement of dysphoria.

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,549
We're going to talk about the Kleinman article on Wednesday.

12
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,280
That's all we're going to talk about is is around measuring context and how that relates to the expression of depression.

13
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,930
And and then the paper that I did with Leaming on that trying to estimate passive suicidal ideation,

14
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,400
you know, it was important because for two things.

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:47,940
First, it illustrates that suicidal ideation or suicide deaths or suicidal attempts are not limited to people who have depression.

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,409
And yet the way that we measure things, the way we measure suicide in most studies,

17
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,280
is among those people who already have screened into some depression scale.

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,049
And so there's this assumption that the only people that we need to ask about

19
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,340
suicidal ideation are those who are who've already told us that they have sex.

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,049
And we can empirically show that is not true. It's also you can empirically show it lots of different ways,

21
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:17,020
like this TED Talk example of a person who was not experiencing or at least expressing symptoms of depression or the example of that.

22
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,160
But only 3% of their medical records had ideation reports.

23
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,600
Right? So these are all sources of measurement error that are preventing us from doing the thing that we're hoping to do, which is prevent suicide.

24
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,129
So I guess so today we're really this week is really going to be about this idea of challenging the validity of diagnostic criteria,

25
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,520
but doing it in a, in a systematic way. So today we're going to talk about depression.

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,020
I'll answer questions about the recorded lectures on society disorders.

27
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,120
And then we're going to spend probably half the class in small groups doing this depression quest activity.

28
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,470
So if you haven't had time to mess around with it, don't worry. You're going to spend time during class.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,760
You do have a discussion board, post a site, small group assignments that that is due on Fridays based on this activity on Wednesday,

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,330
where I talk about cultural influences on the expression of distress. And just as a reminder, your annotated bibliography is due next week.

31
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,390
So so let me start off by just let's review what the diagnostic criteria are for

32
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,250
depressive disorders and specifically as we talk about major depressive disorders today.

33
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,110
So the first is major depressive episodes. This is the criteria from the DSM.

34
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,360
So you have to have at least five of the following nine symptom groups.

35
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,480
So a symptom group is, for example, number four.

36
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
So this is the symptom, usually sleeping disturbances. So it doesn't.

37
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:47,300
So if I was when I was looking at these criteria for the first time, I thought, this is very strange, like insomnia or hypersomnia.

38
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,410
But the purpose, the way to think about it more broadly is just sleeping disturbances.

39
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,370
So that's that's a better that is the symptom group.

40
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:03,170
And the way that those disturbances might be expressed, for example, is in having trouble following your sleep,

41
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,400
having trouble staying asleep, waking up earlier than you want to and falling asleep sooner than what you want to.

42
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,800
The point is, it's sort of like there's there's it's an indicative of some kind of physiologic thing that's happening with sleep.

43
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:23,120
So you've got five of these nine symptom groups and at least one of them must be these to stop one of these two start symptoms.

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,089
So the first is the sadness or dysphoria. Okay.

45
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:35,899
This is the criteria that Joe Gallo illustrates is systematically under assessing the presence of depression among

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,090
older adults because they're systematically less likely to endorse this symptom at the same level of depression.

47
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,280
And the second item is marked disinterest in activities.

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,859
This is referred to as anhedonia. And I'll illustrate all this in a better in a minute.

49
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,710
But that's the other syndrome. You have to have one of those two and then at least four others from this list.

50
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,960
And a major depressive episode is one of these at last at least two,

51
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,829
two weeks and major depressive disorders just having more than one major depressive episode.

52
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,470
So there's nothing on top of this. This disorder literally just means more than one depressive episode.

53
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,989
There's also a minor depression. So this is you know, this used to be called sub syndrome, all depression.

54
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,920
And then they say maybe this is a better term because it's still a syndrome.

55
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,050
But now you have at least two. Sorry, that's a typo. At least two, but less than five.

56
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,030
And many of the same criteria of these, what we call the cardinal symptoms, lies with the stars.

57
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:43,340
Like at least one of those two must be present. And then we have dysthymia, which is depressed mood for more days and not for at least two years.

58
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:49,610
And you have to have at least two of these symptom groups. And then this is what we kind of refer to as this like exclusion criteria.

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,760
You can't have developed depression during that two year period.

60
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,220
So for example, in the in the example of this TED talk, this person, her husband, may well have been experiencing this for this time.

61
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,400
That is kind of low mood or these types of or sorry, these types of symptoms for a long period of time.

62
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,810
But it never sort of came together in an episode of depression.

63
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,790
And so those, you know, I mean, that is the description, like if you went to the DSM.

64
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,629
But I find that's kind of hard to imagine.

65
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,670
And so, I mean, some of you may have experience horror, but for those of you who haven't, I think this is a helpful way to illustrate this.

66
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:31,270
Just from brushes, hyperbole and a half, how many of you read comics I highly recommend?

67
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,590
It's good I have read our new one. Is it good? You may not so like solutions and other problems or something.

68
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,030
So this is, you know, her describing it essentially.

69
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,259
And it's like, what does it mean to not it doesn't mean to psychomotor retardation.

70
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,409
Right. What does it mean to not be able to write? And here she is.

71
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,950
She's describing her experience of stop at stopping. Stop right now.

72
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:02,120
Stop. You know, what is her experience?

73
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,150
This to me is the best description I've ever seen of Anhedonia.

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,319
So coming across the talk, no matter what is happening,

75
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,030
whether it's sunshine or birthday or sounds or not sound or here are spiders, everything is spiders.

76
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,250
Her expression is is unchanged.

77
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:23,450
This would be an example of Antonio that is lack lack of motivation, lack of responsiveness.

78
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,819
This here is the idea of guilt.

79
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:37,790
Right? And this is for hitting oneself like this. This which he's describing here and how it's related to her is not inability to to do things.

80
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,689
So this is what would be able to say passive suicidal ideation.

81
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,440
This is this is a great example of that. So I don't necessarily want to kill myself.

82
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,370
I just want to be dead.

83
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:56,629
Some people will report, for example, like just sort of not like a wake up call to be able to identify passive suicidal ideation.

84
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,040
So and you can argue whether this is how passive this.

85
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,920
Right. This is necessarily passive.

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:11,329
But I think it just when you hear those words, it's hard to kind of know exactly what how that actually becomes embodied in the world.

87
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:20,809
And these are I think her memoir is a great way to to understand that it's so and as her memoir describes,

88
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,910
nobody just kind of wakes up one day and they have depression. Right?

89
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:31,580
That's not how it works. And instead, what we know is that the symptoms of depression, both are nonspecific to the syndrome.

90
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,690
That is lots of there's lots of reasons why it might actually be problems like you might have a test,

91
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:44,120
you might have knee pain, you might have, you know, a roommate that doesn't respect your your sleep schedule, whatever.

92
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,759
But there's lots of reasons why you might have these problems. So there's very few longitudinal.

93
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,409
So the point is they're nonspecific, but also it doesn't all come at once.

94
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,190
So even though most depression is coming on the heels of a major life stressor, that doesn't mean it's coming on.

95
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,190
If that doesn't mean it was sunshine and rainbows and then sadness and then depression, right?

96
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,959
So instead what tends to what we want and this is data from this longitudinal data from the Baltimore ACA study.

97
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Remember, that's our Framingham study. So this is following people for 25 years.

98
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,900
This is at their 13 year follow up. So let me orient you to the graph here.

99
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:30,610
Every person this graph is limited to 63 cases of people who developed major depression between baseline in the first follow ups.

100
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,990
So nobody had depression at baseline. 63 of those people developed depression at some point during the follow up period.

101
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,350
The X axis is, is and each of these symptoms of depression.

102
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,330
Remember back to when we did our depression scale, like if you did this test or if you did the kill.

103
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,080
So this is a different instrument, but this is remember that.

104
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,830
So this is asking people, did they have that symptom?

105
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,400
And then this instrument, which is called the diagnostic interview schedule, asked people, when did that symptom start and when did it end?

106
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:08,959
Okay, so for every symptom. So it's different than what you use when you used to just ask about the symptom that it happens every symptom on here.

107
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,620
We asked people, did that thing happen? And if so, when did it start and when did it end?

108
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,620
Okay. So we've got all the symptom groups, the X-axis. Here is is the time,

109
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:28,550
the time between that depression happening when that when all the symptoms came together to meet criteria for a major depressive episode.

110
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,110
And the time that that symptom first started. Okay. So if you can imagine for somebody.

111
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:50,709
So if their depression starts at age 20, this dysphoria symptom here on average that that first line there is just indicating five.

112
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,440
It's just an easy thing to look at. So that in this case, that sadness item.

113
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:06,910
So if the depression happened here it dysphoria for most people had started about five years prior to that depression.

114
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,310
Right. So that's the way to look at this chart that the that each of these symptoms I'm asking.

115
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:18,130
Okay, when did that dysphoria start? And this is a busker, a box and whisker plot.

116
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,150
So the vertical line within each box is the median.

117
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,660
So what the other way to think about it is that the closer something is to zero, it's closer.

118
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:37,270
This line is to zero. This line in the box, it means the closer in time that symptoms started to when the Depression two really came together.

119
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:45,910
So for thinking problems, okay. So for concentration problems, if you had that symptom, 54 of the 63 people did.

120
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,640
It almost always happened about one year, about one year before the Depression started.

121
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:02,590
Okay. So 50% of people have. So the other way to kind of understand that, it's like, okay, well, sadness is pretty common, right?

122
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,570
But like having trouble thinking like kind of feeling like your brain's chunking, like that's less common.

123
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,489
And when it happens, it's much more closely in time ending.

124
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,340
And it's indicating that you're like, some of the depression is going to start because when does depression start?

125
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,860
Or whether you're closer to meeting diagnostic criteria than if you just happened to be experiencing sadness.

126
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:32,020
The other thing you can see is the number at the end of each of these whiskers is the number of people out of 63 who endorsed that symptom.

127
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,429
So numbers that are closer to 63 indicate that symptom was far more common.

128
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,840
So which is the most other than anhedonia or sorry, other than sadness, which is the most common?

129
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,970
What are the most commonly experienced symptoms by people? And they experience depression.

130
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,670
Sleep sleep problems. What's an ambassador to America their.

131
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,440
So 62 out of 63 experience sleep.

132
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:11,130
56 out of the 63 experienced appetite problems either eating, having very suppressed appetite or wanting to eat more than usual.

133
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,260
54 out of the 63 felt I had these thinking problems.

134
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,890
49 out of the 63 had suicidal thoughts.

135
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:29,400
Okay. So you can also sort of tell that these feelings like the psychomotor retardation and agitation and feeling worthless were less common about.

136
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,070
I mean, but it's still occurred about half the time.

137
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:38,470
So it's not it's but it sort of helps you get a better understanding of when depression is happening.

138
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,540
What are people actually experiencing in it during that depression?

139
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:55,220
Questions about this. So this is this is following people over time.

140
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,740
Now, these are same people. They've been followed for another 13 years.

141
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,500
Now, this is the 25 year follow up. So now the question is, okay, well, given that you had so this is coming into the depression,

142
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,200
that this is these are the symptoms you're experiencing prior to getting to meeting diagnostic criteria.

143
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,830
Now you've met diagnostic criteria.

144
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,330
What's the probability how long does it take you to until you don't meet diagnostic criteria anymore?

145
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,740
Okay. So basically, how long does it take you to recover from a depressive episode?

146
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:31,720
And so the x axis here is time. The clock starts ticking the the day or the year that you meet diagnostic criteria.

147
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,790
Okay. So then the question is how long until you no longer meet diagnostic criteria?

148
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,930
The Y axis here is the is the proportion of cases that are the proportion of people who are still a case at that given time.

149
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,070
So if I go out to 50,

150
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:52,030
that means 50% of people who had a depressive episode are recovered by this point because they no longer meet diagnostic criteria.

151
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,249
And we'll talk about what that actually means, recovery. But anyway,

152
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,729
the point is that they don't actually meet diagnostic criteria anymore because they

153
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,540
don't have as many symptoms or the symptoms are too severe or it's not impairing them.

154
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,310
Okay. So that's that's important.

155
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:12,250
So you can see it takes about 50% of people who meet criteria for depression no longer meet criteria for depression within five years.

156
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,990
You can go out at almost 75% within five, but within within three 50%.

157
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,010
Okay. This is recurrent.

158
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,270
Okay, so now that you've recovered, what's the probability you have a second episode?

159
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,190
Okay, so now the clock has started ticking. When your.

160
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,770
You have been recovered. Okay. So the people that.

161
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,950
The only people who get to go into this next chart are people who recover on this chart, which also is most people.

162
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:52,330
All right. So if you notice this y axis, most people, I mean, you might need to go out 15 years, but they they have recovered from that depression.

163
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,009
So what's the probability of a second episode or more? Right.

164
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:07,300
But this is just time to the next episode. And the answer is that 50% of people will will go at least a decade without having a second episode.

165
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,650
Okay. So the time so the proportion here is like the proportion that have not had a recurrence.

166
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,530
Okay. So the closer to one is what we what we want. Now that.

167
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,800
So let me let me summarize one more time. So you given that you meet criteria for major depression.

168
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:36,050
50% of people have recovered by about three years and about 75% have recovered by about seven years by about five or six years.

169
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,780
Given that you recovered, the probability that you have a second episode is about you within ten years is about 50%.

170
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,770
It's about 50% recurrence within the decade, given that you were covered.

171
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:01,919
Now, of course, the way that we're defining recovery or recurrence in those two charts is through

172
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,340
those diagnostic criteria that I just told you about at the beginning of class.

173
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,700
So that means you no longer meet these criteria.

174
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:21,520
So you might have. Four of the nine symptom groups and you would see would be recovered by this definition, or you could have seven of these things.

175
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,299
But if none of them were sadness or N.A.T.O. You are also recovered, right?

176
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,629
Because you can't have depression unless you've got one of these two symptoms. Okay.

177
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,800
So you can see the artificial ness of this definition of recurrence or recovery.

178
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:47,020
So this is work that I did with a student that was specifically trying to kind of understand better what it meant to recover from depression.

179
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,960
And as we're going to talk about in a little bit later in this lecture,

180
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:58,390
most people who have meet criteria for major depression have also met criteria or will meet criteria at some point for an anxiety disorder.

181
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,219
So that's the one that most people are meeting criteria for is generalized anxiety disorder.

182
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,890
And so we wanted to understand sort of like, well, what does it mean?

183
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,670
So just because I'm I'm recovered from depression, does that mean I don't does that mean I'm like sunshine and roses now?

184
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,080
Like there might be other things going on? Yeah, go ahead. I had a question about recurrence.

185
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:28,970
Is there any reason why the discrepancy between men and women is different time like how it states five?

186
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:37,750
Well, I think there's just too few cases. So in order to get into this draft, you had you had to make it through this graph.

187
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:45,129
And so you can kind of see that the line for men has got a lot fewer dips every time one of these dips is happening.

188
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,760
That's a case happening. And so I can count.

189
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:56,020
There's one, two, three, four. You know what I mean? I can actually count the number of cases, usually probably from the sample of men.

190
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,670
And you could for the women, too. But you can kind of see that like they're they're just more steps.

191
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,610
So I don't know that. And actually, I know from this paper that this difference is not statistically significant.

192
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,390
So it looks like it's not we don't know that it's meaningful.

193
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:20,150
Yeah, that's your question. So so this is the way to look at this graph is what's called a proportional Venn diagram.

194
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:31,940
So may orient you. So first of all, is the major depressive is in the pinker kind of salmon color anxiety disorder is in the bluish.

195
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:41,350
So first is the size of the circle indicates that the is is related to the prevalence of that condition in this dataset.

196
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,559
So this is a different dataset.

197
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:50,450
This is the collaborative psychiatric epidemiologic surveys, but it uses a very similar measurement schema to what I just showed you in the paper.

198
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:58,360
So the first is that there's about 1300 cases of major depression and there's a 621 cases of generalized anxiety disorder.

199
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:04,430
So this circle is has twice the area pretty much as the sample as the first the.

200
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:11,450
The second thing is that the overlap between these two circles is telling you how much.

201
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:20,320
Again, about half of the people with JD also met criteria for major depression and about a third of maybe like 25,

202
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,020
30% of people with major depression also met criteria for MPD.

203
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,850
The Remitted is people who again no longer meet diagnostic criteria when we follow them forward.

204
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,959
So in this case, I can't remember the follow up period here.

205
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:44,060
I'm forgetting. But the again, we see a little bit more remission among major depression than we do a generalized anxiety disorder.

206
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,209
And then what's helpful here is it's sort of indicating that among those who are are co-morbid.

207
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,530
That is, they meet criteria for both a much smaller proportion of those people ever admitted.

208
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:03,559
Okay. So basically that having if conditional that you have major depressive disorder or major, major cause of episode,

209
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,610
if you also have generalized anxiety disorder, that reduces the likelihood you are going to remit from MDD.

210
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,550
So for example, half of the people with major depressive tests alone remitted,

211
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,380
only a third of people with major depressive and generalized anxiety disorder remitted.

212
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:27,450
So again, it it complicates this graph, which is already sort of because it just means not meeting criteria for major depressive episode.

213
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,280
No, it doesn't mean. Well, okay, you know what I mean?

214
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,250
And it also doesn't mean that there aren't what we were and we test this in this paper, what we call residual symptoms.

215
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:44,060
So you're still experiencing a symptom, but maybe it's not as impairing or maybe it's not as frequent or what have you.

216
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:52,460
So it doesn't again, it doesn't mean fully. So I didn't tell you this, but it's true.

217
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,129
Major Preston is the most common psychiatric disorder.

218
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:01,910
About 15% of people will go on to develop a major depressive episode or major depression over the course of their life.

219
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,900
A very long prodromal period. So if you look at here, back here, so, you know, this is five years.

220
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:17,510
So for some people, for about 50% of people who go on to develop depression, their feelings of sadness have been with them for quite some time.

221
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:24,560
But other symptoms like feeling tired or sleeping problems or thinking problems or suicidal ideation,

222
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,330
these things are happening much closer in time to when a depression is actually beginning to onset.

223
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:35,479
That is, that you're about to meet diagnostic criteria. So this graph is, to my knowledge,

224
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:44,420
I've never seen another one that's as beautiful as this to try to illustrate the idea that help us understand what when a symptom occurs,

225
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:53,780
when, when might it be indicative of the beginning of something that we might try to prevent or get early intervention on?

226
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:01,400
Because, you know, as many as we'll talk about when we're more and we talk about nastiness on Wednesday,

227
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,420
there there are very you know, just because you're feeling sad doesn't mean you want to see a psychiatrist.

228
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,550
And even if you did want to see a psychiatrist,

229
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,380
it's not actually clear what they would do for you at this stage without these other symptoms coming along.

230
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,300
Right. And so it's important that we sort of have this graph in mind when we think about,

231
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,649
well, what does it mean to engage in depression, prevention or what?

232
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,450
I would actually I think that's really not useful. Instead, what we need to be talking about is what would what does it mean to engage in

233
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,609
mental health promotion and that that would be a nonspecific sort of intervention,

234
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,640
that it really wouldn't be dependent on solely on specific symptoms, but rather would be a general approach to just kind of doing business.

235
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:46,280
Okay. So about 50% of people who have depression is an episodic condition.

236
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,300
About 50% of people with major depression recover in about three years.

237
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,240
And about 50% of people who experience depression will only have one episode, at least when we follow people out to 25 years.

238
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:03,980
And that co-occurrence or comorbid anxiety reduces the likelihood of omission of people with depression.

239
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:22,819
We pause here for questions. To tell you a little bit about the epidemiology that is and you've read a little bit about this already,

240
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,130
but in terms of maybe explicit about variation by studies, these characteristics.

241
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,669
So the the way to this is data again from the National Comorbidity Survey.

242
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,630
This is this large survey of about 9000 Americans that was conducted in the early 2000.

243
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,770
If I used more recent data, it would look almost identical.

244
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,160
So there's four conditions represented here a panic disorder, a generalized anxiety disorder, major depression and alcohol,

245
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:55,760
dependance that these are just age groups and the y axis is the prevalence of lifetime prevalence.

246
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,820
Have you ever met criteria for these conditions?

247
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,500
You can see that the prevalence of if we just walked it through the blue bar,

248
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,760
the prevalence for panic disorder is highest among people in the mid thirties.

249
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:15,710
Right. And it kind of stays that way until midlife. And then we see this decline as people get older and that's true of all of these bars.

250
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,330
Okay. So now, of course, we're starting here at age 18.

251
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:27,410
This is a survey of adults, but we know that most many of are symptoms of depression and anxiety were present much earlier than that.

252
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,330
Okay. So that's the it's important to kind of understand this is a survey that was done of adults.

253
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,290
So we are truncated on the right hand side of that graph.

254
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,170
There's age groups missing there that are still represented. But what when you think about adulthood,

255
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:51,620
this is what we what we would see that is that most of the time when most mental disorders are kind of you've had it,

256
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,399
if you if you're going to develop it, you've developed it by that point is sort of in midlife.

257
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,740
And then we see this decline with older, older age, which we'll talk about in a minute.

258
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,680
This is the incidence of depression. Again, using the Baltimore U.S. study, this is again only at adulthood.

259
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,100
So the x axis here is age at onset. So this is when did that depression start?

260
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,890
And the Y axis is the prevalence or sorry, the incidence rate.

261
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:26,360
So everyone who is represented in this graph had made it into their twenties without ever having a depressive episode.

262
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,990
And now the question is, what's the likelihood that you develop depression?

263
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:36,100
So what do you see here? Tell me what you see. Yeah.

264
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,080
Oh. The incidence for women is early or early.

265
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,550
More likely to happen 34 months prior around your reporting.

266
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,030
So the peak for women is earlier than the peak for men. Good. What else?

267
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,700
This also includes postpartum depression. It would include any.

268
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,980
It would be agnostic as to the cause. But if you met diagnostic criteria.

269
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:05,860
So it could it could include postpartum depression. Good. What else do you see?

270
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:16,900
Which group has more depression? Remember back to calculus. If you were to take the interval, I know the area under the curve.

271
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,720
Which one has more area? Okay, so this.

272
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,190
I know you're like, I'm never going to use it again. You will use it. So here.

273
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,850
Right. So the area under the curves, that means there's more depression. That's another way to think about it.

274
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,030
Right.

275
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:36,170
So it's not just that the peak is earlier, but that the actual area under the curve, there are more cases of depression among women relative to men.

276
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:49,400
What else do you notice? Yes, there's that second round of second, but like another bump increase between like ages 50 to 60 for both men and women.

277
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,069
So when the way to I'll tell you the story that Bill told me.

278
00:27:54,070 --> 00:28:00,969
So when I first saw this graph. So when they I was I was still in high school when they were they were doing this work.

279
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,270
But when they saw this graph, when they saw this plot,

280
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,500
they they basically went back to their statistician and told them, like, this shouldn't be there.

281
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,990
Like you need to go to kind of figure that like nobody's seen like everybody knows depression is early life and that just kind of declines.

282
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:27,100
But this bump is there. It is real. And in the in the years that have come since then, we now have this a better understanding of why this is so.

283
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,830
A man named George ALEXOPOULOS and I think one of his papers when we talk about cognitive impairment,

284
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,569
has pioneered this idea of what's called the vascular depression hypothesis.

285
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:42,549
And the vascular depression is a depression that occurs primarily among older adults.

286
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:51,250
It is highly resistant to really any of our pharmacologic treatments, and it's occurs among people who don't report having a stroke.

287
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,290
But although post-stroke, depression is actually very common. But these are people who don't report having a stroke.

288
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:01,300
There's no medical history of them having a stroke. But if you put them in an MRI,

289
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:07,630
you can actually see white matter lesions like damage in the brain from microvascular sort of

290
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:13,090
insults that have occurred over the course of a life span that never arose to the point of a stroke,

291
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,649
like a person with symptomatic in that way. And so that's that's what we think is potentially likely happening here,

292
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:27,130
is that these are medical conditions that over the life course and this is also related to type two diabetes people.

293
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,150
When you control diabetes, that increases the likelihood of a depression.

294
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,179
So so now we do have an understanding of this,

295
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:41,950
but at the time in the in the nineties when this work was being done that had that kind of biological mechanism hadn't been articulated yet.

296
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,700
And so now we actually know that, that that what we at least we think we know what that pump is all about.

297
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:56,490
So because again, let me let me make this clear. These are people who've lived their entire life without having to depression.

298
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,000
So they've made it through. Yeah.

299
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:05,469
You're where you are. Or I am, but. And still no depression.

300
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,490
And yet. And then something happens back here. Right. And so what? That.

301
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,450
What's happening back there, if anything, these are people who are most resilient to kind of like stressors.

302
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,070
Right? Or at least they're when they when they experience stressors, they're they're coping effectively with them.

303
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:26,320
But that's the reason that this group of people are people who are not necessarily resilient

304
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,700
to the kind of biological problems that are causing that that look like depression.

305
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,580
And that's a start. And this is also probably an underestimate because what we learned about in the Gallup paper,

306
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,310
these are people who meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, which means they're endorsing sadness or dysphoria.

307
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:49,400
But Gallo said that is dramatically underestimating the number of the older adults with depression.

308
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:55,070
So you sort of can imagine that that peak, that bump is should actually be bigger if we were to relax the diagnostic criteria.

309
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:04,270
So consistent with what I just showed you. From adolescence onward, women are more likely to develop depression relative to men.

310
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,659
So you can see that this gender difference here is present.

311
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,850
Even in adolescence. We really it's really hard to get good data on people younger than age 12.

312
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,980
So I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but most most women are going to start here.

313
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,560
And you can see that that gender gap is present over the entire life course.

314
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,540
But that gender difference varies across social groups,

315
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:35,660
which is already kind of beginning to complicate the narrative that like women get sad and men do other things.

316
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,440
So this is data from the National Survey of American Life. This is a nationally representative sample of black Americans.

317
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,190
So and white Americans who live in census tracts that are at least 10% of black American,

318
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,950
which is relatively racially actually very racially integrated, because most white Americans do not live in census structure.

319
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,790
That would be the case. So the Y axis here is lifetime prevalence.

320
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:06,409
And so for African-Americans, what you see is that women are more likely to have depression relative to men like that's true for white Americans.

321
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:13,310
These again, these are non-Hispanic whites who are living in census tracts that are predominantly white, that are at least 10% African-American.

322
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,550
You can see, again, women are more likely to have depression relative to men.

323
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:26,900
But if we look at these are black Americans who themselves have migrated from the Caribbean or who self-identify as being from the Caribbean.

324
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,160
Right. So they might be second or third generation. We see no gender difference.

325
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:36,379
And the reason there's no gender difference is because men who self-identify as being

326
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,140
Caribbean black have much higher prevalence of depression relative to African-Americans men.

327
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,259
But for women, the status is the same.

328
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:52,220
Almost the prevalence is the same. But for men the difference is is is higher.

329
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,309
So again, we're going to talk more about this on Wednesday.

330
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:02,420
I just started trying to plant seeds that like I can tell you, women have more like women are more likely to have depression, but it's like that.

331
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,950
That's true as a general statement. But within specific groups, that may not always be the case.

332
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,130
Depression is more likely among people who are experiencing poverty.

333
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,070
So this is again, you can see I've got a rate by age group which is again,

334
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,260
showing you this this higher incidence as people kind of move into higher prevalence,

335
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:32,540
pardon me, as people move into my life and that the gap is greatest in midlife and smallest in younger are earlier and later life.

336
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:39,330
So, you know, that fits with our general idea around social disparities in health.

337
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,500
But there's other ways that you can think about social disparities.

338
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:52,650
And one of them is education. And depression is not more common among people with lower education in the United States.

339
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:58,229
So what I'm showing you here is the prevalence of having depression in the past

340
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,590
12 months among people in the United States who did not finish high school,

341
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,590
who finish high school, and who have some education more than high school.

342
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,070
That blue bar is almost identical across all those three of those.

343
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,919
Okay. And there is a little bit, if anything, people who are in your shoes,

344
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,250
who are trying to get more high school, have a little bit higher prevalence of depression.

345
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,740
So this is not how we think about when we think about how the social factors relate to risk of health conditions.

346
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:30,839
The way that we tend to think about it is lower status. So that's lower income, lower education, etc. are associated with worse health.

347
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,530
And that is true for depression among some things like in poverty,

348
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:42,810
but more education which gets you doesn't immediately translate into greater income,

349
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:48,810
but is certainly a correlate of greater income in adult life does not translate into lower risk of depression.

350
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,469
So but it's not what it's like.

351
00:34:52,470 --> 00:35:03,210
It is a it is it really complicates the narrative of what is it what are social disparities look like when it comes to mental health disorders?

352
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,800
This is also more complicated when we talk about race. So this is in the United States.

353
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:20,190
So non-Hispanic whites are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for major depression versus any other racial ethnic group,

354
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,399
with the exception of Native Americans in the United States.

355
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,840
So the Y axis here, non-Hispanic, white, African-American, Native American,

356
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,700
Asian-Pacific Islander and Hispanics, the y axis here is the lifetime prevalence.

357
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,780
So have you ever met diagnostic criteria for major depression like that?

358
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:45,450
12 months is going blue, that is. Have you met criteria in the past year and the yellowish bar is have you ever met diagnostic criteria?

359
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:51,890
Okay. So this the estimates for Native Americans are complicated by the fact that, you know,

360
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:59,190
this is out of all of the groups represented in this graph, this is the smallest in terms of number represented on this graph.

361
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:09,780
And they may not have they may not the data are less representative of this group because of just the way that the sampling samples occur.

362
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,940
And so, again, this this complicates or maybe doesn't complicate,

363
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:23,120
but when when people see this graph, I think it's important to sort of understand it.

364
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:32,459
You know, we think about race and ethnicity as which they are is being correlated with various indicators of social status,

365
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:39,270
whether that's access to goods, whether it's income, whether that's access, quality, education, etc.

366
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,810
So those social status that this graph doesn't, all of that is true.

367
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,330
It is also true that the graph looks like this and this is the way the graph has looked for 25 years.

368
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,170
There's some argument as to whether this graph is changing.

369
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,700
Specifically, do we see an increase in the prevalence of depression among African-Americans?

370
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:06,510
So this is this does look like to be true. There's also been a commensurate increase in the risk of suicide for African-Americans,

371
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:14,610
but that the rate of suicide among African-Americans is still orders of magnitude less than it is for non-Hispanic whites.

372
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:26,400
Orders of magnitude less. In addition, I just showed you that people living in poverty was associated with greater risk of depression.

373
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:33,150
Well, that's true in general, but it's actually not true when you look within racial ethnic groups.

374
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,610
So within African-Americans, there is no economic gradient.

375
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,980
So that's the blue line here. There is no economic gradient and prevalence of depression.

376
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:47,640
So for all economic groups, African-Americans are less likely to be experiencing meet criteria pardon me,

377
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:57,390
separate, but to meet criteria for depression. And even though four and it's still not a it's not like a steep curve for non-Hispanic whites.

378
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:05,280
But certainly we do see that the groups that are experiencing more poverty are have higher prevalence of depression than a group that has.

379
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,469
And this is data. This is older data. So this 55 K, I can't remember what this is different than poverty, right?

380
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,480
This is family, this is household income. But the point is, is that this number is less than that number.

381
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,859
This number is is a little bit less than that number, but still not very much.

382
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,750
So, again, it sort of makes the question as to, well, what what is happening.

383
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:36,690
That is either what are the additional protected processes that are represented by in this case, by this proxy variable of race?

384
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:45,310
Or what are these additional and or what are these additional risk factors for depression or suicide are important.

385
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,220
And this is true. I guess I'm going to show you, I'm showing these graphs by, um, for depression,

386
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,360
but I can, I can show this for substance use disorder and it would look identical.

387
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,959
I can show you this for anxiety disorders. It would look identical to this.

388
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,350
For suicide, it would look identical. The only condition where this would not be the case,

389
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:06,300
where it specifically where this graph would not look the same, is for post-traumatic stress disorder.

390
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:15,030
This is the only one where African-Americans systematically appear to have the same or higher risk of non-Hispanic whites.

391
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:26,380
But once again make more complicated, conditional on meeting criteria for major depressive disorder.

392
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,670
So now everyone in this graph has met diagnostic criteria for major depression.

393
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,200
All we see is that African-Americans and pretty black.

394
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:42,330
So this is data from the National Survey of American Life again, report more impairment due to their depression relative to non-Hispanic whites.

395
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,220
And so this is most evident in terms of time out of role.

396
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,500
So whatever kind of social role that the person like, you know, are you able to do the things you want to do,

397
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,330
are able to take care of your family, are able to go to work, are you able to go to school, etc.?

398
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:02,650
So we see greater impairment here. And then that is the number of days in the past 30 that you've experienced.

399
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:08,409
Time out of role. Okay. So ten days compared to three days and then productivity.

400
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,820
So this is around, you know, just being able to accomplish what you want to do.

401
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:22,630
So there it is. While African-Americans are less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder, conditional on meeting criteria,

402
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:30,730
they are more likely to experience more severe impairment from the Depression relative to non-Hispanic whites.

403
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,070
So I showed you this as well, that I told you this,

404
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:46,760
that there's this potential change even though the patch Q symptom prevalence has been the same over the next couple of days,

405
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,690
with many showing plenty more activity. Okay.

406
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,590
So I want to make sure you have time to ask the question about anxiety.

407
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:04,700
Okay. So let me just summarize here. So we get our age of onset in adulthood of 18 to 25 equals.

408
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,960
We talk about the second peak later in life.

409
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,630
The risk of depression is higher among women versus men, with the caveat that that's not true for all racial groups.

410
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:20,010
Relationship between SS and depression is nuanced. It's depression coming out of people who are poor relative to those who are not poor.

411
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,650
But it does not very substantially by education. That's people who are more educated, do not have less depression.

412
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,360
Are people more or less educated? Depression varies by racial and ethnicity that is not Hispanic.

413
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,569
Whites tend to are more likely to have major depressive or meet criteria for major depressive relative to really any other racial minority group.

414
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,100
With the exception of Native Americans.

415
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:47,460
But conditional on having major depressive racial minorities are more likely to experience or might experience role impairment due to that depression.

416
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,830
So we pause, pause. They're kind of to switch gears and ask if you have questions about anxiety.

417
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:10,930
All right. So the the shoot this is just from a you're doing your reading a paper on germs.

418
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,120
But what I like about it is this. The Y axis here is anxiety, right?

419
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:21,220
Like, this is something that everyone is, you know, is that you have at least, you know, what it's like for you to feel anxious.

420
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,370
Right. And the reason that you all know that is because this is evolutionarily conserved.

421
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:29,079
So that fear is anxiety is coming out of fear.

422
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,300
Of fear if we have fear and it is evolutionarily advantageous response to danger.

423
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,750
We talk about there being a inverted U-shaped relationship between anxiety and performance.

424
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:48,140
So this is basically where you want to be when you're trying to study for your test or take, you know, take your TS or whatever.

425
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,360
But if you're over here, then you're not able to sleep for the week before your test, right?

426
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:59,839
This is where we worry about it. So there's sort of a sweet spot where we're kind of wanting to or the anxiety that you

427
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,829
feel about whatever thing you're trying to do can actually increase your performance.

428
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:10,550
So what's the difference between fear and anxiety? So fear is unpleasant, something that arises in response to a realistic outcome.

429
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,340
Anxiety is an emotion that's similar, but it arises without any objective source of danger.

430
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,209
So it's the same system. So we're not going to go into the neurobiology of this,

431
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:27,080
but it's the same sort of parts of the brain that are relevant to fear response, that are responsible for anxiety response.

432
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,790
There's lots of different ways that anxiety operates.

433
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:35,180
I know we're not going to have time to talk about each of these, but I'll answer questions if you have them.

434
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:42,739
So we kind of try to distinguish between the different types of disorders according to these these sort of three ideas.

435
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:51,440
The first is this, that some disorders are primarily characterized by cognitive elements.

436
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,629
So this is your generalized anxiety disorder where people are worrying about lots of things.

437
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:02,240
Right. And lot and a lot of what they're a lot of their symptoms are around rumination.

438
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,809
That is, thinking about something that has happened and preoccupation that is spending

439
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,320
just a lot of time thinking about something that did happen or might happen.

440
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:13,100
Like that's that's sort of the hallmark of generalized anxiety disorder.

441
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,510
Some different anxiety disorders are primarily characterized by a behavior.

442
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:23,360
So this is avoidance. So what would be an extreme example of anxiety disorder that's characterized by avoidance?

443
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:34,790
You feel like you're distracting yourself or you like triggers or things that cause you anxiety.

444
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,730
And what would be an example of that as phobias?

445
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:44,299
Oh, yes. Right. So this is like, how am I going to get on an airplane? So I'm afraid of flying, right?

446
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,680
Or I'm not going to I don't like I'm afraid of dogs.

447
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:55,459
I'm not going to go to the dog park. Right to avoidance behavior. There are also examples of appetite disturbances and sleeping disturbances.

448
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,330
This is oftentimes it's a suppression of those that come along with them.

449
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,410
But the avoidance behavior is very distinct component of anxiety disorders.

450
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:09,319
And then finally, some anxiety disorders are marked by sort of elements of physiology.

451
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,389
So this is primarily panic attacks. So panic attacks and panic disorder, which has anti disorder,

452
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,830
is just having more than one panic attack and being anxious about having more panic attacks.

453
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:23,210
So there's nothing special about the word disorder there. It just means that you should have had more than one panic attack.

454
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:32,510
And a panic attack is a very acute episode of respiratory and cardiovascular kind of alertness,

455
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:40,760
where people you basically feel like you're being attacked and and it could come along with cognition.

456
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,419
You might be worried about that happening again, and it could also come along with avoidance.

457
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,600
So people with panic disorder often also have what's called a portfolio,

458
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,100
which is like a fear of kind of being in certain situations where it's difficult to escape.

459
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,950
So they would avoid going to like a michigan football game, for example,

460
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,610
because it's hard to imagine getting out of a stadium with 100,000, whatever million of your best friends in a tie.

461
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:10,720
Right. And the last thing I'll say or the last two things I'll say about anxiety is that when we have followed people over time,

462
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:17,389
what's if someone has both anxiety and depression, it is almost always the case that the anxiety happens first.

463
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,540
So these are people that were followed from 1987 to 1993.

464
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,020
So this is the this is the correlation and time.

465
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,780
So at the same time, what's the likelihood that you have high if you have high depressive symptoms, that you also have high anxiety symptoms?

466
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:38,120
And the answer is 24. That's very, very high. What if you have anxiety and 87, what's the likelihood you have it in 1990?

467
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,429
That's 0.72. You can notice that that's much more sticky than the depression, right?

468
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,780
So if you have Depression 87, what's like going to you have depression in 1990, that's only 0.44.

469
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:58,640
So this is showing you of that depression is a much more episodic condition that's characterized more by remittance and recurrent anxiety.

470
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:06,850
It's more sticky. And this also comes back to the argument that some people have that anxiety is less so a state and more so a trait.

471
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:13,400
Do you consider yourself an anxious person and you can answer that question yes or no, and that, you know,

472
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:20,320
there's some overlap between your answer to that and the likelihood that you will be criteria for panic or a generalized anxiety disorder, etc.

473
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:25,780
But the path I want to draw your attention to is that you're given that you have anxiety, high anxiety symptoms.

474
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:30,040
87, what's the likelihood you have high depression in 1990? And the answer here is point three.

475
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:36,820
So again, that's a correlation. It's not to put all this in perspective, your diastolic and systolic blood pressure correlated at about 2.7.

476
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,290
Something to help you understand how tight how high a correlation is.

477
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,520
There's no pass here, not because they didn't test it, but because it wasn't statistically significant,

478
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,180
which means that having depression in 87 does not predict anxiety in 1990.

479
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:57,260
And the last thing I'll say is I say this because I'm a recovered blood injury phobia.

480
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,720
So I used to. First time I found out, I guess I never knew why.

481
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,060
I knew I never liked needles. But the first time I really it all came together for me.

482
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:11,520
If I were being interviewed by one of these surveys is when I went to Claire's at

483
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,200
the mall and I was getting my upper cartilage pierced without my mother's consent.

484
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:23,879
And the girl who was probably the same age as me doesn't and I pass out.

485
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,350
But as I'm passing out, I like, oh, and I break my nails down my face.

486
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:34,680
And so I wake up and I'm covered in blood and there's like a screaming 19 year old and then a security guard.

487
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,670
And I was like, you know, this is not I don't need to do this anymore. This is not a good.

488
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,510
But the reason I passed out is because blood injury phobia is actually the only so

489
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:46,200
many people feel like they're going to pass out when you get into a scary situation.

490
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,310
But the only people who actually pass out are people in the country. Okay.

491
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:57,900
And you can see this. So this is people with blood injury phobia. This is I'm watching a video of cockroaches and the Y axis here is blood pressure.

492
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:01,650
So people have the phobia versus people don't see.

493
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:06,180
Nobody likes cockroaches. Their blood pressure goes up a little bit. So this is watching a landscape.

494
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:11,220
This is all you know, this is birds. This is you show me that scene from Pulp Fiction.

495
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,090
You know, the one. This is me. Like, did my blood pressure just go into the floor?

496
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:21,300
Right. And you can see so it's interesting that like the kind of unique kind of physiology here that at least in this case, blood.

497
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:27,509
Okay. So this is my summary slide and then we're going to get into small groups.

498
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,780
So depression, anxiety is the most prevalent.

499
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:35,400
They often do occur. And we didn't talk about this, but we'll talk about this more later.

500
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,030
In the term that treatments for depression anxiety are largely the same.

501
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:44,700
Like it's not like there's depression specific treatments and anxiety specific treatments with the exception of exposure therapy,

502
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,790
which is used for flooding or for phobias.

503
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:55,169
And in fact, the reason I was completely recovered from my from my blood injury phobia is one, I got pregnant.

504
00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:01,889
And if you've got to get a lot of blood work done when you're pregnant. And then second, I had to have multiple massive surgeries for treating cancer.

505
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,219
And that will also get you over what, injury phobia real quick.

506
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,240
So exposure therapy is very effective process.

507
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:20,910
So all right. So let me pause here for questions. All right.

508
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,840
Well, it's time to play a video game.

509
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,320
Yes. All right. I wish my ten year old was here. Yes, I'm ready.

510
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:40,710
So so on canvas is if you go to today's module, there is a link to a game called Depression The Quest.

511
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:45,180
Maybe you've heard of this game before so that depressed you.

512
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,850
Can you tell us, you know, the history of the person who developed this because we kind forgot it.

513
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:57,509
So she she was one of these sort of early people who were just like destroyed by the trolls on the Internet.

514
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:04,379
And it was like she made this game in response to her, like, negative experience of like people just being like, you don't belong here.

515
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,720
And she's like, what? So anyway, so it's, it's a, it's kind of a choose your own adventure game.

516
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:15,239
So I'd like you to you can get, you can do it by yourself if you want or you can get with a partner.

517
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:19,860
Especially, I should remind you to bring a computer so if you don't have one to partner with somebody.

518
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,110
And we're going to debrief in the last 5 minutes, if that's okay.

519
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:30,060
So I'm just going to let you help me.

520
00:51:31,870 --> 00:52:01,920
Okay. I can get see this?

521
00:52:37,380 --> 00:53:11,410
Consequently. She?

522
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,570
You don't have to be white if you want. I mean, whenever you. Sorry.

523
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:23,160
You're just different.

524
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,080
You got to be.

525
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:17,590
You just find.

526
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:25,180
She? If you.

527
00:56:37,910 --> 00:57:02,950
To make think, feel like the sixties.

528
00:57:28,950 --> 00:58:03,080
She's. Six.

529
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:23,180
Trump wants to keep.

530
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:48,360
She? She said she's.

531
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:22,030
She continues. Situations.

532
00:59:40,940 --> 01:00:12,390
Chief. She?

533
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:15,280
It's not. She falls in together in about a minute.

534
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:20,080
Just so I know you're not going to get tired or you're not going to be able to get through the whole game today.

535
01:01:29,150 --> 01:02:19,140
It. Just.

536
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,590
All right. So let's it's going to go way. We're just about at time here.

537
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:54,620
So any do you think that was really interesting that like the first option was always crossed out,

538
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,949
like the one that you would like normally do if you weren't depressed.

539
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:04,430
And like, I don't know, there were like some like parts of it where I was like, this is really real.

540
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,780
Like, I'm relating way too much to like, what's going on right now.

541
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:16,040
I think she I think she has a very effective it's very. So tell me more about that crossed out sort of where.

542
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,500
Tell me more about that sort of work. Why do you why do you think she did it in that way?

543
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:30,740
I think it goes to show that like it's like the ideal is genuinely not an option when it when you have MDD.

544
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:36,139
And like a lot of times, like for the person who's experiencing that, like, it's not like they're unaware of the option.

545
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:42,860
They're very aware of it, but it's just they simply cannot choose it, which is how it works in the game to where it's like you can see it,

546
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,310
you know, that's what you want to do and what you need to do, but like you just can't.

547
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:51,049
And you may have even heard that like someone may have said that to you. Why don't you just go for a walk?

548
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,129
Why don't you just you know what I mean?

549
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:59,450
So, yeah, I think she's the point of it's not that the person is not aware of it, you know, because she could have just not listed it.

550
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:04,950
Right. I mean, that could have been an option for her to go. That that. Other reactions to the game?

551
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:08,040
Yeah, I think also like with the press,

552
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:15,359
such as you can see that like sometimes like there are more options and sometimes I feel like when I was like playing the game,

553
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,219
there's hardly those like two teams.

554
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:24,990
You get better eventually and like I think at certain points she was getting better, like her friends, just like pretty good therapy.

555
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:29,340
And then she went but then she like, I guess it just shows kind of like the ups and downs.

556
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:41,340
It's not like just a quick fix, right? Yeah. Yeah. And I think that it's it's also sort of we'll talk a little bit more about that, that transition,

557
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,210
like why she decides to go to therapy or like how does that conversation happen?

558
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,370
Yeah. Do you think I mean, do you all think that's an effect?

559
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:54,180
That was if you got to that point, you may not depending on how you played it, she might not have done therapy.

560
01:04:54,810 --> 01:05:03,060
So. To what degree did it illustrate some of the ideas that we talked about when we said like, what?

561
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:09,390
What what are the types of things that shape whether somebody gets hurt or why they should care or to whom they go to for care?

562
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:14,850
Did you see any of those ideas represented in hers? Yeah, like social network thing.

563
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:19,770
She was able to get access to a therapist, not because she was putting in the effort to search for it,

564
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:24,030
but because their friend was like, I know someone, I can give you their number and get them.

565
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:33,290
So it was a nice way to illustrate again like that some of those ideas that we talked about earlier in class, have you heard an initial reaction?

566
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:39,400
You're going to you're all going to have to do a reflection piece of. All right.

567
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,530
Well, I will let you go. I will see you on Wednesday. And this is a reminder.

568
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:50,750
This reflection is due on Friday. Thank you for.
