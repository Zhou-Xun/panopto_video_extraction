1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,620
For for Mac users.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,130
I'm going to direct you to the virtual sites tool offered at U of M.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,590
This allows us to log into a Windows machine in order to use software that only works on Windows.

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,840
I'm going to use the virtual sites. Log in.

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,650
And I'm going to use the non GPU desktop.

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm not using a program that has needs a lot of graphic power such as Illustrator or something like that or you know, statistical software.

7
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,049
So many use the non-GAAP, you access the remote.

8
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,140
I'm going to go ahead and allow access.

9
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:14,530
You'll use your U of M log in. And now you can see I'm basically connected to a Windows computer.

10
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm just going to wait for it to do its thing because this is what I'm looking for.

11
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:44,790
I'm just looking for a standard desktop. I've already connected my Dropbox using the Kumo set up.

12
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,120
And you can see in the lower right, it's making sure that it's synched with my files.

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,050
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go down to the start menu. And I'll open a file explorer.

14
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:22,460
This is going to let me go to my U of M drop box to navigate to my files where I have the Pack 2021 program saved.

15
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,259
And there's all these supporting files.

16
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,380
But what I'm looking for is the packet XY.

17
00:02:31,450 --> 00:03:07,830
And I can double click that. So notice that I'm limited to browse for files that are on this computer.

18
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:17,380
So let me pause real quick and move a file over to Dropbox.

19
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,180
So I'm going to look at once once a. So I'm going to go back once again to my Dropbox list.

20
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,740
Where I've shared files with Dropbox.

21
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,520
And I'm going to drag that over. To the pdf you a evaluator?

22
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,460
It's going to come up with a report. With any errors.

23
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,480
Let's see. This is a little cut off, but.

24
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:15,300
That's just. I can look at the results in detail.

25
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:39,950
As you look at the error messages on this page, it will give you an error code, so to speak,

26
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:47,750
an error identifier and show you where on the page where in the document this is appearing.

27
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,090
And notice there are two categories PDF UK and WCAG WCG.

28
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,300
We are only. We are primarily focused on correcting the PDF UK items.

29
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:14,210
In the canvass site. I'm noting some of the common error messages, ones that are particularly covered in the training series.

30
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:23,660
And so to correct these items, you would again open this file in Adobe to make the corrections,

31
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,300
save it and then bring it back over to check that it's corrected.

32
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:40,360
I also have a resource if you come across a code that is not shown in the training videos.

33
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:51,820
The trainer has shared an alternate resource where we can look up and try to resolve errors if there's anything here that you're not able to resolve.

34
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:03,879
I'll have you noted on the spreadsheet item under the notes field and go ahead and share this error code just so we can be aware of.

35
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,690
Like it's it's nearly there. There was one thing I wasn't able to resolve.

36
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:23,540
I can close that when you have a clean once you've run it and fixed all of the error messages that you can, go ahead and click the PDF report.

37
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,950
And it's a it's going to upend, pack up, report to the end of the document and go ahead and save it.

38
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:55,000
And then you can. Upload those the report and the updated remediated document to.

39
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,610
Google now will say, I used Google.

40
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:13,820
I mean, I used Dropbox to share this, but you could launch a pack 2021 from Dropbox and then use reference your Google files.

41
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,000
I should have mentioned that. Navigate to the Google Files.

42
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,950
It may help if you create a shortcut for yourself in Google Drive so that you can

43
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:31,040
get to them quicker than navigating to folders that have been shared with you.

44
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,690
Let me know if I can help you get that set up.
