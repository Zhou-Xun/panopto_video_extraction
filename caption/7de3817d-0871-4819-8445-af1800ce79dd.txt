1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,140
Good morning, everyone. Look, I'm kind of sleeping in here, right?

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,200
This is probably not very conducive to a lot of us staying away from the key things here.

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:43,020
That's our only option, like. Okay. All right. So I wanted to start by just going back to our class schedule and reorienting ourselves a little bit.

4
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,420
It's not. So we're at September 22nd parade.

5
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:58,180
We've made it this far. Uh, I'm going to talk a little bit about this proposal here in a few minutes.

6
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:08,140
Our class on Tuesday, I was really excited because finally we have a class period where there's no electric component.

7
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:16,840
The goals for class on Tuesday are going to be our next exposure science and the news topic article,

8
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,980
and I'll send out an announcement later today as a reminder for that, we'll have an additional kind of integrated exercise.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,820
We'll do some breakout groups, report back outs, a little bit more on the application of the material that we've been covering.

10
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,060
And then I was going to spend the last few minutes of the class period with a little bit of an exam review.

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,600
So kind of break down what to expect on the exam in terms of format, in terms of the logistics,

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,700
how we'll actually do it, but just kind of have some open Q A as well.

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,250
The thing that we've covered so far in class, we can pull up slide decks from, you know,

14
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:00,430
from any of the previous class sessions and cover, you know, topics or any questions that you might have at that point.

15
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,730
So what it does technically well, I guess the exam review might tie us a little bit to the computer,

16
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:14,380
but we would have had some flexibility for not being in the classroom, like maybe have a class outside or something like that.

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,650
Head down to the hour. And it's almost like perfect timing, right?

18
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,940
It's the first day of fall and the temperature drops below 25 degrees.

19
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,800
So I'm not sure how appealing it's going to be.

20
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,200
I'll still keep my fingers crossed and watch the weather over the weekend in terms of the forecast for Tuesday,

21
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:39,100
if it somehow comes back around and it looks like a pleasant just by a show of hands,

22
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,020
not a commitment, but quite a show of hands that anybody be mildly interested in trying to have class outdoors if we could swing it.

23
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,400
Okay. Not everyone, but many people. So I promise I will try.

24
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,700
But we're not off to a good start with it's like 50 degrees out right now and really, really windy.

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,620
It's not raining. I guess we should be happy about that. But yeah, it's pretty incredible.

26
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:10,150
Like yesterday was the last day of summer. It's like 80 degrees. And today we move into the autumn and it's just right on time.

27
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:17,380
All right. And then I guess looking ahead, just so that we're all on the same page,

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:27,010
we'll come back around later next week on Thursday, and we'll talk about some of the regulatory framework,

29
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,360
different agencies, mostly US centric that that issue standards and have enforcement capabilities

30
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,920
around those kind of community environmental exposures that we've been discussing.

31
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,060
And then the last topic prior to our exam,

32
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:50,650
we'll be joined again by Professor Neitzel to kind of give the flip story of that from the occupational side,

33
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:57,490
what are the regulatory agencies, our standards, that and so forth with regards to occupational exposures?

34
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,309
And then we'll have our exam on the sixth,

35
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:08,500
and I promise we'll talk more about the details of that when we are when we meet again on the 27th on Tuesday.

36
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,610
Any questions, just in terms of class schedules so far?

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,969
Okay. Well, as usual, if they come up, you know, you don't need to wait until the next class to ask the question.

38
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,370
Please reach out to me over email. And if anyone's talking to me to discuss anything, I'd be happy to do so.

39
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,050
All right. So let's get into the material for today.

40
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:43,509
So we're continuing to talk about exposure assessment. In the last class period, we were talking about direct methods.

41
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:50,139
Right. Really focused on personal measurements, biomarkers, personal monitoring.

42
00:04:50,140 --> 00:05:00,730
Right. This is what we prefer if we have our choice or having the most accurate ways to assess exposure, that's not always available to us.

43
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,210
So there are other mechanisms that we kind of refer to as surrogates, surrogate estimates of exposure.

44
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,280
And the title here focuses on questionnaires.

45
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,849
We'll spend most of the class period talking about questionnaires,

46
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:22,750
but there are a few other ones that kind of fit into this category of surrogate markers of exposure.

47
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:31,790
Okay. So we'll talk through the different types and some of the applications questionnaires and some of these other methods,

48
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,360
uh, to talk about actually how to design an effective exposure questionnaire.

49
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,950
How would you go about doing that?

50
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,629
We'll talk about the different advantages and disadvantages of some of these different approaches and then talk about some

51
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,500
of the the important variables that we would consider when when choosing to utilize some of these surrogate measures.

52
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,380
Okay. Yeah. So I just basically summarize the slide about 30 seconds ago.

53
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,890
Uh, this is our preference. We would like to be up here and we're tasked with assessing exposure.

54
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,320
We would like to have personal measurements,

55
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:19,800
either through some sort of biomarker or an external personal monitoring of a person to assess their exposure.

56
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,230
These would absolutely be the best type of data for estimating actual exposure.

57
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:31,970
Just beyond that would be the area measurements. Again, we've kind of used the example of in this classroom, right?

58
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,430
If we couldn't afford to all have a personal monitor that we would wear,

59
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,660
if we had a stationary monitor that we could essentially locate in the classroom.

60
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,650
This would serve as an area. It's not a personal measurement,

61
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:55,620
but it's still a very quantified value of perhaps the concentration of a contaminant in this room that we're all going down the list of desirability,

62
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:05,129
but still useful are this other this other pretty large category of surrogate approaches to exposure assessment.

63
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,160
And we're going to step through these in quite a bit of detail.

64
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,880
So, right, we started off on Tuesday looking at these direct methods.

65
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,590
We talked through both personal monitoring, biological monitoring, the biomarkers,

66
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,549
being able to use some of this EPA modeling to help inform a little bit of what

67
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,350
may be some of the sources of a pollutant might be or a contaminant or a hazard.

68
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,899
Over here, we're going to talk today about indirect methods.

69
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,110
So everything we're talking about today would definitely be considered indirect.

70
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,260
We're going to focus quite a bit on questionnaires or perhaps diaries that people would keep.

71
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,650
These are all of them specifically. We're going to step through them one at a time.

72
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,650
We'll talk about questionnaires, interviews, diaries, observation.

73
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:12,830
So somebody's actually observing a scenario, keeping notes on a relative to your different records.

74
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,550
Proxy respondents, perhaps we can't meet with the individual.

75
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,620
We can meet with someone on their behalf.

76
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:30,140
Various information around a claimant itself can be helpful for helping to inform exposure assessment, expert evaluations.

77
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,690
We'll talk about this. And then simply just knowing information about location and proximity,

78
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,600
people relative to something else we might be concerned about is a source of a hazard.

79
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:50,450
All right. So let's dove into questionnaires. And again, most of the focus of the class period is going to be around questionnaires.

80
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,520
So so what is a questionnaire? Let's go ahead and define that.

81
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:01,040
So it's a tool that we can record or guide the recording of recalled exposures from subjects.

82
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:09,500
And for the most part, this is done within the epidemiological context, but doesn't necessarily need to be.

83
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,200
But the objectives of a questionnaire are to design a balance.

84
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,540
These are the different factors containing measurements of exposure variables that would be essential to the objectives of our study.

85
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,310
At the same trying time trying to minimize the errors and then admits.

86
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,090
And then a really big challenge. And we'll talk about some of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

87
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:43,760
One of the challenges is creating an instrument is both easy to use for an interviewer as well as a subject.

88
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:54,250
But it also provides useful information and ease of analysis and processing of that data after it's collected.

89
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,380
And oftentimes, these are working in conflict with each other in some cases.

90
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:10,510
All right. So let's talk about some of those advantages and some of those disadvantages of questionnaires on the plus side.

91
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,990
So generally quick and easy way to obtain some data, some information about exposure.

92
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,940
They tend to be, for the most part, less costly than personal measurements.

93
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:29,559
Right. I'm talking about the biomarker samples. You know, you need an expert to do blood draws or collect specimens and then laboratories,

94
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,110
right, to run analyzes and so forth, or for the personal monitoring.

95
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:44,410
Right. And inexpensive devices. I think you have perhaps direct readout of what someone's being exposed to or a questionnaire that you generally need,

96
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:53,800
perhaps some paper or perhaps some digital device, and someone who is a little bit trained in how to administer it.

97
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,230
And it can be used to estimate exposure going backwards in time.

98
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:08,340
Right. So if we're trying to assess someone's exposure at a facility or in a community over a two year time period, uh,

99
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:16,700
going out and making measurements now even we have those available to us isn't going to tell us a whole lot about the last two years.

100
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:26,020
Right. So questionnaires allow us to ask questions looking backwards in time that can help inform longer term exposures.

101
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:33,160
On the disadvantage side of things. Questionnaires tend to be a bit more qualitative.

102
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,840
Right. Whereas those personal measurements tend to be quantitative.

103
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:48,870
We end up with, uh, true values, with uncertainty associated with the, the questionnaire generally, or giving us more qualitative information.

104
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,310
Although hopefully useful, they might be prone to errors.

105
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:01,720
We'll talk about where some of those likely opportunities are for error, and they can also be difficult to validate.

106
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,090
Right. The way that you validate a measurement is by comparing it to a known.

107
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,170
In all we have available to us as questionnaires,

108
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,730
we might not actually know what the true value is to compare it to and to validate how well our questionnaire actually works.

109
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:31,190
And, you know, kind of for these reasons, oftentimes questionnaires are used in addition to other exposure assessment techniques.

110
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,780
Right. So it's not the single method that we might rely upon for assessing exposures.

111
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,440
We need to be aware an exposure assessment in general.

112
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:52,510
We need to be aware of underreporting that might lead to a bias as well as overreporting that might lead to a bias and in this case,

113
00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:03,760
specifically recall bias. So some examples of underreporting that might lead to bias are when somebody doesn't really understand the question.

114
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:12,790
Right. They might not be very knowledgeable about what they're being asked or if the

115
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,380
question is posed as being something that's viewed as being unacceptable.

116
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,140
If you answered yes to it, you would be emitting something that's perhaps not socially acceptable.

117
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,220
The example here is the self-reported smoking during pregnancy.

118
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:34,870
There can be cases of overreporting, overreporting, and in the case of recall bias.

119
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,830
So if someone with an existing condition might be more likely to report certain exposures

120
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:47,320
compared to those that don't have a disease present or some sort of condition,

121
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:56,890
it's ideally it's best to gain exposure information without knowledge of disease.

122
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,310
So an example of that would be a prospective cohort, right?

123
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:07,600
So you're starting with perhaps younger or healthier folks and then following them over a long time period and then comparing,

124
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,390
you know, what types of disease outcomes develop over time relative to the excess possible exposure.

125
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,800
And then in case control studies,

126
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:26,470
careful attention needs to be applied so that we have appropriate questions that can help to minimize this type of recall bias.

127
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,790
So the way that they're worded can actually help guard against this.

128
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,530
All right. So we're talking about these questionnaires. They have pluses. They have minuses.

129
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,200
We might use them with other methods and so forth. What actually is the questionnaire?

130
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,750
Right. What would this look like? So let's kind of talk through a little bit.

131
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,090
First, we need to decide, well, what's the point?

132
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,920
Right. We certainly don't want to ask a bunch of random questions.

133
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,290
We need to have a point to the questions. They can be really long.

134
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,709
We can might come up with, like, everything under the sun. Oh, I want to ask this.

135
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,910
And when I start, I want to ask this one, too. Pretty soon it's like a hundred pages long.

136
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:13,210
Right. The attention span of a subject for answering 100 pages worth of questions is not very good.

137
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,990
It's not going to give us very good information. So we need to have clear aims and objectives from the get go.

138
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:26,380
And we're not going to include questions just because right there needs.

139
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,800
We need to go the step through and look at our analysis plan.

140
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,780
Once we have this data in hand, what analysis are we going to do?

141
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:41,590
What offices are we going to be testing so that we're only asking questions on the questionnaire that are going to inform that data analysis?

142
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,610
So we want to think through these things prior to even designing the questionnaire

143
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,440
and then selection of items that need to be translated into questions,

144
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:05,840
right? So the level of detail varies by the quality of data needed and the validity or feasibility of added detail.

145
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:15,600
And then separating from other confounding exposures is a really difficult item, but also one that's very important, right?

146
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,070
We want to separate other exposures from the ones that we're truly interested in quantifying.

147
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:30,590
And then a logical order, right? It might be chronology, you know, starting when you when you first started working here,

148
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,920
what were the tests that you did or when you first moved to this area?

149
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,480
You know, where do you live? Where are you spending your time, whatever it might be.

150
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:47,150
And then progressing right over time might be an example of a logical order to ask questions, you know, kind of jumping around all over the place.

151
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,850
So I kind of alluded to this earlier.

152
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:01,560
We we want to be able to have a high response rate and a completion rate in order to actually end up with a successful,

153
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,490
uh, study or analysis in the end. I mentioned how questionnaires are often too long.

154
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,909
Right, because we are inquisitive minds.

155
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:19,080
And when you think of all these great things to ask that are kind of like just in case, right here is an opportunity to get more information.

156
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,370
We really want to guard against that when we're designing a questionnaire.

157
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:33,340
Uh, you know, in terms of hard copy, there are, there's some data out there suggesting that for self-administered questionnaires, right?

158
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,140
So the subject is completing it on their own. Our response to clients or anything beyond about 12 pages or so.

159
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:47,180
Uh, from a data quality perspective, we need to be aware of straight line responses, right?

160
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:55,650
Uh, this is the silly example of a standardized, uh, exam that somebody takes, and you're running out of time and you're circling.

161
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,920
Beep, beep, beep, beep. Brings it all the way through to the end.

162
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:06,360
You know, this is something we need to look for indicators when we're analyzing the data as somebody might get, you know,

163
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,700
a certain amount into the questionnaire and just kind of check out and say, hey, I just want to finish this, get my $25 incentive and be on my way.

164
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:28,110
Uh, so, you know, to re-emphasize, we don't want to include questions, uh, that doesn't have a clear point in our, in our data analysis plan.

165
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,639
And in some instances, it might actually be possible to use multiple questionnaires, right?

166
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:42,750
So maybe we really do need more information, but it's going to take us well beyond the 12 pages.

167
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:52,710
So instead of trying to do it all in one step, perhaps it's a sequential, uh, series of questionnaires the subjects would complete over time.

168
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,179
So respondent burden we've already kind of talked about this a little bit more detail.

169
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,210
This is something we need to really be aware of, and it's real.

170
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,220
And if there's too much burden, it's not going to result in good data.

171
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,790
It's not going to result in very useful information. Uh, so it might result in just non participation.

172
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,029
Somebody. What's that. It says there's no way I'm going to do this thing.

173
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:24,659
You are dropping out. This would be um, the retention of participants is a big issue.

174
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,389
So in the case of like, let's see, we did have multiple questionnaires, we break them up and we say,

175
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,780
okay, in week one, we'd like you to complete questionnaire number one.

176
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,040
In week two of our study, we'd like you to complete questionnaire number two, right?

177
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:45,360
And then finishing with questionnaire number three. They can actually make it through questionnaire number one and decide, you know what,

178
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,910
that was too much of my time, at which point I'm not going to show up for questionnaire two.

179
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,970
So at that point, even though we got them through questionnaire number one,

180
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:00,149
they're not going to complete the study and they're basically dropping out altogether can lead to

181
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:07,380
incomplete responses or just overall reduced data quality if this respondent burden is too great.

182
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,770
Uh, so, you know,

183
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:20,820
some of the things to consider are the length and distance from the present of the period over which we're asking subjects to recall.

184
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,840
Right. Uh, so if somebody asked me going back to when you were five years old, right.

185
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,040
What do you remember about your exposure to this? Holy cow?

186
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:41,970
These are really stretching things. Um, my my engagement might be turned off right away because I'm not feeling like I'm.

187
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm able to provide useful information, or I'm giving information that has a huge, huge,

188
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,180
huge amount of uncertainty around it because I'm not able to recall that long ago.

189
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:07,070
Uh, high impact topics or events of questioning, um, life events such as pregnancy, uh, the frequency of the event, uh,

190
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,629
the complexity and the detail of the data I saw again,

191
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:19,230
all of these things can play into a huge burden on a particular respondent that we need to be aware of.

192
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,130
So what are the types of questions that are available to us to ask?

193
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:30,430
Uh, at a very basic level, uh, there's two, uh, one that's called open ended, right?

194
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,230
Which is a question that has basically an open box.

195
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,690
Uh, if the person is typing or writing or speaking, right?

196
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:48,120
They're just kind of going on and taking as much as many words as needed to answer the question versus a closed ended question.

197
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,110
Right. Which might be A, B, C or D, it might be a range.

198
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,230
One, two, three, three, two, five, seven, nine. Something like this.

199
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:04,760
And depending on the types of questions we ask, we can get considerably different answers.

200
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,630
Now there's value and limitations to both.

201
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:18,570
So with regards to these open ended questions, there's basically no restrictions on the types of answers that a subject might give.

202
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,300
It's useful for eliciting simple facts where there might be many possible answers.

203
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:31,950
Right. So if we're trying to code this into an ABC or D and if there's way more than four possible answers.

204
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,450
Right, this would be a good example of when to use an open ended question.

205
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:39,840
Things like age, your occupation,

206
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:52,080
etc. This type of questioning using open ended questions tends to be more common when it comes to stick to assessing exposures.

207
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,639
But again, it's it's been more difficult to manage from there and to code for processing.

208
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:08,760
Right. It's really nice to just have answers of A, B, C or D and you can plug all of this in to code and do some really great analysis.

209
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,690
It doesn't take much time to clean the data versus open ended.

210
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,020
Right now you've got like three sentences worth of answer.

211
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,520
How do you actually categorized into a larger dataset to be analyzed?

212
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:29,860
Analyze tails? Flipping over to closed ended questions.

213
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:36,700
Uh, we. We would be striving to have choices that are simple and free.

214
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:41,260
Right? Um. And they're mutually exclusive.

215
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,809
Uh, if the optimist only select one answer. Right.

216
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:53,430
So we don't want to list choices where, you know, perhaps two could be correct in the application or from the perspective of the subject.

217
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,020
If they are allowed to answer, provide more than one answer, uh, perhaps a yes or no format might be best.

218
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,670
Or with the, you know, I don't know, options so that we're not encouraging them to guess right either yes or no if they truly don't.

219
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,890
Um, you know, these are, these are common in questionnaire in general.

220
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:22,060
Closed ended questions aren't used as frequently as specific to exposure assessment.

221
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:27,370
There are some examples here. It's pretty common in in nutrition epidemiology.

222
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,720
So things like food frequency questionnaires or diaries are very common.

223
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:41,170
All right. How much of this eat per day per week within ABC usually ranges of about.

224
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:53,580
And then again, one of the big advantages of using these closed ended questions because the use of data entry encoding prior to then,

225
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:02,040
the use of analysis data. So wording is really, really important.

226
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,510
When we're trying to design a questionnaire, administering questionnaire,

227
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,660
quality of the information that we receive from subjects is really dependent on a well worded question.

228
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:20,969
So questions that should be asked about the wording of each question in the questionnaire include the following.

229
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,210
And there's a bunch here. We don't cover all of them. Really good example.

230
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:35,820
Uh, well, the words be uniformly understood by our entire subject population again, whether this is in a workplace or in a community.

231
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:41,640
So lots of different factors by maybe job task or position.

232
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,720
Uh, the question might be better understood by some versus others.

233
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,030
And then certainly in community settings there's even more variability in respondents.

234
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,880
Uh, your questions include like radiation that might not be clear what they mean.

235
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,020
Uh, are there unconventional phrases or kind of like of jargon, right?

236
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:07,590
It's not. Is it too vague? And the other side of the too precise, we don't want to be biased.

237
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:15,509
We talked about the threatening questions or those that might not be socially acceptable to answer.

238
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,900
Yes. Yeah.

239
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:28,110
Is it unambiguous, uh, in terms of the time reference, does it assume too much about the respondents behavior?

240
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,640
Right. So we're kind of getting the respondent to be worried properly or improperly.

241
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:48,110
And then here are some examples. So if we have a question that says, where does your highest exposure know to take place in the respondent?

242
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:52,720
As opposed to an answer to that as well? You might not know what note to is right.

243
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:59,720
If we go out into the general population in a community, it's probably a pretty decent fraction of people that don't know when in old units,

244
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,850
let alone whether they've been received a high exposure of it.

245
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:13,010
We might ask certain questions so we know what the most common sources are about the exposure.

246
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:26,840
We might ask a question like that questions around How much time do you spend around gas cookers, petrol, gas stoves or perhaps smoking environments?

247
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,280
This question Have you used any pesticide? Well, I mean, do you mean in the last week?

248
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,180
Do you mean in my life? Right. So it's too vague.

249
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,120
There's no time period given. And then what counts as a pesticide, right?

250
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:49,310
Somebody just from a terminology or a definition. How many minutes per week?

251
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,420
Are you exposed to traffic jams? This is a very specific question.

252
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,850
It's a little bit too precise. This is some really complicated mental maps, right,

253
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:11,810
to try to figure out and might lead to either inaccurate or no information in terms of questionnaire format.

254
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,180
So the way that we format questions is really important.

255
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:27,080
So generally speaking, we want to be able to identify separate parts of different questions with different types, right?

256
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,040
So for example,

257
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:39,750
we might use capital letters for the question or page type for alternative answers or italics for when it's giving like an instruction to complete.

258
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,610
We want to include specific instructions to prompts for an interviewer.

259
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:53,120
Right? So we'll talk about how it's very common for interviewers to be trained and how to

260
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,960
administer a questionnaire and then go out and actually do this with the subjects.

261
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,280
So there's two things to keep in mind. One is, how is it going to be?

262
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,670
Is the question going to be received by subjects and their ability to answer it?

263
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,760
But also, how easy is it going to be to administer that question by the person conducting the interview?

264
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:23,930
So you won't go through all of these obvious things here, like provide a space or a box for coding open ended questions.

265
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:31,430
In the case of maybe a digital questionnaire or even a hardcopy questionnaire, you know,

266
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:37,970
the size of the box might give some clues as to like how much information or how much detail you're looking for, right?

267
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,460
Pretty small box. You know, they're probably not arranging much versus if the box is like a page,

268
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:53,060
that's an invitation to enter quite a bit, like things like skips or branches.

269
00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:02,600
Right. So if you answered yes to this question, go to question, you know, X and or if you answered no.

270
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:09,650
Right, some alternatives. Uh, these are a little bit difficult to do on paper.

271
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:16,999
They are easier with in a digital format because it can automatically take you to the other things

272
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,590
like space limitations and then just a an opportunity for increased respondent kind of confusion.

273
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:32,530
Right, as to wait a second, what is it telling me to do? A matrix format is another thing to consider.

274
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:41,560
So this would be like filling out a table. These are often open ended questions and they're often used for for occupation.

275
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:49,990
Right. Kind of listing occupations over time or perhaps residential history as you move from one location to another over time.

276
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,190
Coming back around and talking a little bit about how to order the questions.

277
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:05,920
Okay. So the way that we order questions can influence the response rate and the quality of the answers that we receive.

278
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:16,300
So we want to begin a questionnaire with a simple and interesting question to get to get the subject off to a good start.

279
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:20,380
Right. And a difficult answer, but it's also something that engages them.

280
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,270
So this is a really important way to start the questionnaire.

281
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:33,050
And we want to order those questions in a way that kind of maintains a flow and if it's possible to keep the respondent engaged.

282
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:41,750
So we might group questions by topic and then within each topic begin and question.

283
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,230
It's simple before we try to gain, you know, more detailed information about that topic.

284
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,910
And then again, asking those questions in a logical order.

285
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,600
So, for example, a reverse chronological order.

286
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,560
I'd recall right when you first started working here.

287
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:07,670
Right. And then here's the information. And then as you move through perhaps different positions or different tasks over time,

288
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,650
it's easy for someone to kind of go through time in a logical order.

289
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,860
In terms of some of those aides to recall this.

290
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:27,409
This is actually one of the big challenges is it's hard. I give the example of, you know, somebody asked me something about when I was five years old,

291
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,510
I would have a hard time recalling detailed information from that time period.

292
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,940
So in general, respondents might have difficulty remembering specific facts.

293
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:45,080
So in this case, you know, multiple choice questions might be a way to go, um,

294
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:50,660
depending on the nature of the questions or the kind of the type of study of exposure,

295
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:58,730
use of a calendar might actually be helpful, um, certainly for a study around exposures during pregnancy.

296
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,020
Right. Looking at the calendar. Okay. You know, here I was two months pregnant.

297
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,060
You're always three months pregnant, etc. This might this might help to aid recall.

298
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:18,920
And then also letting, uh, subjects or respondents know the types of questions that we're going to be asking on the questionnaire in advance.

299
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,750
Right. So they're scheduled for the interview next Tuesday.

300
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:30,030
And just to let you know, you know, when we talk on Tuesday, we're going to be asking questions around this,

301
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:36,200
that and this and the other related to your job, related to your pregnancy, whatever it might be.

302
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,450
So it kind of gets them thinking about things, right,

303
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,640
so that it's not during the interview itself that they're trying to recall something for the first time.

304
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,550
A tiered approach can also aid recall.

305
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:56,329
So again, kind of starting with general or more simplified questions followed by more detailed questions.

306
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:04,580
So they're already, you know, kind of mentally orienting themselves around a particular topic without just jumping into some topic with a very,

307
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:12,740
very specific or detailed recall. Kind of having several layers of a question might be useful.

308
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:19,460
So at least you can get some information before you kind of hit the point of no recall or health condition.

309
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,980
This type of approach is commonly used for occupational assessing occupational exposures.

310
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:32,380
And then instead, again, opportunities to ask about a surrogate of exposure.

311
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,850
Right. So we use the gas stove example instead of asking you, what have you been exposed to?

312
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:45,410
Um, and then maybe somebody doesn't know what specific pesticides are, what the definition might be,

313
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:55,160
but asking them if that has problems in their home they might also use be useful as a surrogate of okay if they had has problems,

314
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,840
their likelihood of being exposed to pesticides is greater.

315
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:12,670
Okay. So let's step through how we would actually pilot test a questionnaire we are developing and we know what our objectives are.

316
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,750
We have these clear objectives of our study, of our exposure assessment.

317
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,570
What we want to know as an outcome, we're designing a questionnaire.

318
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,290
So what are some of the steps you might do?

319
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:35,530
Well, first would be to obtain, you know, kind of some peer evaluation of our initial draft evaluation by people that are familiar with the topic.

320
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:43,720
Say, hey, can you take a look at this? Ideally, multiple people kind of give them feedback as the first layer of screening.

321
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:50,170
Then after some revisions, you know, testing that questionnaire on a sample of convenience.

322
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:56,380
Right. Your family at home, you know, some of your friends, you know, maybe some of your coworkers, whatever it is.

323
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:01,030
Get some additional feedback. Well, you know what? It was hard to answer this or this part was confusing.

324
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:09,730
You're getting some more feedback. Preparing instructions for use as you continue to revise this.

325
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,320
So how would you actually train interviewers? Right.

326
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,600
This is the next step is okay. It's starting to come into focus.

327
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,540
We're starting to shape this questionnaire now.

328
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,570
We need to think about what are the issues with training an individual to administer this questionnaire.

329
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:34,520
So problems requiring revision of the questionnaire might be uncovered in this process.

330
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,740
Then actually pre-testing the questionnaire on a sample or some sort of focus

331
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,260
group of respondents that would be perhaps representative of the population

332
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:54,560
of the subjects that you're going to be drawing from getting comments and feedback on both interviewers and subjects from the inner perspective.

333
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,040
Where were the difficulties and challenges in administering it?

334
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:03,440
And then, of course, from the subjects know, what were the difficulties in actually completing it?

335
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:11,190
Again, revising these questions that might cause difficulty, pre-testing it, again, revising it some more.

336
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:16,580
It's a long process and this is really required to get it to the point where

337
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:22,280
it's going to give us useful and quality information once we actually do this.

338
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:24,559
So yes,

339
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:33,950
are preparing revised instructions by additional training for interviewers for implementing the study and then monitoring the performance of the

340
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:43,910
questionnaire during the early phases of assessments and b being willing to stop if there's negative feedback coming from interviewers or subjects,

341
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,850
being willing to stop and kind of go back and phase things.

342
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,240
Different kind of conditions. Yeah.

343
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:58,610
Is there any reason you wouldn't want to use questionnaires that have been used by other researchers or previously?

344
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,770
Yeah, it's a great question. And this actually comes around to the issue.

345
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:06,770
We talked about how a questionnaire can be difficult to validate.

346
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:16,670
This is kind of the surrogate of validation is using something that someone else has previously used.

347
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:23,510
Perhaps there is this invalidated either, but there's some reference right from the start.

348
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,230
You are not starting with something that there's no track record of.

349
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,330
You can be informed by a questionnaire that someone else has already completed.

350
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,200
The issues are that it's not 100% translatable, right?

351
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:44,270
The subject population that you are looking to apply it to is almost never the same as what someone else has done in a different study.

352
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,490
But absolutely. And that's generally how many questionnaires,

353
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:55,760
if we were tasked as exposure scientists to go to this facility and assess exposures using questionnaires.

354
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,440
So if you go to this community, that's where we would start. We would go to the scientific literature and find out, you know,

355
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,410
what have people use previously to help inform the drafting of our own questionnaire right from the get go?

356
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,040
Absolutely. Good question. Any others I know we're getting into the nitty gritty here of questionnaires.

357
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,030
Is is this mostly making sense?

358
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:27,300
Okay. Good, good. Uh, translating the questionnaire.

359
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,420
So this is. This is a huge issue, right? Uh, all of those things that we just talked about.

360
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:39,410
Uh, let's just assume that English was our only requirement, and we could do the whole process in English.

361
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,540
This is often not the case, right? So it adds a whole nother layer of complexity into the process.

362
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:52,940
So we have diverse populations both within workplaces as well as within that community setting.

363
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,730
So offering a questionnaire in multiple languages is very common.

364
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:07,550
And so for the most part, how this process goes is the questionnaire is designed first in English,

365
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,600
and then once it's sorted out, we've gone through all these steps.

366
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:17,360
It's translated perhaps into Spanish or Arabic or whatever it might be.

367
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:22,580
And then it's back translated. And this is an interesting process.

368
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:30,200
So what we need are to help in this process are people that are fluent, obviously in the languages that are involved.

369
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,620
We're translating an English questionnaire into Spanish.

370
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,100
We need to utilize folks that are fluent in Spanish.

371
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:43,490
We also need to utilize folks that understand the topic matter of the questionnaire

372
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,740
and what the study objectives are in the first place so that they have some context.

373
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:55,190
So we're going to have one person or multiple people translate the questionnaire in the first place,

374
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:02,150
and then we're going to have someone else completely independent who's going to back translate it.

375
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,420
So what has been translated into Spanish, for example,

376
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:12,430
we're now asking someone else with that same context to be translated to English, so then we can compare, right?

377
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,830
Does it actually match with our original English questionnaire?

378
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:23,600
And it's going to help identify where there are confusion or unclear questions as part of that translation process.

379
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,760
For sure, we need to be able to take cultural differences into account.

380
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,360
There are many different cultures that use Spanish language, right?

381
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:38,450
So the way that it's received by one culture might be very different than others.

382
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:46,000
As is the case with English. And then, of course, you know that that entire process that we just kind of went through about piloting in English,

383
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:53,810
we would need to do this same, uh, pilot test process in that, in that Spanish case, for example.

384
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,620
Yeah. So back to this question of we did this one.

385
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:10,140
It's really important and there aren't really easy answers to our, I guess less than satisfactory answers to it.

386
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:21,360
So when we talk about validity, we mean does the questionnaire, is it actually measuring what we want it to measure or what we need it to measure?

387
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,750
So ideally, all questions that we ask in a questionnaire would be validated against some gold standard rate.

388
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:39,840
Uh, perhaps we could do a substudy in a population subset, for example.

389
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,570
So let's say we have 100 people in our study.

390
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:54,419
We developed this questionnaire ask about we can use the example from last class period exposure to to lead in a lead smelting

391
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:01,950
facility for occupational workers or for community participants who live in the neighborhood surrounding that led smelter.

392
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:13,480
We go through this questionnaire with 100 of them. Let's say we can afford, with maybe ten of them, to actually do personal measurements.

393
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:20,460
Right. We can collect biomarkers. We can do personal monitoring.

394
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,920
And so now we have a true value, or at least a more accurate assessment.

395
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,459
And then we can compare what is the exposure assessment we come up with independently from the questionnaires for

396
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:39,150
those people and compare it to that kind of gold standard or that much higher level quality of exposure assessment.

397
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:48,270
If they compare very well. Right. This helps us to kind of validate and assume that it's representative now across all 100 people.

398
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,000
We use the questionnaire to assess exposure.

399
00:43:51,690 --> 00:44:00,660
Again, this is often not possible if we're asking about, for example, uh, since you started working here, what's been your exposure?

400
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:08,980
And you've worked here for five years. We can't go back in time to make to collect biomarker samples and to make personal measurements for you.

401
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:14,460
And oftentimes, there's really no clear gold standard of exposure.

402
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,760
So in the end, it's just kind of going back to Kate's question.

403
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:25,710
If you few questionnaires and exposure assessment have actually been formally validated, right.

404
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,940
Kind of following a process of the example that I just gave where you might make personal measurements on a subset.

405
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:38,920
And what we ended up doing is relying on kind of previously used questionnaires

406
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,080
in settings as well as just kind of trial and error going through the process.

407
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:50,470
Less than ideal. But again, getting useful information is the goal.

408
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,580
So when we talk about validity, we're actually trying to assess or quantify how valid is our questionnaire.

409
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,230
These are some of the variables that we would consider assessing and what they means.

410
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,770
So we might assess validity by sensitivity.

411
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:15,640
So this means the probability of receiving a positive answer when the exposure is truly present, right?

412
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:22,900
So our ability to accurately quantify that is important and a measure of validity also the specificity.

413
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:33,220
So this would include the probability of receiving a negative answer when that exposure is truly absent.

414
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:38,830
Right. So we might actually do well on sensitivity, right?

415
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:49,930
But then get a bunch of positive answers in cases where the exposure isn't present, uh, something called positive predictive value.

416
00:45:50,530 --> 00:46:00,550
So the probability that a person is actually exposed, given that that person gave a positive answer and then negative predictive value,

417
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:07,390
the probability that a person is truly not exposed when that person gives a negative answer.

418
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:14,290
So these are all kind of measures of variables that we would consider when we talk about validating a questionnaire.

419
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:28,450
Repeatability is also a really important component of a questionnaire for all questionnaires and especially for assessing exposures.

420
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:38,500
So what does this mean? If we were to define it, in some other words, what would be repeatability, reliability or reproducibility?

421
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:50,200
All kind of synonymous in this case. So basically it's answering are the same answers obtained when a questionnaire is administered repeatedly.

422
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:59,170
Right. So we conduct the questionnaire and then we go back another time and conduct this questionnaire again with the same subjects.

423
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,060
This wouldn't be the case for all 100.

424
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,460
Right. Kind of in our example from a few minutes ago.

425
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:14,480
But similar to how we might try to assess true exposure with physical measurements, we could assess, uh,

426
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:23,200
reliability or reproducibility by going back and conducting that same questionnaire on a subset of those within our study.

427
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:29,740
And if we're getting it, we're receiving the same answers. This is helping to give us confidence in our.

428
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,920
So there's different types of questionnaires, different formats.

429
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:48,129
One would be a self-administered questionnaire, right? For the most part, the images are that it's, uh, the easiest type of questionnaire.

430
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,020
It doesn't require someone to administer it. It's simply the subject completing it on her own.

431
00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:05,830
For this reason, it's the most cost effective, most costly way to obtain information on either present or past or both exposure.

432
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:16,470
It often results in lower response rates compared to some of the other junior formats.

433
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,930
If it's hardcopy and let's say it's mailed, you know,

434
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:31,500
somebody might not receive it or might just simply throw it away as kind of like junk mail and they can't beat you off.

435
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,040
This is one of the advantages of having an interviewer,

436
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:41,550
is that someone who in person engaged with the subject or with the candidate to kind of make sure that they get through it.

437
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:46,710
If it's a person on their own right, it's easier to just kind of like check out and say, I'm going to be done with this.

438
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,390
So for the most part, we can't design a long questionnaire.

439
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:56,940
If a dentist if we're anticipating a self-administration framework.

440
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:10,960
Okay. So moving on to some other surrogate measures of exposure, we've talked quite a bit about questionnaires, about use of diaries,

441
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:22,660
interviews, observation, and then also accessing records or utilizing prior respondents, if not the original subjects.

442
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:30,260
So there can be interviews so often face to face.

443
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:35,300
Right. So this is hey, we're going to meet on Tuesday at 3:00 and conduct this interview.

444
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:42,080
Some of the advantages and interviewers present and can explain the question.

445
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:51,260
Right. So the interviewer asks the question and if the respondent doesn't understand, they can say, right, well, I'm not sure what you mean.

446
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:56,390
Right. It's confusing because the answer is this an answer B is that can you clarify

447
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,459
and then get thinkings and clarification and then get a more accurate answer,

448
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:01,700
right?

449
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:12,500
Versus in that case, if it were self administered, there's no source of a resource for clarification and it could likely result in a no less quality.

450
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:19,790
It gives an opportunity to explore answers to certain questions and more and more detail.

451
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,640
So instead of having to to assume about a responded and think ahead about what

452
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,830
kind of layered approach to questions and where and how to ask for detail,

453
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:41,030
the interviewer can be trained right based on the answer to question number one, then how to ask a follow up for question two and three and so forth.

454
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:49,800
And like I said, it gives an opportunity for the questionnaire to be longer in duration.

455
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:55,040
Again, because you have an active, engaged interviewer working with the respondent.

456
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,980
Some of the disadvantages, of course, is that it requires a really well-trained interviewer in the first place.

457
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:11,660
That's a logistic. It's also a cost consideration. It might result in more kind of socially acceptable answers, right?

458
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:19,010
So if someone is completing the questionnaire on their own, it's a bit more distant or disassociated.

459
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:27,589
So maybe you don't feel the pressure. Right. You know, if it's kind of a socially unacceptable example for smoking during pregnancy.

460
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:31,010
Right? I'm just doing this by myself. Okay. Yeah, I smoked while I was pregnant.

461
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:40,650
If you're being interviewed by somebody, the person might feel some pressure from a peer who is present to let you know.

462
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,710
I don't want to admit to this person that I smoked during pregnancy, so I might not give a true answer.

463
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:53,430
Certainly there are some logistics involved. The person is a self-administered questionnaire.

464
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,860
They can kind of complete it on their own time. Right? When there's an interviewer involved.

465
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,790
Finding out hey window. Our schedules overlap.

466
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:08,090
When can we do this? If they're traveling. All right, that's another potentially.

467
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,880
And for for various reasons, it can be more costly than self-administered.

468
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:24,230
There are some other approaches to having an interviewer and not have it be in person or face to face.

469
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:29,390
So these might be over the phone or video resume, something like this.

470
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:38,030
It still gives us the advantage of an interviewer being able to clarify the questions and again, more detailed responses.

471
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,970
It can be easier to organize and cost less than face to face.

472
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:52,190
Scheduling is easier. It might get rid of travel and so forth, and it even provides an opportunity, you know,

473
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:57,860
perhaps that interviewers in their office and has all of their computer or whatever nearby.

474
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,580
So they're entering data perhaps in real time.

475
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:11,560
Again, similar disadvantages in that it requires someone who is well-trained from the interviewer side of things because we're not in person.

476
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:17,390
There's there's a lot of data that documents that the in-person interview is much more engaging.

477
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:27,500
And so you can ask more questions over a longer time period once you get over the phone or even of video can be shorter.

478
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:38,480
And then this is both actually an opportunity, but also perhaps a disadvantage that might need to be recorded to ensure some sort of quality control.

479
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:48,380
So moving to diaries, uh, and then specifically in the case of self-administered diaries.

480
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:55,220
These can be used repeatedly to obtain information on present exposures.

481
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:01,560
Right. So the example is the one that I gave a few minutes ago about a food frequency diary.

482
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:09,870
We might want to know about, you know, how much of this community is based on these food groups, or you can see me each day.

483
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:16,440
And so the subject is completing each day diary of what they ate into categories of food.

484
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,510
It may also help for environmental studies.

485
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:33,750
It gives us the ability to assess some temporal variability within subjects over time, as well as variability between subjects.

486
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,360
In some scenarios, it could be used to represent longer term exposures.

487
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:50,970
Right. So, you know, there are some data that suggest that, uh, if we have people do a free group and food frequency diary for a month,

488
00:54:51,420 --> 00:55:00,810
right, that is then we can safely assume that this is representative of their nutritional intake over the past year.

489
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:05,040
Right. Uh. Can be combined with other measures.

490
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,099
So your measures to obtain improved exposure estimates.

491
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:16,920
Again, we're always looking for opportunities to use multiple exposure assessment approaches when we're relying on surrogate measures especially.

492
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,700
But at the same time, you know, we need these to be short and easy to fill out, right?

493
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,550
Because they're doing this every day. It can't require more than a few minutes of their time to report.

494
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:35,580
It's not something we can have with pages and pages long and require a ton of simple

495
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:45,240
and easy and quick shifting observation as a surrogate approach to your assessment.

496
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:53,130
So what does this mean? So what additional information is needed on an exposure related to behavior?

497
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,830
Uh, so something a good example is a child hand mouth contact.

498
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:06,330
Right. This is really tough to ask a questionnaire and get information.

499
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,250
How often does your child prepare? All right. Or even worse.

500
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,160
Asking a child, how often do you put your hand to your mouth?

501
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:21,810
So this might be where someone who is trained actually goes and spends time with, let's say,

502
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:29,520
kids in a playground or kids in a classroom or a specific worker who's completing a task.

503
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:35,570
And you're simply observing them and noting or indeed perhaps even counting, but documenting.

504
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:38,640
Right. In the case of the child, how many times do they put their hands in their mouth?

505
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,070
But it would be using a questionnaire in the form, kind of a checklist.

506
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:57,450
And again, we might be performing this simultaneously with other types of exposure assessment, and it might even take place in real time.

507
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:04,080
Right. So the person who's the observer who's actually there watching or utilizing video, right, if there's a mechanism going video,

508
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:12,600
a worker on their task and then getting access to that video and going through and talking about their behavior.

509
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:18,959
So some of the advantages is it can be more accurate and objective than some of those other methods.

510
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,380
Right. We're just simply asking how many times as your child put their hand to their mouth, but it's more time consuming.

511
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:35,970
Right. So the time that it takes for someone to go and sit and actually observe or even to review all of that video,

512
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,420
it's more resource intensive, has a higher cost.

513
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:47,219
And for the most part, because of that, increased intensity that's required is usually going to shrink the subject

514
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:51,390
because of the number of people that we can actually use this approach with.

515
00:57:53,160 --> 00:58:02,760
Another type of surrogate exposure assessment is utilizing already, so being access to data or information over time.

516
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:09,360
We could use this to have an objective expert exposure assessment of either past or present.

517
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,610
So examples would be things like job titles.

518
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:23,730
Right. Is knowing which types of positions that people were in can help inform us of what types of exposures they might have experienced over time.

519
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,900
A material science data. Data sheets.

520
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:32,400
So what chemicals were they working with? What types of hazards were they working with?

521
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:36,870
Just knowing those would help inform us over time.

522
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:47,729
Again, there's some limitations. Things like terminology might have differed over the course of time of the records.

523
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:55,580
So. We're talking about a company we're interested in assessing, you know, entire work for history, but never 30 years.

524
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:01,250
Well, it was only ten years ago that the company actually started collecting data that specifies this.

525
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:06,770
Right. And for the 20 years before, it was like in this very general category using different terms.

526
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:12,200
So in that case, it's a kind of difficult analogy, but overall,

527
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:21,200
the level of exposure related details might simply be limited or not, and it won't be difficult to gain access.

528
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:29,360
Right. How willing. Especially in the case of a private company, how long are they to make these records available?

529
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:35,330
Going back historically. Proxy respondents.

530
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:46,310
So this basically means relying on people who provide information on exposure, like in place of the subjects themselves.

531
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:55,160
So some examples of when this might be the case, certainly in the case of death, if the person is no longer alive.

532
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,730
But we're interested in assessing their exposure.

533
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:03,590
And again, this isn't perhaps an individual. This is looking at a company.

534
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:13,070
We know that there was this high percentage of people at the facility that died due to a specific cause.

535
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:20,509
And we're trying to investigate. Well, what are some of the exposures at this facility going back to the time the people

536
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,770
that have passed away really aren't available to be asked those questions.

537
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:30,200
But there might there may be proxy other folks that can help inform us about,

538
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:34,700
you know, what it was that they did at the facility to help inform our study.

539
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:42,380
It might help increase the study size. Right, if the prevalence of these types of conditions is high.

540
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:45,590
So, again, it's a it's a a long term study.

541
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:52,570
Anyone who was around in the study began would likely be quite old now or no longer.

542
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:57,890
There are some issues with proxy respondents.

543
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,290
We need to have an equal number of proxies.

544
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:07,640
If it's a case control study, the number of positive cases with the number of control cases.

545
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:13,220
We can't say, hey, none of the controls died, so we can just ask them directly.

546
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:18,979
And then for the cases where 50% of the people died, when utilizing proxies,

547
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,990
we need to be able to have a representative number of proxy responses in both.

548
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,730
In order for them to be directly compatible,

549
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:33,440
we need a higher number of subjects due to some of the errors that can take place to get at someone who is serving as a proxy.

550
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,180
So their ability to answer questions might be limited.

551
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:43,040
And again, we're going to want to rely on those with the best knowledge of the subject's exposure.

552
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:58,460
All right. And then here, kind of getting into some some quantitative opportunities or perhaps some quantitative surrogates,

553
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:05,030
both within an occupational setting as within, you know, a more of a community environment.

554
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:10,490
So for occupation, it might be things like employment duration, right?

555
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,780
This is a specific number, 6.2 years.

556
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:23,420
For example, the job title, the job tasks we can talk about and the job exposure matrix here in a minute, as well as expert evaluation.

557
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:29,420
Examples of this in a community are, you know, distance with regards to address.

558
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:39,530
I live at this location. It was 6.4 miles or ten kilometers away from an emissions source facility which that

559
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:47,720
community utilizing geographic information systems and things like time and activity.

560
01:02:50,690 --> 01:03:00,520
Some of these occupational exposure surrogates would include employment, history and duration as well as job title.

561
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:05,570
So what was it that the person was doing, that particular facility?

562
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:17,780
There are some job processes, right? So we know what types of tasks they did or processes they were involved in.

563
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:27,530
On jobs withheld to inform us. There's something called a job exposure matrix that's used often in case control

564
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:32,540
studies when we're looking at especially historical exposure assessments.

565
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,150
So this is where we have a list of the occupations or industries on one axis,

566
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:49,550
and then looking across a matrix at what possible exposure agents came into contact with, simply kind of checking off boxes across this matrix.

567
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:57,350
There's an example here. Right. So within agriculture, right, we have these different job classifications a farmer,

568
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:04,340
a laborer and a mine, perhaps a truck driver who old stuff or a minor in forestry,

569
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:15,350
in construction, and then going across basically some sort of simple metric or were they exposed or not to two different things.

570
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:20,059
In this case, it's like herbicides, welding fields with dust, etc.

571
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:25,490
So these are again kind of quantitative or even semi quantitative of values, of exposure.

572
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:42,290
Getting it to expert evaluation so we can actually rely on someone with expert knowledge of a certain circumstance or situation to help interpret.

573
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:47,150
Right. So, hey, we have this data available. It may or may not be useful.

574
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:52,830
So what? Someone who has expert knowledge of that situation, maybe someone who worked at the plant for 30 years.

575
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:55,220
Right. And even though things aren't well documented,

576
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:01,370
they kind of know from their own personal experience how things developed over time and how things changed over time.

577
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:07,760
So they might be able to help interpret the applicability of our data that we have access

578
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:14,180
to and perhaps fill in some gaps that might exist to offset the people in the study.

579
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:21,920
Right. These are the folks that would be thought to have a better vantage point in the study subjects themselves.

580
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,810
Perhaps it's because they're the one who trained everybody right now would be another good example,

581
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,709
having knowledge of both work processes as well as the study's objectives.

582
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:36,800
Right. They know our study is aimed at assessing this.

583
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,060
So you know that they can they can help. Right.

584
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,780
To build in what we would be recognizing as important gaps.

585
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:52,790
And again, this is traditionally performed within an occupational setting by trained industrial tenants.

586
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:59,830
It's not so commonly used within that community environmental study.

587
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:04,240
This would be much more of an opportunity to apply within a workplace settings.

588
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:20,700
The use of interviewers with key informants to phase paradigm in expert evaluations is shown to provide a greater precision.

589
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:25,830
So what are some of the disadvantages of expert evaluation?

590
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:31,660
Well, uh, finding somebody who's familiar with everything is pretty hard, right?

591
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:38,180
Someone who's familiar with all of the jobs, all of the conditions and how that changed over time.

592
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:42,060
And we're looking at an a retrospective framework going back, say, 30 years.

593
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:53,940
Uh, it's hard to find knowledge on a wide range of industries and jobs found and work histories within population based studies,

594
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:03,000
and then have a general lack of knowledge on important work site characteristics without having detailed reports from subjects themselves.

595
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:12,440
Okay. So shifting from that occupational setting back into more of a community or environmental,

596
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,990
what are some either quantitative or semi quantitative surrogates?

597
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:30,620
One of them is simply geography, right? And this is most useful when we have known differences in spatial difference of exposure.

598
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:36,590
Right. So if we know that there's an emission source located here and we have people living nearby it,

599
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,950
we can compare and contrast that with people that live far away from it.

600
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:44,120
Right. So there's spatial variability in this case.

601
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:52,070
So we have groups of individual one area that are considered to have a higher exposure to that interest and other groups.

602
01:07:52,790 --> 01:08:00,140
And then systematic differences in exposure over distance would be needed for that data to be useful.

603
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,340
Home address is a good example of this.

604
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:09,960
Some of the best data, residential history and so forth.

605
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:20,590
Distinct from fixed sources, right? So this is kind of going back to I talked about air pollution in Detroit,

606
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:30,460
a few class periods to go from 2019, a toxic release inventory of facilities in Detroit.

607
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:39,220
So if we have this as our starting point and we know where some of those largest emissions take place and we just know where people live,

608
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:43,330
we don't know much more about them other than their residential address.

609
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,250
This can help inform.

610
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:54,660
What we might estimate their exposure to be from sea air pollution in relation to how close they live to highways or dense roadways.

611
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:01,050
All right. So some conclusions here.

612
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,709
Right. We kind of started with personal measurements.

613
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:12,870
Are our preferred method or best source of information for assessing exposure, biomarkers, personal monitoring.

614
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:20,280
Right. A little bit more a little bit less quality, but still useful area measurements that are quantitative.

615
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:24,730
Below that are surrogate measures of exposure.

616
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,170
So here's some conclusions with regards to those surrogate measures.

617
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:35,160
On the plus side, they usually cost less than than personal measurements.

618
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:45,540
But in general, right. They're associated with less accuracy of exposure and less precision and making personal measurements.

619
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:57,050
So increased measurement error. And then again, that question of being able to validate a questionnaire or some other surrogate measure of exposure.

620
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:05,870
But oftentimes this surrogate data is our only data that's available and it's really our best option.

621
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:09,900
Right. And the perfect example of that is retrospective.

622
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:15,690
So we're being asked to look back 30 years, right, to estimate exposure.

623
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:23,129
Using these surrogates through a questionnaire and other methods is pretty much only available.

624
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:26,640
We can't travel back in time. Right. And make personal measurements.

625
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:34,350
And then again, not relying on a single surrogate is often our best case.

626
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:38,490
So we can combine different types of surrogate measures,

627
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:47,160
or even in a subset of folks that mix in some some true personal measurement data can be really helpful.

628
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:59,040
And then, you know, having increased access to large databases over time is improving our ability to do this and make use of some of these surrogates.

629
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:06,090
The concept of GPS right wasn't something that was available going back a few decades.

630
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:15,950
It is now. And with that, I will go ahead and stop, which, again, I'm 8 minutes early today.

631
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:21,840
That doesn't always happen. Questions about questionnaires?

632
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:29,910
Yes. So how many people do you have to administer the questionnaires in order to have something that's statistically significant?

633
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:37,540
Great question. Yeah, absolutely. And it's not it's not a simple number or answer that I can give you.

634
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,880
But this is an important consideration. And there's an assessment that's part of this.

635
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:48,030
The questionnaire design is estimating statistical power.

636
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:59,790
So knowing what type of question we're trying to answer with our study objectives, designing the data analysis is working backwards and saying, okay,

637
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:05,909
how many subjects do we need to interview to get enough data to have enough statistical

638
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:10,950
power to answer this this question or address our hypothesis or our objective?

639
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,150
So it's not a single numerical answer to your question, but you're absolutely right.

640
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,860
It's a very important consideration. We can design the best questionnaire we want.

641
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:29,710
If we only, uh, if we assess it on too few individuals, it doesn't matter how good the information is,

642
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,320
it's not going to allow us to statistically assess A, B, or C.

643
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:39,440
Does that make it great? Any other questions?

644
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,860
I keep going back to like the using other people's questionnaires and stuff.

645
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:00,469
Proxy. Yeah. Is there like some sort of protocol for using other people's stuff or is it like you're allowed to plagiarize that?

646
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:03,950
And it's not considered bad because it's like scientific community, general knowledge.

647
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:13,010
Yeah. Yeah. And I can go back to the slides and look at here again, this,

648
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:25,129
this is going to be the case where it's most useful within a workplace setting so that the proxy is someone who supervised,

649
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:32,090
someone who trained, someone who worked side by side, or perhaps it's a close family member.

650
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,030
Like in the case where, you know,

651
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:42,500
the company isn't really willing to give out the details about what this person who's previously passed away has been doing.

652
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:52,610
Um, but like a spouse or an adult child or something that knew, you know, some details about what the subject did in their job.

653
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,890
My question was why about when you use research questions that another researcher has used in the past?

654
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:03,469
Oh, gosh. Like, is it considered plagiarism to not ask but basically, like use it?

655
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:06,500
Or is there like they've published it so you can. Yeah.

656
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:12,290
This this would be the common approach is that it's published.

657
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,800
That's great. Right. That's a better place than something that's unpublished.

658
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:22,610
But that's that also exists as you're aware of someone who utilized a questionnaire for a study,

659
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:26,930
but it was never published, or at least not in a peer reviewed publication, for example.

660
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,320
Right. But yeah, that's within a community.

661
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:40,820
In that case, most of the time, the person looking to utilize it would reach out directly and there's often much more information

662
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:46,430
to be gleaned through direct interaction and just what's available in the publication.

663
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:55,460
So for sure. So multiple reasons for wanting to do that beyond just, you know, I just wasn't sure if giving credit or plagiarizing is great.

664
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:01,850
Yeah. Yeah. And that would absolutely be like when, when we publish our study that we use it.

665
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:09,870
That's how we would write it up. We would say, you know, we started with the questionnaire, you know, from submit that, all right,

666
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:16,970
2016, it was modified and we would spell out exactly what we changed from what from what they did.

667
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,700
Any other questions? Yeah. Do you publish?

668
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,990
Like the questionnaires as, like supporting information to your papers.

669
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:39,650
I'm not familiar with. Yeah. Yeah, good question. So, you know, back in the day when everything was published in hard copy, right?

670
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,579
Like a journal that was less available, right.

671
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:49,330
Because there's pretty strict space considerations for for an article that's going to be published these days.

672
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:59,379
Uh, you know, many journals offer a supplemental material option as part of the digital publication of it, so it's really easy.

673
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,670
And yeah, that's very common.

674
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:09,490
And not just for questionnaires for all other types of information that's in the supplemental, but likely very informative.

675
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:15,450
Yeah. Yeah.

676
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:22,100
When it comes to sensitivity and specificity, how do you know, like what's accurate?

677
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:32,450
Like to know that sensitivity does. And that goes back to if you recall, the preface to that slide was it's really hard to validate questionnaires,

678
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,320
right, because often we don't have a gold standard.

679
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:43,430
But in the case where we do have something that's a higher level of accuracy, then yes,

680
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:49,220
those would be the variables that we would consider for selectivity, specificity, etc.

681
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:54,060
But. Right. It assumes that we actually have something to compare. Yeah.

682
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:59,040
Yeah. These are great questions.

683
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:10,370
You know, there's. All right.

684
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:13,520
Well, hey, thanks so much for your attention and your engagement.

685
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:18,110
I'm going to keep my fingers crossed for something like rapid temperature increase for Tuesday.

686
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:22,620
And it's like glorious. I'm not sure we can we can go outdoors for class.

687
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:28,670
I'll keep you posted over the weekend. Yeah, we got to talk about the proposal.

688
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:32,240
The proposal? Thank you for reminding me. All right, I've got one minute.

689
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:40,790
Sorry. No, no, no. That's perfect. So just to set the stage, uh, and again, you can forget this.

690
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:44,870
I want you to focus on the exam and only worry about doing well on that.

691
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:52,580
But, uh, on October 13, I'm going to assign a proposal for you till after the exam.

692
01:17:52,820 --> 01:18:01,640
I'm going to assign a proposal. It's going to be a mock call for proposal from the state of Michigan or some sort of exposure assessment.

693
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:05,330
And you're going to have about three and a half weeks to work on it.

694
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:11,420
It will be due on November eight, so from October 13th to November eight.

695
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:17,300
So in this case, I'm not going to be looking for some like term paper quality.

696
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:20,030
Right. Something that you've been working on the entire semester.

697
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:24,890
It's also the intention is that it's going to simulate a bit of real world experience.

698
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,520
This is how life works in workplaces.

699
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:33,020
You don't have months and months and months to do it. You're presented with something.

700
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,410
It's a limited amount of time. You do the best that you can.

701
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,920
So I'm not to looking for anything flashy or pretty.

702
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:45,590
It's really just going to be kind of like the content and the nuts and bolts, and it's going to be an application.

703
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,840
Right. So everything that we're learning to this point,

704
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:55,430
taking it and applying it to a specific exposure assessment scenario is going to give you a heads up on what that will look like.

705
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:00,430
It's not going to be 30 pages long or anything crazy like that. So.

706
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:07,300
Okay, forget about it. Don't worry about the proposal. Just focus on doing all right.

707
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:10,720
Thank you for the reminder.
