1
00:00:00,884 --> 00:00:06,424
we have a very intense chapter on modeling and my intention

2
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:11,724
in this chapter is not to scare you away or anything to catch you to

3
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:17,084
talk to language of modelers. okay. and we'll go through some concepts

4
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:22,164
in environmental fate and transport and bio kinetic modeling to the extent we came to

5
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:27,284
ours. so I'm gonna go pretty fast I'm gonna skip certain parts and

6
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:32,304
I want you to learn the language. so if I say sensitivity analysis

7
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:37,684
or variability or uncertainty I want you know what that means for model product gnostic modeling

8
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:43,724
things like this it's a language that I'm after and then we'll get more into applications as we go. again

9
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:48,764
along in the semester. so how maybe which is a climate strike on Fridays to shift

10
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:54,284
gears a little bit. okay. and

11
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:59,764
you know yesterday at the UN was a big climate meeting right and this is probably

12
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:05,004
the preeminent environmental model of our time is with climate change

13
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:10,304
in global circulation and these types of models okay. and so

14
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:16,224
I was looking for one that you might be able to use and Ron and I encourage you to

15
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:21,584
check out this site it's called global calculator and it's a very simple spreadsheet

16
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:27,264
type of model but what it allows you to do is to

17
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:32,264
put in different scenarios like how much travel you're gonna do or what's the

18
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:38,284
energy mix gonna be and then predicts the

19
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:46,801
a number different impacts including cost and

20
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:52,141
energy futures and things like this and I just encourage you to look at it

21
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:57,241
and okay and give it a try. it's it's very simple in some ways but it's

22
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:02,581
also very complex in other ways and this is just showing you for example the historical

23
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:07,641
temperatures and then based on the scenarios here that can include lifestyle

24
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:12,881
technology land and other parameters that I can change it comes up with upper

25
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:18,581
and lower boundary for temperatures over the next seventy

26
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:24,281
years something like that. so it's a cool little application. it's actually a spreadsheet model.

27
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:29,441
okay just been reported to the web. you know nice interface. so you can make

28
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:34,701
simple calculations look really jazzy if you want give that a shot.

29
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:40,061
bye. have much more structured models that we're gonna use in the course.

30
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:45,935
so should a goal is to try to get through all of this stuff here and

31
00:02:45,935 --> 00:02:51,035
the readings are not as essential as understanding the slides. but you should take a look

32
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:56,095
at the readings. so I wanna cover a little bit of reasons tomorrow

33
00:02:56,095 --> 00:03:01,335
and focus really on mass balance modeling. will

34
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:06,355
talk about some of the language for modeling and then I'll go through a progression of very trivial

35
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:11,515
to fairly sophisticated model examples with a little bit of math. so brush that off

36
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:16,715
with us back to science and math and physics and stuff like that. then we'll talk about

37
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:22,115
model of valuation with how you formulate models. what makes good models and and some of the modeling

38
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:27,175
issues. this is an awful lot to do. okay. so I've said

39
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:32,235
all of this and some of the readings that I have

40
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:37,535
put on canvas I listed here. this is a national research

41
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:43,135
council report from what about twelve years ago. describing how models are used in the regulatory

42
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:48,913
process they are an essential piece of the regulators to kids.

43
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:54,313
they should also be major portions of policy makers toolkits

44
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:59,433
as well. okay. and so having some understanding not just to

45
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:05,533
be able to say you know you've left this out your models not good. it's you know show me the the proof

46
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:12,013
but to make things better as well. so we have to look at it on both pros and cons. bye.

47
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:17,133
okay. so models you guys have various types of definitions but

48
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:22,453
one is this is a simplification reduction of reality utilize for some purpose.

49
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:27,633
and this is one of the definition of mathematical definition is

50
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:32,693
that it's some simplified version

51
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:38,353
of the system and the processes that take place within it and third

52
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:43,955
type definition is a mathematical one. we're basically I have. why is equal to half of

53
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:49,055
now in each of these three definitions are just very quickly going through there is a tremendous

54
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:54,055
amount of subtleties let's look at the third one when you have a function like why because

55
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:59,135
after tax what's the dependent variable line of course

56
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:04,495
what's the independent variable vector of access okay. and so the idea

57
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:10,215
is that why depends on these axes the exes are for independent

58
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:15,415
variables and presumably not affected by why but relationship goes

59
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:20,555
one way. okay they affect why we can break this down into two pieces you have

60
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:25,555
the exes those of the parameters and they have specific values that go into the model and then there's some

61
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:30,655
sort of algebraic relationship between them and that's the structure. so why this is equal half to

62
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:36,935
of ex is a model that has two basic parts structure and the parameters go into it.

63
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:42,135
okay. in engineering or some policy applications. we talk about taxes

64
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:47,533
is the things that we can control okay so we'll change the dynamics

65
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:52,533
of electrical power system by increasing or decreasing Hydro. okay that might be an

66
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:58,073
ex. okay and why might be one of us you know CO2

67
00:05:58,073 --> 00:06:03,113
emissions or something like that. climate change and okay from these

68
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:08,193
other definitions here. the things I want to emphasize the seems very basic but it's important. we

69
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:13,513
have a reason to do this. okay. and we have an application.

70
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:18,633
so it's important that we get this right. so

71
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:23,873
you know we talked about impact analysis and the definitions and approaches

72
00:06:23,873 --> 00:06:29,293
ours. describe here we have a review of what the problem is the scoping. we select

73
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:34,833
indicators are measuring something that we care about. we come up with

74
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:40,153
an impact assessment where we evaluate the indicators often numerically. we might use

75
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:45,583
modeling to figure out what's gonna happen in the future okay and then in the EIS

76
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:50,923
process we look at alternatives and those alternatives have to be evaluated so we would use the modeling

77
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:56,343
for that as well. we put it all together and we make recommendations and decisions. so in this

78
00:06:56,343 --> 00:07:01,343
modeling plays a central park. okay. because we need to figure out what are

79
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:08,743
the future impacts of alternatives. so that's how it relates to impact analysis.

80
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:13,843
so this slide has some of the jargon that you need to know. okay.

81
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:18,883
if I am modeling to predict what's gonna happen. okay.

82
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:24,101
I call that simulation and in the context of say climate

83
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:29,261
change in temperatures I might say we're gonna have a business as usual and

84
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:34,661
that's the scenario that we're gonna look at and again I will simulate that scenario.

85
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:40,061
okay. if I wanna learn what's important to the functioning

86
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:45,661
of the system. you know the words how important is it that I

87
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:51,921
put back the cafÃ© standards that the administration remove these are the mileage standards.

88
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:57,221
how much of a difference at is me then I'm trying to see what's

89
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:02,441
important and we call that a sensitivity analysis mathematically.

90
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:08,521
I take my again my simple dependent and independent

91
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:14,761
structure and parameter model relationship and I change one of the inputs.

92
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:20,281
okay and I see how much the model result changes and that's one way to to investigate

93
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:25,658
us instantly okay another example if you're into

94
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:30,738
natural systems or water systems. what's the limiting nutrient. okay and

95
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:35,818
how much is that change results as compared to something that's not limited. well it oughta

96
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:40,938
be greatly different if it's a limiting. talk more about that. okay.

97
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:45,978
so this is what we call sensitivity now also sometimes called Prog gnostic modeling.

98
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:51,438
okay to try to understand what's happening. Sir Bruce. reason

99
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:56,898
or tomorrow is to generate alternatives or determine the best alternative

100
00:08:56,898 --> 00:09:01,958
and this might be done in a cost effective manner. what's the most bank you can get

101
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,078
with the box. this is what we call maximization for optimization.

102
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:12,078
and this is typically structured as a maximization or house com or the

103
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:19,278
minimization of the outcome subject to different constraints. what would be an example of a constrained

104
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,862
budget for example you only have so much money or you can only push the technology

105
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:30,062
so hard. we'll talk a little bit more about all these. I'm a fourth reason is

106
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:35,942
to identify behaviors that might affect the ability to

107
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:41,062
model to implement or change system and this needs to incorporate things

108
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:46,182
like risk averse medicine. how much people will cooperate with one another and this

109
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:51,502
is typically a different type of model than most of the others we call it again. unfortunately

110
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:56,682
simulations but it's also called gaming. okay. and they're all kinds of features based models

111
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:01,942
for example that might be used for simple rules to figure out how collected but he's

112
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:07,342
okay. questions on this. so again what I want you know is simulation sensitivity

113
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:13,762
analysis optimization and gaming. just kind of application.

114
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:19,486
there's more. okay if I wanna know what's gonna happen in the future to forecast something

115
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:24,846
I call that forecasting. okay so basically we might simulate an energy scenario and forecast

116
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:30,586
what is the time change now. no other reason

117
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:36,166
to model is a little more complex in the sense of assigning culpability

118
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:42,406
or who's responsible in this folder spank him to figuring out what's a good way to control the situation.

119
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:47,666
the example that I work with the most is a portion minutes of particulate

120
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:53,646
matter in the air for example if we go out and measure air quality we might see that

121
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:58,866
today it's very clear day but if I go back a few other days some of those hot and hazy days.

122
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:04,186
we might've had a particulate matter concentration of say twenty five micrograms per cubic meter.

123
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:09,766
okay who's responsible for that. there are

124
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:14,786
millions of sources. pollutants coming from long range they come in

125
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:19,788
from nearby. I wanna know how to bring the p.m. level down

126
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:29,968
how why figure out who's responsible. so anybody you know how to do this.

127
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:48,528
yeah.

128
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:53,528
okay so what you're telling me is what we call receptor modeling which is based on the composition of the

129
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:58,528
particles that I measure and matching that to different source characteristics that's

130
00:11:58,528 --> 00:12:04,168
model. that's a statistical model. I could also use a simulation model by modeling

131
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:09,348
contributions from cars power plants and other things and then seeing who is

132
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:14,608
actually putting out the pollution I calls this level at this location.

133
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:19,802
so those are two very different approaches ones receptor modeling based on what I measure

134
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:25,142
location and the other is a simulation model using typically a dispersion model.

135
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:30,722
good. seventh reasons

136
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:35,902
model is just because it's cheaper to manipulate a system with a computer and you know with

137
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:41,082
and actually build something and test it out and so it's

138
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:46,282
clearly not feasible to do a lot of things that you can actually quite simply model

139
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:51,442
the complexity of the world is another reason you know for talking

140
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:56,442
about things like climate change or some many factors that go into it and she using

141
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:02,082
the parts of different pieces and their significance as possible without a mathematical

142
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:07,442
structure and then finally will use models

143
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:12,762
because we have to. okay. EPA says you need must do this.

144
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:18,462
okay. or whatever. alright questions on this page

145
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:23,522
good. so I'm from the NRC

146
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:29,582
review. there's a little bit of text about how the EPA is using models and

147
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:34,902
you know they have a very long history here and you know all models

148
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:40,442
simplification 's. but you know what we need to do is focus on what's important

149
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:45,462
and we need to understand how good the model. 's. okay and

150
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:50,742
so that's really some of the points that are made here. lot of other points as well. now I talk

151
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:56,662
to you about optimization. I mean if you have ever run an optimization model before.

152
00:13:56,662 --> 00:14:01,670
okay. good you know this is some sort

153
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,150
of micro economic types of things but for example if you're looking at chemical exposure could be a worker

154
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,370
or a community whatever as I tried to bring it down by using better source controls

155
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:18,050
or possibly different materials. the cost of doing this may increase.

156
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,610
okay. and we have sort of a exponentially increasing cost

157
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,990
in this picture as I tried to eliminate eliminate the chemical exposure.

158
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,170
alright so this is just sort of hypothetical graph now for

159
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,210
any particular little point on this

160
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,410
plot. some of them are feasible and some are not feasible and what I'm showing you here

161
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,650
is a location where I have say moderate chemical exposure. okay. based on

162
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,750
the X scale and the control cost is fairly high and based on this

163
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,847
plot. what I should be able to do is to bring down the cost

164
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:05,227
get the same chemical exposures so I could optimize this

165
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:11,147
by reducing the control cost by maybe improving the process for the technology and achieve the same

166
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:17,787
level of chemical exposure maybe better than that would be to go in this direction

167
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:22,907
by which I greatly reduced the chemical exposure. but

168
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:28,347
the control post doesn't change. okay so both of these are examples

169
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:33,607
of optimization and the point of the optimization is to get on this curve

170
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:39,047
which we may call the French here is a production service curve or something like that depending on where you are in economics

171
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:44,127
and social well for things and stuff like that. okay. but the main point is don't

172
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,187
be in this yellow area because you can always do better in terms of lower cost

173
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:56,787
or better for for everybody see that. okay. question.

174
00:15:56,787 --> 00:16:04,771
yeah. so

175
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:09,811
yeah. so you know technology changes things get you

176
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:14,931
know your cell phone gets more powerful for the same cost and so forth. so you know if

177
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:19,951
you're looking at your cell phone performance or something on a load of high scale.

178
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:29,811
maybe you can upgrade without increasing your cost. okay.

179
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:36,791
okay so let's talk about the doesn't that's completely unrelated samples. let's say you have um

180
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:42,231
a water treatment plant it's discharging some pollutants

181
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:47,731
and it's deciding whether to put on primary treatment secondary

182
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:52,931
treatment for serious treatments go up and clean up or whatever. each of those things

183
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:57,971
cost money. okay. and as I put on the additional layers of cleanup.

184
00:16:57,971 --> 00:17:05,605
I reduce the exposure. but my cost goes up okay so the question is

185
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:11,385
up here. I might not have a very effective choice of cleanup strategy.

186
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:16,625
so I can do the same performance. okay. by using

187
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:23,885
a better. 's smarter selection of cleanup strategies. that's all. so. okay.

188
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:28,985
can I get to this point right here. the

189
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:34,045
reason is that this to find is what's feasible or possible to do and you

190
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:39,265
know the point I'd like to be as low. we're zero chemical exposure and low

191
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:44,725
cost. but technically that's not feasible. okay. so this is what's called and feasible

192
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:49,745
region. this is a feasible region. but the only possible reason. region or

193
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:54,905
set of solutions is on the score everybody with me on us.

194
00:17:54,905 --> 00:18:01,293
now that was a good. simple question. first question is

195
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:10,793
what's the best solution.

196
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:16,093
what doing are you. okay. my reasons for anything.

197
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:22,373
okay. when

198
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:28,353
yeah visual privileges anywhere you want be disappointed is woman's role black loss.

199
00:18:28,353 --> 00:18:38,433
okay. because the rush is sort of contextual policy determines whatever

200
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:44,353
like the regulated except you're looking at this like this is their basement

201
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:50,073
right across from us right there probably had a

202
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:55,573
lower cost that they can achieve. they were the

203
00:18:55,573 --> 00:19:00,845
first year was a story sure. so if you know the regulator

204
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:06,385
said you can't have exposure. more 's. this is where. they are okay.

205
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:12,025
so this is basically you know some sort of micro economic types of approaches

206
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:17,425
or basic optimization thinking about a trade off with one parameter

207
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:23,365
here. okay and showing you feasible and infeasible and optimal solutions.

208
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:28,765
okay. models can be used to define this person

209
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:33,885
right to figure out the best that you can do and I'll show you an example now.

210
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:39,565
if you look at any reasonable projects for example the highway expansion.

211
00:19:39,565 --> 00:19:44,725
you've got cost issues you've got air quality issues you got safety you've got noise you got all kinds

212
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,725
of other issues and that kind of production front here here it has to be

213
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:54,805
looked at in multiple dimensions because you got multiple trade-offs going on. okay. so there may

214
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:59,989
not be a simple solution to it but still models can help clarify this

215
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:05,389
kind of example is typical for pretty much all projects that require modeling.

216
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:10,469
there's a lot of information many people are involved boundaries and even

217
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:15,669
the scope of the problem is not is not clearly defined the loss of objective

218
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:20,789
lots of constraints. complex relationships. nonetheless you know I would still argue

219
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:25,829
the models play a pretty essential role here. okay. because it's an explicit statement of

220
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:31,409
what you think is happening. okay. may not be the way policy is made.

221
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:38,979
but is your best kind of technical rational turn to to improving the outcomes

222
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:44,319
okay. 's founders. so bold reasonable model really important. the

223
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:49,319
climate change model. 's and I mentioned is got an this enormous boundaries the

224
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,619
entire globe for example that might be needed

225
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:59,799
given the nature of the problem. typically though that kind of model is not tractable

226
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:05,179
and amenable to analysis and we need to break it up and simplify it.

227
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:11,399
so selection of a boundary is really important for that. boundaries can be institutional

228
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:16,919
defined by the regulator can be economic can be environmental.

229
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,319
these are all factors that can influence the boundary and the boundary of the model

230
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,479
environment is different. often is a geographic scale of temporal scales

231
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:34,099
and functional with media pathways and contaminants are involved.

232
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:39,308
one of the examples that sometimes I use for this is an application for

233
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:44,328
that steam assisted gravity oil sands extraction that I showed you on

234
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:49,728
the first day and this is like third of the third. it's a huge

235
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:55,888
state you know huge province in Canada and they do find the study area

236
00:21:55,888 --> 00:22:02,328
for water quality impacts based on the drainage

237
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:08,948
with the idea that this is where water quality impacts would

238
00:22:08,948 --> 00:22:14,328
apply on the other hand the air quality impacts for much broader

239
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:19,488
and so you know I can go on at length here but you can have multiple types of projects or model

240
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:26,128
boundaries depending on what you're looking in the same so much.

241
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:31,308
okay. next destination. mass balance modeling. some of you. I hope

242
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:36,568
are familiar with those sort to be familiar with us. yes no.

243
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:41,604
alright well this is important message balance modeling is a process of

244
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:47,044
accounting for transport that's the chemical movements in the face

245
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:52,184
that's a degradation accumulation vibe accumulation et cetera. of typically

246
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:57,264
contaminants in different environmental compartments. you are an environmental

247
00:22:57,264 --> 00:23:02,444
compartment. okay. or what body is an environmental

248
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:07,804
compartment key terms in the mass balance modeling.

249
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:13,464
are the source. where is the mass and this is really contemporary

250
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:19,244
and it's coming from what's up halfway house getting there.

251
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:24,444
what's the sinks. this is a location where the containment is ultimately stored

252
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:29,664
or integrated or transferred out loading toward input or flux

253
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:34,824
deals with the rate at which the sources and meeting the contaminants

254
00:23:34,824 --> 00:23:39,904
and the mass balance is that this home of everything entering that

255
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:44,984
compartment should match with leaving it in what's being

256
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:50,424
stored. okay. so let me make this more real to you.

257
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:56,144
hey if you go swimming in like Michigan or boating rooms and look. alright. good big like right.

258
00:23:56,144 --> 00:24:01,164
so on the left panel we're showing estimates from a very large study that

259
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:06,624
was done a while back for mass balance of PC bees and this one is Mercury

260
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:11,764
doesn't matter which one we look at DC Beach. most of the PC bees coming

261
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:16,944
into the lake. okay. come in from the Fox River because

262
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:22,744
it's contaminated superfund site. so they come in through this water pathway.

263
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:27,764
there is Kalamazoo River. we talked about that. okay we know it's contaminated because of those

264
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:33,124
paper mills. there is smaller loading 's and the size of these bars indicate

265
00:24:33,124 --> 00:24:38,744
about how much is coming in from some of the other ports along the harbor

266
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:45,106
where's most of the PC becoming

267
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:50,306
from the Fox however the blue arrow showing that hair

268
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:55,806
deposition atmospheric loading over the surface of the lake which is large

269
00:24:55,806 --> 00:25:01,006
is in fact responsible for most of it. okay. almost a twenty year or more

270
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:06,526
that's more than twenty years. 's son and a half year. okay.

271
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:11,786
somewhat larger than the combined tributary loading switcher three one twenty five kilograms.

272
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:16,966
okay. same thing on the rights for Mercury we have tributary a

273
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:22,066
loading 's of Mercury coming in some of the same locations are there but

274
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:27,066
the atmosphere closings are also dominant. interestingly the levels are about

275
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:32,306
half of the Mercury cases it's coming but their

276
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:37,326
portion to someone something. so what we have in those pictures is

277
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:42,644
depicted better here. we have stuff coming in from the air okay

278
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:47,644
in terms of kilograms per year comes in and rainfall comes dry particles comes

279
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:53,044
from absorption gas to the water. okay. we have some coming from shoreline

280
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:58,344
discharges and river discharges and things like that. okay. and

281
00:25:58,344 --> 00:26:03,944
this qualifies in a different estimate the kilograms per year that are coming in

282
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:09,024
now in billboard the or call here. we have a

283
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:14,244
balance between what's coming in from the atmosphere and the tributaries and

284
00:26:14,244 --> 00:26:19,284
what's being incorporated into the surface sentiments down here. so some of the stuff. I

285
00:26:19,284 --> 00:26:24,444
mean it likes carbon rich fatty stuff so it's gonna be fine too and so soon

286
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:30,004
and will be incorporated in surface items. okay. some of those settlements get buried

287
00:26:30,004 --> 00:26:35,004
and they get into what's considered deeper less successful or deeper real.

288
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:40,184
basically gone from circulation. okay. and then we also have

289
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:45,310
some losses do to a little bit of degradation transformation and we

290
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:50,450
have Al flows via St. Mary's River at the top of the legs. so we lose a little

291
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,870
bit of peace TVs that way. the idea of the mass balances that all of these

292
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:01,330
songs at together in Mass.. okay.

293
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:17,820
so it's very complicated.

294
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,820
Joe that's a very good point yeah and as they degrade it may change their bio

295
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,880
accumulation characteristics and so forth. so yeah it's a multi step process for PC bees

296
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:37,380
and this is one of the concerns that just they're so persistent.

297
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,520
yeah bio it is kinda incorporated into this and it's not really brought out separately.

298
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,920
this is very complicated. okay. my point here is to not get into the subtleties

299
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:54,280
but to talk early mostly about the past wage but you're up.

300
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,300
okay. a couple other points from this. we have pathways that are two way here

301
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,880
we have deposition absorption coming in but we also involve socialization. okay. so it's

302
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,200
really we need to look at the net. okay. second thing is where

303
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,225
is most of the PC being in the system

304
00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:22,065
absolutely look at the settlements and here it says forty two hundred kilograms in the settlements

305
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:27,485
in the water column. we have thirteen hundred kilograms still quite a lot.

306
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:32,485
okay but most of it's in the settlements and they don't even talk about the deeper buried settlements is

307
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:37,585
probably much much more there. we. don't okay. so the mass.

308
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:42,885
also tell the mass balance also tells us where the stuff is and in this particular

309
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:48,385
example. I have really models the water column the surface

310
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:53,945
settlements in the deep settlements the separate compartments and I'm tracking PC

311
00:28:53,945 --> 00:29:00,685
that are flowing into and out of each of those compartments.

312
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:07,845
we reduce you. hello

313
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:12,865
I can't recall okay that's

314
00:29:12,865 --> 00:29:17,905
a very complicated picture let's make it simple practical for us. we have inputs coming

315
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:23,665
in to some control volume some compartments and we have outputs.

316
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:28,745
okay so it maybe a stream flowing into a lake discharging and

317
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:33,765
generate the flow downstream. okay. what we want to do is track

318
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:39,105
what comes into our control volume. understand the slowest mass inputs or flux

319
00:29:39,105 --> 00:29:44,245
is coming in. flux is or discharge is coming out

320
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:49,885
and any reactions and accumulations that are occurring within this control going.

321
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:54,945
it's important to understand this language okay. control volume is something I do fine.

322
00:29:54,945 --> 00:30:00,245
okay it could be discrete logical things like a lake

323
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:05,305
it could be as cells in your body. okay. and in fact

324
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:11,051
exactly the same types of approaches might be use at the cellular or organist mistake level

325
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:16,251
okay so I might look at your liver your brain or something like that and that's what form two kinetic models

326
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:21,471
with the mass balance puts together the boundary

327
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:26,731
and the flows and it says that what I accumulate in the control volume

328
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:31,731
is equal to what flows in minus what flows out plus

329
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:36,751
or minus the reactions formation that occur within that control

330
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,751
bye. okay. and those reactions are typically negative

331
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:46,891
losing mass. we could be positive like with forms of contaminants or if there's no

332
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:55,971
is that zero and it's life simple and happy. Michael.

333
00:30:55,971 --> 00:31:01,071
everybody okay on this. if you don't like this. you gotta stop now

334
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:07,151
because guess much worse. alright. if you wanna think of this as a bathtub

335
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:12,225
and you're running the water in and then if it slows out you've

336
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:17,805
got your. okay. I don't care how you think about. if you wanna think about it is

337
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:23,005
you're making a recipe. okay and you're cooking and you're adding stuff into the pot. I don't

338
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:30,225
care. but you gotta have a conception in your mind. alright.

339
00:31:30,225 --> 00:31:35,285
so what I wanna do then is take that reaction and expression differential terms

340
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:41,085
where I have the mass flowing in but now I'm gonna look at in terms of a mass time per so it's rate

341
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:46,105
and then that's the inflow coming in minus the outflow plus or minus

342
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:53,465
a reaction. so I've taken exactly the same thing right here and I've just made it into a differential

343
00:31:53,465 --> 00:31:59,065
and I express this is rates now and then it's steady state

344
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:04,406
and this is a very critical assumption that means that the mass

345
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:09,505
in the control volume is changing on not changing over time.

346
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:14,845
so I can set the left side of the sequel to zero and that means that the inflows

347
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:20,005
are equal to the flows. so your bathtub has the same amount of water running as it does coming

348
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:25,325
out. so it doesn't overflow. okay. or whatever your model

349
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:30,565
is plus or minus the reaction to take place. Stacy is key

350
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:35,585
concepts because it allows us to really simplify model. if that

351
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:41,565
sometimes the case next. if there is no reaction

352
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:46,945
degradation or whatever. then what I'm modeling is what's called a conservative in

353
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:52,025
contaminants and there's no reaction. so that means that last term goes

354
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:57,745
away and then if I'm both conservative

355
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:03,445
and it's steady state. it's really sucks what flows and flows out

356
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:08,905
to Mass.. so many PC bees per year coming into Lake Michigan. is exactly

357
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:14,028
equal to what's leaving weakness the amount of PCP in the lake

358
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:19,447
system doesn't change. okay. everybody with me.

359
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:24,907
conservative in our study state mass balance modeling. that's really

360
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:39,427
key. alright. good move on.

361
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:44,468
absolute enough. okay. so you could have stuff coming in. you could degrade and

362
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:49,468
nothing slows out and and I case you have a steady state system for different

363
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:54,548
reasons. okay. study state is kind of a birds eye view you don't necessarily know what's

364
00:33:54,548 --> 00:34:00,392
going on just and know it's not change good question. others.

365
00:34:00,392 --> 00:34:05,511
okay. so really the key expression here is shown up here.

366
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:10,612
alright so stare at that recap mass balance

367
00:34:10,612 --> 00:34:15,771
modeling you need some well defined reactor system. you need to know what's flowing

368
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:21,191
across that boundary that reactor system. ideally you know about the transport

369
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:26,531
within the control volume and the kinetics the reactions take place

370
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:32,471
and you need to ensure that the model structure has some relevance to reality.

371
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:37,572
okay. which what we just did for like Michigan I know. okay. but you know we're

372
00:34:37,572 --> 00:34:42,612
simplifying. alright let's do a couple of silly

373
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:48,191
examples to make some of the stuff come home in other ways.

374
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:53,431
okay. imagine you have a stream flowing from left to right here and it is flowing

375
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:58,512
at specified volume and or or flow rate and we have an industrial

376
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:03,672
plant making a discharge and some of the parameters here are that these

377
00:35:03,672 --> 00:35:08,932
discharges seven hundred fifty milligrams per liter or total dissolved solids TES and

378
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:14,712
the discharge rate is a hundred cubic feet per second and I'm sorry about the whole class.

379
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:19,833
okay it doesn't matter the receiving water body has a height

380
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:24,972
of a velocity of a meter foot and a half for second with the forty five

381
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:30,472
feet depth of two feet and it has already. GTS involved

382
00:35:30,472 --> 00:35:35,512
at three hundred and ten milligrams per liter. okay. so my question to you is will achieve

383
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:40,532
your standard of say five hundred milligrams per liter be via lead. we and I turn

384
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:45,792
on we district. okay. just

385
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:51,252
a mass balance because I'm adding stuff I need to track it goes into a

386
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:56,414
receiving order I have the dimensions of that and so forth now there's

387
00:35:56,414 --> 00:36:01,635
a lotta subtlety in these problems and I'm going to simplify it

388
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:06,714
in reality will have a mixing zone such that the discharge from this facility

389
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:11,814
isn't going to be completely diluted or mixed and this is gonna have a mixing zone where concentrations

390
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:19,074
might be high. okay. blow that away. ignore that right now.

391
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:24,374
I have flows upstream and downstream I have concentrations upstream

392
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:29,434
I need to figure out what is the concentration downstream. recognize that

393
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:34,874
flow downstream is equal to both what the river 's flow was here plus the discharge

394
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:40,635
so I'm gonna need to account for that. I need to do a mass balance on move order for us

395
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:45,635
less. okay. I also need to do a mass balance on the containment

396
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:51,174
tedious. okay. so you guys could recognize

397
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:56,254
easily that this is just dilution case where the concentration is defined

398
00:36:56,254 --> 00:37:01,354
as the mass over the volume or the flow rate coming in for

399
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:06,435
walks mass per time. divided by the flow per time

400
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:11,435
the flow rates and so I can take the product of the concentration and the

401
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:16,614
discharge and this will give me a mass for time.

402
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:21,614
okay because the units here are milligrams per liter and if I say liters

403
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:26,974
per minute. then I get milligrams per minute. okay.

404
00:37:26,974 --> 00:37:32,175
and then the same for the river because I already have upstream stuff here.

405
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:37,214
so slow in the river times the concentration the river gives me another flux rate

406
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:42,774
a contaminant and then I just had to two flows and so basically what I'm getting here is the

407
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:48,114
milligrams per minutes for example divided

408
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:53,334
by the liters per minute the flow rate. the minutes cross off and then I just end

409
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:59,178
up with milligrams per liter concentration

410
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:04,259
okay. so this is why the previous line said make sure your units work out they match they need

411
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:09,259
to everybody with me on here. so you know I

412
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:14,379
throw in the data here and put in the parameters I do not have that flowing the river

413
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:19,398
and get a make a simplistic assumption that it's just cross sectional area times

414
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:24,438
the flow rate. thank as you me this long this flow here and I substitute the data

415
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:30,079
in there and plug away the unit should cancel out in the result like it is there.

416
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,839
okay it's just simple voucher right so if I was

417
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,839
working for CMS mass or

418
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,279
ramble environmental some other consulting firm and you know I pick my clients

419
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:52,218
would pay my normal rate of whatever it is because I do cheesy standard

420
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:58,059
and you can see I have a pretty precise answer.

421
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:03,078
so I can't are you guys are smiling with

422
00:39:03,078 --> 00:39:08,158
a basket. so this is incredibly simplistic model that kind

423
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:14,358
of precision is not warranted right there so many things I've potentially left out.

424
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:19,398
but I do get a result. okay and it is mass balance based. okay.

425
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:24,519
it's a simple dilution questions on. 's. why

426
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:34,698
might this be wrong.

427
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:40,019
you know and certainly

428
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:48,398
you know variation. great what else

429
00:39:48,398 --> 00:39:53,538
well search this yet I could be wrong. what else I leave I'll

430
00:39:53,538 --> 00:40:02,213
leave out anything besides variation

431
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:09,153
hey it's physically boost plus # maybe it's okay.

432
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:14,312
so you know we assumes a lot of things okay and it's really

433
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:19,693
need to look at the assumptions that you're made implicitly here. we assumed that the

434
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:25,032
mixing zones didn't occur it was uniformly and instantaneously mixed across

435
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:30,572
the reach of the river and as we'll talk later states to impose

436
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:36,532
separate requirements for the near field zone years of discharge okay but downstream

437
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:41,593
it will be fully it's just a question of how far downstream you to go I assume

438
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:48,673
infinite accuracy and we talked about that. I did assume that the mask was

439
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:53,693
in to did the grade were conservative. okay. and so you

440
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:58,792
know there is a physical basis to this model and that basis is again a match. I

441
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:03,913
actually did too bad spouses I just the water flow. I didn't account for evaporation or anything

442
00:41:03,913 --> 00:41:09,493
like that and I did mass balance on the.

443
00:41:09,493 --> 00:41:14,753
okay. so the critical point here in mass balance

444
00:41:14,753 --> 00:41:20,032
modeling is that you preserve mass. got 's a physical basis and the output he inflict those

445
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:25,713
changes plus reactions by I happen. okay.

446
00:41:25,713 --> 00:41:30,753
that's a critical. let's take the same model boosted up a level of complexity

447
00:41:30,753 --> 00:41:36,021
here. essentially the same type of approach but this case this is

448
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:41,142
Marlene let's model DOD anybody heard of DOD before biological

449
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:46,322
oxygen demand. it's a measure of how much oxygen is gonna be sucked out to metabolize

450
00:41:46,322 --> 00:41:51,422
typically ways. okay that's. present. you can think of it is just

451
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:57,382
another contaminants. okay. beauty. same river parameters

452
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:02,761
in this case we're discharging eight hundred milligrams per liter of DOD.

453
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:08,662
that's actually a law how much oxygen is in the water.

454
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:15,541
so anybody know often got some water in here.

455
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:23,922
smells like coffee though.

456
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:29,362
yeah much dissolved oxygen is the water does contain oxygen

457
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:34,681
need because fish to get the oxygen yeah it depends

458
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:40,141
on temperature. give me an order of magnitude.

459
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:45,582
good so you learn stuff here. it's not much of like ten milligrams per liter.

460
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:50,822
okay. not very much at all. alright. so it's easy to use it up and here were discharging

461
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:55,901
eight hundred milligrams per liter which means that you know we are super

462
00:42:55,901 --> 00:43:01,761
saturating and it's not really work but I mean there's gonna be this is a big

463
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:06,822
source of case going to a hundred liters to dilute each

464
00:43:06,822 --> 00:43:11,941
leader come up with something it's reasonable. okay. so again

465
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:17,082
I wanna figure out what's the deal D downstream and I care about dissolved oxygen

466
00:43:17,082 --> 00:43:22,801
because if it goes too low. what happens for us to high return belly up. okay.

467
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:28,721
typically we have rules to keep it above five or six milligrams per liter.

468
00:43:28,721 --> 00:43:33,944
okay so let's do the same thing

469
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:39,023
let's figure out what the DOD is in the receiving water by doing the mass

470
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:44,283
balance again multiplying the beauties just charge concentration

471
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:49,404
times the flow units again should match out and match up and I get three

472
00:43:49,404 --> 00:43:54,583
hundred twenty milligrams. this shouldn't surprise you because discharge here

473
00:43:54,583 --> 00:44:00,083
is diluted like a factor of two or three. okay. and so we end up with a just fresh

474
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:07,364
start. okay. this is still really hot right

475
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:12,763
now. beauty is a little different because

476
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:18,303
from TV because you know is it not conservative. it disappears

477
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:23,664
oxygen comes in the uh the surface of the water and plants and algae

478
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:29,124
and stuff in the water will save the water a little bit and it's common to describe

479
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:34,152
the DOD disappearance with the first order to Kay or reaction

480
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:39,152
like this such that the DOD I call that else the change with respect

481
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:44,291
to time follows the first order reaction with the rate constant eight one which is that the

482
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:49,751
oxygen nation rate times the concentration. typically Kay

483
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:54,791
is on the order of point two point three per day. so that means that if I

484
00:44:54,791 --> 00:45:00,251
start off with a PO Dave what did I say it was three hundred and twenty

485
00:45:00,251 --> 00:45:05,332
after one day. I lose roughly twenty three percent of it.

486
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:10,612
okay. because variation comes in beauty to grace. I can take

487
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:16,031
this solution by integrating it and I come up with a curve that looks like this for the boundary

488
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:21,112
conditions plus the beauty needs to disappear at equal. and if

489
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:26,672
I look at the you know the DOD at time team compared to the initial DOD.

490
00:45:26,672 --> 00:45:31,672
just they'll right at the or source a time T four zero. it's just a racial

491
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:37,202
one and as I moved down in time it disappears and so at the

492
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:42,242
and I can take the log of that and you get a straight line. okay you seem us in

493
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:47,242
calculus before the key idea here is that how long this is take for LT did

494
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:52,462
this decreased by half half would be here. go down I guess three

495
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:57,521
or four days something like that. okay that makes sense if I'm losing about twenty percent per

496
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:02,822
day. everybody with me on this first order disappearances

497
00:46:02,822 --> 00:46:07,902
exponential decay to first order process. alright. this is the way

498
00:46:07,902 --> 00:46:13,202
we typically model kinetics of something that has been fairly

499
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:18,281
constant worry. so let's apply that model and the

500
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:23,422
key governing piece of this models that expression there and here to

501
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:29,382
answer this question I need to understand what time to live close in to my model

502
00:46:29,382 --> 00:46:34,683
because rate is continuously decreasing over time so I need to determine

503
00:46:34,683 --> 00:46:40,063
the travel time and in this always use the river velocity

504
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:45,364
and just to find the travel time is that distance. Jesus of interest. bless you.

505
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:50,803
divided by the velocity and the prom asked you to calculate the beauty

506
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:57,604
at different distances and so for example at point one mile.

507
00:46:57,604 --> 00:47:02,803
I do the math and it's six point zero zero four days to get there. alright

508
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:08,483
so the river is moving along at a meter and a half a second I mean not that fast going

509
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:13,921
only point one miles paper for long distance okay then

510
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:19,361
I'd take the concentration right downstream plug it into that

511
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:24,441
expression that I had before which was EXT to the rate

512
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:29,661
constant Kay one times the travel time that works out to be a point nine nine nine one

513
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:34,681
and multiply those two together and I get still three hundred

514
00:47:34,681 --> 00:47:39,701
and twenty. 's. so what what's going on. I just said that

515
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:45,401
I have first older loss. but I'm ending up with the same concentration ability.

516
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:52,001
why

517
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:58,981
I accounted for decay.

518
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:04,822
yeah

519
00:48:04,822 --> 00:48:10,624
yeah there's been no time it's the same as when I took water I didn't have enough time goodbye.. exactly

520
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:15,685
okay. so ten miles downstream it takes point four days. I do

521
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:21,485
the same and. okay. and now I start to see about a ten percent loss.

522
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:26,624
okay. okay. I just didn't give

523
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:31,705
the system enough time to actually do anything. point one.

524
00:48:31,705 --> 00:48:36,845
okay. so here I had to add an additional kind of calculation to figure

525
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:41,864
out the travel time to put that into the model. I have pretty much the same assumptions

526
00:48:41,864 --> 00:48:47,665
as the instantaneous mixing model. I had dilution. I assume constant geometry

527
00:48:47,665 --> 00:48:52,805
constant velocity constant a rate with the first order disappearance and

528
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:57,885
so what I've actually done is solved a fairly complicated brawl by making up three models

529
00:48:57,885 --> 00:49:03,185
dilution model of degradation model transport models putting those together and coming

530
00:49:03,185 --> 00:49:08,325
up with us. 's. okay. so we in fact have a little

531
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:13,395
model system here what's the sensitivity of parameters

532
00:49:13,395 --> 00:49:21,935
remember what sense of you know this is what is it

533
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:35,814
somebody did you guys. okay. nobody knew.

534
00:49:35,814 --> 00:49:45,775
yeah. so based on what you saw here what do you think are most sensitive parameters.

535
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:54,034
so what do you think would happen if I doubled â

536
00:49:54,034 --> 00:50:00,034
yeah but probably wanna change huge amount because we only saw a ten percent change.

537
00:50:00,034 --> 00:50:05,294
good. so again this is physically based there's an empirical

538
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:10,294
portion of the beauty model because the option nation rate constant K one

539
00:50:10,294 --> 00:50:15,299
I just talked it from somewhere okay. and we have that parameter and testing that sense

540
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:20,438
to reach that parameter could be important. okay. good. alright let's

541
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:25,879
get to something a little more useful but importantly more complicated. okay.

542
00:50:25,879 --> 00:50:30,999
here is a classical picture of a 3D chemical transport and state problems.

543
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:36,999
we're basically I rid up my world into little control volumes.

544
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:41,999
I have bulk flow through this control volume. so you might have

545
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:47,099
a current flow number from this face of the cube exiting the space of the queue.

546
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:52,539
I have a geometry or actually set up such that axis

547
00:50:52,539 --> 00:50:57,559
that direction of flow. this is the convention. why is the

548
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:03,859
height is he is coming out to us this is not much of a convention it depends on the application.

549
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:09,158
the contaminate comes into the control volume. something might happen to it in here

550
00:51:09,158 --> 00:51:15,243
including it might react it might move up

551
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:21,063
down towards us or away from us. okay. and it could flow out.

552
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:26,163
alright. so we have to consider all the processes that are occurring within this cube

553
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:32,343
or control volume as well as the ones next to us in each dimension.

554
00:51:32,343 --> 00:51:37,883
okay. and this is kind of the basis of multiple

555
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:43,403
models including things like circulation models or climate models or river models and so forth.

556
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:48,463
where for example this cube is just one of those surrounding the earth

557
00:51:48,463 --> 00:51:53,623
or water body or something like that and you know one of the powers of

558
00:51:53,623 --> 00:51:58,863
computers is to be able to have potentially thousands or millions

559
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:04,103
of these control volumes are that all couple together with a number of equations and actually

560
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:09,383
get solutions. 's and so you can think

561
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:14,395
of these 's mass balance models for each of those control

562
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:19,395
volumes that are Hubble and the current

563
00:52:19,395 --> 00:52:24,555
state of the art in global models like this might be to have eleven to thirteen

564
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:29,635
levels here are potentially even more and

565
00:52:29,635 --> 00:52:35,175
now depending. one degree point something degrees

566
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:40,235
something like this. dimensions. so you'd have you know

567
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:46,675
thousands of

568
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:53,815
that models kind of work and pictured one media

569
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:59,995
system. this picture is showing how we might couple those to

570
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:05,055
multiple media including water and soil and we would be looking at

571
00:53:05,055 --> 00:53:10,183
processes section expertise as well and so we have for example

572
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:15,503
volatile as a nation absorption deposition settling and so forth.

573
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:21,123
it's just these compartments represent well these represent environmental compartments oil

574
00:53:21,123 --> 00:53:26,403
soil air border. we could add the biological component to that people

575
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:31,703
to industry to it whatever you like. the key idea here is that we have these different part

576
00:53:31,703 --> 00:53:38,583
of our mental compartments in different pathways.

577
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:43,963
so I I think I mentioned the other week that we have in the Great Lakes she's confined

578
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:50,346
disposal facilities for glass hills basically and they are um

579
00:53:50,346 --> 00:53:55,866
taking contaminated sediments that dump the in between two [INAUDIBLE] or the [INAUDIBLE] around

580
00:53:55,866 --> 00:54:01,566
the system and this picture is just showing you some of the pathways that might be operating

581
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:06,666
for contaminants like PC beans or whatever. we'd leak out.

582
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:12,066
they can include seepage see kids seepage. sorry

583
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:17,386
through the type which is typically not that well protected they have

584
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:22,586
precipitation coming through leading to infiltration and generations we changed into

585
00:54:22,586 --> 00:54:27,666
the sub soils. there are wind blown involved in relation to plant

586
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:32,666
uptake and loss plant materials. those are additional pathways. okay.

587
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:37,886
so here this picture is just showing you air water and

588
00:54:37,886 --> 00:54:46,346
soil compartments in the link 's.

589
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:52,753
very good question

590
00:54:52,753 --> 00:54:58,073
one guess what do you think that's good. it's also

591
00:54:58,073 --> 00:55:03,093
not very expensive and it's an

592
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:08,473
issue though. absolutely very vulnerable to storms and things like this

593
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:19,653
as well as not actually confining the material.

594
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:24,693
burns a better picture of contaminant migration pathways is this kind of classic picture

595
00:55:24,693 --> 00:55:29,833
that I no longer remember where I stole it from him but you know here we have

596
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:34,893
maybe agricultural runoff and industry discharge and it makes its

597
00:55:34,893 --> 00:55:39,913
way into the lake and what this is showing is five accumulation up through the food

598
00:55:39,913 --> 00:55:45,053
chain. you know and then into the fish and potentially

599
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:50,189
into the fisher people there's also exchange with the atmosphere three deposition

600
00:55:50,189 --> 00:55:55,550
involved civilization there's also the migration this way as well so this is the norm.

601
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:01,310
it should be considered the exception but

602
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:07,050
still quite complicated and most of our environmental laws regulate single media.

603
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:12,590
so you know if you look at the clean air act for example we didn't

604
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:17,830
until quite recently consider bio accumulation. mercury was not viewed as an issue because

605
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,989
the concentrations in here were very very low. however it added to

606
00:56:22,989 --> 00:56:29,310
the burden these aquatic systems.

607
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:34,570
another model more recent for Ben 's always hiring one of the

608
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:39,649
pH is that's considered a carcinogen. DAH is a probably cyclic our matter card you're curved

609
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:44,889
at least a couple of benzene ring stuck together the simplest thing Vaseline been

610
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:49,926
zero eight. is one that is considered among the more toxic this

611
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:55,186
is a result of a combustion byproducts and complete combustion anytime you burn

612
00:56:55,186 --> 00:57:01,806
something produces Beatrice and so we did a

613
00:57:01,806 --> 00:57:06,926
model. we're looking at the flows and so forth into the settlement quarter comps

614
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:12,446
soil air and the same sort of thing that might be done

615
00:57:12,446 --> 00:57:18,406
that was done with cities the and 's Mercury.

616
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:24,846
okay. I'm gonna switch gears a bit. any questions where we are right now

617
00:57:24,846 --> 00:57:27,866
and time for for free. the number. okay.

618
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:38,541
but it's really interesting. okay. okay

619
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:43,761
models can be very complicated and solutions may not be the same sort of thing that we

620
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:49,061
use before with the dilution models. we might not have the algebraic equations

621
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:54,581
we might have only differential equations and we need to be able solve them. this schematic

622
00:57:54,581 --> 00:58:00,281
here is just showing that you know if I have a true prediction on the blue line here.

623
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:05,621
I can estimate this by knowing the slope at this point and moving out to the future

624
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:10,741
for example coming up with an estimate. even if I don't know the true function.

625
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:15,881
okay. and so this is just an example of using the boiler point slope method or

626
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:21,441
something like that to come up with an estimate models protection.

627
00:58:21,441 --> 00:58:26,621
if var varies from the true value. okay. and you guys have done this

628
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:31,681
when you think about oh my bank account is paying two percent interest

629
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:36,715
so I have a hundred dollars the hundred and two dollars next year right but in fact if

630
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:41,875
they do daily compounding you know you'll have a little bit more. you just estimated with two percent.

631
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:47,055
alright. so you know this is the same sort of approach that might be used

632
00:58:47,055 --> 00:58:52,415
by growth models. and if you go back to

633
00:58:52,415 --> 00:58:57,735
sixties I think with Jay Forester. Mister Gross model where he predicted

634
00:58:57,735 --> 00:59:02,795
the population will continue to increase and we would over consumer resources and we

635
00:59:02,795 --> 00:59:07,875
have a crash as a result of running out of oil and food and everything. used he to

636
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:13,475
model such that the new population at the time she plus delta Chi

637
00:59:13,475 --> 00:59:18,723
's a one year or ten years or fifty years into the future is equal to the old

638
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:23,743
population plus the when I say old the population at

639
00:59:23,743 --> 00:59:29,203
the current time she plus the birth rate and the birth rate is expressed

640
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:34,843
in terms of birds per population time of or other ways times the population

641
00:59:34,843 --> 00:59:40,083
that we had times the delta T and then subtract all set the death rate.

642
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:45,423
express the same way with the death rate like this and so you can simplify by

643
00:59:45,423 --> 00:59:50,423
pulling together the fact that and tea and Delta team multiplies both

644
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:55,683
D and D. so I can associate that and I get that new population time

645
00:59:55,683 --> 01:00:00,823
to close delta T is the current population times the birth minus the death

646
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:05,883
rate times the same stuff over here and then I can K who's

647
01:00:05,883 --> 01:00:11,083
B- D and make that substitution and then have an it's plus delta

648
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:16,604
T minus and it's you over Delta T be very rates

649
01:00:16,604 --> 01:00:22,244
and that's going to be just what's left on the right hand side and then if you remember the fundamental

650
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:27,404
of fear calculus he let Delta T go to zero or two very small values and

651
01:00:27,404 --> 01:00:32,604
you come up with a differential equation such that the change in population with respect to time

652
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:37,684
is equal to cater to people 's looks familiar. yes because we did

653
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:43,704
the same thing for the beauty disappearance just sort of first.

654
01:00:43,704 --> 01:00:50,364
you know what process. okay. now it's for is a population.

655
01:00:50,364 --> 01:00:55,584
I'm so we can solve that in different ways we could use calculus solution

656
01:00:55,584 --> 01:01:00,704
we could use an iterative solution where we say okay. plus

657
01:01:00,704 --> 01:01:05,844
a one year and we calculate that and that gives us next year 's population we plug

658
01:01:05,844 --> 01:01:10,924
that in here and get a year after that and so we could use this and this is called

659
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:15,932
the oilers mess that point slow method and point here and it's not worth going through

660
01:01:15,932 --> 01:01:21,352
much you know as I do incremental calculations and

661
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:26,672
I can come up with estimates for population over next you know fifty years.

662
01:01:26,672 --> 01:01:31,692
and of course I'm making errors because I'm assuming it's a linear step in each of those and

663
01:01:31,692 --> 01:01:37,012
it's not one way to reduce the error is to make a smaller

664
01:01:37,012 --> 01:01:42,452
time intervals. okay. and if I love those time intervals go to very very small.

665
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:47,452
I'll probably gonna get more results so this is just showing you the numerical

666
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:52,712
integration or differentiation technique can come up with good answers. if you

667
01:01:52,712 --> 01:01:59,392
have small enough step sizes but

668
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:04,452
for this problem since I have an algebraic

669
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:10,552
solution to that governing equation. I should use a calculus

670
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:15,728
because I make no errors right. so basically here

671
01:02:15,728 --> 01:02:21,348
use the analytical solution because it's correct. I don't need to use in the need differential

672
01:02:21,348 --> 01:02:26,428
or the iterative or approximate solution. okay.

673
01:02:26,428 --> 01:02:31,768
so if you have a choice which one to use use analytical

674
01:02:31,768 --> 01:02:37,748
wanted to develop obviously but still realistically

675
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:44,368
most of the numerical message that would be used are pretty good to you states.

676
01:02:44,368 --> 01:02:49,768
this brings me to another really important and this is really the central piece the of

677
01:02:49,768 --> 01:02:54,788
lecture today is the notion of the governing equation and this is usually

678
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:59,908
a differential equation represents the way we think about process what is

679
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:05,588
actually in know mass balance context happening. okay to

680
01:03:05,588 --> 01:03:10,768
get differential equation or a governing equations solved we need initial and boundary

681
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:15,796
conditions and then in cases there are analytical solutions can be used

682
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:20,816
and we've already talked about the one for the disappearance of. good. I wanna move on

683
01:03:20,816 --> 01:03:26,756
with his questions in most cases in this course.

684
01:03:26,756 --> 01:03:31,796
governing equation is related to mass amounts. okay we

685
01:03:31,796 --> 01:03:36,796
can also do the energy balance. okay. we can do temperature

686
01:03:36,796 --> 01:03:42,596
balance. please all interacting types of

687
01:03:42,596 --> 01:03:47,876
systems. so this is compares numerical and Kosovo solutions

688
01:03:47,876 --> 01:03:55,056
I'm not gonna do that next model. most important one. okay.

689
01:03:55,056 --> 01:04:00,116
full Easter. conservative chemical reactor what's most important here is the and snows

690
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:05,436
chemical reactor. same kind of box I had before control volume has a concentration

691
01:04:05,436 --> 01:04:10,476
inside seal volume inside the. we have stuff flowing in the concentration coming

692
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:15,682
in enough low rate to we have stuff flowing out at a

693
01:04:15,682 --> 01:04:21,342
concentration see out queue out. I have stuck in a little propeller here

694
01:04:21,342 --> 01:04:26,542
which means that it's fully mixed in size. okay. so if you're thinking about

695
01:04:26,542 --> 01:04:33,022
late. no structure to lake is completely mixed.

696
01:04:33,022 --> 01:04:38,282
we're gonna study the transient response of this we're gonna assume again if a defined volume

697
01:04:38,282 --> 01:04:43,542
and has rigid walls. we have the masters inside of this is the product

698
01:04:43,542 --> 01:04:48,602
of the concentration times the volume right because milligrams per liter time a 's number of

699
01:04:48,602 --> 01:04:53,882
leaders multiply those together I get milligrams mass. alright and

700
01:04:53,882 --> 01:04:59,002
we're also gonna say this is basically completely full. okay so what flows and flows out

701
01:04:59,002 --> 01:05:04,002
because the walls are rigid

702
01:05:04,002 --> 01:05:09,062
everybody weather. so then we're gonna try to Mass. in that reactor

703
01:05:09,062 --> 01:05:14,622
exactly the same thing I did for the mass change with respect to the time is

704
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:19,738
been changed in the time speak over time. this is equal

705
01:05:19,738 --> 01:05:25,618
to a close and minus four close out that's all there is to it. conservative so there's no reaction.

706
01:05:25,618 --> 01:05:30,738
alright. the volume is constant

707
01:05:30,738 --> 01:05:35,958
queuing it is equal to queue out. see how is that equal to see and so I convinced do a few

708
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:41,458
substitutions and I get the governing equation. the volume of the system times a change in concentration

709
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:48,198
overtime is equal to the difference between what flows and flows

710
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:55,730
differential equations. so be careful

711
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:00,890
so again I have this differential equation but solve it. I'm not gonna send

712
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:05,910
much time in solving and I'll just give you the solution but we need an initial conditions.

713
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:10,930
let's assume that the parameters of the flow rate

714
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:15,930
is constant. just to make it simple. let's assume that flow the and

715
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:21,170
the concentration in the slogan is Constance. okay so if it's a water body

716
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:26,750
with the stream feeding into it the stream is the same flow in the same concentration. okay.

717
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:31,990
and let's assume for the initial condition that the reactor has

718
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:37,470
a concentration seasonal whatever happens to be just known at the initial time.

719
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:42,570
okay. the solution is shown here quick concentration

720
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:48,110
of time she is equal to the concentration of the influence.

721
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:53,330
times is one minus Ext 's to to you over V. this term here. 's

722
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:58,599
plus the initial concentration seen often times the storm over here.

723
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:04,499
so what we have is two pieces to this. we have the affect of the inflows

724
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:09,859
and if you look at this expression as she gets big yak speed to the minus

725
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:16,119
infinity goes to zero and so we have one minus zero so we end up with CNN.

726
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:21,539
save us in picture the on second the over here we have the effect of the initial condition

727
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:27,219
as she equals to zero and this is one

728
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:32,579
and we have just seen. off so basically what happens

729
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:37,719
is we have these two pieces that song together reflecting the

730
01:07:37,719 --> 01:07:42,899
inflows and what we started with and there's a balance between us. let me give you a couple

731
01:07:42,899 --> 01:07:48,439
of examples before I do that. let me just know that you've heard of fox models before

732
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:53,639
this is a box model but we're looking at it dynamically completely

733
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:58,659
weirded example. our renters in Ann Arbor.

734
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:04,539
you if measure the humidity in your apartment bed it's pretty high at times.

735
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:09,579
I don't want to get you excited. but you know mold and bed bugs and all this kinda stuff like

736
01:08:09,579 --> 01:08:16,339
warm or humid conditions. anyway

737
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:21,739
let's assume you just purchased or rented a damp apartment

738
01:08:21,739 --> 01:08:26,759
and you have fire aerosol concentration in there and I'm just gonna call the

739
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:33,799
thousand see if use per cubic meter which is see if you

740
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:38,799
call me farming unit so it's some viable bio. errors okay. Reynolds

741
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:44,259
bro. that's a little high we you don't like it to be a thousand years of use

742
01:08:44,259 --> 01:08:49,539
and so your ventilation rate in your apartment is about a thirty change

743
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:54,567
for our pretty low because you're trying to save energy. okay you don't want see to so you

744
01:08:54,567 --> 01:09:00,407
take up the windows. okay. how long would just hate

745
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:05,487
assuming that there's no internal sources of mold for you

746
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:10,587
to drop a bio aerosol concentration

747
01:09:10,587 --> 01:09:17,267
from say a thousand a three hundred just five gallons

748
01:09:17,267 --> 01:09:22,287
the apartment volume is six hundred cubic meters the outdoor air concentration is two hundred. I mean

749
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:27,347
thereby worse falls outside that's where they came from. okay. so when this

750
01:09:27,347 --> 01:09:32,487
case can we use a east full coast volume conservative reactors the answer is yes.

751
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:37,587
your apartment is shown here we have a concentration outside of two hundred

752
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:43,467
we have initial concentration here of a thousand. let's plug in shop here with the equation.

753
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:48,687
the parameters are seen on his one thousand. the volume is

754
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:53,807
six hundred. concentration inside. I'm sorry flowing in is two

755
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:59,531
hundred and the airflow flow rate is the air change

756
01:09:59,531 --> 01:10:05,951
one third per hour times the volume. six hundred. so it's two hundred cubic meters

757
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:11,671
per hour. okay. everybody with me. so then

758
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:17,191
I plug in Charlotte and I put that in there see units express

759
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:22,431
and here is the solution express graphically. we started off at a thousand

760
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:27,571
after ten hours we're down to two hundred fifty or three hundred. as time

761
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:32,711
goes on to infinity. we end up with a concentration doesn't go down to zero.

762
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:38,911
why not because that's a outdoor concentration.

763
01:10:38,911 --> 01:10:44,771
okay. if I looked at the model. remember I told you the model was the sum of two pieces

764
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:49,851
that piece reflected the outdoor air coming in is the blue line it builds up to two

765
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:55,051
hundred. the initial fees from the thousand that was inside is the green

766
01:10:55,051 --> 01:11:00,223
line that drops down. the results is the sun shone us up

767
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:05,923
that's the two pieces of this model right here the flight. effective the inflows

768
01:11:05,923 --> 01:11:11,883
and the effect of the initial condition. so this is the transient response to

769
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:17,603
this model. and it's a for we stirred constant volume.

770
01:11:17,603 --> 01:11:24,023
conservative chemical reactor everybody with me on this.

771
01:11:24,023 --> 01:11:29,203
okay. now I want to take it up and knots and

772
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:34,443
swing those Pyro 's come inside their particles. okay

773
01:11:34,443 --> 01:11:39,763
their diameter is depending on the or mold whatever it could be ten microns diameter.

774
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:45,883
okay that's a fairly big aerosol it'll drop out and it will code your

775
01:11:45,883 --> 01:11:50,963
table top and your flooring your carpet or whatever. okay so there's

776
01:11:50,963 --> 01:11:56,883
a loss mechanism inside the apartment. so let's add

777
01:11:56,883 --> 01:12:01,929
to this chemical reactor this area going down which we have is Casey or first

778
01:12:01,929 --> 01:12:07,369
order loss we've seen this now. couple of times. everybody was me.

779
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:12,569
okay. so less than exactly the same assumptions

780
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:17,609
we add this mine is Casey to the governing equation.

781
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:22,809
okay. gets more complicated now. but essentially we have the info

782
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:30,689
is my see how flows plus or minus the reaction a reaction this case is really just.

783
01:12:30,689 --> 01:12:35,723
again I can defined governing equation

784
01:12:35,723 --> 01:12:41,263
have my parameters make it simple that there constant. I added the degradation

785
01:12:41,263 --> 01:12:46,963
lost now. I need to do find a couple of things to handle that in this framework.

786
01:12:46,963 --> 01:12:52,043
I'm gonna talk about retention time. and this is the meantime particle would spend

787
01:12:52,043 --> 01:12:58,123
in this in room my apartment or my control volume and that is equal to

788
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:05,863
the over a queue or I do find this as beta and

789
01:13:05,863 --> 01:13:10,863
it's the one over the attention time. which gives me units of time in

790
01:13:10,863 --> 01:13:15,863
verse and then I can add Kay which is also expressed in the same units of time

791
01:13:15,863 --> 01:13:21,003
and verse. 's I and can substitute

792
01:13:21,003 --> 01:13:27,023
that instead of simple care change I had before. into the calculus solution.

793
01:13:27,023 --> 01:13:33,122
don't worry about us. okay. just mechanics you need. you may need to. 's

794
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:41,002
so same problem. but in this case. I'm going to use a

795
01:13:41,002 --> 01:13:47,942
the GED as being

796
01:13:47,942 --> 01:13:53,082
one half per hour in other words half of the particles drop

797
01:13:53,082 --> 01:13:58,302
out in one hour in my apartment. okay. and

798
01:13:58,302 --> 01:14:03,522
I have the air change rate before which was one third for our fight eight

799
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:09,322
feet. she to it it's a third hour inverse

800
01:14:09,322 --> 01:14:16,242
plug and chug again and this is the result that I guess. okay. and the green line.

801
01:14:16,242 --> 01:14:21,322
what's important here is less. so the man but the interpretation before I

802
01:14:21,322 --> 01:14:27,042
got the verbal one. the concentration came down to two hundred.

803
01:14:27,042 --> 01:14:32,062
that was the same as the outsider concentration. now I have the same

804
01:14:32,062 --> 01:14:37,460
starting point but it comes down faster and then it approaches a level

805
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:50,660
of about a hundred one. tell me what's going on.

806
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:55,940
I lose your guys.

807
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:01,040
I have another process which is settling or loss that's occurring inside

808
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,080
the space. okay. and those aerosols come in but they are removed in

809
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:11,500
part and that's what I'm saying. please everybody with me on this.

810
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,640
this is actually a pollution control technology. okay. if

811
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:22,560
you had a settling pond in for example waste water treatment facility.

812
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,800
you just slow the water through a big pond or tank and the particles

813
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:33,140
settle out and then it moves along. okay. that's what your apartments is

814
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:40,318
with respect to the air exiting is cleaner.

815
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:51,858
okay next question. 's this is student state.

816
01:15:51,858 --> 01:16:04,258
you say yes. tell me what you mean

817
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:10,738
which variable do I care about air flows constant

818
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:15,998
settling rate is constant. the amount that settle. could very five

819
01:16:15,998 --> 01:16:21,258
high concentration side pass settle by below concentration has to settle in an hour.

820
01:16:21,258 --> 01:16:26,558
so that is going to change steady state is defined

821
01:16:26,558 --> 01:16:31,558
as the mass in the control volume is not changing the control volume

822
01:16:31,558 --> 01:16:37,076
is the apartment here it is changing so it's clearly not a steady state

823
01:16:37,076 --> 01:16:43,096
but once I get past maybe a day or so. it's not changing.

824
01:16:43,096 --> 01:16:48,616
so as long term aims the system is a certain.

825
01:16:48,616 --> 01:16:53,856
so make sense. this

826
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:58,896
is chemical reactor is not hypothetical it's been used thousands

827
01:16:58,896 --> 01:17:04,916
of not tens of thousands of times. here's a very simple example of an

828
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:10,316
on events in gas fireplace. you can buy these things. okay so put you

829
01:17:10,316 --> 01:17:15,956
them in the wall you just touch a gas line but you don't have an exhaust for it because

830
01:17:15,956 --> 01:17:21,136
industry says the combustion is very complete. just produces CO2 these

831
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:26,216
folks measure carbon monoxide and they turned it on to medium

832
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:31,356
flame and the CO levels increase like this. they turned it off

833
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:36,574
to decreased places. guess what that exactly follows the predictions from

834
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:42,294
our police third chemical costs involving reactor model okay

835
01:17:42,294 --> 01:17:47,834
interesting way when they had it on high flame CEO the level did not increase is

836
01:17:47,834 --> 01:17:54,714
much anybody able to interpret these CEO numbers by the way

837
01:17:54,714 --> 01:17:59,974
you know what the standards are for Seo. it's about nine

838
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:07,414
PPM. okay. so clearly we have a problem here. Houston

839
01:18:07,414 --> 01:18:12,434
and it's fire CEO with medium flame because combustion is not so good you've got like a

840
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:17,474
yellow flames compared to a blue flame so it's more product of incomplete combustion which

841
01:18:17,474 --> 01:18:22,834
include you. alright. switching

842
01:18:22,834 --> 01:18:28,294
gears. this development of the model is not a straightforward

843
01:18:28,294 --> 01:18:33,394
simple thing you need to have a client and application off model developer.

844
01:18:33,394 --> 01:18:38,736
if he's under ago conceptual development

845
01:18:38,736 --> 01:18:43,856
so I understand what you want and it needs to be implemented with the equations

846
01:18:43,856 --> 01:18:49,316
and coding and the interface it needs to be evaluated in terms of

847
01:18:49,316 --> 01:18:54,396
peer review and quality of short data sets and so forth and then

848
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:59,656
is only useful in fact if it's used and so when it's used you wanna be able to communicate

849
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:05,096
for example what the model says the uncertainty and so forth and this can be an iterative

850
01:19:05,096 --> 01:19:10,726
process. okay so this game just so so shows you that in terms

851
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:15,726
of the language that I want you to understand the formulation of the model typically

852
01:19:15,726 --> 01:19:21,126
follows this framework to find what you're trying to do in terms of objectives

853
01:19:21,126 --> 01:19:26,486
identified indicators or the outcomes that you care about. this is something

854
01:19:26,486 --> 01:19:31,806
I want to stress figure out conceptually what you're trying to do draw the conceptual

855
01:19:31,806 --> 01:19:37,566
model. make a picture. okay. identify the relationships the parameters

856
01:19:37,566 --> 01:19:42,766
constraints implemented and verify that it's functioning and check to see that it gives you something

857
01:19:42,766 --> 01:19:47,806
that's reasonable and feasible conceptual models I've added the

858
01:19:47,806 --> 01:19:52,826
slide because you need to think hard about what's important we get

859
01:19:52,826 --> 01:19:58,186
lost in the details you need to focus on what's important. some of the aspects of conceptual

860
01:19:58,186 --> 01:20:03,186
models are shown in the structure here. boundaries dimensions

861
01:20:03,186 --> 01:20:08,187
whether it's steady state or time depending. big choice you know what that means now

862
01:20:08,187 --> 01:20:13,307
mechanisms that affect transport and safety multimedia aspects of chemical

863
01:20:13,307 --> 01:20:22,207
physical biological sinks and sources and initial conditions need to the finals

864
01:20:22,207 --> 01:20:27,227
as a completely different example. were concerned about particle

865
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:32,707
exposures causing cardiac and pulmonary offense. particles

866
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:37,907
come from all kinds of sources traffic was the origins this particular conceptual model.

867
01:20:37,907 --> 01:20:43,347
it showing you that you have a fax on the autonomic and systematic systems in your body

868
01:20:43,347 --> 01:20:49,007
and very sick well I that occur as a result of exposure.

869
01:20:49,007 --> 01:20:57,007
not simple picture at least we've got a conceptually laid out here.

870
01:20:57,007 --> 01:21:02,547
there's another approach. if you are taking your stance course and

871
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:08,027
you all have some stance and model formulation and variable selection you throw everything

872
01:21:08,027 --> 01:21:13,153
into the pot stepwise or all possible subsets

873
01:21:13,153 --> 01:21:18,213
or some other kind of statistical techniques just make sense and you see what

874
01:21:18,213 --> 01:21:23,493
pops up. okay. and this is another kind of approach and you know I'm not gonna talk

875
01:21:23,493 --> 01:21:28,913
much about statistical models or next thank you. models

876
01:21:28,913 --> 01:21:34,213
are best developed for mass balance. you know hierarchical structure.

877
01:21:34,213 --> 01:21:40,193
and we need to find a system as the complex and the components that are interrelated

878
01:21:40,193 --> 01:21:45,373
because they share some purpose they. represent mastery different components and so

879
01:21:45,373 --> 01:21:50,513
forth. here's a picture of the Hydro power project we've already talked about this little bit. you

880
01:21:50,513 --> 01:21:55,793
could break us down into environmental system with water quality land recreation

881
01:21:55,793 --> 01:22:00,853
sedan itself the reservoir the power plant each of these can be further broken down. each

882
01:22:00,853 --> 01:22:06,013
of these could be modeled separately. the overall analysis might pull together

883
01:22:06,013 --> 01:22:11,069
these different models for the water treatment and distribution system the system slant

884
01:22:11,069 --> 01:22:16,169
but it could be. we have different steps involved in treating water. we might

885
01:22:16,169 --> 01:22:21,669
fluctuate out some of the stuff set out those clock filter at this in fact

886
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:26,909
distribute this is a schema tries to here with an additional

887
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:32,509
steps up Rio 's in nation rapid minutes this is pretty common for most water treatment plants.

888
01:22:32,509 --> 01:22:37,629
the reason I'm bringing this up is that each of the steps. we break down and we call

889
01:22:37,629 --> 01:22:42,729
it unit operation today and this is an engineering

890
01:22:42,729 --> 01:22:47,769
term but basically we analyze what's happening in one of these boxes develop

891
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:52,769
a model Ford a couple lives inputs to what happened before and it outputs what

892
01:22:52,769 --> 01:22:58,409
happened after it and we can come up with a very complex but very usable

893
01:22:58,409 --> 01:23:03,569
model by building movies by putting together these basic building blocks okay

894
01:23:03,569 --> 01:23:19,965
in the building blocks unit office um-hum

895
01:23:19,965 --> 01:23:25,325
it all depends we're not starting from scratch hardly anything but it depends

896
01:23:25,325 --> 01:23:30,325
on what your purpose. the data that you have available. so forth.

897
01:23:30,325 --> 01:23:35,805
free question. I'm gonna get to some of them gonna try anyway

898
01:23:35,805 --> 01:23:41,185
in these black and these unit office. they can be mechanistic week based. they can also

899
01:23:41,185 --> 01:23:46,645
be a black box. 's an example of a black box might be for example

900
01:23:46,645 --> 01:23:52,165
looking at combustion process where I know I put in fuel and I come out with CO2

901
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:57,225
and it's car monoxide and there might be proportionality 's that I use.

902
01:23:57,225 --> 01:24:02,525
I could feed nutrients in to an organism and produce products here. I am not

903
01:24:02,525 --> 01:24:07,605
gonna simulate probably every cellular thing that's happening in there but again treated

904
01:24:07,605 --> 01:24:12,805
as a black box okay. even being a black fox. we

905
01:24:12,805 --> 01:24:17,865
have constraints. we have to conserve mass storage geometry equilibrium

906
01:24:17,865 --> 01:24:23,285
kinetics energy and so forth potentially in Mass. balance models for usually

907
01:24:23,285 --> 01:24:28,505
looking at mass mass balance. so

908
01:24:28,505 --> 01:24:34,265
putting some of this together and what are useful models for us. we have

909
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:39,265
for environmental models for fate and transport contaminant migration. we have

910
01:24:39,265 --> 01:24:44,485
basically the emission sources for discharge and air pollution source of water pollution

911
01:24:44,485 --> 01:24:49,985
source whatever characterized by parameters that include emission rate

912
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:55,385
chemicals properties of them. we have feet transport characterize

913
01:24:55,385 --> 01:25:01,025
five dominant processes transport dilution reactions transformations

914
01:25:01,025 --> 01:25:06,445
and then we have receptors. what we were trying to predict typically human health

915
01:25:06,445 --> 01:25:12,763
and ecosystems and so forth okay. a couple of other points on here. take your questions.

916
01:25:12,763 --> 01:25:18,023
also different types of permission sources in the air context we might talk about point

917
01:25:18,023 --> 01:25:23,303
sources like the smoke mobile sources trucks and things like this in terms

918
01:25:23,303 --> 01:25:28,523
of fate and transport processes. we typically are looking at transformations

919
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:33,623
of what we call primary pollutants for example in the air case you might it

920
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:38,683
so has too but this gets transformed in the atmosphere to a reaction product.

921
01:25:38,683 --> 01:25:44,183
say sulfate ammonium sulfate or sulfuric acids. that's the second.

922
01:25:44,183 --> 01:25:51,447
okay. car here for us

923
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:56,567
yeah so what's happening in a black box is that I am not

924
01:25:56,567 --> 01:26:02,227
God. I do don't have a model that has equations for every transformation that's occurring

925
01:26:02,227 --> 01:26:07,507
and I have very much simplified the processes that are occurring in that system

926
01:26:07,507 --> 01:26:12,567
and so I specifically have it. relationship between what's going

927
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:21,827
in and what's coming out as compared to say a mechanistic or engineering type relations.

928
01:26:21,827 --> 01:26:27,147
associates are a fairly high level approach

929
01:26:27,147 --> 01:26:32,387
schema ties in what's happening in your model. they can show linkages of mass

930
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:37,607
or energy or information or whatever. this is one that we used for many

931
01:26:37,607 --> 01:26:42,887
years still being used in Europe where we soak energy pathways and still being used time in

932
01:26:42,887 --> 01:26:48,998
and change. we have emission control strategies.

933
01:26:48,998 --> 01:26:54,218
so if we're going partly cold partly gas partly nuclear.

934
01:26:54,218 --> 01:26:59,299
we might to look see what is the emissions from each of those units. this

935
01:26:59,299 --> 01:27:04,458
results and omissions in this case to air their atmospheric processes like and form

936
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:10,018
that ammonium sulfate that comes down as acid rain for example affecting the forest ecosystem

937
01:27:10,018 --> 01:27:16,198
and then we might have an environmental impacts that result as a result of that mission

938
01:27:16,198 --> 01:27:21,198
and this whole time. okay. we saw this before women

939
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:26,759
were running this from left to right. this is a forecast.

940
01:27:26,759 --> 01:27:32,319
what's gonna happen in terms of aquatic lake forest

941
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:38,178
in packs and so forth. okay. that's the scenario analysis

942
01:27:38,178 --> 01:27:43,259
right for a particular scenario on the other hand. what we've also done and this

943
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:48,538
happened in Europe and it happened to an extent in the US was we said you have to

944
01:27:48,538 --> 01:27:54,010
keep the amount of acid that's falling on these forest

945
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:59,150
systems below a critical load and below this

946
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:05,350
critical level buffering is sufficient not to sit a fine.

947
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:11,310
everybody with me. so this is a notion of critical loads of the maximum tolerable impact

948
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:16,390
without causing damage or maximum tolerable loading without causing damage.

949
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:21,530
that's that's a limit over here and then we moved backwards

950
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:26,930
to optimize this to come up with a lease cost strategy

951
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:32,070
to achieve that. okay. so again. system. a big

952
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:40,450
modeling system used forward and and reverse modes or some error analysis or.

953
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:45,510
so coming back to the question how to develop models. you know in a sense

954
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:51,111
it's a combination of the darkness I am sick heart there's many subjective issues science

955
01:28:51,111 --> 01:28:56,251
you know clearly there's a lot going on in terms of content knowledge here. couple

956
01:28:56,251 --> 01:29:01,530
of rules. know what you're doing okay. I mean that's kinda common

957
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:06,631
sense so you need an expert. you need data as well because you can't

958
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:11,711
develop a model for any practical purpose without updated. tell

959
01:29:11,711 --> 01:29:16,850
you if it's working and so there a lot of are issues and model

960
01:29:16,850 --> 01:29:21,990
development some you know some of them are listed here. again we're not starting from

961
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:27,091
scratch off and it's a question of what model is most appropriate overall those might

962
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:32,410
be used in those that might be used might be back of the envelope calculations for some incredibly

963
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:38,071
complicated system. so how do you select among them. models

964
01:29:38,071 --> 01:29:43,251
taken off the shelf and calibration. they need to be applied to local context.

965
01:29:43,251 --> 01:29:48,731
people are interested in how accurate they are. what errors. what are the areas for me.

966
01:29:48,731 --> 01:29:53,789
what fax results and so forth so you know if I'm looking at

967
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:59,928
models. I want something that explains what's going on. so my explanatory

968
01:29:59,928 --> 01:30:05,488
power are squared could be should be what

969
01:30:05,488 --> 01:30:10,809
you guys are taking stuff and epidemiology.

970
01:30:10,809 --> 01:30:18,189
what's the good of our square

971
01:30:18,189 --> 01:30:23,309
that would be marvelous. but I can get very useful results with point one point

972
01:30:23,309 --> 01:30:29,029
two as well. so it depends on the context. absolutely. okay.

973
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:34,229
second thing I want and I I wanna have point one point two for my feet and transport

974
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:39,448
model that's awfully low. okay. I also want the model to be consistent with

975
01:30:39,448 --> 01:30:44,448
explanations of mechanisms that I understand. okay. and that's what we'll call

976
01:30:44,448 --> 01:30:49,549
verification and then I wanted to be personally. 's. okay. basically as

977
01:30:49,549 --> 01:30:54,967
simple as possible still but roll and so in here in practice

978
01:30:54,967 --> 01:31:00,227
this means that I need to validate the model with real world data that I need to have appropriate structure

979
01:31:00,227 --> 01:31:05,426
and outputs and inputs to make it consistent with the mechanistic or structures and

980
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:11,047
I wanted to be as simple as possible. so these are things that I look for

981
01:31:11,047 --> 01:31:16,507
now. I have too much stuff here to deal with errors. but all models makes

982
01:31:16,507 --> 01:31:21,767
different types of errors and some of those errors are listed here. I'm not gonna spend any time on this right

983
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:26,787
now. additional deficiencies are shown here as well. so please just take

984
01:31:26,787 --> 01:31:31,866
a look at this. so you know you

985
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:38,467
have this famous quote from George fox at all models are wrong but some useful.

986
01:31:38,467 --> 01:31:45,127
okay. how much air and is tolerable is requesting question it really depends on the application.

987
01:31:45,127 --> 01:31:51,797
it depends on you know the ability of data to support

988
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:56,977
the application the model. and so forth. but you guys may not

989
01:31:56,977 --> 01:32:02,156
be model developers but you are gonna be models users and

990
01:32:02,156 --> 01:32:07,717
interpreters and you need to be able to understand the structure function

991
01:32:07,717 --> 01:32:13,196
of models. you need to understand where they diverge from measure.

992
01:32:13,196 --> 01:32:18,937
I won't say reality because measurements are not reality

993
01:32:18,937 --> 01:32:24,477
and so you need to be able to discuss and quantify those in certain. and you need to understand

994
01:32:24,477 --> 01:32:30,091
when your knowledge picks out. need to get somebody else

995
01:32:30,091 --> 01:32:35,571
but the most important lesson and I've seen some many times you go a in court room

996
01:32:35,571 --> 01:32:40,691
and as an example and some of the Texas flooding an expert was there

997
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:45,890
and said you know we design the spillway 's and the cold birds and it should've handled. five hundred

998
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:51,010
year storm. okay and there's billions of dollars of

999
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:56,490
damage and insurance companies and see out everybody else are suing everybody

1000
01:32:56,490 --> 01:33:01,530
left and right and the expert says you know but we engineer this is Central

1001
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:06,611
flooded and you know the defense or whoever says

1002
01:33:06,611 --> 01:33:11,611
did you inspect the river or the covert Burger whatever you know since I

1003
01:33:11,611 --> 01:33:17,010
looked it at with the satellite photo I know the slope got the roughness program and all this kinda stuff.

1004
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:22,091
if you go on there you would've seen the trees and the brushes and everything else growing in what

1005
01:33:22,091 --> 01:33:27,593
he assumed was a completely smooth toll for okay and the water obviously backed up

1006
01:33:27,593 --> 01:33:33,633
in something like this. so you need to know what you're dealing with as the well physical

1007
01:33:33,633 --> 01:33:38,893
ground truth is really important. 's lots of some examples like that.

1008
01:33:38,893 --> 01:33:43,893
some ways to find a good model. are listed here. choose the simplest one you

1009
01:33:43,893 --> 01:33:48,893
think is applicable applicable easy to validate provides what you want as the

1010
01:33:48,893 --> 01:33:54,033
features that you want. EPA. often doesn't give you that flexibility

1011
01:33:54,033 --> 01:33:59,154
they're gonna say use Emacs use our line. use whatever

1012
01:33:59,154 --> 01:34:04,393
newsies had one models for whatever they're gonna specify what you have to do. sometimes

1013
01:34:04,393 --> 01:34:09,613
they allow you to it use for phone models. typically people

1014
01:34:09,613 --> 01:34:14,654
don't use specified miles. I've got

1015
01:34:14,654 --> 01:34:19,654
two or three minutes left for a couple of important thing.

1016
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:25,493
models need to be evaluated prior to use. there's a language that corresponds

1017
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:30,516
to this process. I wanna go over that. make sure

1018
01:34:30,516 --> 01:34:35,555
you get that today verification is the first in the

1019
01:34:35,555 --> 01:34:40,796
model. it's a hypothetical test to see that the model works as you expect

1020
01:34:40,796 --> 01:34:45,996
in our apartment with the bio aerosol model. if I have more

1021
01:34:45,996 --> 01:34:51,055
rapid settling. would you expect the concentration to be higher or lower in the

1022
01:34:51,055 --> 01:34:56,175
or lower. yes it's better work that

1023
01:34:56,175 --> 01:35:02,276
way. okay so test model your with these hypothetical test calibration

1024
01:35:02,276 --> 01:35:07,555
is the process of finding an appropriate value of the parameter. okay

1025
01:35:07,555 --> 01:35:12,716
so what's at here change rate. make sure it's the right one. okay.

1026
01:35:12,716 --> 01:35:18,595
you need data to do this evaluation is taking

1027
01:35:18,595 --> 01:35:23,836
small data set typically in comparing your prediction with that data from

1028
01:35:23,836 --> 01:35:28,930
the real world. okay. it's a case by case evaluation

1029
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:34,390
because it's like one or two studies it doesn't tell you except whether working that context

1030
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:39,430
is not general logical validation as a result of doing

1031
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:44,650
a valuations many times using multiple data

1032
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:50,270
sets by different people. it's a much stronger standard. okay.

1033
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:55,650
and then solidity of the model is that it's been deemed

1034
01:35:55,650 --> 01:36:00,969
to give you adequate accuracy. okay after being validated

1035
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:05,989
for that particular application. alright so we see we've gone

1036
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:11,250
through a variety of different increasingly high bars to

1037
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:16,290
assess the model performance reasonable

1038
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:22,050
to you. who should do this. I just developed the pattern and model

1039
01:36:22,050 --> 01:36:27,370
which is like five thousand dollars. probably needs to be evaluated by an outside

1040
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:34,314
party okay. this would be ideal. really don't

1041
01:36:34,314 --> 01:36:41,754
hates GM believe it or not has a standard for model validation third-party

1042
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:47,314
assessors. you can look at that model validation is often very very difficult

1043
01:36:47,314 --> 01:36:53,234
I mean climate change models how we validate them. use we historical data. there's lots of gaps in the data

1044
01:36:53,234 --> 01:36:58,714
right. if things change in the future then we're gonna make a fallacy of extrapolation.

1045
01:36:58,714 --> 01:37:04,154
you know it's gets really really nice point is we need to do this despite

1046
01:37:04,154 --> 01:37:10,234
the shortcomings some of the questions here for validation are

1047
01:37:10,234 --> 01:37:15,734
highlighted. if I told you hardly any of the environmental models

1048
01:37:15,734 --> 01:37:20,814
are sufficiently validated but we still have to use them. if I tell

1049
01:37:20,814 --> 01:37:26,013
you in general many models are on validated. you still get on that airplane.

1050
01:37:26,013 --> 01:37:31,241
right that's been assembled with all kinds of structural models to figure

1051
01:37:31,241 --> 01:37:36,442
out whether it's strong enough to survive. who knows wind gust of lightning strike whatever

1052
01:37:36,442 --> 01:37:41,542
you still get on that plane right. well we do that because we

1053
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:48,122
have coping mechanisms some of the coping medicine mechanisms for example or to use a margin of safety.

1054
01:37:48,122 --> 01:37:53,181
okay. I mean this could be important. we also do

1055
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:58,181
sensitivity analyses and things like this but there's a cost to all. 's. alright.

1056
01:37:58,181 --> 01:38:03,602
and if you get into that plane and I can only take

1057
01:38:03,602 --> 01:38:08,681
ten passengers are better example you get into a skyscraper and they've made the concrete pillars

1058
01:38:08,681 --> 01:38:14,161
so strong that there's so little space last. okay for the occupied portion.

1059
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:19,502
obviously there's a huge cost us. so we want to have efforts that reduce the

1060
01:38:19,502 --> 01:38:24,542
uncertainties. it's really important. expressing the uncertainty is really

1061
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:25,493
important. I was just trying to quit yes
