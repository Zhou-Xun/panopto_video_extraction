[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:10,193
Let's take a deeper dive when it comes
to the variation of actions that happens

3
00:00:10,193 --> 00:00:13,389
state by state across
the United States for healthcare.

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:17,336
Even though most state constitutions
require states to protect the health and

5
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:19,450
welfare of its constituents.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,180
The organization and
authority granted to state and

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,410
local public health agencies,
vary substantially across the country.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,283
So therefore states have authority for
their own public health.

9
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:37,050
Most state constitutions require states to
protect health and welfare of the public.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,830
They assign this
responsibility to themselves

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,200
since this action is missing in the U.S.
Constitution.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,430
Take, for example, newborn screening for
sickle cell disease.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,600
Newborn screening is the practice
of testing every newborn for

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,640
certain harmful, or fatal disorders
that aren't otherwise apparent at birth.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,459
Newborn screening programs
exist across the country, but

16
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,440
what gets put on the panel for
testing differs state by state.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,175
In 1984,
a national recommendation was made for

18
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:10,170
sickle cell disease to be implemented
across the United States.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,090
However, it took 30 years for

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,540
the entire United States to
fully implement this test.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,880
This occurred because across the nation,
states differed in what the funding and

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,810
priority issues were.

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,050
States may establish
their own frameworks for

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,350
approaching a public health issue,
in the absence of a federal mandate.

25
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,810
Despite the federal government not having
legal authority over the health of

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,290
US citizens, it still contributes
a significant amount of influence.

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,714
Here, in this figure, we have
components of the public health system.

28
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:45,486
The figure represents a complex and
broad range of federal state and

29
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,251
local health agencies.

30
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,970
Laboratories and hospitals as well
as non-governmental organizations.

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,172
Public and private agencies,
voluntary organizations, and individuals.

32
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:02,256
The federal government acts in six main
areas related to population health.

33
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:06,458
Policy making, financing,
public health protection, collecting and

34
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:11,500
disseminating information about US
health and health care delivery systems.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,970
Capacity building for population health,
and direct management of services.

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,781
Let's look at how the US Congress
is involved in public health.

37
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:25,295
Commerce power is the power of Congress to
regulate commerce with foreign nations,

38
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:29,610
and among several states, and
with Indian tribes as well.

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,630
Interstate commerce applies to most goods,
including tobacco, medical devices, and

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,520
pharmaceuticals.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,490
There's also the power to tax and spend,
this ability to collect taxes provides for

42
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,579
the general welfare of the United States.

43
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:49,917
Congress also funds major federal agencies
that manager public health such as

44
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:53,250
the Centers for Disease Control or CDC.

45
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,490
And also state agency as needs and
priorities arise.

46
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,800
The CDC is the leading public health
institute for the United States.

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,240
And it's under the Department
of Health and Human Services.

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,494
This agency focuses its attention on
national concerns around health prevention

49
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:12,635
and disease control.

50
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:17,215
As an example of how federal and
state governments work together,

51
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:22,146
let's turn our attention to
the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

52
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:26,178
There was a reported 89 million
cases across the United States,

53
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:30,390
and over $6 billion was available for
the response.

54
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,612
CDC worked with other federal agencies,
states, and

55
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:36,915
local governments to
communicate about the response.

56
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:41,417
CDC distributed Public Health Emergency
Response Funds to state and local

57
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:47,250
jurisdictions based on the population
need, risk and a number of other factors.

58
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,452
Once the funds were dispersed states were
in control of how they wanted to spend it.

59
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:54,479
Here's a sample of states across the U.S.

60
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,336
that received public health
emergency response for H1N1.

61
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:05,334
As you can see the amounts varied state
by state and Texas received the most.

62
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:09,069
Once the states received the funds,
what they did with it varied, again,

63
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,250
state by state.

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,810
For example, in Nebraska, the Douglas
County Health Department contracted with

65
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,790
nurses to administer the H1N1
vaccine at mass vaccination clinics.

66
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,260
While Texas funded a bilingual
public health education campaign.

67
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,680
While each state received, again,

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,270
a certain amount, it was at their
discretion to use it how they saw fit.
