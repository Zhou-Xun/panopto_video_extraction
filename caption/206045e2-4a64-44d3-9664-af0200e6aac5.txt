1
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:14,890
So. No.

2
00:00:37,880 --> 00:02:43,470
Yeah. On Friday morning.

3
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,650
Good morning. Hope everybody is doing well.

4
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:05,990
Today, we are going to be wrapping up instruction in this class and then for the next or the last four classes, we'll get to hear from all of you.

5
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,910
So I'm really excited. I do enjoy actually hearing how students.

6
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,080
Like, you know, grapple with the material in, you know, in some type of application.

7
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:29,480
So I'm looking forward to it. Just a reminder, in terms of announcements, Quiz four opens today.

8
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:39,900
Let me turn it down a little bit. Quiz four opens today and it is 20 points.

9
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:48,010
Short answer, not all short answer, but there are some short answer questions.

10
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,700
More than you've seen on any of the other quizzes. Most of the questions focus on.

11
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,890
Step five and step six. There are a couple questions that are.

12
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,960
I threw in there that harkened back to some of the things that you've talked about thus far.

13
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,010
That's my effort at reinforcing that, especially as you go into this final assignment.

14
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:29,670
You know, it will reinforce some of the things that I've been saying that we will be looking for on the on the final playing.

15
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,490
You have until November 29th. And, you know, as usual, it's open book.

16
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,010
And yeah, that's about all I will say about Quiz four.

17
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,069
Yeah, I think there's 14.

18
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:55,410
There's 20 points. It's either 13 or 14, but not 20.

19
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,820
It's not 20. QUESTION Some of the point some of the questions are worth multiple points.

20
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:09,250
When I say yeah, not essays. When I, when I say short answer, I mean like 2 to 3 sentences, one sentence.

21
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:15,700
So nothing. That's like an essay. But technically they're called short answer if you have to write them in.

22
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,700
So don't worry that this is not a humanities class.

23
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,459
I'm not making you write an essay, but just some.

24
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:34,310
And actually the questions that you that you'll see that go backwards are actually questions you've seen before.

25
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,410
So, again, just reinforcing things that you've already done.

26
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,070
Yep. And then. No.

27
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,540
I'd say half and half, because there are some factual questions related to steps five and six.

28
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,040
Yeah. You know,

29
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:13,440
just a reminder presentation start on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving and 15 minutes for each group and be prepared to ask or answer questions.

30
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,610
And any other questions about assignments or.

31
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:28,340
The flow of the class after Thanksgiving. Yes. That's not part of the.

32
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:37,990
Our question now. I thought somebody might ask that whatever it says in the description.

33
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,880
It's not clear. Okay. I got it. I got to look at my math again.

34
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,260
Can I send an announcement just to.

35
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:55,200
I don't want to say something because I realize I'm like, crap, I got to look at this in 2 minutes and little questions.

36
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,590
So, yeah, I feel like it's 15 and then 5 minutes for questions.

37
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,050
Thank you. Any other questions about confirm.

38
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:15,250
Just to make sure. All right, let's let's jump in.

39
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:24,690
So we're a wrap up today. So as a means of wrapping up and I didn't share the slides because some of this material,

40
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:34,440
while all of it technically does not belong to me and that I believe strongly that if I do an evaluation and you pay me for it, it belongs to you.

41
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:42,269
So technically, the information here belongs to food gatherers.

42
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,760
And so I didn't share the slides for that purpose.

43
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:55,170
But if you really want the slides afterwards, I'm happy to reach out to them just to confirm they're usually okay, but.

44
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,860
Since I didn't ask them in advance. I just want it to be on the safe side.

45
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,770
So the project that I'm going to be talking about today and I will wrap in some of

46
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,479
the things that you've learned over the semester of the project I'm talking about.

47
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:22,840
Today is a project that I did not too long ago with food gatherers, which is Washtenaw County's food bank.

48
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:36,760
So the primary evaluation team, myself, I don't think I've actually talked much about Bumblebee, which is my private evaluation practice.

49
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,360
I won't give you the long story, but it's my it's my play.

50
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:52,239
Places I like to call as I like to call it. It lets me do things that I probably wouldn't get to do under somebody else and try them out,

51
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,300
try a techniques out, focus on things I like to do and then apply them elsewhere.

52
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:11,200
And so in addition to myself, I worked with primarily two other staff members at Foo Gathers, Markell Miller,

53
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:21,940
who is the director of community food programs at Foo Gathers, and then Larry Santa, who is a food gatherers program evaluator.

54
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,020
And they brought me in because of my experience with culturally responsive and equitable approaches.

55
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:36,390
And I will also say that. It pays off to do presentations.

56
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:46,559
This actually this relationship was established because of a presentation I did for the Health the Michigan Health Endowment Fund,

57
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,490
which is a foundation that we have here in Michigan that focuses on health care.

58
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,600
So technically, you know, before I get started in the actual like overview,

59
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:08,670
technically this is a quality improvement study which is a close cousin to the evaluation, as you've been learning.

60
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:20,490
But I wanted to highlight this particular project because it does apply many of the things that you've learned about across this semester.

61
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,059
And part part of the reason and probably the main reason actually,

62
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:36,420
that it is a quality improvement study versus a formal program evaluation is that when it comes down to it,

63
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,920
we really don't need to determine if feeding people is effective.

64
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,140
We give people food. They're not hungry.

65
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:57,330
I mean, I'm being facetious, but, you know, what food gatherers was interested in was not just feeding people and giving people food help.

66
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:08,280
They were more interested in how do we provide services that are addressing the myriad needs of people in our community.

67
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:20,580
So food gatherers, as I mentioned, reached out to me sometime in 2019 about wanting to do this project.

68
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:33,810
And their basic goals really were to align community food programs that the particular department with equitable evaluation practice.

69
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,650
And they also wanted to identify gaps in service.

70
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:47,940
So like lots of programs that started around to late 2019 or early 2020 or mid 2020,

71
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:58,590
Kovac contributed to a delay, but we finally got started in summer 2020 and.

72
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,620
Did that project up until fall 2021.

73
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:16,370
So while it's been a year since I finished this project, some highlights that I will talk about the evaluation advisory group so that you get eg.

74
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,850
I never figure out a way to say it smoothly.

75
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,890
Different survey administration and.

76
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,980
Yeah. And, um, analysis and reporting.

77
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,760
So the first thing as we started this class, the first thing we learned about in terms of thinking about the CBC program evaluation

78
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,870
framework was step one of engaging stakeholders or our interested parties.

79
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,980
You know, just a reminder, when we're talking about those stakeholders or invested parties,

80
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,690
we're talking about people who are involved in program operations,

81
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:09,400
people who are served or affected by the program, as well as the primary users of the evaluation.

82
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:24,799
We also talked about in terms of engagement, that you can think about it as from a continuum where at one end we think about outreach,

83
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:32,280
where there is some community involvement, but it is really primarily a one sided engagement.

84
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,590
I ask you answer, and then that's the end of our relationship.

85
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:53,600
But at the other end. We get to share leadership or that final decision making about what happens with a program is at the community level.

86
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:02,270
Much of this project floated around this collaborate where there were relationships

87
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:12,440
built and continual communication and shared decision making with the the egg.

88
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:21,680
This is a nightmare that I'm not happy to revisit. I don't know what it is about that word, but I used to struggle with it too.

89
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,400
If I could just find a perfect way of saying it. So we.

90
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:37,389
The mechanism that we created to be able to collaborate with community and community,

91
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:43,870
in this case being their organizational partners as well as community members who use the service.

92
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:51,520
We developed this evaluation advisory group, which was the first thing that we convened.

93
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,359
And so the role of that advisory group was to provide insight into content,

94
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:09,100
to include including approval of all instruments, survey tools, interview protocols,

95
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:19,330
providing insight into data analysis, providing insight on how the design evaluation activities,

96
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,570
particularly which came into handy, particularly because of COVID.

97
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:36,730
The ways that pantries distributed food changed in response, you know, in the effort to reduce the amount of face to face contact.

98
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,320
We do have a recruitment flier and the recruitment process.

99
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:53,650
So this was an effort where we identify potential places to reach out to people and then.

100
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:02,070
You know, worked with them to see if that would be if this was something they would be willing and interested in participating in.

101
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,280
So few gather is actually partners with.

102
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,820
I'd say over a hundred pantries in the county,

103
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:26,500
as well as other partners that don't necessarily distribute food but touch food insecurity in some form or fashion.

104
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,750
So we recruited community partners to join, but we also asked for nominations for community members at large.

105
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,560
And in terms of participation, members were.

106
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,580
Compensated at $75 a month for one meeting.

107
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,870
And we met one month. We met once a month.

108
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:00,980
And so, again, thinking about equity, what we wanted to do is make sure that as we were engaging community members,

109
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,280
including those organizational partners, that they were being compensated for their time.

110
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,870
By the time we got through the recruitment process, we ended up with four organizational partners and three community members.

111
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,000
So we started with seven and we end it with five.

112
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:34,230
All of our organizational partners stayed on, but we ended with one community member, which was an interesting lesson.

113
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:52,350
What we found is that. It takes more than enthusiasm or interest in providing or collaborating to be able to maintain involvement in this group.

114
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,899
So we had one member, for example,

115
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:09,620
who had wonderful things to share but was also dealing with numerous disabilities that hindered hip hop participation.

116
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:16,610
And then we had another community member who was new to this type of involvement.

117
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,300
Actually, both of those members were new to this type of involvement.

118
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:30,050
So they, um, that other person struggled to stay engaged and manage their other life responsibilities.

119
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,260
So one thing that, you know, I would say about, you know, for you,

120
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:46,010
the take away about engagement is that you need to think about what would facilitate somebody being successful in this type of role.

121
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,980
And also to think about, are there different ways to engage people if.

122
00:18:54,570 --> 00:19:00,840
Their life circumstances might not be compatible with intensive involvement.

123
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:09,540
The person that stayed with us was youth actually used to doing community engagement and these types of roles.

124
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,809
So she had a better sense of what to expect. So for us,

125
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:26,280
we learned a valuable lesson about being clear about what to expect and to ask people to really think about whether or not they were ready for,

126
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,210
you know, basically going from 0 to 80 in terms of engagement.

127
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,190
So that takes us a step to which is describing the program.

128
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,850
And just a reminder, you know, describe it.

129
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:52,470
This step is really about clarifying components and intended outcomes of the program or policy being evaluated.

130
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:02,609
And it's really important so that we can make sure that we're all operating from the same frame of reference about this program or in this case,

131
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,590
this organization, as well as helping us focus the evaluation questions.

132
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,700
Now, as I mentioned, this is really a quality that are a quality improvement study.

133
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,180
Again, a close cousin to evaluation.

134
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:27,700
But part of the implications of that is that we really didn't need a lot to gathers, didn't need a logic model for me.

135
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:36,910
They did it and they had a good sense of the problem that they were tackling.

136
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,020
And part of our role is really to to fill in some gaps.

137
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:50,770
But one step that was important and valuable is really understanding the landscape of the work that food gatherers does in this county.

138
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:59,170
So one step I took was to really understand how food gatherers worked with its community partners.

139
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:06,620
As you can see here, here's some examples. And they do, you know, a lot of work.

140
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:13,790
This food bank does a lot of work, not just in terms of providing food to pantries,

141
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:24,739
but also working with communities to talk about healthy eating and working with participants or

142
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,820
residents in the county to ensure that they were enrolled in any federal food assistance programs.

143
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:44,020
And this was again, I think, you know, think back to culvert pantries experienced a huge uptake of services during this time.

144
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:58,810
And a lot of people of those people were actually not aware of federal food assistance programs or they had ideas about food assistance programs.

145
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:07,360
So food gatherers served a huge role in being able to inform some of those

146
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,890
misconceptions about food assistance as well as providing food to community.

147
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:29,310
Well, after taking that time working, you know, part of my learning was reading about not only food gatherers,

148
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:41,070
but reading about their partners, visiting partners, visiting the organization, seeing how they operate as well as being able to.

149
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,980
You get a better sense of how they went about the food that foodbank work.

150
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:56,910
But after spending time in that, we moved to step three, which is focusing that evaluation design.

151
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:04,560
And again, remember that the work of the advisory group is happening at the same time.

152
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:12,300
So this evaluation design is really happening in partnership with the advisory group.

153
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,130
So in step three, this is where we focus the purpose and the scope of the evaluation.

154
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:30,030
And what we're doing is thinking about what can we do with the available resources and thinking about priorities.

155
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,820
So here's the evaluation purpose that I wrote for.

156
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,610
Wrote in conjunction with Markelle and Larry for this project.

157
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:52,500
So as you can see, I give some information about food gatherers.

158
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:06,120
My pain. And then giving some background information and thinking about what what is the context of this work?

159
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:13,170
And then. Stating what food gatherers wants to do.

160
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,870
Well what they want to do and what they will do afterwards.

161
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:33,630
So a question for you. Did I follow the format? So what needs to be what needs to be available and or what needs to be listed in the purpose?

162
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:44,640
Or a purpose statement. Dusted off.

163
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:54,970
Dusted off? Yep. Okay.

164
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,010
Let's start over again, because I can hear I realize I can hear you over the fair.

165
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,310
So who who's involved? So we know who. Yeah. So that's one who's involved.

166
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,940
Who are the decision makers? In this case? It's full gathers.

167
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,660
What types of decisions that they're wanting to make?

168
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:32,700
Um, so in this case, being aligned with a value, they want it to improve their services so they can be aligned with an equitable evaluation practice,

169
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,720
as well as allow for gatherers to identify gaps.

170
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:50,010
Um, some things that we didn't talk about, um, in this purpose, um, thinking about kind of the, the frame, like the length of the project.

171
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,620
But overall this gives you the most important information.

172
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:00,730
Who, who is this evaluation for? Who gets, you know, what kind of decisions will be made afterwards.

173
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:10,490
And so here are our questions. We have three major questions.

174
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:18,050
So the first being, does their current evaluation efforts meet the needs of their beneficiaries?

175
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:26,750
So in this case, is defined as people living with hunger or food insecurity and indirectly community partners.

176
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:35,900
The second question are there groups? Their food gatherers is not reaching either directly or through its community partners.

177
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:44,390
And then the third one being how? To what extent is food gathers meeting the needs of the current beneficiaries of their services.

178
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:59,849
So if you saw these evaluation questions. What are some things that you are immediately thinking about in terms of design for this evaluation?

179
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,179
And it does have to be form on I mean, like, is it exploratory?

180
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:10,560
But what in just thinking about things that you want, you will keep you would keep in mind if you were starting to design a study.

181
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:38,100
Hmm. I actually want you to be less technical.

182
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,770
Just even just thinking about. Like.

183
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:51,490
Let's take this third question. Are there things that stick out to you that you might want to keep in mind as you're designing?

184
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:16,850
Hmm. Oh, sorry. So yeah, so one, it is subjective.

185
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:42,510
A lot of this is subjective, so I'm actually going to write that first. Yeah.

186
00:28:44,410 --> 00:29:00,210
Any other thoughts? Yes. Yeah.

187
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,910
So thinking about I mean, we are thinking about people that we aren't necessarily reaching.

188
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,710
So we're not talking. We're talking about a heterogeneous group.

189
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,030
Or at least in terms of Washtenaw County. Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:24,759
So then I f I wanted you to think about that because then as we go through the rest of this,

191
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,090
think about how you might see those things emerge in design.

192
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,610
Remember, I talk about, you know, working forward from your questions, making sure that there are some linkages to the design.

193
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,780
So right now, we got three things already. We got some.

194
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,790
We know we're going to have some subjective data. We're talking about opinions and attitudes.

195
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,710
We're probably going to need some qualitative data because that allows people to express

196
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:59,910
what their subjective thoughts and opinions are about food gathering service services.

197
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:10,200
And then we likely are working with a heterogeneous group that might have some implications for things like sampling.

198
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,810
All right. So that takes us to. Step four.

199
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,300
Focusing the evaluation design. So not too far away.

200
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:31,680
You know, unlike when we talked about stakeholders, but thinking about this in this step,

201
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:39,750
we are really focused on compiling information that the evaluation team and stakeholders perceive as high quality,

202
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,520
trustworthy and relevant for answering questions.

203
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,270
So all you know, I'm, um. Oh, actually, I did.

204
00:30:51,270 --> 00:31:03,090
I forgot to make a point that I wanted to make, which is that we ended up doing an exploratory design.

205
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:14,320
Because again, we're not we're not trying to prove that providing hungry people who are experiencing hunger with food works, we know that works.

206
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:24,970
We don't need to prove it anymore. But what we're doing is trying to better understand how to improve those services.

207
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:36,010
You know, and again, another word for exploratory is spirit pre experimental.

208
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:48,200
One thing I also want to note here again in this step, this is where we're thinking about issues of internal and external validity.

209
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,730
We definitely are not worried about external validity.

210
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:11,100
Validity, right. Because we're not trying to understand the implications of the findings for other counties or other people.

211
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:19,410
We are really focused in on what the food gatherers service population, in this case Washtenaw County.

212
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,810
What do they what do they think about the services?

213
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:34,460
And we in and we've talked about that. Typically, you're doing a tradeoff between internal validity or external validity.

214
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,910
So if you're going to focus on one, then that's going to impact the other.

215
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:49,460
But in this case, we're not actually as concerned about internal and internal validity either.

216
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:54,050
Why? Because, again, we're not proving something here.

217
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,240
So we. You know, so we're not doing a pretest pulse test.

218
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:08,430
So they're internal threats like history maturation that are not as.

219
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,079
Concerning here. We're also not working with a comparison group.

220
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,760
We're only focusing in on Washtenaw County. So there are other threats to validity that we're not concerned about, like selection bias.

221
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:32,250
Well, in the same way now what we do need to be concerned about again in terms of selection bias is right here.

222
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:40,030
Do we have a group? Do we have a sample that is at least.

223
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,970
Somewhat representative of the county. And so we'll see how that comes into play in a little bit.

224
00:33:51,770 --> 00:34:00,410
So now go back to this. So we actually collect the data in multiple ways.

225
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:12,350
So remember, our questions were about the evaluation process and about gaps in services and perspectives on current service,

226
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,390
on the service from those that we know that we are reaching.

227
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:28,960
So with residents, we did a community member survey where we wanted to try and reach people who were not that weren't necessarily.

228
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:37,610
Receiving services from food gathers. We also did a pantry customer survey.

229
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,649
And that way we could go directly to pantry customers to see what needs that we were meeting,

230
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:51,500
what needs we weren't meeting, and we also did most significant change stories.

231
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:57,920
So here's your qualitative data from those who have engaged with food gatherers in the past,

232
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,700
and I'll talk a little bit more about the most significant change in a minute.

233
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,270
But in this step I'll focus in on the surveys.

234
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,560
I also we also did staff interviews because we wanted to know how staff were.

235
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:24,570
What their attitudes about evaluation were, and especially if they were aware of how they were participating in that process.

236
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:34,800
Then because we're talking about equitable evaluation, making sure that all stakeholders have a say in the work that's being done.

237
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,630
And then finally we did an organizational survey with their partners, 170 partners.

238
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:55,130
Now, even though in this case we weren't as concerned about internal and external validity due to the fact that we were doing quality improvement.

239
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,180
One thing we do care about is measurement validity.

240
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,280
We wanted to make sure that what we were measuring actually reflects.

241
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:15,010
The ways people think about the different concepts and that we were measuring all the concepts that community members felt were important.

242
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:28,660
So some things that we did, we use pre developed measures for food insecurity as well as questions about food choice and food options.

243
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,110
We also checked face validity by.

244
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:44,880
You know, working well, first, actually working with the advisory group to determine what things should be included in surveys.

245
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:59,410
And then from there. Running these tools, these draft tools by the advisory group as well as other staff to understand,

246
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,150
you know, the extent to which we have face validity. Now, I wanted to escape here for a second.

247
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:13,580
Okay. Yes, keep them. To show you an example of these things in action.

248
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:22,170
Okay. So we have both paper and electronic surveys.

249
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,020
Um. That was fun.

250
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:46,730
So we used a number of questions that have been used in previous pantry surveys before, such as visiting questions about trying to get food.

251
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,330
You know what? What make food? What would make pantry use easier?

252
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:09,670
And then again, some, you know, predetermined measures of food insecurity.

253
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,720
So these two actually come from a scale that has that's commonly used to measure food insecurity.

254
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,840
And then even in terms of the structure, we started late.

255
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:30,110
So when I think of this light. So. You know, pretty non-personal, no question.

256
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:36,220
Well, pretty kind of like questions like how often do you visit pantries?

257
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:48,580
And then escalating in terms of D2 asking for detail and information that might be a little bit more personal, such as food access.

258
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:58,300
I must I should give you a disclaimer that I'm not talking about the findings either, because, again, those also belong to food gatherers.

259
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:08,980
And. But I will say that we did learn that a lot of people this was interesting to me, one that a lot of people really wanted more fresh.

260
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:16,780
They wanted meats. They wanted dairy. But they also we asked about food sharing.

261
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,240
Lots of people sharing food.

262
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:30,540
Which allowed us to be able to make some break, make some recommendations about how to expand to those who don't use pantry services.

263
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:39,810
And then we end it with demographic questions, which is a pretty standard practice ending with these demographics.

264
00:39:52,430 --> 00:40:04,100
All right. So in 2021, I spent my summer collecting data with my lovely research assistant.

265
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:09,320
I felt like it was fair that I should actually just show you a picture of my daughter because you saw my son.

266
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,890
And it's just not right that you don't see my daughter either. But honestly, she actually came with me as my assistant.

267
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:24,229
I mentioned that Bumblebee is actually my solo practice and my kids were sitting around doing nothing.

268
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,800
So they got paid $15 an hour to to work with me that summer.

269
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,240
They were very happy. They're still like, you got any work for us? No, I don't.

270
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,290
I don't. I really don't. Sorry, but.

271
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:46,120
In terms of the Pantry survey, one thing you know, again, we're thinking about the county is not homogeneous.

272
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,940
We have rural areas. We have urban areas.

273
00:40:49,390 --> 00:41:01,000
Most of our population in Washtenaw County is located in Ypsi in Ann Arbor, whereas there's other areas within the county that are less populated.

274
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:06,580
Manchester Whitmore Lake are two examples.

275
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,840
So we actually apply the call, the sampling approach to the Pantry survey.

276
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,840
Where we did more. We?

277
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:32,239
We collected data in multiple pantries in Ann Arbor and Ypsi, but also because of the again,

278
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,150
the population, but the fact that the population is primarily in Ann Arbor and Ypsi.

279
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,960
But we also made sure that we collected data from other pantries within the county.

280
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:52,580
So in Manchester. Where else do we go?

281
00:41:53,730 --> 00:42:01,530
I felt like we went. I can't. I'm sorry. I can. I'm trying to remember where else we went, but I cannot recall it right away.

282
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,790
We also wanted to make sure that we were thinking about.

283
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:11,350
Racial and ethnic diversity.

284
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:23,349
So making sure that even within Ann Arbor and Ypsi that we were reaching places, that because and because Washtenaw County is very diverse,

285
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,879
we want to make sure that the pantries we were reaching had diverse populations.

286
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:42,370
So we made sure that we went to places where maybe primarily Spanish speakers were there Arabic speakers, also Mandarin and Cantonese.

287
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,870
Yeah. Cantonese. Now I feel like I'm saying it wrong. I apologize.

288
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:56,750
So we wanted to make sure that we got basically a diverse sample of people to inform this survey.

289
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,540
We also did a community non customer survey.

290
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:13,970
So one of the places we went to was Park Ridge Summer Festival, which is a festival in Ypsilanti that takes place every year.

291
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:20,780
And we offer people $5 to complete a survey for us.

292
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:33,020
Again, thinking about issues of equity, what we knew that we could not necessarily afford to give everyone who was at a pantry.

293
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:42,500
$5 to participate in the survey. But we also want we were also considering things like coercion.

294
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:50,210
So we offered a raffle for the pantry service because we also wanted a higher sample size for that.

295
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:07,560
So again, as I mentioned, I spent a lot of time collecting data after it, being informed by being informed by the advisory group.

296
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,510
So at step five, this is where we do the analysis.

297
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,670
This is where we justify conclusions.

298
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:27,100
The biggest probably the most interesting process of analyzing data was a collaborative project with the evaluation advisory group.

299
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:35,210
They conducted or we all conducted the most significant change process project, most significant change.

300
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:41,620
If you have not heard about it before, is a process where people basically at this lower level.

301
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,620
Oh, no. Oh, here at this lower level. Right here.

302
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:51,530
People collect stories from an audience.

303
00:44:52,430 --> 00:45:03,890
Then they're organized into domains. That's what these letters, these this D, F and M refer to just examples of domains.

304
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:05,540
And then from there.

305
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:19,250
Typically what happens in this process is that a story that is the most representative of the domains is selected as the most significant story.

306
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,870
And again, it's about representation of the domains that emerge.

307
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,300
We did a little bit different of a process in that we didn't we didn't like the idea of selecting one story.

308
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:41,240
So we but we did organize stories into domains so that our advisor group members collected stories.

309
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:45,660
They were also compensated for that work if they chose to participate.

310
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,260
And then those who provided stories were compensated as well for their participation.

311
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,990
We ended up collecting 11 stories and again applying a quota sampling approach.

312
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:05,650
So we've collected stories from residents in Ann Arbor and Ypsi and myelin.

313
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:17,610
And then those stories were either recorded or typed out by the interviewer or the respondent o in Manchester.

314
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:23,670
And again, I think, you know, part of the adjustment we had to make was, again,

315
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:31,229
it's it and who's the audience for some of these for some of these pantries and Manchester.

316
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,310
We found, for example, that a lot of the residents are seniors.

317
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:43,950
And so they really didn't feel comfortable coming in for in-person conversation.

318
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:52,070
Some might even have had issues with. Using a phone.

319
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:59,120
So we accommodated that by allowing people to type out their stories and share those with us.

320
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:13,660
After they were provided the questions. Then in terms of what's most relevant for this step is that we analyze the data as a group.

321
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,830
So in our advisory group, we read the stories out loud.

322
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,440
We brainstorm ideas for domains engaged in dialog about that,

323
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:33,700
and then classify the stories and the domains that we have kind of finalized and identify inclusion criteria.

324
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:44,920
So in other words, what makes a story, a food diversity story or a help to family story or a service story or a crisis story?

325
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:51,160
Again, this is not you know, the research is saying, okay, these are the most important domains,

326
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:58,720
but these are domains that are emerging from the advisory group, from community members and from organizational partners.

327
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,780
Then I took it a step further and did some analysis.

328
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:24,340
Qualitative data is fun, but I use the manual approach, so I make use of matrices to analyze other particular themes that fell under those domains.

329
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:33,820
To understand where there might be overlap. That's what all these Xs and little F's and Counts are referring to.

330
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:46,369
And I should add them showing those results to the advisory group to confirm that that

331
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:54,950
felt that that same accurate that nothing that I found through that further analysis fit.

332
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,730
We're identifying that those things fit. All right.

333
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:07,240
So finally we got to step six. So that's ensuring use and sharing lessons learned.

334
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:13,720
You know, as we said, if all of this work really is not.

335
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:23,870
Helpful if helpful if we're not ensuring they use and sharing the lessons.

336
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:31,070
So one thing that we did was develop a dissemination plan for this project.

337
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,250
So you can see here we have format kind of the purpose.

338
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,440
The audience for the timing and the frequency.

339
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:49,490
And then this was agreed upon by the primary evaluation team.

340
00:49:53,790 --> 00:50:05,490
So we also use some of these mechanisms to be able to identify identify what would be helpful.

341
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,800
In terms of making decisions. So the board presentation, for example,

342
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,770
that provided information to the board so they could think about things like how do

343
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:22,660
we ensure that there is greater community representation in our decision making?

344
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,590
The final report was divided into different sections in order to be able to.

345
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,280
Be given to particular audiences.

346
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:43,579
So we have a, for example, staff findings that could be shared directly to staff so that they have a sense of, okay,

347
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:50,420
well, what is the evaluation process look like and be able to participate in more decision making about evaluation?

348
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:55,910
And then we also have additional dissemination that just kind of came about.

349
00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:04,790
So this is a flier or this is the front page of their newsletter they want it to talk about, um, for development.

350
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:09,470
Development was really interested in sharing the results of this work.

351
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,850
So even though that isn't on the dissemination plan.

352
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:20,900
There might be also opportunities that also can contribute to sharing lessons learned in the sharing use.

353
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:38,110
So any questions about like the process of or any comments about kind of the process of this evaluation or quality improvement study?

354
00:51:48,940 --> 00:52:11,240
Right? Yeah. On.

355
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,739
So I would say, well, one,

356
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:26,530
I do I do think that evaluators actually have some responsibility and at least in terms of creating the conditions so that this can be followed up.

357
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,330
Like if I just wrote a report that wasn't assessable, that's on me as an evaluator.

358
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:39,640
But in terms of follow up after a contract is over, that's a really interesting question.

359
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,150
I would say technically. I mean, you don't have to.

360
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,950
Let's you know, just you know, frankly speaking, I mean,

361
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,180
you're not especially if you think about it, you know, contractually you're not being paid any.

362
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:02,060
But from a relationship perspective and then from a utility perspective,

363
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:11,840
I do continue to follow up with with clients when I can and I continue to offer, you know, keep an open door.

364
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:19,730
So even if a contract is technically over and say, for example, like with another project,

365
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:27,830
they hired an evaluator to implement the recommendations that I made for that project.

366
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:34,760
And so I recently met with the new evaluator to kind of walk them through this plan and,

367
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,420
you know, kind of share the experience of doing their evaluation.

368
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:44,840
So even though there's no, like, legal responsibility, there is an ethical responsibility to to follow up.

369
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:51,460
But. You know, again, an approach like how do you approach this work?

370
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:07,120
In the other questions. So hopefully that was helpful.

371
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,290
Just kind of seeing.

372
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:17,889
What these different elements that we've talked about across the semester out there is helpful in seeing how they play out in real life.

373
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,420
I mean, as you can see, not everything makes it to the makes it to the party.

374
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:31,420
You know, threats of internal validity and external validity are important to think about, but not all.

375
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,530
They're not always applicable.

376
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:44,890
You know, stakeholder engagement is important to kind of inform how you ask questions and where you ask questions, how you collect data.

377
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:54,240
Yeah. I forgot to mention that, you know, we based on the recommendation of the advisory group, we collected paper surveys,

378
00:54:54,990 --> 00:55:00,540
which is, you know, has budget implications because somebody had to enter all of those surveys.

379
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,290
That was my son. He got paid $15 an hour to do data entry.

380
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:10,500
Tell him to put on this resume. He actually put it on his head for to be put on this resume.

381
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,090
He was a research assistant. But he's learned a valuable skill and.

382
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,150
You know. He's learned a valuable skill.

383
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:25,370
Oh, yeah. So I just wanted to end with.

384
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:32,660
I know that many of you will walk away from this class not being evaluators, and that's okay.

385
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:41,150
We're a fun bunch, but I get it. But I will say my final word is just don't leave us hanging out there.

386
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,360
Right. A lot of times.

387
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:53,300
People hire an evaluator and say, okay, well, hands off, you know, okay, just go do your job, collect some data.

388
00:55:54,770 --> 00:56:05,870
Let me know what you come up with. But that really is not a good way for us to work to ensure use as well as to do a quality project.

389
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,620
So we need input and we need your expertise.

390
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:17,330
And so thinking about what you've learned over the course of the semester, you know, just think this test field site,

391
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:25,430
because this slide was for social work students, but all of you and all of you do some work in different organizations.

392
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:34,760
So I just want you to kind of reflect on how your perspective might benefit the evaluation process at these different stages.

393
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:45,860
So as a staff person, how can you help evaluators engage stakeholders, describe the program accurately and not just based on our perception?

394
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:57,410
How you can help inform or focus the evaluation design, gather credible data, justify conclusions and ensure use.

395
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:07,280
So this is my request to you as you continue on past the semester that.

396
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,950
If your evaluator is trying to just work in isolation,

397
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,450
you now know that that's not really the best way for us to get the best answers to help you out.

398
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:24,360
So don't leave us out to dry. All right.

399
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:28,980
So any questions or comments before we close for today?

400
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,190
Everyone so tired. Oh, I get it.

401
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,299
I'm tired too. So again, just a reminder.

402
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,750
Quiz four is open. Don't come here on Tuesday.

403
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:48,030
That's the work day. It was. I was put in there.

404
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:56,399
So you work with your groups, but. You know, consider it presentation start the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.

405
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:06,180
And if you don't know which day you're presenting on out of those four, look for Hannah's announcement on canvas.

406
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,340
Both of us will continue to be on email.

407
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:17,760
So if you have any questions. We'll be happy to chat with you.

408
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,389
Right. And I won't. I won't hold office hours. I guess I should mention I won't hold office or office hours on Tuesday,

409
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:30,770
but if you do want to kind of touch base with me, I'll be available for like Zoom.

410
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:38,870
Just let me know. All right. Well, have a happy if you celebrate, have a happy Thanksgiving.

411
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:47,230
If you're traveling home, be safe. If you're not traveling home, be safe on the roads and I will see you after the holiday.
