1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:21,330
He's at Lowe's the other day during the Christmas stuff. Sure.

2
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,220
All right. So welcome to evaluation. Chemical Hazards on Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:37,290
So here we are, September 22nd and you'll see the week from today is quiz number one.

4
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,140
So I've been going back and forth in my head a lot of debate internally.

5
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,970
And I think what we're going to do is it will be online, preferably during this 3 to 420 period.

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:59,190
So with it being online because it screams kind of small, I just didn't want to cram everybody in here with pencil, paper and all that.

7
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,259
And with it being online, I can't really prevent people from using study AIDS.

8
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,299
So we will say that's okay. But I'll reiterate this on Tuesday.

9
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,570
I would. You're going to want to study because if you wait and try to look everything up, you're going to run out of time for sure.

10
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:26,840
So I would advise studying, you know, just knowing that it's always good to know where to find information.

11
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:35,140
I've never been super huge on memorization anyway, but being able to use the resources available to you.

12
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,150
So that's that's what we're looking at and we can talking about it on Tuesday.

13
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,170
But if you have any concerns at this point, just let me know.

14
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,560
And if anybody doesn't have a quiet place to do it online.

15
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:55,450
If there are people interested, I could sit here during that time if you want to come here and do it online.

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,830
But we can take a poll on Tuesday for that. Any questions on that for now?

17
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,900
Yeah. Are they going to be like that with someone or anything?

18
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,170
I wouldn't say. Example quizzes. I think I do have a brief.

19
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:20,069
I can give you a brief sort of study guide so it'll be, you know, stuff that's been covered in lecture or readings.

20
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,940
I would say much more heavily on the lecture notes, the shorter focus.

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:40,260
And yeah, so it'll be a mix of different types of questions, some multiple choice, some listing, short answer, some maybe matching.

22
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,040
I think those those two maybe a true false or two, stuff like that.

23
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,910
And there's 20 minutes and you can have like 35 or 40 minutes.

24
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:03,500
Just to give you a sense of. Any other questions and we have a short term.

25
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,249
I just think that that'll be in the in the system.

26
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,790
Yeah. That's another reason that it's nice to use, you know.

27
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:19,490
Yeah. So it would just be over from like 3 to 4 33 to 420 and I think it starts time right when you start it.

28
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,710
So if you don't get on until 310, you'll have you'll still have 80 minutes.

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,770
And if, if that's a problem for you, I can extend the window.

30
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,590
But just know that once you personally like started, that's when the clock starts.

31
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,589
And I think it'll give you warnings at certain time.

32
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,950
Left and I'll cut you off, actually. Not to not to make you guys nervous.

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,580
That's just the way they do it. It was pencil paper in here. You know, I would do the same thing.

34
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,730
This is probably a lot more nice. Like the computer.

35
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,350
The other questions. Well, open.

36
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,100
Well, they're not open until three air will be open at all before nine.

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,270
I have it set to open at three. If there was reason people needed earlier than that, we could discuss.

38
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,960
But for now, it's set at three. Yeah, the Environmental Justice Conference is next Thursday.

39
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,370
There's just the thing at four on Thursday. Okay. Possible.

40
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,680
Do you like it earlier? Stuff that's a lot earlier.

41
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,290
You know, just like you don't have to answer now. But yeah, you can remind me on Tuesday.

42
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,020
I just wanted the window be too wide so people were tempted to kind of talk to each other.

43
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:47,980
Right. Of course. You know, you have to be online by yourself, similar to the group, the whole class sitting together.

44
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,470
She's writing in concrete. Like, that's not that's not fair. So don't do that.

45
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:02,799
I will find you. All right. So today we're talking about occupational standards and guidelines as an extension

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,310
of of Tuesday who are professors to watch them and talk about environmental.

47
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,839
A big focus on air quality. Now we're going to get into occupational as it relates to chemicals,

48
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,230
but I will give a little bit more broad background to occupational guidelines in general.

49
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:27,130
So some competencies for today talk about this term but we ILS it's one we'll see a lot throughout the semester.

50
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,280
Occupational exposure women's which organizations set those and then why?

51
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:42,100
There are differences many times between organizations and then how do you apply those in various situations?

52
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,839
So these numbers, again, eight years, these change year to year.

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,890
I don't even know what year this is from. It's not. The specific numbers are important.

54
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,660
Just to give you a sense of scale with regards to this country, you know, 50,000 workers,

55
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,650
a few million work related injuries and illnesses every year and then, you know, occupationally.

56
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:14,440
We also have to worry about accidents that didn't really come up much in in the environmental, though some of that foodborne stuff just get scary.

57
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:22,509
But this occupational, you know, injuries is a big driver as well for a lot of these regulations which gets beyond the chemicals,

58
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:29,499
that's the focus of this course. But I think it's important to acknowledge as backdrop many diseases.

59
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,049
So occupational. Next unit will focus solely pretty much on occupational.

60
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,100
And there's a reason for that is because, you know, they tend to be much more highly exposed.

61
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,820
Right. They're working directly with a lot of different things.

62
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:51,910
Our knowledge of toxicology and disease related chemicals really unfortunately occurred because of sort

63
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:59,110
of a natural experiment where people were working very high levels of various things in different jobs,

64
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:12,900
and they even have names for of these diseases miners, potters, foundries, file cutting bakers even usually think about more spinners.

65
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:22,480
So, I mean, was a textile spinning machine, not the animal but thought to be associated with the mineral oils used to those things.

66
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,010
I used to do a whole half lecture on Mad Hatter's disease cancer.

67
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,890
Really interesting story but had to kind of due to time. But that's an interesting one as well.

68
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,140
This one got cut off each other. Anybody heard that one before?

69
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,780
It literally was a deterioration of the job from too much phosphorus exposure from matchmakers,

70
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,330
not only dating people, but people were making matches to light fires.

71
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,380
So a lot of these types of examples that came about throughout history.

72
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:07,399
There's a lot of graphs like this. They're all crazy old. So this only goes through 2001.

73
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:16,100
But it's just to illustrate kind of, you know, you don't see a ton of drop off here in any of these categories for skin disease,

74
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,550
dust disease, respiratory conditions, poisonings, etc.

75
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,740
You have this one big thing here that came about in the late eighties.

76
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,150
It's that 911 go. Sorry. I know, right?

77
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,540
It was before 911 repeated trauma.

78
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:44,090
So that's when a couple of things shifting work forced more office and then increased recognition of ergonomics as an issue.

79
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,799
So it's not like they weren't having repetitive trauma back in the old days.

80
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,710
It's a more recent recognition and then of course also that.

81
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:03,800
And so that's a sort of messes up the picture here but that's all ergonomic stuff like carpal tunnel back stuff, things like that.

82
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,960
It's not really chemical related, but for our purposes, a lot of these curves, not a ton of change,

83
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:22,850
nothing that needs to be acknowledged here is that not every illness or symptom is reported as occupational related.

84
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,080
So they they think of this as the iceberg, where above this waterline here you have your reported occupational illnesses,

85
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:37,760
but a lot of them go not reported for various reasons.

86
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,670
Some people don't want to get in trouble with their job. You know, there's a lot of dynamics at play with workers.

87
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,850
You hope that's not the case. But, you know, especially internationally, you might have issues related to reporting, work related illnesses,

88
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,130
people not even realizing that something that is wrong with them might be related to their job.

89
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:07,459
Um, people having symptoms, but maybe just attributing it to age or other things and then no symptoms.

90
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,160
But biologically they probably are being impacted by repeated exposures to various various chemicals.

91
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,280
So when you talk about some of these numbers and figures, just realize that it's probably not accounting for everything.

92
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,780
All right. I do this all the time, but I pushed record, right? Yeah.

93
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,980
Happens to me when I leave my house. I shut the garage door to me trying to fall asleep.

94
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:47,180
Anyway, it is recorded. So you recognize this figure from Tuesday when Professor Devine talked about environmental policy,

95
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,690
how you have that combination of the science and the non-science components.

96
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,960
The same thing occurs when we're talking about the workplace.

97
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,560
So we have our natural sciences, our social sciences, understanding the exposure and its relationship with disease.

98
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,640
That should be the primary portion of what goes into setting a standard.

99
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:11,060
However, you have this bottom part that we'll talk about a little bit, but there's all the other stuff that comes into play.

100
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,820
It looks a little different. You know, he mentioned various companies, the things that have an interest in doing things the way they are.

101
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:28,010
You see that a lot here as well. And there's other reasons that we'll talk about with regards to risk and acceptance.

102
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:40,500
And some other factors. So when we talk about exposure limits in the occupational setting, it combines some of the stuff we've been talking about.

103
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,250
We talked about risk assessment. We went into toxicology a little bit.

104
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:53,060
So you have this risk science decision making process of, you know, from human or animal studies looking for that point of departure, you know,

105
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,200
might be that most observed adverse effect level might be some other method they use to try

106
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,500
to see where that effect is first noticeable on that spectrum of low to high exposure.

107
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,659
We don't really touch on this, but then they will apply some uncertainty factors.

108
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:22,430
So if it's based on animal models, they'll have multiple multiplier to try to account for the interspecies difference in environmental settings.

109
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:31,560
We might have something to try to protect susceptible populations again, just a multiplying factor and then integrate all that.

110
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:41,550
So that's your health based standard that might be set, but then you have risk acceptance.

111
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,200
So in the occupational setting, you know, people are getting paid for this job.

112
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,070
What is that? What's that tradeoff? What you expect them to take on because they are being compensated.

113
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,709
And then this one is a big one, this feasibility. So economic, economic and technical feasibility.

114
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:05,220
So that's where they get a ton of argument from industry a lot of times saying, hey, if you make this exposure level too low,

115
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:12,990
we won't be able to make what we make and we'll go out of business in that part of the world, will have these products that they need.

116
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:22,450
So it becomes pretty complicated at that point. So a US policy making similar to environmental.

117
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:32,709
You have our governmental policies that are created by a law in the legislature that then is funded by executive office,

118
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:39,250
usually through an agency that will. Do you work?

119
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,900
And then interpreted by the judiciary. Supreme Court all the way down.

120
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,250
So that's the law itself. But then when it comes to regulating and enforcing, that's where that agency comes into play.

121
00:13:51,750 --> 00:14:00,760
It's funded by the executive branch and and then has its its ways of regulating to enforce that law that was created.

122
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:09,000
There's also non governmental policies. A lot of times these will be guidelines and not not law.

123
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:17,350
So this can be private organizations. So professional associations will talk in depth a little bit today about one big one here.

124
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,870
Businesses might have their own.

125
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:28,089
A lot of times those might be directives, non other NGOs, non-governmental organizations put out guidelines and things like that.

126
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:34,930
So, you know, a lot of times these might be considered, but they're usually not legally enforceable.

127
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,850
We've got to come from the government.

128
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:49,580
So the agencies involved for occupational health, we have the big one, which is OSHA,

129
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:57,740
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which was formed in 1971, and that covers primarily non-government workers.

130
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,580
Related one focused on mines specifically.

131
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,550
So we know mining is very dangerous job, a lot of injury and illness related to that,

132
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,570
but they have their own Mine Safety and Health Administration that was formed in 1977.

133
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,660
Couple of other relevant ones. Department of Transportation. So hazardous chemicals get shipped from place to place.

134
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,740
They need laws on the books to cover that. And that's done.

135
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:31,970
DOD and then military has its own set of guidelines and and there might be some others out there for smaller groups of of people.

136
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:44,560
Use or not. So these are all websites if you're interested. So we focus a lot on ocean because it is covers a much broader spectrum than mine.

137
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,480
But just know that mining has its own separate related agency.

138
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,060
Or if any of you are from a heavily mining area or go to work in an area with a lot of money.

139
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:05,970
You can see Northwest, sort of like West Virginia area, Kentucky, a lot of mining still.

140
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,940
Still. The OSHA Act.

141
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,560
So 1974 my time, but that's what people look like.

142
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,300
But a lot of the laws on the books are the same. You know, styles come and go, but the old act is is forever.

143
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,940
So what that did was established both culture that we just talked about,

144
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,770
as well as an organization called the the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

145
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:42,640
So you might have some funding from them if you're an occupational health age program so than they are.

146
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,250
So OSHA is in charge of setting the regulations and enforcement is more of the research arm and

147
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:55,330
education arm that studies these associations and tries to come up with health based guidelines.

148
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,370
So what I also did was provide a statute statutory general duty.

149
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:09,070
So basically on the books that says the employer must protect the health of the worker, but then beyond that,

150
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:17,530
it has to get specific for certain things and then it based on the type of industry, it might have set rules as well.

151
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:28,260
So you have 1910, it's general industry, 1880 Maritime 26 construction took quite a bit of work in the construction industry.

152
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:35,390
It's kind of interesting that they some some rules are different just because they're like a construction stuff,

153
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,440
you know, so it gives them out in some ways to not be as protective sometimes.

154
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,510
Then you have agricultural. So within the social standards, there's two general types.

155
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,980
The first type is is called a performance standard, and the second type is called a design or a specification standard.

156
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:05,549
So the performance standards, this is talking about air concentrations only and it's just a single number usually that's on the books,

157
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,270
a single number for a particular kind of call that is air concentration that you're legally supposed to stay below.

158
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:22,290
So this is considered results oriented, flexible, meaning that the employer, it's basically up to them they how they reach that number.

159
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,240
You know, they can basically just rotate workers in and out to reduce the averaging time.

160
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,170
You know, there's a lot of tricks to do that. So that's what we mean by flexible.

161
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,770
There it is in that sense. It can be hard to enforce as well.

162
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,940
Requires a lot of employee. Trying to make sure it's representative.

163
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,090
Things like that. And it's fairly generic.

164
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,610
Again, it's just a single number for a different chemical, and it covers about 500 chemicals.

165
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,430
And you can find these numbers in these links.

166
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,890
They're called Tables Z one, Z two and Z three.

167
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:11,320
So Table Z one is time weighted average levels that are allowable tables, E2 covers ceiling levels and Z three is special to us.

168
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:20,100
It's like silica based. So I think I had time just to click on this quickly.

169
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:30,540
Um, so here's table one is just a list of chemicals and OSHA permits permissible,

170
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,200
permissible exposure limit p l and that's based on an eight hour time weighted average in this table.

171
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,860
And you'll see parts per million milligrams per cubic meter.

172
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,390
And you just have lists and lists of chemicals alphabetically.

173
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,390
So pretty simple, right? It gets it gets a little more complicated.

174
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,990
Pebbles it, too, is for chemicals that have a ceiling limit.

175
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:03,090
So these are things that are going to be much more toxic acutely. And we will have a ceiling level, they call that.

176
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,020
You can't you can't exceed that at all. It's not it's not averaged.

177
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,460
And then Z three. Oops is your.

178
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,480
Minerals. You know, glass, so you have silica.

179
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,870
A lot of things we talk about that can cause illnesses along with just one other one, diseases, cancer.

180
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,120
Okay. So we'll come back to that. It's.

181
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:40,570
Okay. So let's that's performance standards promotion. On the other side, you have these specification standards.

182
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:46,660
So these go in a much more detail about how their level is to be met.

183
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,670
So it can be very much more procedure oriented. So this is something like LED.

184
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:01,750
They'll talk about the conditions of the workplace, how that has to be set up to prevent lead exposure and also prevent exposure through other

185
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,629
routes in addition to inhalation things like in the lead to require showering stations,

186
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:18,490
for example, in certain areas, hand-washing stations to try to prevent that decontamination training, medical monitoring.

187
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,340
These are all things that might be included in the specifications.

188
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,709
They're inflexible and they're easier to enforce or to cite somebody on because there's

189
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,630
a lot of paperwork and things that need to be placed in place within the organization.

190
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:41,160
So it's easy to find where somebody might not have records on that we train their workers on.

191
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,970
However, there's only about 30 chemicals that have this more detailed type of standard.

192
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:57,750
And here's a partial listing here. So that things like things that are known to be pretty toxic to asbestos.

193
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:04,520
There's a group of 13 carcinogens going to chloride. There's the lead one, hexavalent chromium, cadmium.

194
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:10,489
So a lot of the stuff that we've kind of covered a little bit in that intro to Chemical Hazards Lecture,

195
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,770
because these are ones that are well studied and we know that they're quite toxic.

196
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:22,900
So it. Makes sense to have a more specified standard.

197
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,580
There's a major. Yeah. This square coke oven emissions.

198
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,540
Coke oven. Who knows if anyone is working on a Coke oven before.

199
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:43,790
So that's going to be a nonspecific. So it's probably a lot of metals and maybe some mineral dust as well.

200
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:51,260
I'd have to reasonably question. Yeah, I'd have to reacquaint myself with that process.

201
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,460
But it's a very dirty process that definitely they didn't want to.

202
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:05,270
I'm guessing it includes a lot of different agents, but because it was a big industry at the time, it had its own standard related to those emissions.

203
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:12,530
But yeah, I'd imagine like a modern equivalent of like that makes them smelting is kind of the downturn in flux.

204
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:20,720
Yeah. It's, you know, if they're familiar with that more metals metals being heated and and processed and.

205
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,150
Yeah. What you think it is.

206
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:34,230
And I think there's a lot of pictures very, very dirty, messy processes, typically both inside the facility as well as you can see if outside just.

207
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:44,850
It's like crazy. But good question. So that one, that's going to be a little bit more general to a process rather than a specific agent potentially.

208
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,190
Although the agents are probably going to read that one might be a good one for a problem set.

209
00:23:52,590 --> 00:24:02,450
So here you have some elements. Ethylene oxide has been in the news a lot lately. Interest in respirable crystal and silica comes up a lot.

210
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:09,760
And then you have some construction specific ones here. So those are comprehensive specification standards.

211
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,580
Again, those different than from those basic.

212
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:26,250
Single level quantitative ones because this is a chemical agent class that is listing some additional ocean regulations that are related,

213
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,390
but not that we're going to really cover a whole lot in this class.

214
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,800
You know, if you have or exposure to chemical ventilation, there's a regulation for how to do that.

215
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,030
Tanks. Hazardous waste. Welding, etc.

216
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,260
Um, personal protective equipment. There's rules for those as well.

217
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,740
If that's what you're using to protect workers from. Various companies.

218
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,850
I spend a lot of time on it today and then record keeping and some other administrative types of things.

219
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,930
The standards here.

220
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,190
Just to make you aware of the kind of the scope of OSHA with regards to chemicals, but we're not going to cover a lot of that here.

221
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:22,249
It gets even more complicated when you think about, you know, just again, what kind of us centric right now for our purposes.

222
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:28,479
But states can also have their own. OSHA on the books.

223
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:36,410
So this is a map showing. So of course, California does, as we've talked about, there tend to be more progressive in the environmental realm.

224
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,690
But Michigan has one as well. Michigan knows my area, they call it have zero agents.

225
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:48,830
They might have their own standards that have to be at least as stringent as the federal standards, but can't be more more strict.

226
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,630
A lot of auto industry, so I'm guessing can be traced.

227
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,220
I'm not from Michigan originally, but if you trace it back, that might have something to do with it.

228
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,910
I'm going to show somebody to have their own OSHA.

229
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:12,319
But the statement. So occupational health regulations have been effective over and over time.

230
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,830
So we spoke in 1970 again. This again is injuries.

231
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:25,040
Fatal injuries. You can see it went from 18 2 to 4 per 100,000 workers in this time span shown on this table.

232
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,480
So that's good.

233
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:36,709
However, you know, if you just crunched some of those numbers, there's one inspector per about 60,000 workers and 9 million workplaces.

234
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,980
So the odds of an inspection based on when this is calculated is, you know, once every 57 years.

235
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:50,150
So, you know, employers I think most employers get the sense of this.

236
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:59,810
So it has to be you know, the fear of of inspection is very seldom enough of the motivation to to do things the correct way.

237
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:08,490
Unfortunately, on the chemical side, it has resulted in reduced exposures.

238
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,060
Here's another example figure with asbestos. You see it peaked here.

239
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,950
The amount of asbestos use peaked, right the 20 years leading up to the OSHA Act.

240
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:27,850
Then as those regulations came on the books, the usage tracked kind of with the lowering of the permissible exposure.

241
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:40,300
Was that over time? But you know, we go back to the first class where we talk about how many chemicals are out there.

242
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,720
What is our number? Could have done exactly 85,000.

243
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,360
So that's the number that's used a lot as we talked about. That could be an overestimate.

244
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,950
Could be an underestimate. Depends on who you ask. But it's more than 500.

245
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:06,270
We know that. And that's the number of chemicals we have kind of laws on the books for as far as what's allowed a level of exposure.

246
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,760
And when you talk about that process of setting a standard, it's quite complex.

247
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:26,130
So since 1970, there's only been a handful of chemicals that have been added to the list, and only a few have been changed or updated since then.

248
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,280
So this is since I have been in this profession, there's only been two.

249
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,390
I've been doing this for a while. It's about chromium and silica.

250
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,969
And each of those took about 20 years. It was time they started.

251
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,910
So I think I have a link here. He was interested. You can.

252
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:54,330
I might have you do this on the problems as well but you know timeline 1994 it listed as a priority and then in 2016, it finally became a rule.

253
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,550
So that's that's a long time, right? It's so.

254
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:07,090
Just to give you a sense of how complicated this can be. And that's silica has a disease, silicosis.

255
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,430
And they still can do the other can postpone or like the general duty clause.

256
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:16,120
Or they can. I think that can get a little messy as well.

257
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,630
But yeah, if it's a gross negligence kind of area, you can use the general duty clause as with other.

258
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:40,410
So a few years ago they actually owned up to this it we know we know we're frustrated too.

259
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:51,390
So they say they know that they're outdated. And they came out and said flatly that they're not protective of worker health.

260
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:57,060
And so they updated the table. So they still have their appeals that have been on the books forever.

261
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,410
But a few you may have noticed when I clicked to Where to go.

262
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,820
If you go to these tables. So you have the people here, but they also have these annotated.

263
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:18,160
So we'll show the Cal EPA, the Cal OSHA, permissible exposure level, the show, the national recommended exposure level.

264
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:24,430
We'll cover that a little later today and then we'll also talk with these students yet still read.

265
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,360
So before the statement came out a few years ago, all they showed were the peels.

266
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,770
But now they're saying the process is so difficult, we know they should be lowered, but we can't do anything about it right now.

267
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,350
So they're basically hinting at everyone to maybe try to use these other numbers instead.

268
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,510
Which is kind of sad. At least acknowledging it.

269
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:58,860
She. Were. So they encourage people to use some of these other values if they can.

270
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,460
So who do you think is able to use this other up more often?

271
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,770
It's usually the bigger corporations that are much more forward thinking investing in.

272
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,880
Work, worker health, things like that for small companies that don't know much about environmental health and safety.

273
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:27,150
I'm not sure that message is going. Any questions up to this point?

274
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,980
Just shock and horror is there.

275
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,990
One of the alternatives that's more commonly adopted is at the time we usually.

276
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,170
Yeah. Yeah, I think so and we'll discuss that.

277
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:47,820
That's a good question. So this is another kind of interesting comparison.

278
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:55,590
So on Tuesday, Tim talks about how, you know, the EPA feels under Bush did and behind the times,

279
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:05,010
but it's appearing that the OSHA and I don't know when these numbers this these numbers fluctuate every time there's new executive branch and whatnot.

280
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:18,300
But 17,000 employees compared to 2000, 20 times larger budget, up to 15 years in jail versus six months for people that really break the law.

281
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,150
And then this this is another big acceptable risk of a given health effect.

282
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,860
The benchmark is one in a million for an environmental exposure, but one in a thousand for for occupational.

283
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,100
So quite a difference there. We talk about acceptable risk.

284
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:43,110
All right. So back to these occupational exposure limits become a different form.

285
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,209
One is a daily limit, and that's where you're going to take that time weighted average.

286
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,490
And this is four exposures that occur day in, day out over a long period of time and more chronic hazards.

287
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,960
And it's about a 40 year 45 year career typically is what is.

288
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,160
A suit for those that differ from a short term.

289
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,600
So if something has more of an acute effect potentially.

290
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:13,180
These are 15 minute averages instead of an eight hour average.

291
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:20,920
So a lot of times in the term that's t a short term exposure as opposed to a PDA or something like that.

292
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,350
And then you have something called the ceiling limit. So this doesn't have any averaging time at all.

293
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:30,720
This is just a peak level that can be reached at any moment in the work shift has to be avoided.

294
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:37,900
And these are typically chemicals that will kill you or severely affect you in a very short period of time.

295
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:46,480
And then beyond that, you have an emergency chemical limit, and these are considered immediately dangerous to let it be known.

296
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:54,550
So, again, something super toxic. I don't know if she calls it ideal age, really dangerous to life and health.

297
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:02,020
For those emergency chemical elements. All right.

298
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,740
So here's a hypothetical exposure profile over time.

299
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:11,170
Say we had a real time monitor, we were able to measure for 8 hours that blue curvy line there.

300
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,820
And for any particular chemical. Well.

301
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,159
A sealing would, of course, be would be higher, you know, a short term exposure one at a time.

302
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:29,420
We had average and then whatever your measured exposure is averaged over that time, 8 hours or maybe a 15 minute period.

303
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,810
That's how we how we think about it. And we'll come back to that.

304
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,540
There's different types of. But we also we typically are talking about traditional oils.

305
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,780
I just want to. Put these into context.

306
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,620
So, you know, these are never perfect. These traditional ones. They take a long time.

307
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,309
They have a lot of technological feasibility considerations.

308
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:02,210
Usually if you had perfect data, you know, you'd have this quantitative help base that we all wish really exists.

309
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,250
But there's other things that are very common in industry and potentially in other countries.

310
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,900
Provisional wheels, you know, if you have a chemical that you work with a lot,

311
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,719
chemical companies, pharmaceutical companies, they'll do this a lot more.

312
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,620
They have their own processes to try to prevent exposure more upstream, which is very helpful.

313
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:35,890
We mentioned Rich last time, so this is European. So again, more process based rather than a single number you're trying to prevent.

314
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,650
In the air. And then down here, you have hazard banding.

315
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:49,820
Control again for four larger companies, pharmaceuticals, chemical, things like that.

316
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:57,270
They'll through a lot of this work, it's more process based. So there's just to give you some context on the different types of turns you might see.

317
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:06,450
But we're talking about right here for. So that acceptable risk that we talked about, you know,

318
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:15,780
you have your scientific component and then you have acceptable risk and technological and economic feasibility, that kind of money, the waters.

319
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:23,790
So are acceptable risk here. We just talked about how one in 1000 for occupational versus 1 million for

320
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:30,690
environmental as far as the that the risk of disease voluntary versus involuntary.

321
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:37,920
So again the workers kind of. Not because they're getting paid.

322
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:47,210
They don't have to be there. People say they should be taken out or be able to handle a higher level of risk.

323
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,520
Usually you might see things that have, you know, death is going to be taken a lot more seriously or a cancer event,

324
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,870
you know, something that causes dermatitis or something like that.

325
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,640
And then some cultural differences and what might be considered acceptable as well.

326
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,410
Chris. Country or world. So ocean current of evidence.

327
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:17,050
So their goal is to protect all employees from a material impairment of health and functional capacity.

328
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,470
But we've seen that may not be true.

329
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:28,989
To do that, they have to demonstrate that the limit on the books or what's commonly encountered,

330
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:34,870
if there is no limit currently on the books, is a significant threat to health.

331
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,640
So something that already has appeal,

332
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,500
we have to show that that level is associated with it much greater than one in a thousand risk of the particular outcome.

333
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:51,520
So that's to be very, very. Risky.

334
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,330
And they also have to show that any proposed new member would significantly

335
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:02,560
reduce that risk and then has to be technologically and economically feasible,

336
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:10,600
which is also very messy. What I think is technologically feasible, you know, can be considered so by someone else.

337
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,010
Be. And that's why it took so long.

338
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,870
So that's why it takes 20 years to get a new silica standard on hexavalent chromium.

339
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:26,620
Both things we know are harmful. So here's just a figure showing this.

340
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:32,180
So you have your whole premise for exposure limit. They show it's much greater than one in a thousand risk.

341
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:39,620
There's proposed a new one and show that it would be associated with much lower a significantly lower amount of risk.

342
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:46,800
And it has to be feasible. To to employers to get the reach that.

343
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:59,159
Here are a couple of old examples. So I think at one point it had an appeal of 500 micrograms per cubic meter and they were able to

344
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:07,260
show that it was associated with a risk of up to 700 per 1000 for a particular health outcome.

345
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:17,910
And they were able to get that cheese to ten micrograms per cubic meter and got down to a lowest feasible risk of 2 to 3 per 1000.

346
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,690
So still not that one in a thousand, but it's much, definitely much better.

347
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,729
And that was based on human data. Well, as we talked about, arsenic is naturally occurring.

348
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,170
So there is a lot of human data out there, all sorts of industry studies.

349
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:41,440
Ethylene oxide. Similarly, an old OPL 50 variable would show their around one 100 per 1000.

350
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:53,110
Or one in ten and then go change to 1 p.m., which is associated with one or two per 1000 risk.

351
00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:01,100
And that change was based mostly on toxicology. And both of these were way back in like the 1980s.

352
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,379
More modern. The two modern ones were the hexavalent chromium.

353
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:14,260
And the rest of the silica. Okay.

354
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:22,720
So let's all show an appeals promise for export limits alternatives in the US.

355
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,700
And both of these do appear on those annotated poll tables on our website now.

356
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:35,300
We have an American conference of government industrial engineers and they publish what are called the threshold limit values the top.

357
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,700
So again, you have a generic term occupational exposure limit.

358
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:50,830
OSHA has the permissible exposure. PCH has the TLB is the threshold limit value and now shows the recommended exposure.

359
00:40:52,630 --> 00:41:02,800
So the ECJ exchange is not a government organization, even though it says governmental industrial hygienist, it is just experts from around the world.

360
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,810
They get together and publish this annual book of topics and other things.

361
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:16,660
They also have some biological exposure indices, be the eyes for biomarkers of specific chemicals,

362
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:24,570
and these are the basis for a lot of occupational exposure limits for countries around the world.

363
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:34,180
So it's it's a highly regarded organization. Now, as I mentioned earlier, it's the research arm that was developed in the Bush Act.

364
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:44,140
And it does sets these health based recommended exposure limits that are supposed to be considered by OSHA in their standard setting.

365
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,340
But again, it can get kind of derailed by some of these other considerations.

366
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,080
So I'm just trying to be as clear as I can on these alphabet soup type of things,

367
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:01,360
because we do throughout the next part of the term, we'll be throwing in these terms around quite a bit.

368
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:13,730
So it's you know, these are distinctive because they're driving without countries, national policies or legislation.

369
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,270
They try to keep the politics out of it and be health based solely health based based on the data.

370
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,980
And in doing that, they don't take into account the feasibility issues,

371
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:30,090
although there have been studies to suggest maybe they sort of subconsciously do so.

372
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:38,020
But that's for another day. And they have a lot of caveats throughout because they have been sued a lot.

373
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:46,580
I think that if you put out levels that you say are our acceptable exposure level, something happens, people come after you.

374
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:54,580
So they have a lot of language in there about what they represent, what how they're supposed to be used, who thinks to use them.

375
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,530
So it's supposed to be trained professionals that apply these values that they publish.

376
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:10,719
Some history. So. Industrial hygiene students.

377
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,680
Have you heard of Warren Cook? No one cook thing here.

378
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:18,970
Coming up in October, he used to go to faculty here and they call him sort of the father of the.

379
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:24,820
He was instrumental in getting these off the ground way back in the 1940s, I believe.

380
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:35,770
So the ocean act for him was in 1970. Ocean was developed in 1971 and they published their first of appeals.

381
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,020
Pretty much just taking the topics that were already established from a sea change.

382
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:46,600
So the tubs that were on the books of my book here.

383
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,560
So they took the ones in 1971, made those their appeals.

384
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,970
But the TV's The River is them all the time with new information.

385
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,290
New research comes in. They can update motion, not so much.

386
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:09,370
So, you know, 18 years later, they try to revamp their PDA less an update a lot of the numbers based on your.

387
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:22,720
And they got shot down pretty pretty famously even the AFL CIO who you would think would be in favor of greater protections,

388
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:32,380
were against this at the time. So they after a three year battle, they then went back to the original 1971 values.

389
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:41,840
Except for those few that have been updated. So except for those 30 or so that have been updated, all these due date back to 1971.

390
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,340
And those were actually based on the topics that are on the books in 1968.

391
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:54,200
So keep that in mind again, when you look at these outdated tables or if you're charged with comparing,

392
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,080
figure out what level you think is acceptable in the workplace.

393
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:06,950
You want to keep in mind that many of these are very much outdated with the AFL-CIO again, and working with the trades.

394
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:13,620
So unions. And usually they're very, you know, pro the protection.

395
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,770
Um, so that must have to do with maybe fear of layoffs.

396
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:21,330
Who knows? Just before my.

397
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:25,460
Time. So.

398
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,360
Just to continue to illustrate kind of the messiness of this.

399
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,980
So occupational exposure limits around the world, kind of like Tuesday.

400
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:43,230
Unfortunately, this is more of North America and Europe centric, but even between there.

401
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:56,290
So we have this motion here of Australia, EU, Finland, this is France, Germany, Sweden and Austria and just a handful of chemicals shown here.

402
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:02,660
You can see that just kind of all over the place, like throw it throw a dart at the dart board to to know what to use.

403
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:10,360
So, you know, all these are at least a hundred fold difference between various organizations, some up to 210 different.

404
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:23,970
So again, highly variable. I, you know, best practice would say look at as many as you can find, compare what they say,

405
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:31,590
supports what they set it at, and then try to use your best judgment beyond, of course, the law.

406
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:40,639
The good news is that there is a general trend, aside from OSHA, that doesn't do this very often.

407
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:48,000
But, you know, you can track these is going as more science comes out, there's more research,

408
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,110
you have more sensitive end points, for example, and they might reduce over time components.

409
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:59,300
Why you see one that goes up because there's better information. But usually the trend is don't.

410
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:07,900
Yeah. So when they go up, is it the same? Processes for bringing the gun down.

411
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:11,209
That make sense? It's like our own actions. Yeah.

412
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,480
And I don't. I can't think of one that has been done at the whole level.

413
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,640
So legally enforceable, one that has gone up.

414
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:26,390
I think, you know, the TV's, it's just a much more not as formalized process that involves as many lawyers.

415
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:32,450
So, you know, it's a group of scientists that get together and say, oh, this we think we may have not had the right outcome or.

416
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:36,350
It's not very common, though. Usually they usually they get smaller.

417
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,510
So at least these organizations would agree on what's a carcinogen or not, right?

418
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:54,870
Well, not really. So they all have sort of different designations, but this is kind of put them all on the same scale.

419
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:59,520
And you see you have a range of one, two, three, four, some of these like.

420
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:10,260
It's. Hydrazine or ethylene bromide, potentially carbon tetrachloride.

421
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:19,590
Some organizations say it is definitely a human carcinogen. Some say it's insufficient evidence in humans to say carcinogen, but it is in animals.

422
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:24,540
So it's kind of all over the place based on their how they how they process information.

423
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,220
All right. So back to the tabs for a minute.

424
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,879
I got this slide from the previous instructor, which this course. Is huge topic.

425
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,450
Have you ever read it? He loves it. He agrees, but they are very influential throughout the world.

426
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:50,980
Again, we do updated every year as the basis of levels here as well as other countries.

427
00:48:53,900 --> 00:49:00,020
I mentioned they get to the eighties, there was a big lawsuit, but that's not the only one.

428
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:09,409
But so yeah they did industry with suing it workers suing them because it's you know it can be kind of

429
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,600
a lightning rod if you put that level out there and people want to follow it or something happens.

430
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:24,410
So again, there's a lot of interesting, but on the canvass site, I have posted a lot of the documentation.

431
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:33,890
So each job will be accompanied with documentation of what date of use to set that as well as their their videos.

432
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:39,090
So I posted the song and there's also some in the. The library upstairs.

433
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,820
So I mentioned there's a lot of caveats here. So they say, what are the trees,

434
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,629
the airborne concentrations of a chemical substance under which it is believed that

435
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,070
nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed day after day over a working lifetime.

436
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:03,470
So adverse health effects. So, again, they're not saying you can't say everyone.

437
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,159
They're saying, you know, nearly all their health based aides, again,

438
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,250
they're not supposed to take into account technological or economic feasibility guidelines to assist.

439
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,830
They're not legally enforceable. It's based on the scientific opinion of a group of experts.

440
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:26,200
And, you know. You're advised to use them as one of multiple factors in your assessment.

441
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,820
And they are reviewing it. They're also very careful to say what they are not.

442
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:38,130
They do not claim to be fine lines between safe and dangerous concentrations.

443
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,240
Many people are guilty of this when I've done this myself. Relative indices of toxicity.

444
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:50,090
So you take the tube of one chemical and compare it to another and it's lot lower.

445
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,880
You'd say, Oh, this must be a more toxic chemical there. They say, You're not supposed to that.

446
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:01,500
Not quantitative estimates of risk. Not consensus standards.

447
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,130
Again, not legally enforceable and.

448
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,900
Not. Considering economic and technical.

449
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:16,480
So. Again. They're very careful.

450
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:29,000
What we say. Cautionary notes again, supposed to be used by trained personnel only after reading the documentation.

451
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:34,690
Now, I don't know if people should follow this, but it is good to know how it comes about.

452
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:45,030
Until he does that. And again, there should be some writers upstairs in the conference room that we call the Egis library on the sixth floor.

453
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:50,819
I also posted a bunch of the documentation for some selection calls on campus and also on campus.

454
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,910
There should be the 2020 full book. Don't tell anybody.

455
00:51:54,270 --> 00:52:01,200
So this is not this year. Just to give you a sense of how it was and what it looks like.

456
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:06,180
Does anybody how until people click the student numbers of these change?

457
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:13,230
It's a it's a very densely packed a lot of ton a ton of information here.

458
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,420
It's got chemical hazards as well as physical hazards, noise, etc.

459
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:24,640
But, yeah, it's. It's nice. Do you usually carry that your back pocket?

460
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,010
No. Just on a lecture day where I'm talking about it. No, I'm not.

461
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,630
I'm not that hard core person, but it's always have it on my person.

462
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:39,760
Here's just an example of how they approach their updates.

463
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,140
This is an example from 2020. This year's looks a little different.

464
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:51,910
So, you know, I have proposed from the notice of intended changes.

465
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,720
So each year that I have a list of chemicals that are on the notice of internal changes, then the following year they might formally adopt that.

466
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:07,780
And then they'll say what other ones that they're thinking about for the future that they're currently actively talking about.

467
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,219
Then they have this sort of working list where they're like, These are of interest.

468
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,550
We just haven't really done much. We'll kick it to next year.

469
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:24,540
So you see a family on their phosphate. So some of these from 2020 are also, you know, they're in here now.

470
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,260
It's not like, oh, sure, it takes 20 years. They'll go this go ahead and do it.

471
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:35,380
Another one from this year going to see this. I made it up to that level.

472
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,360
Which is a very heavily used. Pesticide.

473
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:47,150
So kind of like with the pills, they have different designations.

474
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:53,360
So it'll be time weighted average based on 40, 40 hour workweek, eight hour workdays.

475
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:58,860
The short term exposure in my studio, that's 15 minutes.

476
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,300
And they also further specify you can only exceed that up to four times per day.

477
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:11,970
You can't just expose somebody for 15 minutes, not expose them for five, and then do it every, you know, every 15 minutes, he says.

478
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,930
Four times a day, separated by at least an hour. And.

479
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:23,070
Every chemical that has a short term exposure also has an eight hour time average.

480
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,910
But not every chemical has a time with average hazardous to you.

481
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,450
So it's chemicals that they know are chronic hazard.

482
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:36,110
But if you have peak exposures, you want to limit those. Ceiling levels.

483
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,959
That's again, something that should never be exceeded.

484
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:46,130
And chemicals in the GOP booklet that have a ceiling level will not have a time weighted average for us to eat on.

485
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:51,950
They're so toxic, they don't even want people to consider those longer duration exposures.

486
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,380
And then the last one here is surface limit. So this is getting at dermal.

487
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:05,450
You talk about how important dermal is, but there's only like two chemicals that they've actually listed for for this.

488
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,600
So this one still kind of work in progress, I'd say.

489
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:17,850
Do. Plus. I don't know if that's appropriate for Hiccup.

490
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:24,480
Yeah, it's probably okay. So here's an example of a page from last year's book.

491
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:32,880
Um, just kind of trying to point out some things. So you have the chemical name, case number you may not see and understands for.

492
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:42,910
Chemical Abstracts service, sadly, but that's useful for as chemicals have all kinds of synonyms like, you know.

493
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:49,630
Somebody might be calling it one thing and another group might be calling in another thing based on the organic chemistry or whatever it might be.

494
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,230
This that's the way to unify it, to make sure you're talking about the right thing.

495
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:57,520
If documentation, dates we've talked about every one of these values,

496
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,650
we'll have a document that talks about the data used and why they made the decision to that number.

497
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:12,250
And then I'll tell you how reason it is. So they are seen one that dates back to four seven, whereas then, you know, the pesticide is 2018.

498
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:16,210
So it a be more recent. We have a time weighted average.

499
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:25,510
So you see different units that are parts per million milligram per cubic meter fibers per cubic centimeter for asbestos.

500
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,220
And we'll go over some of those units in the. Future lectures.

501
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:38,090
We see a large range of numbers. The only one on this page that has a short term, 15 minute exposure level is benzene.

502
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:45,580
And you'll see that it's higher than the time weighted average. Then you have notations.

503
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,660
So there's a lot of different things. So an A means that carcinogen designation 81 is known carcinogen.

504
00:56:53,620 --> 00:57:01,809
Down that list that I showed she slides ago that says skin that means dermal is a is a concern but again they didn't quantify that

505
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:09,640
we talked about how complicated dermal exposure is to to quantify it just says pay close attention to prevent skin exposure.

506
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:17,780
Sensitization touch on that here by you can that's the existence of a distance from biomarker.

507
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,040
So a lot of potential notations there to give you more information about the chemical you

508
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,520
have your molecular weight as we talk about that can be important for a number of things.

509
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:33,700
And then, you know, talk about the basis that you tell me.

510
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:38,030
So from the documentation, what are the health effects of most concern that led to this number?

511
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,840
And it might be one thing, it might be multiple things. So for asbestos, you have to do reconnaissance, lung cancer, immunotherapy.

512
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:53,120
For benzene, it just says leukemia somewhere, you know, upper respiratory irritation.

513
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,829
Corners, race and ambition. It's a carbon paper.

514
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:05,760
So those are the organophosphates we talked about. So all kinds of information just on this one page.

515
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:10,650
Here's another random page. I just want to show you one that has a ceiling.

516
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,150
So we'll have it under the steel, a see and then a number.

517
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:21,750
You'll notice it doesn't have any other means. It's a toxic chemical that you don't ever want to exceed that value.

518
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:28,370
I don't know why. The other rotations.

519
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:43,840
So I went through some of these API. A lot of times that, in addition to inhalation, might be important.

520
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:49,210
That's why you might want to also get an internal dose measure. Skin designation.

521
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:53,180
We can talk about that.

522
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:59,389
But just because something doesn't say skin doesn't mean it's not a dermal concern, just means they don't have enough data yet.

523
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:06,080
So just keep that sensitization could be DSC n or RCN d is for dermal.

524
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:11,570
Ah, as for respiratoire, we touched on that earlier, earlier lecture sensitization.

525
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:19,460
You know you're exposed once you have an immune reaction that then might be triggered on a much lower exposure in the future.

526
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:28,980
So a lot of other notations to the back cover.

527
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:36,750
So again, there's a version, electronic version on campus of the 2020 version, but you can scroll down to see those notations there.

528
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,850
Peek at some other information here.

529
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:49,459
So even if there isn't an Steidl, they have guidelines on how much higher than the time we would ever do.

530
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:55,390
You could be forgiven period of time. So three times higher or five times higher.

531
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:02,700
Are some trigger points there? There are notations for some course fixing and a whole section.

532
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:06,160
And then you have a different appendices for carcinogens. Panelists.

533
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,760
Particle size mixtures and all such briefly sweeps.

534
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:21,670
Okay, so back to the exposure. Contour that showed before a profile through an eight hour work day.

535
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,370
So based on this, what do we think?

536
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:34,480
What if there's this chemical, this hypothetical chemical had a ceiling level to or we exceedance of a ceiling level here.

537
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,190
No. I mean, if it were me, I'd say that's getting pretty cool.

538
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:49,420
But no, not. Not technically. Uh, what about the CEO of a 15 minute short term explorer level?

539
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:06,880
Yes, probably we don't really have the the resolution here to know because in an hour it looks like maybe about 30 minutes.

540
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:13,450
But again, we don't really have. It's not. High resolution figure here.

541
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:17,420
So, yeah, I would say still the short term still is a concern here.

542
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,800
What about our time weighted average? Read our time weighted average. Right?

543
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:27,100
No, because this is the average of this curve.

544
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:32,499
You get this, you know, maybe 48 is our time weighted average.

545
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:37,030
But the threshold really value for time with the average is about 60.

546
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:44,680
So in this case, it's smaller. So just as an illustration of how the different values might compare to an actual exposure.

547
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:52,470
Just quickly, some of these dependencies are mentioned, carcinogens. This is how PCH defines them.

548
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:58,110
Again, that's slightly different from EPA as well as I argue that we touched on earlier.

549
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:09,140
Park was not otherwise specified. So a lot of things that aren't soluble where they don't think they're getting into the bloodstream.

550
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,510
They don't really know how to regulate them. So they do have some blanket hobbies.

551
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,329
And these are actually very high levels of ten milligrams per cubic meter.

552
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:21,110
So this is, you know, when I'm sweeping out my garage and I have all that road dust,

553
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:28,730
you know, I can't see across the road, I probably want to see what how I compare to this.

554
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:37,420
Piano pianos. Generally considered to have low toxicity if they don't have the own.

555
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,819
[INAUDIBLE] be. Another appendix for size.

556
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:46,980
Selective television will come back to this in a future lecture when we talk about aerosol sampling.

557
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:52,470
But this is an available dress proposal that we talked about when we talked about inhalation exposure.

558
01:02:52,950 --> 01:03:06,000
You know, generally speaking, you know, 100 micrometres, maybe 1085, depending on where they're causing their damage in the respiratory tract.

559
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,950
Mixtures is another thing.

560
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:19,230
So if you're exposed to multiple chemicals that have talvez, you have to think about are the effects additive or are they unrelated or independent,

561
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,940
or are they potentially synergistic if they're considered additive effects?

562
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,980
Um, similar toxic effect, but you don't think they're going to be synergistic?

563
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,150
Synergistic,

564
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:39,810
then you just simply add up the fraction of your measured concentration that appeared in the TLB and add those up and see if it's greater than one.

565
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:51,740
So, you know, if you have. Coming out of that first chemical was 50% healthy and the second one is 75% to tell me.

566
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:59,360
Neither one is on its own is exceeding. But if you add them together, they would be exceeded said to be 1.125%.

567
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,020
So that's basically how you approach an additive mixture.

568
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,320
And the title of the book has a whole section on how to do this.

569
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:16,410
And then if you have different time designations, how you how you combine those with a multiplayer.

570
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:26,020
Independent effects. It's simply just does any one of them except to be on their own.

571
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:31,270
You'll have to consider them together. And then when you're.

572
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:41,320
So how do you. You have to just use your own judgment to try to determine if something's additive or independent synergistic.

573
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:49,540
You have to base that on the literature. There's not a ton of examples out there, but they also don't even have instructions on how to handle it.

574
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:56,350
Um, there's some recommendations out there, but no, um, general guidance as to how to do it.

575
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:08,150
Some examples would be a big one that's smoking in asbestos 69 epidemiology studies where you know you have your smoking risk.

576
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:14,030
Do you ever do epidemiology research? Let's do a study of smoking and asbestos.

577
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,210
Both that one. But together, like the slope is much, much greater.

578
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:21,500
That's a synergistic effect. So you want to treat that differently.

579
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:27,440
They just don't advise you how specifically to methyl its carbon and ethanol.

580
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,540
So that's a synergy.

581
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:37,880
There's also a potentiation that can happen where both chemicals aren't necessarily targeting the same thing on their own, but together they might.

582
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,309
So isopropanol and carbon tetrachloride is one example.

583
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:48,320
And then ethanol, alcohol consumption, this is an example with many different things,

584
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:53,870
as has been shown with chlorinated hydrocarbons or various medications.

585
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:59,879
So that's just touching on mixtures, unusual work schedules.

586
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,530
So a lot of people work more than 8 hours at a time. They have processes for that.

587
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:10,500
And there's arguments based on what people think is the right way to handle these.

588
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,210
We don't really have time to get into these, but just know there's different approaches.

589
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:18,150
One's called the pharmacokinetic model approach.

590
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:26,900
One is called the ocean model approach, also known as the callback method, and then one called brief and scalar.

591
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,580
I think the names of the people that proposed we're not really going to get in depth on this right now,

592
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:39,670
but just know that there's I think I have supplemental slides that you're not responsible for,

593
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:44,060
but if you're interested in the slide deck, just had to go in a little bit more detail.

594
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:51,950
So to summarize the application until we again, they're usually much more.

595
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:56,780
They are much more updated than the ocean feels, much more health based.

596
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,810
And I would recommend using those if you can.

597
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:09,470
But you just need to know what their their limitations are and, you know, learn about them as much as you can as far as the documentation.

598
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:16,370
And you can judge for yourself on whether you think it's protective enough, things like that.

599
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:21,910
So to summarize,

600
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:31,750
Pelzer still feels legally enforced until these recommendations polls taken advantage take into account economic and technical feasibility.

601
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:38,170
The TV's do not their health based appeals and their legacies all workers protected.

602
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:43,120
We know that's probably not the case. These guys, they're little more careful with their language.

603
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:46,930
Nearly all, all workers protected very infrequently.

604
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:52,930
Revised for the Pels. Whereas these change revisits in only.

605
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:59,530
Heavy court battles to get the couples changed takes years and years.

606
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:05,680
Whereas his church is just committees of experts that discuss and propose and agree.

607
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:14,910
Just a couple more points here to make it just a little bit more on our heels.

608
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:20,230
I mentioned earlier recommended exposure limits. These are based on health research.

609
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,800
They set a level as guidance for OSHA.

610
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:32,710
What would be the health based level to set a high standard that usually gets raised once those concerns are taken into account?

611
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:41,190
And these things, while these are mostly outdated by now because they don't do this much anymore because they aren't updating.

612
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:47,969
Plus, they don't need to do a lot of background research that gets triggered when they have it on their party lists.

613
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:56,350
So like the Seleka in the 1990s, they said we want to revise the silica standard since we know they were going to do a ton of research.

614
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:01,080
Same happened with hexavalent chromium when that one was was sort of elevated.

615
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:06,180
But those criteria documents at the time they're written are very detailed and useful.

616
01:09:07,830 --> 01:09:16,260
This is a very useful resource, this nice pocket guide to chemical hazards, very useful information in the first problem.

617
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:23,220
So after the quiz I have, you go through some of these resources, you get some hands on experience interacting with them,

618
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:29,510
so you have some time to work with that I mentioned ideally already.

619
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:38,600
So again, if you're going, you know, sight unseen out to a hazardous work space and you're in charge of health and safety,

620
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:43,379
listen, first thing you might want to do is just make sure nobody is going to die right away.

621
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:52,290
Right. You want to maybe live to see another day to start chipping away at the various hazards, you know, in succession is for risk priority.

622
01:09:52,290 --> 01:10:00,420
But the ideal age, you know, confined spaces, things like that, where you can really have an elevated exposure in a short period of time.

623
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:04,950
And it's important to know. This pocket guide.

624
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:11,220
I don't really need to go, but it's useful to have all kinds of different chemicals.

625
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:21,480
You may have a favorite one. Want to search? Of course, I think dichloromethane very.

626
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:31,540
I'll meet you back later, guys. I used to work with this a lot as an undergrad.

627
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:38,010
I'm seeing one one dichloromethane and it's going right.

628
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:48,360
So here you have your training. So again, people like so that you want to refer to that that's track service number.

629
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:53,550
You have your other designations, Department of Transportation.

630
01:10:54,060 --> 01:11:00,870
Again, for for shipping, there's an ideal age. Hopefully you didn't exceed 2300 ppm.

631
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,790
You're still still sitting here.

632
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:10,700
They'll give you some ways to come back to this later in the semester, measure it some various chemical descriptions, things like that.

633
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:16,280
So it's a really useful thing in the old days is to have a book and it's actually a book,

634
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:22,560
but I think it's probably more useful online these days because it is a bit bigger than that one.

635
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:33,810
There's another one called The Wheels. So the American Industrial Hygiene Association is a professional.

636
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:38,270
Association of Industrial Hygiene, as you might expect, noted.

637
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:46,750
So they got together and set their own levels for things that weren't covered by TV's or Poles.

638
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:53,649
AJ AJ has much more people out in the street as members than these other organizations,

639
01:11:53,650 --> 01:12:01,570
so they got together and created levels for couples that weren't otherwise covered, so they got to about 80 of them.

640
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:07,479
Eventually that was taken over by a different organization called Holy Cross, and those are listed here.

641
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:13,810
So again, if you don't see the chemical of interest in those first two locations, you can check check the wheels.

642
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:21,220
Beyond that, individual companies might have their own regulations.

643
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:30,820
Since we're only covering about 500 and you can check other countries, but, you know, some examples.

644
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,100
DuPont, Dow, of course, chemical manufacturer,

645
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:38,410
they want they have a ton of chemicals that they have internal standards for that are on the books elsewhere.

646
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:45,930
Exxon is another one. So that's another way in which people want to compare levels.

647
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,150
Quick question. Yeah. For the corporate levels, are they like transparent about what those are?

648
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,360
Can you find them? Were internal classes?

649
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:01,920
I'm guessing it's usually internal. I'm guessing if you were on, say, a panel or knew somebody there, they would probably share that information.

650
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,729
But as far as that public, you can try.

651
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:08,840
But I if I had to guess, I'd say it's probably not public.

652
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,840
Especially not how they derived it, like the stuff, you know, the studies that were used.

653
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:21,150
They know it's harmful at that level. You know, so that stuff's pretty heavily guarded.

654
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:28,020
W.H.O. was mentioned on Tuesday. They also have some more good health initiatives.

655
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,200
I own a national labor organization.

656
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:41,590
I'll website's useful because it has all these different countries and you can see how those deals compare between countries.

657
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:46,840
It doesn't have every country. Hopefully they keep updating it to get more and more.

658
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,350
But here's an example. Screenshot of benzene.

659
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:58,030
You know. Here's us. It gave us those shows as well as nice.

660
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:04,160
And it shows how it compares to. The other countries that have one that they had access to.

661
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:11,120
So that's useful, especially for a lot of companies these days or international rights.

662
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:22,570
You want to know what the local laws are. So to review sunrise today a lot of a lot of acronyms.

663
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:29,260
So we have again, we know is the general term for occupational exposure, one not specific to any organization.

664
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:42,430
OSHA is the P0, HGH is the TLT, and they are, you know, the IAG, which is now the we are is the wheel.

665
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,290
And then of course, corporate is. But then you have some specialized.

666
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:52,430
We talked about the Mining Safety and Health Administration military has its own set of standards for various things.

667
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:56,780
Nancy might have some stuff that's on the surgical.

668
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,220
Please. I won't. I'm not going to really cover this.

669
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,920
It's just some considerations to to to think about when you're looking for an oil.

670
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,370
But generally, we think we say, you know, there's the oil.

671
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:18,780
We really a lot of times the topic is what we we really pay attention to and strive for because it's much more health based,

672
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:24,840
much more current usually. So but with that in mind, I'll let you guys reflect on these on your own.

673
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:32,310
So that's all for today. There's my resources page, you know, because I had so many links throughout.

674
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:35,220
It's just they're all embedded in the rest of it.

675
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:41,040
But like I said, we'll get that first promise that will have you interact with some of these resources.

676
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:51,250
All right. Any questions? Which which of these organizations would you trust the most?

677
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,530
It's huge, it's good. And the necessary element, there are one.

678
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:03,950
Those aren't updated very often. That's the problem. So they're good for that the year they were said.

679
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:09,080
So the topic, I'd say that's the way to go.
