1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,500
But I don't have any advice.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,520
So. Good morning, everyone. You're back.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,160
So, hey, we are thrilled to welcome to campus Shauna Eggers.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,450
And I tell you a lot about herself here in a few minutes.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,740
But as a way of introduction, I did want to give a couple of quick highlights.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,820
She completed her bachelor's degree in microbiology at the University of Wisconsin.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:43,350
She then went on to complete her Ph.D. in population health sciences with a concentration in epidemiology also from the University of Wisconsin.

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:55,770
Since 2018, Shauna has served as a post-doctoral fellow in environmental medicine and public health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

9
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,510
She's contributed to teaching numerous courses,

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,680
as well as research mentoring of a number of graduate and undergraduate students, both at Wisconsin and Sinai.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,670
During the same time, Shanna has published 16 peer reviewed journal articles, has collaborated on a number of projects,

12
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,650
and currently serves as principal investigator of her case 99 hours zero zero award from Newcastle

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,210
that focuses on early life metal exposure like gut microbiome and neurodevelopment in childhood,

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,210
which she's going to talk a little bit about here in a few minutes. So certainly an impressive list of accomplishments to date.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,420
Please join me in welcoming Jon Eggers you.

16
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,500
Right. Well, thank you all so much for coming out to see me. I appreciate it.

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,889
Yeah, this time I talk to you, but I'm just going to dive right in.

18
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:09,290
So my general research focus is to use environmental and molecular epi frameworks to understand interactions

19
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:15,050
between environmental chemical exposures and the human microbiome and then their downstream health outcomes.

20
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,430
So a little bit about me and why I care about this, how I got into it.

21
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,550
So I grew up in Iowa City, Iowa, basically like on campus of the University of Iowa.

22
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,230
And so I'm very familiar with the Midwestern college town vibes.

23
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:39,440
I used to go when I was a kid, I used to go up to northern Wisconsin to camp every summer where it really, you know,

24
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:49,520
got interested in the environment and conservation and all those types of good things and really sort of blossomed the love for Wisconsin.

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:59,450
And so when it was time to go to college, I decided to go to the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where I majored in microbiology as an undergrad.

26
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:10,250
And then I took, you know, of a few jobs working in different kinds of microbiology labs and analytical chemistry labs after I graduated.

27
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:17,870
And so I got to sort of be on the kind of applied microbiology side of things and

28
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,519
thinking about how microbes affect health in humans and different ways that,

29
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:30,620
like microbial genetics, interact with human health and even like genetically modified plants and all that stuff.

30
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:39,020
So it really got me interested in and thinking about microbial genetics and human health and the environment.

31
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:46,640
So I decided to apply for a Ph.D. in the Population Health Program at Madison.

32
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:56,180
And then I worked with an environmental epidemiologist there and did work around environmental exposures and the human microbiome,

33
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:06,380
which I'll talk about in a minute. And so then I wanted to get a little bit more focused environmental health research, training and experience.

34
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,059
So I chose to do my postdoc at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,

35
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,860
and there Environmental Medicine and Public Health Department, which is where I'm at now.

36
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,740
And so for the next steps, I'm hoping to make it back to the Midwest a little bit more comfortable for me.

37
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,339
All right. So just to make sure we're all kind of on the same page about what I'm talking

38
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,190
about when I'm talking about the human microbiome and microbiome studies,

39
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,229
I have a few slides, so sort of background and intro about microbiome concepts.

40
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:44,270
So the microbiota is the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that share our body space.

41
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,520
I'll get into a little bit what those different types of organism definitions are,

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,010
and the microbiome is the microbiota and all the genes that they encode.

43
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,240
So I'll probably be talking about microbiome sort of from here on out, but I'm,

44
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,230
I'm really talking about a mix of like who's there and what genes they have.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,569
So different body sites have different environments and thus support different kinds of microbial communities.

46
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,750
And so the human microbiome is different on the skin compared to a nose or the mouth of the gut.

47
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,600
And usually our body is in pretty good balance with our microbes.

48
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,939
You know, we grow up with them, humans have evolved with them. And so usually there's sort of this homeostasis.

49
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,899
And when that gets out of balance, it's called a dysbiosis,

50
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,660
which is usually an indicator that there's like a disease state or there's something going on there.

51
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,450
So we can have different kinds of relationship with the bacteria within our gut microbiome.

52
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:53,690
Oh, and I want to mention that the microbiome includes bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea, but I'm really going to focus on the bacteria side of this.

53
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,709
So we have different kinds of relationships, good relationships, bad relationships.

54
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:05,090
The good ones are mutualistic where we provide a benefit to the microbes and they provide a benefit to us,

55
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,390
like we give them a place to live and they help us digest our food.

56
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,200
There are also commensal relationships where they are good for the bacteria typically,

57
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,310
and while they're not providing us any direct benefit, they're not doing any harm either.

58
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:29,720
They're just kind of hanging out. So here are a few different examples of specific bacteria that usually are mutualistic or commensal.

59
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,400
You know, bifidobacteria often influence gut barrier integrity or different kinds of farming.

60
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:47,690
Kids can produce different short chain fatty acids are are a big thing in microbiome research and help us digest so.

61
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:54,500
Relationships that we can have with these bacteria are typically pathogenic or opportunistic pathogens.

62
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:03,180
So pathogens cause disease for us, and sometimes there are bacteria that are usually commensal.

63
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:10,250
But if the gut shifts into a dysbiosis, they can sort of take over and then cause disease.

64
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:18,680
And that's what we call an opportunistic pathogen. So I highlighted a couple that I wanted to just focus on moving forward.

65
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,380
Staphylococcus, probably a lot of you have heard of MRSA.

66
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:29,630
It's staph aureus are usually commensal, but they can cause disease, especially if they're antibiotic resistant like Mersa.

67
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,379
And then Proteobacteria is a file of bacteria in general.

68
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:40,130
It has a lot of pathogens. And typically when we do our microbiome studies and there's a lot of

69
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,540
proteobacteria in a sample or in a community that's indicative of a disease state.

70
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,830
So normally the gut microbiome helps us mediate food digestion.

71
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,950
They work in combination with the immune system to help sort of tailor it to what to attack?

72
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,530
What not to attack. And they create a lot of different kinds of messenger molecules and metabolites

73
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,370
that enter through into the bloodstream and circulate throughout the body.

74
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,120
And they also also can serve to prevent pathogen colonization.

75
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:25,129
So there are a few different ways that they do that. So this is like a zoom in to some epithelial cells within the gut.

76
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:31,160
And this top yellowy part is the mucus layer, and then these are the glial cells.

77
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:43,340
So a lot of the times are good, healthy microbiome helps to thicken that mucus layer and prevents pathogens from getting through to the cells.

78
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:53,380
They also can help in supporting the like build buildup of connections within the tight junctions here.

79
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,780
So they just make this like a stronger bond between cells so bacteria can't go through there.

80
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,390
And they also can provide competitive inhibition.

81
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:13,940
So that's where the good bacteria basically outcompete bad bacteria for vital resources or binding sites, things they need to survive.

82
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:22,430
So we have a bunch of different ways to study the microbiome and different types of data.

83
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:30,760
So the sort of classic microbiology that has been around for hundreds of years is culture based.

84
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:36,350
So that's where we have some specific media that we're trying to grow of bacteria,

85
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,040
and you can use that kind of data to look at is this bug that I'm interested in there or not?

86
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:52,580
And you can also sort of estimate its concentration by count by doing like serial dilutions and then counting, like how many of them grow on a plate.

87
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,940
But that has its limitations because a lot of bacteria are not cultural in the lab.

88
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,730
So you're really limited to what you can look at and you don't get a sense of like the whole community at once.

89
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:15,860
So in the past 20 years or so, sequencing technologies have really advanced and become very like cheap and popular to use.

90
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:25,190
And so one of the sequencing methods that we use for microbiome data is RNA, amplicon sequencing.

91
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:33,890
So the US RNA is like a specific genes that are here and this is what the RNA looks like.

92
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:44,480
So there are specific regions that are highly conserved across all bacteria like at the beginning and the end and then like certain places throughout.

93
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:53,090
So we use PCR primers to target those spots and then we sequence the entire sequence between those highly conserved spots.

94
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,840
And the spots in between are highly variable, but they're conserved sort of within species level.

95
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,470
So you can use that data from this marker gene to try and identify what the bacteria is.

96
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,010
And so you take those sequences and you run it in a database and then it spits out like what the bacteria is,

97
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,190
if it can be identified, and then what you have are usually obtuse or abbvie's.

98
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,649
And what that means is like it's not quite species,

99
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:30,290
but it's kind of an approximation of species and it's basically like the taxonomic unit that we use when we're using microbiome data.

100
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,990
So I'll probably refer to those. That's what I'm talking about. And with this kind of data you can get.

101
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:45,430
Presence or absence of different types of bacteria. And you also can get abundance or relative abundance within the sample.

102
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,150
So that's like how many of each type of bacteria there are.

103
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,280
And then you can also calculate diversity, which I'll talk about a little bit in the next slide.

104
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:04,390
So a little bit more advanced form of sequencing that is really becoming more and more popular every day is whole genome sequencing.

105
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,170
And what that does is instead of just using that 16 s RNA marker gene to try and identify the bacteria,

106
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,890
you're sequencing all of the genes in the microbiome.

107
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:25,089
So what you get is a much clearer way of identifying which bacteria are there, and you also have all the genes that are there.

108
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:31,120
So you know what their potential functions are, although you don't know which of those genes are actually being used.

109
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,719
So without the diversity so there's when we talk about diversity,

110
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,190
there are two kinds outside of, well, two kinds that we talk about in microbiome stuff usually.

111
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,660
So there's alpha diversity, which is within individual sample kind of population.

112
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,380
So that is within the sample, the richness, which is the number of different taxa present and their evenness of abundance.

113
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:04,240
So if there is like specific bacteria where or microbiomes where one bacteria is really outgrowing everything else,

114
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,510
then that's that lowers the diversity score.

115
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:14,320
And a good diversity score has more evenness where everything's sort of evenly distributed across many different kinds of bacteria.

116
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,370
So I have this little these little boxes that are supposed to represent different microbiome samples.

117
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,650
So I take a look at them the different like shapes and colors so as to represent different kinds of bacteria.

118
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:34,210
So based on this, which box has the highest richness number of C.

119
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:44,700
See, see here. But also, when we're just looking at richness, it's just a number of different times.

120
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,080
There's three different kinds here. Three Democrats, zero two here. Okay.

121
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,230
So when we're thinking about diversity, which is the highest in diversity.

122
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,530
C Yeah, because it's more even with. A You have many more of those purple dots.

123
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:09,900
Okay, perfect. So with being a diversity, that's more of a comparison between communities and groups of different samples between each other.

124
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,180
So a lot of the times this is measured as a distance.

125
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:21,810
So like two samples that are very similar composition will be closer in distance, then two that are far apart.

126
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:32,790
And then these distances are based on different presence and absence levels of different bacteria and different abundances.

127
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,540
And you can also include phylogenetic tree information.

128
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,140
So that's like, you know, E.coli and salmonella are two different species.

129
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,200
So if you're not considering phylogenetic tree, they count as like two separate entities.

130
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,610
But if you are considering the phylogenetic links, they're very similar genetically.

131
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,839
So a sample that has a bunch of E coli and a sample that has a bunch of

132
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,680
salmonella would actually be closer together if you're considering phylogenetic.

133
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,830
Okay. So here's like a a 3D rendering of beta diversity.

134
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,850
So which of these color groups are most similar to each other?

135
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,190
Mm hmm.

136
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,150
Yeah, red and green. So these two colors are most similar to each other because they're closer together.

137
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:27,570
But within this blue group, all of these samples are very similar, and these ones are a little bit more dispersed within each group.

138
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:39,809
All right. So the gut microbiome and so gut microbiome composition has been associated with many different kinds of health outcomes,

139
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:50,730
especially neurological outcomes, through the gut brain access, which is a sort of multiple pathway link between the gut and the brain.

140
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,490
And, you know, our guts and brains are constantly in communication. That's why, you know, you're hungry and all that stuff.

141
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:04,530
So there's a lot of different ways that signals go between the gut and the brain and the microbiome is involved in that.

142
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:18,120
So the gut microbiome is a really interesting in thinking about the way that the gut affects health and disease, especially like neurological disease,

143
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:24,660
because it's malleable, it's a potential opportunity for intervention that if we can promote good gut health,

144
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:33,509
we can prevent some of these downstream health outcomes. But to be able to shift the microbiome, you have to know what affects it, right?

145
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,430
So how does it develop? Timing is really important in gut microbiome development.

146
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,939
So there's a little bit of evidence that maybe there's some microbiome stuff happening before birth.

147
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,480
But really the primary colonization time point is at birth.

148
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,340
So the way that children are born, the mechanism, either vaginal or C-section,

149
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,900
has a big influence on what kind of bacteria colonize them, especially in those first few months.

150
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:08,310
And then a lot of the exposures that happen basically within the first three years or so can cause big shifts that can last a long time,

151
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:15,930
although there's not a ton of research on these sort of like childhood years because the studies just haven't followed the kids that long yet.

152
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,630
So different kinds of exposures that can affect the gut microbiome.

153
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,069
Our birth mode, which I just discussed and diet is a huge one.

154
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:32,250
Obviously different kinds of nutrients support, different kinds of bacterial metabolism.

155
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:39,360
And so for different kinds of microbes, antibiotics, clearly probiotics, probiotics,

156
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,050
anything that is specifically made to target the microbiome in that medicinal type of way obviously does.

157
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,919
And then environmental pollutants, that's what I'm interested in looking at.

158
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,400
And there's a lot less out there on those effects.

159
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:04,240
Although it's growing. So environmental metals are among sort of earliest recognized environmental hazards.

160
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,670
They cause a whole host of different kinds of health effects, including neurological,

161
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,910
etc. Usually they're studied individually, and that's how public health standards are set.

162
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,120
Considering individual exposures to different kinds of chemicals, but people aren't exposed to things one at a time.

163
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,770
We're exposed to lots of things all the time.

164
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:32,440
So there's really been a shift in the last ten years or so towards looking at different kinds of mixtures of environmental exposures,

165
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,620
and these different mixtures can have like additive or interactive effects.

166
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:47,890
And so it's really important to consider them. So metals aren't just bad for humans, they're bad for a lot of bacteria as well.

167
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,010
Some bacteria are resistant to metals similar to antibiotic resistance.

168
00:18:54,430 --> 00:19:06,520
So there's been a lot of research in animal models about the ways that these different kinds of metal exposures interact with the microbiome.

169
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:12,159
And overall, the animal models have shown that they reduce diversity of the microbiome,

170
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,270
they alter metabolic function and they can induce antibiotic resistance.

171
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:24,099
And that happens in a few different ways. A lot of the times, antibiotic resistance genes and metal resistance genes are linked.

172
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:32,170
So they can either be like physically linked on the same plasmid where the genes are close together and they move between bacteria together,

173
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,850
or it can be that they are transcriptional induced.

174
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,739
So you have to separate genes. But the same stimulus induces transcription of both, or you can have that.

175
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:50,800
There's one mechanism that provides antibiotic and metal resistance, like I'm efflux pump that just pumps chemicals out sort of indiscriminately.

176
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:59,800
And so if you have antibiotic exposure or metal exposure, it induces antibiotic and metal resistance together.

177
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,499
So like I mentioned, most of this research was done in animal models.

178
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,410
So what about humans? And here's how I think that biological mechanism works.

179
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,410
So we have metal exposure that causes changes in composition, reduces competitive information,

180
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:24,130
generally alters the gut microbiome, but metal exposure also reduces immune function.

181
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:31,000
And because the gut microbiome and the immune system interact constantly, that also causes shifts.

182
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:39,730
And both of these could lead to potential increases in colonization by pathogens and general antibiotic resistant bacteria.

183
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,829
And then also, we have this direct selection for antibiotic resistance, as I mentioned before.

184
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,670
So this is sort of simplified. There's more arrows that probably belong up there.

185
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,800
But when we think about metal mixtures,

186
00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:01,930
it basically amplifies all of these pathways and it doesn't just lead to different kinds of antibiotic resistance or pathogen colonization.

187
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:07,940
There are a lot of other health outcomes it can affect. Cool.

188
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,090
All right. So when I started down this path, I was really curious about what kind of epidemiologic evidence existed.

189
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:30,370
And at the time, this was the only study published in humans that looked at metal exposure and the gut microbiome, heavy metal specifically.

190
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,929
So this one, it wasn't even the main point of the study.

191
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:42,850
It was kind of like secondary aim, but they just kind of tacked on. But what they found was that lead was associated with gamma proteobacteria.

192
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:49,420
So if you remember back to my early slide, Proteobacteria is usually an indication of dysbiosis.

193
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:57,670
So this sort of laid the groundwork for an association between LED and like not great bacteria in the gut microbiome.

194
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,180
So before I like really committed to this as my dissertation topic, I was like,

195
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,010
Is there data that exists out there that I could dabble with and look at this a little bit further?

196
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,509
So I went to Ed Heinz and Heinz doesn't have microbiome samples, but for the years 2000,

197
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:22,210
2004, they did screen for nasal mersa and staph aureus in general.

198
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:30,370
So I looked at the association between blood lead and nasal versus an MSI.

199
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:40,180
So MRSA is the susceptible version I was using. This is like a marker of the general antibiotic susceptible microbiome.

200
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:49,480
And what we saw, at least in the unadjusted model, was that with increasing levels of lead exposure,

201
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,919
there was decreased odds of colonization by these susceptible microbes.

202
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,660
And, you know, the effect went away a little bit when we adjusted for different kinds of confounders, but it's still sort of the same direction.

203
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:11,140
And then we looked at the same thing with methicillin resistant staph aureus, so a marker of antibiotic resistant microbes.

204
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,820
And what we saw was that with increasing quartiles of lead exposure, we saw increasing odds of colonization.

205
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,660
So this sort of supported that hypothesis that, you know,

206
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:30,340
lead exposure would lead to a decrease in susceptible bacteria and an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria.

207
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,430
Yeah, these are the conclusions. So I was excited about this.

208
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,560
I was like, okay, I'm willing to commit to this a little bit further.

209
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,950
So the next question was, is human led exposure associated with the gut microbiome as a whole, not just this one nasal pathogen?

210
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:56,139
So to look into this, I use data and samples from the survey of the health of Wisconsin or so it's modeled after NHANES.

211
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:04,540
But like just in the state of Wisconsin, they collect tons of different health survey data and lots of different like samples and measurements.

212
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:12,040
And in 2016 and 2017, they added this Wisconsin microbiome study.

213
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:19,870
So the purpose of that study was to look at dietary fiber specifically and different kinds of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the gut microbiome.

214
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:25,479
But they took a bunch of different samples from all over the body, including stool samples,

215
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,150
and they asked some additional, like antibiotic resistance, risk questions and additional diet stuff.

216
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,770
And this was all in humans.

217
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:42,190
But I will say, since then, they've continued to do a lot of microbiome sampling in kids and adults, lots of different sites.

218
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,050
They even have some environmental stuff. So if you're interested in working with them, they have lots of data to look at.

219
00:24:48,880 --> 00:25:02,710
So for my dissertation project, I used urine samples collected by show to analyze LED exposure and saw that with increasing light exposure,

220
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,690
there was an increase in diversity.

221
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:16,720
So inverse Simpson is one way to measure diversity, and that's sort of showed up in this unadjusted and again weaker and then adjusted model.

222
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,240
But then when we looked at richness was just just the number of different bugs that are there.

223
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,650
We also saw an increase with increasing urine lead and it remained significant even in the adjusted model.

224
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,700
And then when we did the beta diversity, we saw that there was a very, very small but significant association between urine letting greater diversity.

225
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,419
And you can kind of see it here like there's not clear separation.

226
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:50,620
And in a lot of human studies where you're looking at healthy patients or participants, I should say,

227
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,640
you just don't get a lot of clear separation, but you can through a little bit of color shift there.

228
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:04,180
But then when we looked at which of the bacteria specifically were shifted, we saw an increase in proteobacteria and work your reality.

229
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,970
So which is a type of proteobacteria. So to summarize this, we saw positive associate.

230
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:17,880
Relations between richness and diversity. And you're an LED, which was a little sort of the opposite of what we saw in those animal studies.

231
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:24,030
But a lot of the research that's come out since this paper has seen the same thing,

232
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,469
and it makes sense when we think about we're increasing abundance of proteobacteria

233
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,220
and some of these other not so great bacteria that those numbers would increase.

234
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:41,040
All right. So once we did this, we were really interested in looking at the antibiotic resistance within this population.

235
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,860
So we use the same urine led and specifically cultured.

236
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,939
So that last study was using sequencing.

237
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,870
And then we also cultured for specific antibiotic resistant bacteria.

238
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:09,660
And we looked for Mersa vancomycin resistant enterococcus fluoroquinolone resistant gram negative bacilli and CTF and I sort of pooled all of those.

239
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:18,240
And because we know that you really need higher sorts of higher exposure levels,

240
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,440
we and the general exposure to lead in this population was pretty low.

241
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,080
We split it into like the 95th percentile, most highly exposed to it versus everything below.

242
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,409
And then we looked at yes. Did they have one of these antibiotic resistant bacteria or.

243
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:47,670
No? And we saw that with being in the 95th percentile of LED exposure was associated with an increased odds of colonization.

244
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,399
Again, it was a little bit of significance with the trend. It's sort of the same in the adjusted as the unadjusted.

245
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:00,660
And then we also did a stratified analysis to look at differences between rural residents and urban residents,

246
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:10,470
because urban residents have a lot more sort of risk factors for lead exposure in Wisconsin and also for just acquiring different kinds of.

247
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:19,790
Contagious bacteria. So we saw that really most of the association was in this urban subset of the population.

248
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:29,270
So to summarize, this led associated with an increased odds of RB colonization, especially in the urban residents.

249
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:33,410
So this was all cross-sectional adult population.

250
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:42,380
We really don't know sort of like what came first. And so the next clear question was like, does timing of exposure matter?

251
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,770
Because we know that the gut microbiome develops really early.

252
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,810
It makes sense that those early exposures might have a stronger effect them in this adult population.

253
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,990
And of course, I'm interested in looking at mixtures. So that's what I wanted to do for my post-doc.

254
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:05,700
And since I've been working at Mount Sinai, I've learned a lot about different kinds of mixture modeling approaches.

255
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:14,930
And one of the ones that's frequently used in my department, because the developer works in my department, is a way to control some regression or WQ.

256
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:22,280
S And this is a very simplified explanation of how it works, because I am not a biostatistician.

257
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,740
But just to give you the nuts and bolts of it,

258
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:35,540
you basically calculate weighted associations of a bunch of different typically chemicals that you're putting into a mixture index.

259
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:41,150
So you calculate the weighted associations with some specified outcome that you're interested in.

260
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,380
And then you use quantile exposure to get them all sort of on the same levels.

261
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:57,950
And you can constrain that model to be a positive association or negative association with whatever your outcome is.

262
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,879
And then use an ensemble step that creates that index,

263
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:10,130
putting all of the different chemicals together and calculating weights for all of those different chemicals.

264
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,370
So then, oh, and also you split the data.

265
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,440
So that was all in a training dataset and then you use a validation data set once you have those weights calculated.

266
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,280
So you use the weighted index in a regression and it estimates the mixture effect.

267
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:30,559
But then you can also use the weights within the index and multiply them by that

268
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,630
data to get an idea of like what each component is contributing in the effect.

269
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:37,600
All right.

270
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:48,320
So again, I was learning this new analytical method, and I wanted to see if I could figure out how to use it on some publicly available data.

271
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:59,370
So in back to end, Haynes and looked at a bunch of different chemical mixtures in association with Mersa and I was interested in metals obviously and,

272
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,209
and Haynes is a little bit tricky because of the way that the subsample participants.

273
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,440
So I couldn't get like all the metals across all the people. I had to sort of break them up into funny groups.

274
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,989
But I was interested in looking at metals and edges and metals and triclosan,

275
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:21,110
because both of these have sort of previously indicated a relationship with antibiotic resistance or potential to select for it.

276
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:32,900
So in this analysis, we saw that there was a significant association between the mixture of some of these metals and agents and versus colonization.

277
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:41,629
And when we looked at the weights from within that index, these are the most heavily weighted ones for cadmium and a few of these other ages.

278
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,810
But you can see blood lead is way up here. So even though this is the same data that I analyzed way back,

279
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:53,840
when we get really different results when we're looking at mixtures versus individual exposures.

280
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:00,230
So the metals and ages were associated with increased nasal colonization.

281
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:07,880
What about the rest of the human microbiome? And can these mixture methods be applied to microbiome data?

282
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,569
So I've been working with Chris Jennings,

283
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:17,990
who developed WKYC and has helped sort of shape the way that all of the different kinds of extensions of WTS have gone.

284
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:26,570
And we're really interested in seeing if we could use it to look at microbiome data as a mixture of potentially correlated bacteria.

285
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:33,379
So to do that, we first used random subset WQXR, which was developed for metabolomics.

286
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:39,080
And basically you use it when you have a lot more components in your mixture than you do observations in your study.

287
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:45,889
And we had to adjust it a little bit to use it for microbiome data,

288
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:54,920
because microbiome data is very zero inflated because a lot of different people's microbiomes just have different things in them.

289
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,100
So you get a lot of zeros from one person to another.

290
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,970
And so we use this ranking system where we kept all the zero zeros and then only quantile above zero.

291
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,739
But we're also we're still playing with this a little bit, thinking about different ways that we could deal with these zeros.

292
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,300
But this is how we've approached it so far.

293
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:20,030
So we also paired that with W-2s with repeated holdouts, which basically just reruns your whole analysis a bunch of times so that you get.

294
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,890
So robust estimates and we put this all together and what we're currently calling W,

295
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,720
r, r, h, which is still a mouthful, but a little bit better than all of those words.

296
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:39,270
So we wanted to see if we could use this reasonably on, on microbiome data.

297
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:44,790
So we again went to some publicly available microbiome data from the Human Microbiome

298
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:51,150
Project and we wanted to test the use of WQ r s r h on microbiome abundance data.

299
00:33:51,990 --> 00:34:02,129
And to do that, we simulated a binary variable and then gave it an association to 20 otus or taxa from within the microbiome

300
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,850
data that we picked because they had previously been linked to different kinds of health outcomes.

301
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,650
So we thought it was like more realistic.

302
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:17,400
And of those 2002 use, we assigned two to have a strong relationship with the binary variable eight to be medium and tend to be weakly associated.

303
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,030
And then we also simulated a random variable as sort of a negative control.

304
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:29,010
So we wanted to look at is the wts r s RH index associated with this binary variable in the direction

305
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,100
that we assign the association and isn't able to pick out those totals that we gave rise to.

306
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:41,129
So we ran the model and we ran our random variable as a negative control and

307
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:45,120
we can see that the model picked up an association in the positive direction,

308
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,300
which is the direction we assigned and the random variable did not.

309
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:54,950
So we're very happy about that. And then we wanted to see if it could pick out those different oh to use.

310
00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:03,270
So this is sort of a we tried different ways of like averaging in that sort of ensemble step that brings the w us together.

311
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,660
And one of them was sort of better than the other.

312
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,540
And then we plotted the sensitivity and specificity of its ability to pick out these 20 otus.

313
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:21,540
And with W, you kind of set a threshold of importance in the weight value so you can figure out like

314
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,740
these ones are more than average weight and these ones are less so they're less important.

315
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:35,940
So in in this case, we were able to calculate the sensitive sensitivity and specificity because we knew which 20 we were looking for.

316
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,780
And we can see that the sensitivity and specificity sort of crosses right here.

317
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,830
But in a normal use of this model where you're just doing one over the number of components in your mixture,

318
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,100
which we call the equal weighted threshold, that's what this gray line is.

319
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,100
So it's still not too far off from there.

320
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,920
And so here's our overall sensitivity specificity.

321
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,290
And we can see it does the best in those strong and medium associations and not quite as well in the weak associations.

322
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:15,960
And then we also compared this method to a bunch of other sort of more standard ways of doing microbiome analysis.

323
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,600
And it either performed the same or better than all of the comparison models that we looked at.

324
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:27,120
So we're really excited about this. We identified the association in the right direction.

325
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,570
It had pretty good sensitivity and specificity.

326
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:39,570
So we're going to run with it, right? So can we use this W-2s and extend it to examine microbiome associations over time?

327
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:45,060
Mm hmm. So I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with this.

328
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:54,000
Fig. about critical windows of exposure. So basically time is really important in development, right?

329
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,480
You have different developmental trajectories for all of these different biological traits that start as early as conception,

330
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,770
and some of them go forever, but some of them are sort of set within the specific balance.

331
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:15,870
And when you have exposures that sort of derail that trajectory at different time points, they have different resulting like phenotypic outcomes.

332
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,570
So if you have led exposure here, you have a potential to mess up a lot of different things,

333
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:26,220
a lot more than if you have light exposure here where a lot of these things already sort of set.

334
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,940
So I'm interested in looking at are there critical windows of exposure for microbiome development?

335
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,970
And because we know like those first three years are really important in microbiome development,

336
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,659
there's some sort of evidence that there might be something like this,

337
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,030
but it's not really clear whether like there could be prenatal programing of the immune system

338
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,410
or things like that that could influence microbiome composition throughout the life course.

339
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,090
So to investigate that, I need a better biomarker of exposure.

340
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,080
And so I'm working with Dr. Maneesh Arora at Mount Sinai, who developed this tooth biomarker.

341
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:18,540
So we use baby teeth shed like, you know, 7 to 10 years old and collect them, which is a very easy biomarker collection comparatively.

342
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,180
You don't have to freeze them or anything like that and then send them to the lab, cut them open with a laser.

343
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,480
And you can see that the the baby teeth sort of grow with rings like trees.

344
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,310
So there's this first line that happens at birth, obviously.

345
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:39,900
And then there are these different rings and you can kind of count forward and backward and

346
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,910
development from as early as like the second trimester of pregnancy to about the first year of life.

347
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:53,940
And then you use a little laser to blast these little rings and and you get different particles and then you run through them and

348
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:05,040
you can measure a ton of different metals and other kinds of like calcium and different things all at once in a very sort of easy,

349
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,750
simple way. And you get really fine high resolution of exposure as well.

350
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:21,360
So my plan basically was to use these study participants and samples and data from the progress cohort,

351
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,729
which is based out of Mexico City and it enrolled pregnant women and has followed them.

352
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:33,719
Now they're about 13 or 14 years old. Teeth were collected at age 7 to 10.

353
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:42,810
And then when I started my postdoc at Mount Sinai, we started collecting stool samples from the kids and then they were about 9 to 10 years old.

354
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,560
So the goal is to get about 300 samples.

355
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:55,770
We got to about 120 and then COVID hit and we're still sort of trying to ramp that back up, but the goal is still 300.

356
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:01,620
And then we also started collecting saliva from the kids in the mothers to look at the oral microbiome as well.

357
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,660
And we're hoping to get everybody in that sample.

358
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:17,190
So with this data, I applied for a P30 pilot grant to get some preliminary data and then turn it into a canine 900 application,

359
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,640
which was funded until the end of 2021.

360
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:29,819
So here are the aims. I'm interested in looking at metal exposure in the teeth from that second trimester to the first year,

361
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:35,850
and then using blood and other biomarkers to look at the sort of in between metal

362
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,620
exposure up until the gut microbiome samples were collected at 9 to 11 years.

363
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:48,990
So looking at real exposure on the gut microbiome later in childhood and then linking it to some attention outcomes,

364
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,490
this cohort is really well set up to look at neurodevelopmental outcomes.

365
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,310
And so attention is one that we wanted to look at specifically here.

366
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:08,490
And then we're also using stool metabolomics to sort of get at that mechanism between this metal exposed gut microbiome and retention outcomes.

367
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:22,079
And so this is some like really early preliminary data where we were just sort of applying this WQ as method to about 25 samples so far.

368
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,330
And we see like the method works even with this little sample and across these

369
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:35,010
different trimesters and time points of exposure to lead specifically in this one,

370
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:42,870
we had some different bacteria that were associated a different time points, but a lot of them were conserved across all three.

371
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,190
So this is just like super early based on. Whole genome sequencing data.

372
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,470
And I just got all the rest of the the whole genome sequencing data back.

373
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,100
So hopefully I'll be working on this some more in the next year.

374
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:03,850
So here are the next steps for the 99. I'm still collecting stool samples.

375
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,830
We're doing some analysis with the blood metals because we don't have a lot of overlap yet between the teeth and the stool samples.

376
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:20,290
And then of course, adding the metal mixtures analysis in the plan for the R0 zero phase is to analyze the tooth microbiome or the tooth

377
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:26,380
metals in the microbiome and the stool metabolomics and linking everything together with the neurodevelopment.

378
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:37,120
So with that, my general, like long term career plans are to continue to do these environmental epi studies, keep working with progress,

379
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:43,930
doing longitudinal follow up of these kids, doing other microbiome sites and including other kinds of omics analysis.

380
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,620
And then of course, replicate and extend it in other cohorts as well.

381
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:55,030
And I'm also interested in expanding the different kinds of chemical exposures that I'm looking at,

382
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:01,060
especially other kinds of endocrine disrupting chemicals and looking at interactions with nutrition.

383
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:09,970
A lot of people who are highly exposed to environmental chemicals also don't have great nutrition, and so they're a highly vulnerable population.

384
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:19,059
And I'm also interested in expanding to other health outcomes, including respiratory health and immune health.

385
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:26,070
And this is sort of the way that that early biological mechanism has shifted a little bit in my research.

386
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:33,010
So now we're looking at these different kinds of chemical nutrient mixtures over time, the gut microbiome with lots of different health outcomes.

387
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:43,030
So I'm also interested in doing some reverse translational stuff, looking more at causal mechanisms, specific bacteria combinations and of course,

388
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:52,090
exposure trials that you can't do in humans and looking at more invasive outcomes, including like brain metabolomics and that kind of stuff.

389
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:58,450
So the takeaways from this are that human mental exposure is associated with altered gut

390
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:03,910
microbial diversity and composition and could potentially affect downstream health outcomes.

391
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:10,540
And I'm currently working on a lot more stuff with mixtures and timing of exposure and mechanisms.

392
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:17,710
So with that, I'd like to thank all my many collaborators who contributed to all of this work and of course, the funders who paid for it.

393
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:31,110
And with that, I will take any questions you have. You folks have questions?

394
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:39,659
Just great talk. Like super interesting research, like wondering how you conceptualize, like, interventions in this space.

395
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,219
So, you know, should you're like, are zero zero be successful, you'll identify potential links here?

396
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,400
Or do you have like ideas about how to move this forward from public, public perception?

397
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:56,200
Yeah, that's a great question. I think that a lot of the interventions would go specifically towards like probiotics

398
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,929
with specific different bugs or dietary interventions that like sort of probiotics,

399
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:06,250
but just general like dietary health interventions as well can go towards a lot of things.

400
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,260
We have a question. Yeah. Um, thanks for the talk.

401
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:27,309
I'm really curious. So the fetal microbiome we don't really think exists with the follow up study since that one study that showed something.

402
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:29,310
So I'm really interested in that.

403
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:38,709
The early second trimester findings that you found link to lead and how you think that could be an association that's occurring.

404
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,100
Or maybe it's just like a super superfluous association.

405
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,469
I'm not sure. Yeah. I mean, there's always potential that that's the case.

406
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:55,480
But I think that a lot of the sort of systems that are like the immune system, for example,

407
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:06,840
it could be that the LED is affecting immune development, which then sort of like primes, what will become the microbiome even at birth, right?

408
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,940
So you have this exposure during the prenatal period.

409
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,709
It shifts the way the immune system is, is going to work.

410
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:20,530
And then once you have your initial colonization and all of your sort of exposures after that,

411
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,550
it can continue to have an impact on the trajectory of the development.

412
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,200
Yeah. And I also wanted to really get back to Justin's question then.

413
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:33,700
So like for an intervention, how might that disrupt that potential?

414
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:39,549
Yeah, that's a great question. I'm not an interventionist. I'm interested in understanding like the mechanism.

415
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,090
But yeah, I mean, I'm sure lots of great minds will think about this one day.

416
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:51,819
I'm hoping. But I, you know, I think a lot of them are dietary are working with populations that because a lot of the focus

417
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:58,510
around LED exposure is really in kids but let it is there for everybody at every stage of the life.

418
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:07,180
So I think just sort of extending sort of lead reduction in exposure reduction sort of interventions all through the

419
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:14,559
life course would would help kind of hit especially with these pregnant women like increasing prenatal vitamin.

420
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,459
You sound like good nutrition and that stuff. I mean, a lot of that is already happening.

421
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,030
Right. But this is like additional support, though. It's really, really important.

422
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:26,549
Yeah. Kind of related to that.

423
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:34,080
Do you have data on the mother's microbiome? Like, even if it wasn't taken when they were initially sampled and mothers felt like sources

424
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,080
of exposure because now there's now we don't let is it even in our U.S. food.

425
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:46,830
So yeah. Yeah. So we don't have maternal gut microbiome samples, especially in this cohort, the progress cohort,

426
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:53,520
there is another cohort that I've been working with based out of Detroit actually called Wheels and they have a

427
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:01,709
lot more microbiome samples from moms and kids and a bunch more time points sort of serially up to that point.

428
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:05,190
And so I think that's a much better dataset to use to sort of look at that.

429
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:11,280
But at least for in the progress cohort, we do have all kinds of data on moms exposures.

430
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,870
We have all the like blood measurements and lots of questionnaires and stuff like that from the prenatal period all,

431
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:26,770
all the way through and mode of delivery. So.

432
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:38,440
Yes. Great call again so that you all your study you show that the larger and the entire antibiotic

433
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,810
resistance association and then when you look at the mixture and the blood relative,

434
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:50,860
it's gone very, you know, the attenuated and then the cadmium showed and then the period to show up.

435
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:59,830
So can you articulate a little bit more about why that happened and how that inform your next again,

436
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:09,490
this progress study and that when you designed this study, whether would you even consider like a page and the other manner interaction?

437
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:16,179
Yeah. So I, I don't have great answers for you about why I think that's happening.

438
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:24,850
I mean, there could be some, like underlying biological associations happen and chemical sorts of interactions at play there,

439
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:32,740
which I don't know that much about. But and it could also sort of be like a factor of the WQ s approach.

440
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:38,020
Sometimes when things are very highly correlated, it kind of just like picks one to go with.

441
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,350
And so it could be an artifact of that.

442
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:49,870
And for that early analysis of the NHANES data, it was before that sort of repeated hold out approach had really been developed.

443
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:58,060
So it's for that estimate. It's like one run of the W-2s with like a set random seed, right?

444
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,370
So if I was going to redo it now,

445
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:08,470
I would definitely do it a bunch more times and see if those ways remain the same over all of the different estimates.

446
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,240
Okay. That was one part of your question then.

447
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,520
I can't remember what the other part is, where that operation was, the how that information included design of yours.

448
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,929
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

449
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:32,020
So we so seeing that those different interactions came out differently definitely made me want to do the mixtures analysis in the progress cohort.

450
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:39,580
And so far like that preliminary analysis, we were just looking at that because it's such a tiny dataset, but that is like the goal.

451
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:46,900
That's what we're going to do next. And there so I'm using the in using the tooth data, it's a little bit limited.

452
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:52,000
If I want to just look at that period using two data, it's limited pretty much to the metals.

453
00:50:52,360 --> 00:51:01,750
But if I look at we have like maternal prenatal blood exposures and urine and we have those at birth and all the other time points.

454
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:09,760
So using those types of data, I could look at different classes of chemical exposures together and that's sort of the plan going forward.

455
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,220
It was just sort of too much to put in in that specific grant proposal, but that's the plan.

456
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:24,780
I just want to check my knowledge on something really quick. So bacteria do absorb metals.

457
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:30,840
Right. So when looking at antibiotic resistant bacteria compared to like a healthy microbiome,

458
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:38,009
are there certain bacteria that are absorbing the metals at a different not necessarily at a different rate,

459
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,410
but with the antibiotic resistant bacteria?

460
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:49,860
Are they contributing to the storage of those metals or are they are the bacteria that are better being kind of killed off?

461
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:56,460
Are those the ones that are holding onto the metals and then replacing the rest of the microbes?

462
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,360
That's a great question, and I think the answer is kind of all of that.

463
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:07,410
Yes, and it depends. Classic answer. So it depends on what the antibiotic resistance mechanism is.

464
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:13,379
If it's a key flux mechanism where the the chemicals go in and then get pumped out,

465
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:21,800
then those resistant bacteria would like increase the amount of sort of circulating chemical, whatever you're talking about.

466
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:28,710
Right. Whereas if it just went into a cell and died there, then that's a little bit constrained.

467
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:37,019
But there are other mechanisms like binding to sort of like extracellular molecules or binding with salts and that sort of thing.

468
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,190
That changes the sort of biological availability of those.

469
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,630
But it's not necessarily in the cell. It could be outside the cell as well.

470
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:53,130
So yeah, especially in these cross-sectional associations where we're measuring the light exposure downstream,

471
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:58,230
it could be like reverse causality where the gut microbiome is affecting how

472
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:02,840
much of those metals end up in the in the bloodstream and eventually the urine.

473
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:08,960
So, yeah, it's a lot to tease out. I saw a hand over here.

474
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:16,950
Yeah. Yeah. It's the breadth of things. So think about I mean, when you do this, all this association, you think about the mechanisms.

475
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,940
So what are your thoughts on the how do you investigate the mechanism for.

476
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,509
Well. Yeah. I mean, the mechanisms are tricky.

477
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:31,979
And because I'm really approaching this in an epidemiological framework, I'm really looking for the associations.

478
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:38,280
But once sort of when we're hypothesizing them and and once we find some,

479
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,999
a lot of what we do is like go back and see if there is some kind of biological plausibility in in that mechanism.

480
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,650
And then that's where I really want to expand my research and the mouse trials and the reverse translational stuff to really get at that mechanism.

481
00:53:52,980 --> 00:54:00,270
And it's also why I've been starting to add other kinds of omics analysis like the stool metabolomics to try and get out what are the in-between,

482
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:08,060
you know, metabolites between the gut microbiome and the human host that are affecting things.

483
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,700
How would you separate the gut microbiome metabolites from human metabolites?

484
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:24,360
Yeah. Not very easily. There are some there are some like databases that have more like known microbial metabolites.

485
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,400
Yeah, it's a it's a tricky thing.

486
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:38,400
And like some people who who are trying to identify bacterial metabolites, like compare stool samples to blood samples to try and get.

487
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:43,480
But even that is like you, you don't really know what the source says because they can both be animals.

488
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:50,710
Are there any other questions? Okay, another question.

489
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:59,410
So with the progress cohort, cohort, do you know with specifically that region like what nutrients they're deprived of or like what

490
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:03,880
their what they might be lacking that can also contribute to what you're expecting to see?

491
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,730
Yeah, that's a great question and I haven't really looked into it.

492
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:16,090
There's a whole team of researchers led by Alondra, but I can't remember her last name who's like really into the nutritional side of this.

493
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:22,209
And they've collected a ton of data and we're going to use it and the analysis is like covariates and stuff like that.

494
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:26,830
But I haven't really dug into what the nutritional situation is.

495
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:31,830
A lot of the I mean, most of the participants in the study are low scores.

496
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:37,450
And so it's it's likely that a lot of them are not getting all the nutrients they need.

497
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,660
I think we are just about at the end of our time, we should probably go ahead to conclude.

498
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,380
Thanks for all of the wonderful questions, the great and wonderful answer.

499
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:03,110
And how are you doing?
