00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,930
After watching this video,

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,370
you will be able to understand

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,930
more basic concepts
about survival analysis.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,104
As with any other
type of analysis,

5
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:21,555
the basic stages of survival
analysis are first,

6
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,640
doing bivariate analysis, and

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,475
then go into
multivariable analysis.

8
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:28,700
For bivariate analysis,

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,780
particularly when you have

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,655
exposures that are categorical,

11
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:33,890
the Kaplan-Meier curves help to

12
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,015
estimate the survivor
function by group.

13
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,420
But that's only a
visual representation.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,750
We want to know if the
differences that we see

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,750
visually are actually
statistically significant.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,050
Well for that, you can
use the log-rank test to

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,910
compare the survivor functions
of two or more blocks.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,860
Once you are done with
your bivariate analysis,

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,570
you can move into your
multivariable analysis.

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,505
That is, you want to adjust
for potential confounders.

21
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:02,775
You can use two
different approaches.

22
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:04,509
Either Cox Regression,

23
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,620
which is a
semi-parametric approach,

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,140
and we will explain
what that means later,

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,315
or the Weibull Regression.

26
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:13,615
In this course, we
will only describe

27
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,200
the Cox regression because it's

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,010
the most popular approach
in the literature.

29
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,155
The Cox proportional
hazards model

30
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,940
is a semi-parametric approach,

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,905
which means that it's not

32
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:27,775
totally parametric
or non-parametric,

33
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:30,560
because it assumes
a parametric form

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,125
for the effects of the
explanatory variables.

35
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,880
So you still get parameters

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,935
out of them model, that is betas.

37
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:39,870
But it allows an unspecified form

38
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,600
for the underlying
survivor function,

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,180
that's the non-parametric
part of the model.

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,855
That actually give us
a lot of flexibility.

41
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:51,140
But the most important part about

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,875
this model is to

43
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,250
know what we are estimating
with those betas.

44
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,490
We're estimating hazards
and hazard ratios,

45
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,560
which we have not had before as

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,475
a standard measure of
association in epidemiology.

47
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:05,375
But in a loose way,

48
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,655
can be interpreted as rates.

49
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:11,675
That is the hazard is the
rate at which events occur.

50
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:15,399
According Miguel A. Hernan,
for dichotomous exposures,

51
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:18,300
the hazard ratio is
defined as the hazard in

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,740
the exposed group divided by

53
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,660
the hazard in the
unexposed group.

54
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,759
For all practical purposes,

55
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,225
hazards can be thought
of as incidence rates.

56
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:29,360
Thus the hazard
ratio can be roughly

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,135
interpreted as the
incidence rate ratio.

58
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,150
This is a huge relief
because as epidemiologists

59
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,945
we can feel comfortable
with incidence rate ratios.

60
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:42,260
Now we take a peek
to the Cox model

61
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,695
above and compare it with
the logistic model below.

62
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:48,935
We can see now why they don't
belong to the same family.

63
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,215
They are definitely
pretty different.

64
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,345
Now we can see away
there Cox model is

65
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:56,965
the cat of the family and
not really one more human.

66
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,570
The main assumption of Cox models

67
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,430
is the proportionality
assumption.

68
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,560
Proportional hazards over time,

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,315
means that the hazard ratio
is constant over time.

70
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:09,245
If the assumption is violated,

71
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:12,530
you can enter time dependent
variables in the model.

72
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,690
We can actually
use these to check

73
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,530
the assumption. We
will see that later.

74
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,945
Bottom line. First,
we're modeling time.

75
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,420
Second, for bivariate analysis,

76
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,270
we will do Kaplan-Meier
curves and log-rank tests.

77
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,540
Third, for multivariate analysis,

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,260
we will do Cox proportional
hazard models.

79
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,400
Fourth, hazards are more
or less like rates.

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,530
Hazard ratios can be more or less

81
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,830
interpreted as
incidence rate ratios.

82
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,915
In summary, in this video,

83
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:45,950
we learned some basic concepts
about survival analysis.

84
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,600
In the next video, we will learn

85
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,315
how to run Kaplan-Meier curves.
