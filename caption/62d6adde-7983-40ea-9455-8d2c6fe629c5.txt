1
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:06,122
In this segment, I'm going to introduce
you to a model or framework for

2
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:10,460
categorizing some of the influence I
mentioned in the previous section.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,100
This model, the Ecological Model,
acknowledges that health and health

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:21,300
behaviors are determined by influences at
multiple levels or spheres of influence.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,033
This is an important model
in public health and

6
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:31,239
future lectures will also reference it.

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,141
At the center of the model is
the individual, and at this level

8
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:39,871
the intrapersonal level, we think
about factors that influence health or

9
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:46,130
health behaviors that occur or
can be assessed at the individual level.

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,050
At the intrapersonal level we think about
influences, like one's biological or

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,220
genetic makeup,
their physical ability or skills.

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,220
We also think about one's knowledge,
preferences, beliefs, or attitudes.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,156
Self efficacy, or one's self-assessed
belief that they can make a choice or

14
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:10,091
enact a change, is another factor that
may shape a specific health behavior at

15
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:16,187
the intrapersonal level.

16
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:19,384
The next level of the model,
the interpersonal,

17
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:25,380
we think about how social relationships
affect one's health behavior.

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,675
This is where we would categorize
influences like peer pressure, and

19
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:34,623
role modeling, as well as the social
support one might have from their friends,

20
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:40,406
family, roommates, or partner.

21
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:45,224
The next level of the model,
the institutional or organizational level,

22
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:50,428
conceptualizes how one's involvement
in social organizations like religious

23
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:56,870
groups or institutions like one's school
or workplace, shape health behavior.

24
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,121
This level includes both the social
norms or expectations that

25
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,850
exist in these settings as well as
how the physical space may enhance or

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:13,007
limit one's ability to
engage in healthy behaviors.

27
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:17,080
At the community level, we think
about broader, cross-cutting features

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,650
of a neighborhood, or community,
that may influence health behaviors.

29
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,929
This may encompass things
like community initiatives,

30
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:28,892
the physical characteristics of
a neighborhood or a community, and

31
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:36,772
the relationships between
organizations within a community.

32
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:40,347
At the outermost level we
look at how public policy or

33
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:44,220
societal influences
shape health behaviors.

34
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,640
This level encompasses
influences from popular culture,

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,360
advertising, the media,
and evolving social norms.

36
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,770
This level also encompasses factors
like zoning laws, as well as the laws

37
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:06,650
that regulate the sale or consumption
of goods like cigarettes or alcohol.

38
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,630
In a subsequent lecture on diet and

39
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,990
nutrition you'll use this model to examine
multilevel influences on how people eat.

40
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,730
The main thing I'd like you
to take away from this model

41
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,610
is that individuals are embedded
into larger social systems.

42
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,540
Certainly, why someone smokes may
be influenced by their individual

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,680
attitudes towards smoking or
a genetic predisposition to addiction.

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,860
But there are other influences at
the interpersonal, organizational,

45
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,305
community and social policy levels,
that shape the decision to smoke.

46
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:44,985
Fundamentally, health behaviors
are influenced by the ways individuals

47
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:52,400
interact with their physical,
social, and policy environment.
