00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:13,753
Hey everyone, this is the quick review video for the Lipid Synthesis Lecture.

2
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:16,197
So synthesis of fatty acids,

3
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:21,184
you can obtain fatty acids from two sources either dietary,

4
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:25,511
so you've eaten them or from the novo lipogenesis.

5
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:28,016
So you synthesize them from precursors,

6
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:31,605
the main sights of this are in the liver and adipose tissue.

7
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:36,655
Usually, excess fuel is stored as fat, and if you want to store anything as fat,

8
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:42,040
you need to have high energy levels and high glucose, which we'll talk about.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:49,340
So Key Regulatory Steps are ATP Citrate Lyase, ACC, and Fatty Acids Synthase.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,266
So ATP Citrate Lyase, so the acetyl CoA is made in the mitochondria.

11
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:59,679
Remember from the carbohydrates unit we said that pyruvate from

12
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,951
glycolysis needs to go into the mitochondria.

13
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:05,615
And that's where we can make acetyl CoA, and

14
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:08,090
then acetyl CoA can go into the TCA cycle.

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,840
So acetyl CoA is actually in the mitochondria.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,720
But to make fatty acids, we need acetyl CoA to be in the cytoplasm, over here.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,764
So what happens is that acetyl CoA becomes citrate, and

18
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:27,640
then citrate can go from the mitochondria into the cytosol.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,058
So we cannot transport acetyl CoA immediately from the mitochondria to

20
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:32,947
the cytosol.

21
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:36,977
It needs to kind of change its identity into citrate, and then

22
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:41,960
citrate can go outside the mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondria.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,418
And as soon as citrate is in the cytoplasm,

24
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:50,430
it will be modified by ATP Citrate Lyase, which is an enzyme.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,010
Everything with -ase is an enzyme, to make acetyl CoA and absolute as a date.

26
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,710
So acetyl CoA is now officially in the cytoplasm.

27
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,268
And the ATP Citrate Lyase is activated by insulin, and

28
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:11,640
by SREBP, and ChREBP over here, we'll talk more about those.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,588
So think about it as if insulin is how you just had a meal,

30
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:20,640
you want to store any excess fat, so this is why you want this to happen.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,772
So acetyl CoA to be in the site is also that you can initiate fatty acid

32
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:25,590
synthesis.

33
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,189
And if you have a SREBP will talk more about it, and

34
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,142
ChREBP is up regulated by high carbohydrate and take.

35
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:35,966
So it's somehow very similar to insulin,

36
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:40,640
like after a meal you would want to start storing facts.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,405
So saturate feedback, let's say citrate can have a feedback on PFK1.

38
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:50,150
If you remember from the previous lecture, but

39
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,666
it's also part of lipid synthesis pathway.

40
00:02:54,666 --> 00:03:00,390
So it can't work on fructose, if anything acetyl CoA carboxylase over here.

41
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,774
So keep in mind that acetyl coA carboxylase would be activated

42
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:10,651
by insulin and deactivated when you're low on energy.

43
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:16,540
So you have AMP or AMPK kinases is active or glucagon and epinephrine are active.

44
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,843
So in times of stress when you need energy you do not want to

45
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:24,439
be synthesizing triglycerides to store them.

46
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,260
If anything, you want to be breaking them down, which makes sense.

47
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,933
But then if you have high levels of insulin,

48
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:35,040
then you would want to up regulate fatty acid synthesis and starch.

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
So Malanyl CoA, which we talked a lot about in this unit.

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,238
So as soon as acetyl CoA is in the cytoplasm under the action of ACC,

51
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:46,501
it becomes Malonyl CoA.

52
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:50,737
The increased levels of Malonyl CoA can inhibit CPT1,

53
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:53,810
which is a very necessary transporter.

54
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,613
That allows only a long-chain fatty acid to go from the side of class back

55
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:03,340
into the mitochondria to undergo oxidation because oxidation can only

56
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,860
occur in the country.

57
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,511
So this makes sense because as soon as you put in some time and

58
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:15,371
energy to get acetyl CoA away from the mitochondria

59
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:22,640
into the cytoplasm, as for this picture over here.

60
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,687
So this is citrate going out, and then becoming acetyl CoA.

61
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:31,203
So you've spent some time doing that, so

62
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:36,240
it would be counterintuitive to keep CPT function active.

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,200
So it would be counterintuitive to keep CPT1 active, because that would

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,925
be re importing fatty acids from the cytoplasm back into the country.

65
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:50,805
So it's counterintuitive to have a flux outside the country,

66
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:55,051
and then into the country of basically the same thing.

67
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:59,088
So you either have oxidation or you have fatty acid synthesis,

68
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,540
not both of them together.

69
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,168
And then this Malonyl CoA under the action of fatty acid synthesis can become

70
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,481
the fatty acid, and so on.

71
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:11,740
And this is how eventually we can undergo fatty acid synthesis.

72
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,811
So the rest of fatty acids, so we talked about those first regulated steps ACC,

73
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:22,440
FAS, and ATP Citrate Lyase which was up here.

74
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,640
Oops, sorry over here, ATP Citrate Lyase, and

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,046
then everything kind of passively happens to start

76
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:36,540
creating the fatty acids, so the triglyceride.

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,962
So the reaction will need acetyl CoA which serve, so

78
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:45,584
you have the first acetyl CoA which is two carbons, and

79
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:49,930
then it serves as a primer for the whole fatty acid.

80
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,876
And then you just keep adding Malonyl CoA to it, so

81
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:55,061
we keep adding two carbons at a time.

82
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:58,165
And this requires a lot of NADPH that can come from

83
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:03,020
the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and other places, and requires a lot of ATP.

84
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,120
So the only situation where you can actually initiate fatty

85
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,958
acid synthesis is when you have high ATP and high glucose to be able to go

86
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:19,340
through the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and generate NADPH.

87
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,677
So the sources of NADPH is the Pentose Phosphate Pathway,

88
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:24,251
which is what we just said.

89
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,451
And also another sources the exile acetate, so

90
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:31,931
remember when we said saturate goes out from the mitochondria into

91
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:35,540
the cytoplasm under the action of ATP Citrate Lyase.

92
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,974
It will yield an acetyl CoA, it will also yield an exile as a state that can go

93
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:46,001
back and form an NADPH as well because it gets converted to fire of it.

94
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:52,640
And then it can generate NADPH for each acetyl CoA.

95
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,371
So transcription all control over here,

96
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:59,203
what I'd like you to focus on is that ACC, ACLY, and FAS.

97
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:04,484
They're all activated by SREBP1c, which by itself is regulated by insulin and

98
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:08,310
mTor which we'll talk more about in the protein lecture.

99
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,410
And ChREBP is up regulated by high carbohydrate.

100
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,987
So all of ACC, FAS synthase, the Elovl6, and

101
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:23,096
the D saturates are all up regulated when SREBP1c and ChREBP are active.

102
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:28,040
And those can be activated by insulin or high glucose intake.

103
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,421
Which makes sense because when you have high insulin or high ChREBP intake,

104
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:39,040
you would want to store any excess fat you have, so fatty acid synthesis is promoted.

105
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,031
So regulation over here, saturated fats and insulin would promote SREBP activity.

106
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:51,331
Whereas PUFA, so somehow healthier fats would inhibit SREBP activity.

107
00:07:51,331 --> 00:08:02,040
So they would inhibit making more fatty acids and storing lipids.

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,171
Let's get the exercise, so let's try esterification over here.

109
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:12,792
You have a glycerol keep in mind that glycerol kinases is available and

110
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,584
the liver.

111
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:18,883
So the liver can activate the glycerol backbone for fatty acids,

112
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:25,140
because every triglyceride has a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids.

113
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,971
But at the adipose site, so the fat cells do not have glycerol kinases.

114
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:35,107
So every single time a fat cell needs to make the glycerol backbone, it has to

115
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:41,740
obtain glycerol from like dialysis because it lacks the glycerol kinases.

116
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,649
So this is exactly what we just said, so

117
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,361
the liver can get like glycerol three phosphate.

118
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:55,291
And then through either glycolysis or by the action of glycerol kinases over here.

119
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,770
So it's immediately converts glycerol to the active form glycerol three phosphate.

120
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,920
But in the adipose site we do not have glycerol kinases.

121
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,996
So we always need to obtain the G3P from glycolysis.

122
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:17,270
So Lipodystrophy is when there's an impaired capacity to store fat.

123
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,795
So it can include some gene mutations, and LMNA, and LIPIN,

124
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:28,940
and AGPAT2, which are all necessary for synthesis of lipids.

125
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,202
So if the fat can be stored in adipose site which is naturally

126
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:35,257
where it usually is stored.

127
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:39,446
Then it will go into the liver, the muscle, or it will remain in the blood

128
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:43,087
vessels, causing a very elevated lipid profile in the blood,

129
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:46,640
which is definitely unhealthy as you can imagine.

130
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,511
So this can cause NAFLD, for example, so non-alcoholic fatty liver disease because

131
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:54,914
if the liver keeps accumulating fat as mentioned over here,

132
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,331
then eventually it will become cyanotic.

133
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:01,340
And that's what cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

134
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,021
So steatohepatits, this is the first step and then it becomes NASH,

135
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,450
which is when you have fat and inflammation.

136
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,404
Then you get scarring and eventually you have carcinoma if this progress is too

137
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,421
much and I believe those two are irreversible.

138
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:20,767
So even dietary changes and exercise over here

139
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:25,981
cannot alleviate the fact and the scarring.

140
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:30,606
So cholesterol synthesis, so over here we start with

141
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:35,658
acetly CoA you have HMG- CoA some phase to make HMG-CoA.

142
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:39,987
And then HMG-CoA over here under the activity of

143
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:45,040
HMG-CoA Reductase or HMGCR will become mevalonate.

144
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,420
And then mevalonate can become cholesterol.

145
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,168
So keep in mind if the HMG-CoA sem phase is up regulated,

146
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:54,600
then you're making more HMG-CoA.

147
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,470
If the HMG-CoA Reductase is up regulated, you're making more mevalonate.

148
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,447
Usually they follow each other those steps, so if HMG-CoA someplace is up

149
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:09,200
regulated, that would mean that three duct tape is also up regulated.

150
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,693
And all the steps to synthesize cholesterol from the mevalonate are up, so

151
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,850
you're making more cholesterol.

152
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,741
So how do statins work?

153
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:20,677
They look very similar to HMG-CoA,

154
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:25,620
which over here is the step trade for the HMG-CoA Reductase.

155
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,270
So the HMG-CoA Reductase will be tricked into believing that the statin is HMG-CoA.

156
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,181
But in fact it will not be able to work on a two mevalonate because it's a drug, and

157
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:41,040
it's not really a HMG-CoA it just resembles its structure.

158
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,666
So this is how statins can help lower endogenous synthesis of

159
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:49,640
cholesterol because all cells can produce cholesterol.

160
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,845
So we do have a negative feedback of HMG-CoA Reductase.

161
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:57,243
We still do not know exactly what is negatively

162
00:11:57,243 --> 00:12:01,550
influencing HMG-CoA Reductase activity.

163
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,665
But we know there's something along this pathway that sends a signal back to

164
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:08,130
HMG-CoA once cholesterol levels are high.

165
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,522
So this makes sense because when cholesterol levels

166
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:17,524
are high you would want to stop synthesizing cholesterol.

167
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:21,913
So the body is smart and it can detect when those levels are high, and

168
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,231
this is how this mechanism happen.

169
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:29,140
So you have negative feedback as soon as cholesterol levels are up.

170
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,599
If cholesterol levels are low than,

171
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:37,740
you would imagine that HMG-CoA Reductase is up regulated that's activity.

172
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,820
And dietary intake of cholesterol can suppress production only in the liver.

173
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,713
So a high cholesterol diet cannot suppress endogenous cholesterol production and

174
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:51,540
other cells but only in the liver.

175
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,482
So transcription regulation SREBP2 is responsible for

176
00:12:55,482 --> 00:13:00,746
the transcription regulation of cholesterol synthesis, so keep in mind.

177
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,258
SREBP1C for fatty acid synthesis, SREBP2 is for

178
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:08,351
cholesterol synthesis, and it's inhibited by sterols.

179
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:13,500
So once the body has sufficient cholesterol levels SREBP2 would

180
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,378
down regulate those enzymes that produce more cholesterol.

181
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:22,198
And it will also down regulate LDL receptor,

182
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:28,250
because LDL receptors serve to engulf and LDL particle from the blood.

183
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,789
And then LDL particle has high cholesterol, so

184
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:37,639
basically with SREBP2 is trying to do is to raise cholesterol levels in cell.

185
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,275
So as soon as it detects low cholesterol levels it will increase

186
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:47,181
endogenous synthesis through HMG-CoA Reductase and symptoms.

187
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:51,256
So those two enzymes and it will also increase update of

188
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:54,631
cholesterol into the cell by engulfing LDL.

189
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:59,438
Which is a molecule that's very high in cholesterol through the LDL

190
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,133
receptor conversely.

191
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:07,129
[COUGH] Sorry, if SREBP2 detects that there is sufficient levels of cholesterol

192
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:15,240
and cell then it will down regulate those enzymes and their sector activity.

193
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,389
So ketogenesis is producing ketone bodies when you have acetyl-CoA.

194
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:24,491
But you do not have a gazelle acetate and those are the products.

195
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:31,201
So ketone bodies it's the first step over here is similar to cholesterol synthesis,

196
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:36,901
and they're transported to other tissues that can use them for energy.

197
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:42,936
Because as well mention the metabolism lecture, the liver can make ketone bodies,

198
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:46,941
but can't use them because it lacks the oxyT1 enzyme.

199
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:51,381
So it can't once it forms the ketone bbodies,it can't utilize them.

200
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:55,830
Can only send them to peripheral tissues that have the oxyT1 enzyme, and

201
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,640
can utilize ketone bodies.

202
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,866
So ketogenesis occurs mainly in the liver.

203
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,177
They do not stay in the liver because the liver can't use them.

204
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:08,441
And eventually they get oxidized and other cells like the brain, the heart,

205
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,770
the muscle, and so on.

206
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,861
Because all other cells have the oxyT1 enzymatic activity.

207
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:18,617
So they can efficiently convert ketone bodies to acetyl CoA, and

208
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,140
then yield energy from as it broke away.

209
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,726
So diabetic ketoacidosis over here it's where you have a build up of

210
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:27,870
ketone bodies.

211
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,399
So if someone is diabetic and they're undergoing a lot of leukemia gynesisi,

212
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,431
then they will deplete their exile acetate levels.

213
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:39,750
And this is how they will be forming a lot of ketone bodies.

214
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,120
So and type one diabetes beta cells can't make insulin and

215
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,848
someone who's type two diabetics there beta cells are damaged

216
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:53,592
due to prolonged abuse of the pancreas and the insulin system.

217
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:57,610
Usually, after overfeeding for a prolonged period of time.

218
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,385
So over here those people would be unable to stop like policies, so

219
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:05,645
they will always have excessive acetyl CoA.

220
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:09,638
And that acetyl CoA can't go through the cycle because it's elastic has been

221
00:16:09,638 --> 00:16:10,440
depleted.

222
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,497
So they will always be making ketone bodies, remember from the car Black

223
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:17,954
church ketone bodies are produced if you have acetyl CoA, but

224
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:19,701
you do not have exile acetate.

225
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:24,240
So no exile acetate you cannot go through the TCA Cycle.

226
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,510
And it's accompanied by hyperglycemia.

227
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,450
Because someone who's diabetic their liver things that they are starving when

228
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,040
in fact their cells are just resistant to insulin or there's no insulin.

229
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,280
So it keeps undergoing Laconia genesis in an attempt to raise blood glucose.

230
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,356
So this is why someone who's diabetic will always have

231
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:49,621
hyperglycemia if it's uncontrolled in ketoacidosis.

232
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:54,251
In this scenario by which life policy is not being suppressed

233
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:58,081
because you don't have insulin ketogenic diet.

234
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:02,964
We've talked about someone who's on a ketogenic diet is usually normal life

235
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:05,301
Simic because they never eat carbs.

236
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:09,579
So it's unlikely that someone who's on a ketogenic diet would be hyperglycemia.

237
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,910
So that makes sense in their ketone bodies

238
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,557
are within normal values so far as it seems.

239
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:25,293
The diabetic ketoacidosis over here would be if you have more ketone bodies than 15

240
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:26,240
million malls.

241
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,505
Whereas someone who's on a ketogenic diet usually has very minimal level,

242
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,310
so less than 3 mM.

243
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:37,660
And this is why someone who's on a ketogenic diet and is used to being,

244
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,840
on ketogenic diet does not suffer from diabetic ketoacidosis.

245
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,785
And that was it.
