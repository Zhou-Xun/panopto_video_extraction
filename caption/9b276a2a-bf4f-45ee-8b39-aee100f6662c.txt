1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,260
Now that we've covered
both the basics

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,745
of microeconomics theory

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,530
and various ways in which markets

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,570
may fail to yield
optimal outcomes,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,190
we'll begin to consider how

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,870
these types of market
failures occur,

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,255
specifically in a
healthcare setting.

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,180
Understanding the root
causes and consequences of

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,090
these characteristic
market failures will allow

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,830
us to analyze the case for

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,480
various interventions to approve

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,135
upon sub-optimal market outcomes.

13
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,340
While those interventions
often involve

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,255
government policy and regulation,

15
00:00:37,255 --> 00:00:38,840
interventions can also arise

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,470
from private
non-governmental actions.

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,730
We'll also analyze how and why

18
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,250
these interventions may
yield imperfect solutions to

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,720
the problems created
by market failures and

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,320
cause unintended
consequences of their own.
