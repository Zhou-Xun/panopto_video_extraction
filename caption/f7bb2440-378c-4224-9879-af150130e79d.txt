1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,730
All right. It's 230. Let's get rolling.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,760
So today we're going to start out by doing a quick review of screaming, talking about positive predictive value,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,310
negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity where we're deriving those numbers from.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,880
How do people feel about two by two tables? Nothing.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:26,640
Nothing. Nothing. Okay. How do like. Okay. That's right. And I will say that the trick to ask yourself is who is in the denominator.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:33,900
This is help me navigate to my truth in the past so we can overlap, especially when we go over to the quiz.

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,360
So to begin with, doing this is the gold standard instead of versus our testing, our screening, testing,

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:50,760
and you'll often see it set up this way, just so you know, the rows that the heap of screening tests in the codes are both standard.

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,270
And so then among the gold standard are truly the individual individuals who have the thing that we're looking for.

10
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:06,450
We have two positives all earn a positive result on their screening test and the false negatives.

11
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,470
So these are people who really have the disease, but their screening test comes back negative,

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,960
both negative and similarly, we for our disease, that is, we have no disease.

13
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,660
So these are people who truly do not have the disease, but for some reason they're putting test comes back positive.

14
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,630
And these are individuals who truly don't have the disease and their screening test comes back negative.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:41,160
So in some sense, we can think about this two by two people dividing our population into two different ways.

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,810
Just looking at the columns, we are splitting people into the disease risk reduced.

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:55,229
And if we're just looking at the rows, we're putting people into positive screening versus negative screening.

18
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,510
And then so what exists in here is this sort of joint relationship.

19
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:12,320
Does that helps? And so sensitivity then is the ability to that your test to accurately identify who has the disease.

20
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,270
So the proportion of truly deceased individuals who are identified as such.

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,750
And the way we go about calculating this is we take our true positives.

22
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:33,080
So there are people who truly have our disease. And we want to know in our denominator of the truly disease individuals,

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,260
how many of them or how many that who tested positive had the screening in our disease population.

24
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,300
And so we want to look at the marginal total we want to look at.

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,440
There's some right here. So essentially we're taking the proportion of folks who we know have the disease and who tested

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:00,060
positive for our screening and ask what proportion of those constitute the folks in the disease column,

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,530
if that makes sense. Even worse. Okay. Okay.

28
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,190
And so there's our formula right there. So we're looking at and so we'll do this in the exercise today.

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,400
You'll have a total down here. You the total will be the sum of these two guys.

30
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:26,870
And that's exactly what that is here. Likewise, specificity tells us of the folks who truly do not have the disease.

31
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:35,720
How many of those have we identified as such? And so in a lot of ways, the complement of over here and it just so happens that y you know,

32
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,919
the way we lay out two by two tables, you get sort of a diagonal thing going on.

33
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,440
But these are folks who truly don't have the disease and who tested negative.

34
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:54,580
So the folks who test negative via our screening who of like what percentage of other.

35
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:02,510
Let me put it this way. Of those who with no disease, what proportion of them tested negative by the screening test?

36
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:09,470
So then the denominator in this example is those people who really don't have disease.

37
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,150
And the denominator in this example are those who truly do have the disease by our gold standard.

38
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,420
Okay. Next, we have positive and negative predictive values.

39
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,050
These we are going to be looking across the columns.

40
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,600
We're going to be looking at the rows. And so we'll be interested in what the sum over here is.

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,440
But that's not listed.

42
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:50,420
And so positive predictive value asks of those who have really had the disease by the gold standard, how many of them tested positive?

43
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,710
Or rather of those who are positive face screening?

44
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:05,570
What proportion truly have the disease? So our denominator for positive predictive value is all of those who tested positive by screening.

45
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,700
And then we're finding what proportion of those truly have the disease.

46
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,660
And the negative predictive value is sort of the complement of that that we've seen already.

47
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:27,110
So it's asking among those people who tested negative by way of our screening test, how many of them are really, truly negative?

48
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:37,040
QUESTION So far. Okay. Um, and so this is a summary slide.

49
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:45,470
I believe you should have it also in the notes that are provided, you are going to look at this.

50
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,750
All right. All righty.

51
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,639
So it was three. So maybe it would be actually.

52
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,680
Let me guess what? Sure.

53
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,820
On the exam like A over A-plus. B, like that's what a formula is going to be giving us.

54
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:19,270
Okay. Okay. So we said, okay, let's go ahead and just draw a two by two table, because I think that will be more helpful than not.

55
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:59,059
And for fun things, I'm going to call this one and then there's a big and I actually got it is confusing if

56
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,050
I reduce this to a single variable or do you would you prefer to see that it must be.

57
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:23,610
We? And this James Bond represents.

58
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:32,340
This is where we spent the whole population. So we know from the instructions they gave us, where would we put 500 on this table?

59
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,250
And exactly. So we're starting off with the population size of the 500.

60
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:55,020
Okay. And then it asks. 319 students reported no influenza symptoms on the survey and tested negative for influenza via a PCR.

61
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:02,740
I know I already have the answer here, but in what self would we put these people to the.

62
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,470
Okay. We are given a proportion.

63
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:18,650
So it should be a this is a great way to look at look for clues if we're looking for a proportion or taking some folks out of a bigger population.

64
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,510
And so it says 92% of students with PCR defined influenza reported influenza symptoms on the survey.

65
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:36,410
Who is in our denominator? Is that all it was really was the disease.

66
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,350
That's really that is it for folks who tested positive for screening or those who didn't.

67
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:58,690
Yep. So the folks that we're looking at right now are in this cold and then the 92% is like whatever

68
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:10,680
that poll is that we're asking of all of the folks that were with PCR to find influenza.

69
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,630
So that's our gold standard 92 reported and the symptoms on the survey.

70
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,330
Do you guys kind of see how we can pick out the denominator in this group?

71
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,580
You don't know. Okay. Well, okay.

72
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,370
Well, we'll keep on going and think back to this.

73
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,780
All right. I guess I'm among.

74
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,880
Who are we talking about?

75
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,880
What population of folks are we talking about? Everyone to hurt anyone who was caught in the symptoms.

76
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,770
Everyone with the P0 defined into the test. Yeah.

77
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,620
So this is that we're looking at those folks. We're just saying among those people.

78
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,670
Look, we'll continue to look into it. All right. It takes practice.

79
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:06,730
Well, Dori. Okay. And then of the 397 students that reported no influenza symptoms on the survey.

80
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:13,930
So we're talking about the folks who took the survey and reported no influenza symptoms.

81
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,280
So are we talking who's our denominator? What group are we talking about across through?

82
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,090
98% percent of them did not have PCR defined influenza.

83
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:41,740
So we're saying we're sick of this group over here as the folks who took our screening tests of this, many over this, many did not have.

84
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:52,280
Do you regret this? I think I confuse with specificity and I think it is pretty fair.

85
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,140
Yeah, it's the specificity. Actually, I think that might be the next question.

86
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:06,100
Uh, I guess not. Okay. Sure. So, specificity and negative, uh, predictive value.

87
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,870
Almost ask the same question. The subtlety is which denominator am using.

88
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:24,280
Am I asking among those folks who truly do not have the disease, which we know by the gold standard, who we know do not have the disease?

89
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:33,880
Did they did the screening test? Their symptoms that we were screening for indicate that they tested positive or negative?

90
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:47,110
And so sensitivity is a it is. We're looking at those folks who, by the gold standard we know do not have the disease or specificity excuse me.

91
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:55,000
And then we're dividing that by our true negatives and negative predictive value.

92
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:04,390
Is looking at this a different way. It is saying, of those people who both tested negative on the gold standard and tested negative by a screening.

93
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,490
So that's these guys. What proportion are they?

94
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,780
Of all of the people who tested negative by the screening.

95
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:24,880
Oh, okay. So in these questions, they come up with 397 students that reported no symptoms.

96
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:33,260
So. People didn't.

97
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,120
90% of them did not. Yeah, in that case. Yeah, it's easy to understand.

98
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,210
So I did help with it when I did call him.

99
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,760
Yep. And I want to just be clear. That is a really easy mistake to make.

100
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:56,860
And so, um, I was like, getting used to working two by two tables, taking a deep breath and then being like, okay, who's in the denominator?

101
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:02,110
Like, going stepwise through like, what? What am I being told is really helpful so that.

102
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,380
Yeah. And because it's easy to get backwards.

103
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:17,060
Okay. 20 students responded influenza symptoms on the survey but did not have a PCR to find an influenza.

104
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:30,850
Where would we? So we have folks who, according to our our screening instrument reported like, oh,

105
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:40,240
growth fever, body aches, respiratory conduction infections, excuse me, congestion.

106
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,630
But when we tested it with our gold standard, they did not have influence that they had something else.

107
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:55,180
What group are we talking about here? He. Oh.

108
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,890
Okay. All right, cool. And then this.

109
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:06,970
One of the 500 students who's in our denominator and.

110
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,730
It's not a trick question. Yeah, exactly.

111
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:18,450
But over our entire city, population of over 500 students, 18% have PCR defined influenza.

112
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,729
I'm so sorry. You guys just I mean, it's not going to happen.

113
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,220
That's going to happen. Yeah.

114
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,360
So that's the prevalence of disease.

115
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:41,940
And so when we find prevalence, we are acting out of all of the people that we have in our study, how many have X characteristic?

116
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,479
So we would be taking these guys.

117
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:57,630
So we would be taking A-plus and over our large and so whatever that it winds up working out to.

118
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,510
I know that was a lot. I want to make sure we have time to go through the exercise.

119
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,920
I have office hours. Please feel free to come to them if they don't work for you.

120
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,670
Please feel free to email me and we can set up another time to look through this.

121
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,320
I do want to kind of make sure that we stay on somewhat of a schedule, but yeah, we'll keep going.

122
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,590
Okay. So we're looking at a chemical.

123
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,360
500 people will be screened. So that is our total population for diseases defined as high toxin levels in the blood.

124
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:41,730
And a positive screening test is a certain value and that is fairly normal for certain types of screening instruments like.

125
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:48,090
Yeah. So I mean, the answers are here, but we can walk through it anyway.

126
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,390
So. So this is what we know. So we know 500 folks were screened, so that would go right here.

127
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:02,730
And then we know that of the screening tests, 50 were positives.

128
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:10,799
So among let's just do the rows first among those who were screened and found to be positive per the screening.

129
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Pertierra 50 of them also so screened to have the disease per the standard.

130
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:25,530
And 50 of them did not test positive by the standard.

131
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,629
And so, yes, and so our marginal total is any sort of number you see along the edge.

132
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:39,600
I think this will repeat it is often referred to the margins or the marginal total as wanting to get

133
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,360
come through with that term because it's used often all it means is the total sum of a column a row.

134
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:54,420
And then we said 400 have low levels of the toxin in their urine.

135
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:02,370
So if it's those and the true negatives of 380, any questions?

136
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:11,319
Right. And so we asked him, what is the sensitivity of the urine test?

137
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,560
And I know that the answers are here, but let's sort of walk through it together.

138
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,890
If I'm looking at sensitivity or who is my denominator, who here would be?

139
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:31,850
Empathy. It be those who buy the gold standard tested positive for the disease.

140
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,900
And then I'm Bearden op ed and then our numerator would be these folks.

141
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:52,580
Specificity. Same thing here. We're asking of those who tested negative for the disease through our gold standard for the blood test.

142
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,810
So that would be the sum of these two. Who is truly negative, then?

143
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,080
It's that. So that's how you get that population. Right.

144
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:17,180
Yeah. So in public health practice, developing a highly sensitive screening test that comes at the expense of specificity for a given population will

145
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,810
result in the following an increase in the number of false positives and the increase in the number of true positives.

146
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:29,420
Right. Question Can you just explain away.

147
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:40,070
Sure. See? If we are lowering specificity.

148
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:48,970
So specificity is defined as be over 80% if we are lowering that proportionately.

149
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,810
So for lowering this number, let's say where people have to be categorized tomorrow.

150
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:06,080
And so we're assuming that they're being categorized in either one of these so or whether it'd be a category to sell.

151
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:12,290
And so. Yeah.

152
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,080
That's again. And so we were.

153
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,890
Yeah. So these would be these benefits. So we're showing some sort of misclassification.

154
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:36,260
We're saying both those who were originally in this column got misclassified.

155
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,600
And so now we're moving them over to the East Coast.

156
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:49,790
And in doing so we're changing the nominator, but we're also treating these values, appreciating we're using age to date.

157
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:56,810
And so this values the proportion of change and the triggering, and so the proportion is going to change.

158
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:03,530
So essentially moving, tripling some people to different columns.

159
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:14,160
But that's not. All right.

160
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:22,030
Uh, so a test that is reliable will also necessarily need to be precise.

161
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,520
And when a serious disease can be treated early is important to have a test with high sensitivity.

162
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:39,610
Yes. Can you explain why? Why is it important that some diseases require high specificity or high sensitivity tests and others don't?

163
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,020
If it's a serious disease, you want to catch it as early as possible.

164
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,640
And that's what sensitivity is. Exactly. Exactly. All right.

165
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,950
You know, it's posted on canvas as a whole.

166
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,610
It's due 30 minutes after class. Feel free to work in groups.

167
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:13,690
And what time is it? My hope is that we can sort of regroup a little bit after three and discuss.

168
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:26,770
That's okay. Okay. This cement going to be the same as last time like I updated it, so it shouldn't be as problematic.

169
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,670
You should be able to submit it like normal. So, you know.

170
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,840
Thank you. If you have issues doctoring a video test scores of.
