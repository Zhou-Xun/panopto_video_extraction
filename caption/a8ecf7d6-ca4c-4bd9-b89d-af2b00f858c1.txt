1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,100
There will be two recordings today because I have my stuff. Okay, so selective loss to follow up.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,770
So lost to follow up due to death, nonparticipation or migration can produce selection bias, right?

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,480
So we not only worry about who we wrote into the study, but then we want to, of course, try to keep our population the same as much as possible.

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:27,910
Disease risk can be associated with loss to follow up and the exposed and or the unexposed subjects.

5
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,360
One important thing to note is lost. To follow up does not always produce bias.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:47,410
Right. It needs to be related to both the you know, the exposure and the outcome of interest for your, you know, your measures.

7
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,549
Although if you're just trying to do something like estimate incidence,

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:58,030
which is often that in cohort studies to if you're losing people not related to exposure status but based on disease risk,

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,399
that can also of course impact incidence. So bias from loss.

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,960
To follow up, we have a cohort study of coronary heart disease for whites and blacks.

11
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:15,190
In a fixed cohort of a thousand men in the 1960s, 10% of all whites and 30% of all blacks for longer.

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,670
Follow up will bias a current estimating the race effect.

13
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:35,790
What do you think? Not necessarily right, because here we're just saying it's related to exposure.

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,310
We haven't told you about the outcome. So here we have. Here's our base population.

15
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,300
Um, laser pointer here.

16
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:57,780
Right. And relative risk and risk difference measures 4.0 for relative risk of 0.075 for our risk difference in the first study.

17
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,920
Right. We are losing 10% of all whites and 30% of all blacks.

18
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,780
But it is not related to disease status.

19
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:16,499
Right. It's just related to race. And so just because we have loss from follow up doesn't mean that we end up with different results.

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,530
Right. Our relative risk is going to be the same.

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,220
Our risk ratio right in our risk difference is going to be the same.

22
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,150
What will happen here, though, compared to the base population, compared to having everybody?

23
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,410
What's going to happen? We're going to end up with white or confidence intervals, right?

24
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,110
So we will definitely have that it impact. Right. But we're not impacting the effect estimate.

25
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:58,530
However, in study two, right, we have the situation where if you're white, you're more likely to be lost to follow up if your disease right.

26
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,680
Than among men among the the black population.

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,030
Right. So you're 51 instead of 60 compared to ten. Ten still there.

28
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,480
Right. So here we biased. Both are our risk ratio, right?

29
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,559
Which is our air here and our risk difference.

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,770
Both of them are biased because the loss of follow up is related to both the exposure and our outcome of interest.

31
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:38,130
So great news. If you actually happen to know the bias, you can estimate the effect on your measure,

32
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:48,390
be it a a relative risk, or here it's a CAIR rate or a risk difference.

33
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,010
So this right here is going to be our bias term.

34
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:01,920
So we've got our our relative risk times, the bias term, and then we've got the the estimated term.

35
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:12,420
So a over a right here is the selection probability for exposed cases, right?

36
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,239
B over B which would be little.

37
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:23,180
B over here are expected data, what we selected, what we get, and then the true data is the selection probability for non cases.

38
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,170
So what do you think C over C is going to be the selection probability of whom?

39
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,470
The C or C selection probability of what group?

40
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:53,400
Unexposed cases. Right. So the the expected relative risk here is going to be the ratio of the to true relative

41
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,690
risk or is going to be equal to the the true relative risk and some bias factor.

42
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,430
Right. Which is is basically the ratio of these selection probabilities over the the ratio of the total populations.

43
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,080
And you can do some same thing for a difference.

44
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,770
One thing you'll notice right away is we've got two different bias terms here.

45
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,670
So we don't have a single bias factor when we're calculating the impact on the risk difference.

46
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,320
I'm just using this notation below. We've got the risk and the exposed the risk in the unexposed right.

47
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:53,980
We've got this selection probability of the exposed cases over the self-selection probability of the the total exposed population,

48
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:04,810
minus the risk in the unexposed individuals.

49
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:15,250
And then we've got the selection probability of the unexposed cases divided by the selection probability in the total unexposed population.

50
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:31,080
Okay. So selective loss to follow up and bias in the of the risk ratio and the risk difference in study one going back here.

51
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,709
Right. Neither are biased. Right.

52
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,850
But in study two, what do we see that they're both biased in this case.

53
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:46,020
Right? However, the good or bad news, depending on your viewpoint, is that they actually don't have to be affected in the same way.

54
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,230
Um, so, and they, and they in fact may not be affected in the same way.

55
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:59,400
Uh, so here we have an example of that. We've got study three and study for right, same patient population as before.

56
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:08,400
We have now manipulated it in such a way that the, the CAIR is unbiased and study three.

57
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,840
But the rate, the risk and difference is biased here.

58
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,700
Right. And of course, you can get the opposite occurring here in study for the CAIR is is biased.

59
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,720
Right. But the risk difference is unbiased.

60
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:34,050
So it's important to remember that the bias, the loss to follow up may not affect the two measures in the same way.

61
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:41,400
All right. So selective survival or wait first, are there any questions about that?

62
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,600
I believe in the assignments you get to actually calculate out and like go through those formulas.

63
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:59,950
I highly recommend doing the assignments. I will say that I think the assignments or the exercises for this class are slightly harder than the exams.

64
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,179
That is on purpose because you get lots. You get to look at the materials.

65
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:13,420
You can go talk to the GSI. It really aids in understanding the material, the in class activities and the quizzes,

66
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,010
particularly the quizzes tend to be easier than the material on the exams.

67
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,050
It's not meant to really fully test your understanding the material it's meant.

68
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:30,490
The quizzes in particular are meant to make sure that you're kind of keeping up with the course, not that you've necessarily completely perfected.

69
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,759
So I'd say like 80% of the quizzes on average tend to be a little bit easier than or a

70
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,030
little bit maybe lower level than what we're expecting you to fully get out of the class.

71
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,090
So just to kind of put that out there, please do make sure you're doing this exercises or assignments, particularly if you're struggling in the class.

72
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,410
But I would say for everybody, it's probably really valuable experience.

73
00:08:53,830 --> 00:09:00,879
Okay. So selective survival or migrations like selection bias occurs before the study because

74
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,350
of a disproportionate loss of potential subjects before they would be selected.

75
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,690
Right. The bias will occur in the relative risk score.

76
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:20,200
The odds ratio at the exposure status is associated with the loss of otherwise eligible subjects to a different extent for cases of nine cases.

77
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,499
Right. What's again, what we're seeing is that different loss or the difference in eligibility to

78
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,260
enroll into the study is related to both disease and exposure status here.

79
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:41,200
So could we think about healthy worker effect like a special case for survival and selective migration?

80
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,510
Yeah, I would think of it as selective migration because normally those people are just moving out of that occupation.

81
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,179
So, you know, you could think of it as surviving in the occupation too, I guess.

82
00:09:52,180 --> 00:10:01,720
But but yes, prevalence incidence bias is a selective survival issue.

83
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,899
Bias resulting from the inclusion of prevalent cases in a study intended to make inferences in a relationship

84
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,200
to disease risk the prevalence rate ratio in a cross-sectional study as an estimate of a risk ratio.

85
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,379
So an example of this is current smoking and emphysema. Smoking increases the risk of emphysema.

86
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:28,900
We know that in addition, survival and thus the duration of disease in emphysema patients is affected by whether or not patients continue to smoke.

87
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,500
That is, survival is shorter in those who continue to smoke.

88
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:43,000
As a result, prevalence rate ratios and cross-sectional studies tend to underestimate the risk ratio for smoking and emphysema.

89
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,510
Right, because they're measuring it at the time that somebody is already got chemo and people who continued smoking.

90
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:58,150
Right. Are more likely not right. All right. Temporal ambiguity and reverse causation.

91
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,580
So temporal ambiguity is a failure to establish that the exposure occurred before the disease.

92
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,569
It's particularly problematic in cross-sectional studies, right,

93
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:13,780
because we're measuring them both at the same time, and particularly those involving disease prevalence.

94
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:24,549
It's most likely to produce bias in cross-sectional studies of the disease, directly or indirectly affects the exposure status and the observed.

95
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:30,220
In that case, the Observed Exposure Disease Association may reflect the effect of disease on exposure

96
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,470
rather than or in addition to the hypothesized effect of exposure on the disease.

97
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:44,620
So of course we have an example of that. So we have a prevalence study could be cross-sectional or a case control study to

98
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:50,020
assess the possible effect of anxiety level on the first occurrence of heart attack.

99
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,290
Anxiety level here is being measured after somebody has a heart attack.

100
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,950
So then the question is, well,

101
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,040
does your anxiety level cause your heart attack or does causing having a heart attack cause your anxiety level to increase?

102
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,920
Right. Because we're measuring it after the heart attack, even if you know the exact timing of the heart attack,

103
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,290
anxiety cannot be measured retrospectively, or at least not accurately.

104
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,800
Right. So that's an issue.

105
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:27,850
Okay. We can also have this issue with temporal ability and reverse causation in longitudinal studies.

106
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,690
So here we have a longitudinal study of fourth graders in New York City,

107
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,340
and we see an inverse association between the change in physical fitness level

108
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,570
and the change in systolic blood pressure during the same five year period.

109
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,900
However, the problem here is the way the measurements were taken because they were taken at the same time.

110
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,429
Right. And only once the beginning of the end from the design,

111
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,460
it's not possible to determine that the change in fitness level preceded the change in systolic blood pressure.

112
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:07,580
Well, it's a temporal ambiguity due to how the data were analyzed. It can happen because of how the data was analyzed or how the data were collected.

113
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,780
Right. Mostly, I guess here, how they were analyzed.

114
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,390
Okay. So selection bias and case control studies,

115
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,990
selection bias can result from disproportionate use of health care services or procedures that are used

116
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:31,790
to identify the study population for a case control study when all selected subjects are hospitalized.

117
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,700
This is called Bergson's bias. Right. We already have an example of Bergson's bias earlier.

118
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:51,360
So anybody remember a study where everybody was hospitalized? Smoking lung cancer the dollar bill steady whenever that one one thing of note is

119
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,930
this is not the only type of selection bias that's present in case control studies.

120
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:03,149
There just isn't a specific name that we are using for this for this particular type of bias.

121
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,410
So it's just a selection bias that occur. There is a name when everybody's hospitalized.

122
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:17,129
So here's an example, right? A case control study to estimate possible effect of alcohol intake measured as blood

123
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:22,620
alcohol concentration or back on injury severity among victims of head injury.

124
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:33,000
So if you suppose that all severely injured victims are tested, but mild injuries are more likely to be tested if they've been drinking.

125
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,660
So how would that happen? Right. Somebody goes in with a mild head injury into the E.R. and the physicians like I think I smell alcohol.

126
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,770
Right. You know, and so therefore they get a test, right?

127
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:52,620
Or the nurse or whoever is, you know, like somebody along the way providing them with care, ordering tests.

128
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,309
So here we have a example of this, right?

129
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:12,180
So we've got our base population. There's no relationship in this supposed base population between drinking alcohol and head injuries.

130
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,190
Severity. Right. But now.

131
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,850
Right. Everybody that.

132
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,400
Has a severe head injury gets tested. Right. So we still end up with the same 5050.

133
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,299
But among the mild individuals, only a subset of them get tested.

134
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,230
And they're all they're more likely to be tested if they've been drinking.

135
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,080
And somebody around them either tells that they've been drinking or, you know, they smell like alcohol.

136
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,390
Right. And they can tell. And so then here we see a odds ratio of 0.43.

137
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,680
So we'd say this is negatively biased because of selective testing for blood alcohol concentration.

138
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,230
All right. So Bergson's bias is selection bias and case control studies of hospitalized patients.

139
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,809
Hospitalized patients are more likely to have the exposure because probability of being hospitalized

140
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:17,110
in the base population depends on which disease they have and also on their exposure status.

141
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,700
This is when the exposure is related to disease and the exposure is related or

142
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,560
leads to an increased probability of hospitalization given people are disease.

143
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:40,320
So an example of this for when the exposure was related to the disease was the smoking in the Dolin Hill controlled study.

144
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,130
Right.

145
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:51,060
Remember a lot of their controls or diseases that were actually related to smoking exposure at the time that those diseases were related to smoking.

146
00:16:52,350 --> 00:17:00,270
And remember, we saw that really high level of smoking of the exposure in the hospitalized controls in that study.

147
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,340
And I propose that perhaps it was a smoking only hospital as a joke.

148
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:13,620
I do have that. All right. An example of exposure related to an increased probability of hospitalization given disease.

149
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:19,259
One. One example is obesity. Diabetes might be another possibility.

150
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:26,160
Right. So if you got the disease and you have these other risk factors, then you're more likely to be hospitalized.

151
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,860
Okay, so that's bergson's bias detection.

152
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,490
Bias results from certain cases being more likely to present for care or be detected in routine medical surveillance.

153
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,700
That's what you were referring to earlier, right?

154
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:50,430
Exposure in cases affects probability of seeking care, or they're more likely to be given a complete or intensive medical attention,

155
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,690
resulting in an increased likelihood of disease detection, which might otherwise remain undetected in the absence of exposure.

156
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,480
So this is going to happen a lot for diseases that are in more kind of preclinical stages.

157
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:10,050
Right, as well as for diseases that have a more mild presentation, particularly at the beginning,

158
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,270
it will lead to a artificially high prevalence of the exposure in cases.

159
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,270
So this is one of those examples.

160
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:26,250
Detection bias in a cohort study or a randomized controlled trial is going to lead to differential disease misclassification.

161
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,380
And that is an information bias, not a selection bias, right.

162
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:41,940
So because it doesn't determine who's in your study, it's having an effect on the probability of them being correctly classified as a case or not.

163
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,300
So diagnostic suspicion, bias or diagnostic bias.

164
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,180
This is a bias that results when knowledge of the exposure affects the likelihood of the outcome being diagnosed.

165
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:06,960
It's been alleged that this has occurred in various studies, including tampons and menstrual toxic shock syndrome, aspirin and rice syndrome.

166
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,939
It's generally expected to positively bias the odds ratio or the risk ratio.

167
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:22,259
And this is because the person who's assessing the outcome thinks there should be a positive association with that exposure.

168
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:29,820
And the outcome rate occurs in case control studies, in cohort studies and unblinded randomized controlled trials.

169
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:36,180
This issue is once again going to manifest itself as differential disease misclassification.

170
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,080
So it's going to be an information bias. Same cause behind it.

171
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,940
But how we think about the bias is different, right? Because it's once again not determining who's in our study.

172
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,509
Rather, it's determining the information like it's affecting the information that we have about the participants in the study.

173
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:58,390
And it's misclassifying them. All right.

174
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,960
Reporting bias. Reporting bias is closely related to diagnostic bias,

175
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,740
but it has the probability of a case being reported as related to knowledge of the exposure status.

176
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:24,210
Inclusion. Exclusion bias. Systematic inclusion or exclusion of subjects with other diseases that are associated with the exposure

177
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,220
tends to occur when controls are patients who have sought medical care or have been hospitalized.

178
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,570
Remember, we kind of talked about in case control studies a little bit that we might decide to

179
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:40,320
exclude the people who had particular thing exposures from among the particular diseases,

180
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,560
I think from among the controls and the cases. Right.

181
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:53,610
But that that choosing to exclude these could actually impact the negatively impact the measurement.

182
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,340
So it could lead to bias.

183
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:05,430
So an example of inclusion exclusion bias is a hospital based case control study to estimate the effect of smoking on lung cancer.

184
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,920
You select a group of emphysema patients without lung cancer as the controls.

185
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,020
This would result in severely underestimating the parameter interest rate.

186
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:24,000
This is who we're including in the study is a problem because we're actually selecting a group of controls that's much more likely to smoke.

187
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,050
And it would reduce it would cause a negative bias.

188
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:39,120
So for inclusion exclusion bias, researchers often try to avoid this bias by excluding groups from the control group.

189
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,700
So in a previous example, that would mean excluding all patients with smoking related diseases.

190
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,990
However, that can lead to exclusion bias. Right.

191
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:55,469
So they're trying to avoid inclusion bias by excluding a bunch of groups.

192
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:01,740
And then that leads to exclusion bias. Right. As the controls would have artificially low prevalence of the exposure.

193
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:08,670
Right. So we're going to exclude all possible control groups that could be related to smoking.

194
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,559
Right. And now we've kind of excluded a bunch of smokers from our study.

195
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:20,070
Like it's no longer representative of the general population from which the cases came from with the the smoking prevalence.

196
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,440
Right. And so that would lead to a positive bias where you'd see a stronger association in this case.

197
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:36,270
So researchers can often try to deal with this by excluding exposure related diseases from both the cases and controls.

198
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:44,580
However, this may still result in selection bias if the status of excluded cases is associated not only with the exposure status,

199
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:50,280
but also with the index disease status under study conditional on exposure status.

200
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,920
So here we're going to get to our dogs a little bit. What are we talking about here?

201
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:02,080
When does this happen? Well, it happens when the index disease affects the occurrence of the excluded disease.

202
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,020
If it's a collider, if both diseases have one or more risk factors in common,

203
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,720
aside from the exposure, and then if the excluded diseases are risk factors for the index disease.

204
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,910
So here are the dags for inclusion and exclusion bias.

205
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:26,220
So here we can see in DAG number one, Bert directed acyclic bar graphs.

206
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,040
This is a collider, right?

207
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:38,430
When we adjust for a collider, we're going to cause there to be a relationship between the exposure and disease, even if there isn't one.

208
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:46,160
But here we've got one or more risk factors in common from the exposure.

209
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:52,240
So we've got the exposure of the disease there. In this particular case, not related.

210
00:23:52,260 --> 00:24:01,110
However, we've got this risk factor which is in common right to the exposure and disease.

211
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:15,629
Once again, when we adjust for this, for deprived, excluded diseases, then we now get a backdoor path, basically a path from ETF and down to the end.

212
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:27,390
So you're inducing a relationship here. And then the third scenario here, where the excluded diseases are a risk factor for the disease of interest.

213
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:33,030
So they're kind of on the causal pathway here. Right. And we're now adjusting for that to work going anyway.

214
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:39,140
Part of the effect. So you can kind of think of in words.

215
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:46,730
I can think of it in times, whatever is easier for you.

216
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,820
It's saying the same thing, right? It's a diagram versus the other words.

217
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,800
Okay. So selection bias in our seats. They're different sources.

218
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,380
So selection bias can occur during randomization.

219
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:09,590
You can have inadequate generation of a randomized sequence or subversion of randomization due to inadequate concealment of ALEC allocation.

220
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,750
I don't know. Did Abrams show the Gray's Anatomy kind of looking through the envelope right now?

221
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:24,830
That would be a selection bias. Selection bias can also occur after randomization, and that's due to loss or attrition.

222
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,509
Right. So you can get withdrawals from the study. You can have lost to follow up.

223
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,070
You could also have protocol violations where people are then removed from your study population.

224
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:47,910
All right. Dealing with selection bias. So there are different ways, two or times in which we can deal with selection bias.

225
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,270
So we can deal with it in the planning stage, in the data collection stage and in the analysis stage.

226
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,850
So what do we do during the planning stage to try to minimize selection bias?

227
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,100
We'll use incidence, not prevalence data whenever it's possible.

228
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,929
Not always possible, but that would certainly be the preference and case control studies.

229
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:18,570
You'll select controls randomly from the base population if it's possible that you'll use a population based design if possible.

230
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:27,810
You want to make sure that all potential subjects exposed and unexposed undergo the same diagnostic procedures and intensity of surveillance.

231
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:37,290
But that will also remove some of the selection bias that or so that will avoid detection bias could lose to an inclusion bias,

232
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:42,990
though, because that may determine who can be in your study, or that is going to determine who can be in your study.

233
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,790
You can apply the same eligibility criteria for selecting all subjects.

234
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,040
This may still lead to bias and non population based studies if the reason for

235
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,850
inclusion or exclusion is associated with both the exposure and the disease.

236
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,320
But these are kind of our usual go to procedures for trying to reduce selection bias

237
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,590
at the kind of planning stage for the study at the dedicated data collection stage.

238
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:18,390
We're going to try to minimize non-response non participation lost to follow up so we can do that by making answers required.

239
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,460
Right.

240
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:25,470
Although then the risk there of course is always that people stop with the survey at that point because they don't want to answer that question.

241
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,750
So you're going to remind people, try to get them to participate.

242
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,050
You might give them an incentive for participating and answering that survey.

243
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,180
And, of course, going to try to follow up with your participants as much as possible to kind

244
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,780
of keep them engaged with the study and thereby reduce the cost of follow up.

245
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,620
You also want to collect as much information as possible regarding exposure history,

246
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:59,720
and that's to avoid temporal ambiguity and then make sure that the disease diagnosis is blind to the exposure status.

247
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:09,870
So you want to, if you can, kind of blind the individual assessing disease to the exposure status of the participant, that isn't always possible.

248
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,050
Right. But when you can't do it, you want to try to do it. At the analysis stage,

249
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,810
we're going to compare non-responders or withdrawals with responders and non

250
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,810
withdrawals with respect to baseline variables to see if they differ systematically.

251
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,950
This is not going to necessarily confirm the presence or absence of bias or the direction of the bias or magnitude.

252
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,559
But it may make us feel a little bit better or a lot worse about our study and the fact that the possibility of bias.

253
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,219
Right. You can also use study results,

254
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:48,210
prior knowledge and logic to try to deduce the direction of specific biases and if possible, also assess the magnitude.

255
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,130
Here we're talking about kind of sensitivity analysis. So what if this happened?

256
00:28:53,130 --> 00:29:02,480
This would be the effect on my study, right? So dags first selection bias.

257
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,820
See how many. Okay. I think we can get through this.

258
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,100
All right. Okay, so here we've got our basic tag, right?

259
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,680
We've got exposure and disease, and we are selecting based on both the exposure and the disease status.

260
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,229
The box around here, the selection shows that we are conditioning on selection.

261
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,230
Right. For them to be in our study are three selected to participate in the study.

262
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,579
So when we are conditioning on something,

263
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:41,610
we're also dividing that into strata and examining the association within that strata also called adjusting or controlling for right.

264
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,919
Of course we must conditional selection because if we don't conditioned on selection, we don't have any data on those people, right?

265
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,460
So in order to have data, um, they have to be in our study, they have to be selected for our study.

266
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,970
All right. So here when we conditional on selection, which is a collider, right?

267
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,759
Because it's not related to both exposure and disease status,

268
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,909
we induce an association between exposure and the outcome that was not previously present.

269
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,960
Or if there was already an association, we might change real change that association.

270
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,930
Right. We're conditioning on a common effect.

271
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,630
And that's what introduces the bias. Right.

272
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,610
And remember, when we conditional something we're, you know, we're adjusting or controlling for that thing.

273
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,980
All right. So selection bias in case control studies.

274
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,530
So in case control studies, remember, we're we're selecting people based on their what status?

275
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:49,020
Their disease status. Right. So we've always got this arrow from disease to selection.

276
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,310
Okay. That means for selection bias to occur.

277
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,510
And in case control studies, we only also need to inadvertently select on exposure status.

278
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,050
Right. So it means that it's a lot easier to kind of induce a strong selection bias in case control studies and some of the other designs.

279
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:15,180
So selections for study only needs to be now related to exposure status.

280
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,680
Right. And then we have bias in that study.

281
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,270
So the case control study, here's an example, right, of bias in a case control study.

282
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,810
Here's our our our drinking and head severe disparity here.

283
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:38,010
Right. So we've got had severity was already related to selection or you need to have a head injury to be in the study.

284
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:42,780
We're going to do mild to severe. Right. But then we have drinking.

285
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:48,239
Right. Was related to being in the study too because remember,

286
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,640
in order to be in the study for that particular example, you had to have a blood alcohol concentration.

287
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:04,020
And if you had a mild head injury, you were more likely to have a blood alcohol concentration measurement if you'd been drinking.

288
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,080
So there you go. So there's that that example. All right.

289
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:17,460
Here's an example of differential loss to follow up in cohort studies, which is a selection bias.

290
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:27,960
So here we've got antiretroviral therapy, uh, can result in side effects which can lead to sensory.

291
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,550
Right. So when people get censored, then they will have selective loss.

292
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:40,829
Right. So here we're looking at symptoms, CD4 count, viral load, going to HIV.

293
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,100
And of course, here we have unmeasured suppression.

294
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,170
So we basically. Ah.

295
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,030
So here censoring sorry is a common effect of both the exposure to exposure.

296
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:03,470
We're interested, I apologize is actually anti-retroviral therapy and the disease aids.

297
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,080
Right. Because it's related back through there. All right. So we're trying to look.

298
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:14,239
I should probably redraw this. So it's a little bit more obvious to be looking at,

299
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,410
but we're looking at an our but as we're entering with a lot of therapy and the effects of developing AIDS.

300
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,129
Right. These are some other factors.

301
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:33,140
Right. That are related to both selection or loss in this particular cohort study.

302
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,510
Right. So if you've got a higher SCHIEFFER panel and higher viral load, you're going to feel worse.

303
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,740
You're going to be more likely probably to drop out of the study. So there you go.

304
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:52,430
All right. So summary selection bias is a bias that results from who is or is not included in the study.

305
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:59,150
It's going to be how the participants are selected or found, the determinants of participation,

306
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:05,620
and then whether a participant is included in the analysis so lost to follow up or missing data.

307
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,640
But those are also some biases.

308
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:17,599
And a selection bias is going to arise whenever both the presence of the exposure and the outcome effect that that a person will be in the study.

309
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,680
Right. We need it to affect both the exposure and the outcome.

310
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,620
And with that we are going to end for today.

311
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,723
Do not go anywhere because we are going to be getting you the exam.
