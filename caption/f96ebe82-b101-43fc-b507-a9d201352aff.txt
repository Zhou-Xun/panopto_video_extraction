1
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:09,870
It is critical for
our body to be able to respond to stress.

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,000
This is how we maintain homeostasis.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,600
All of the ways in which our body responds
allow us to handle the stressor, but

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,210
they can also place
a burden on our own body.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,390
In an acute stress situation, we have
functions that require our body to spend

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,860
excess energy on those systems that
are necessary to the stress response.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,320
Those functions are called adaptive
functions because our body adapts to

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,140
the stress that it is encountering.

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,200
However, when we use those adaptive
functions, it is necessary for

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,590
our stress response that other systems and
other functions are put at expense.

11
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,800
We might think of adaptive functions
to include things like vigilance,

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,340
focused attention, nutrition to critical
tissues like the brain, the heart, and

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:06,630
skeletal muscle, oxygenation of tissues,
and detoxification of tissues from waste.

14
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,840
All of these things are ways
in which our body works

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,670
to make us better able to
respond to a stressor.

16
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,610
However, when we respond to stressors,
the systems that get compromised or

17
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,374
get decreased in activity to help us
focus our energy on those adaptive

18
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:27,420
functions include things like eating,
growth, and reproduction.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,610
These are all called
nonadaptive functions.

20
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,340
So in the face of a stressor, our body
will prioritize the adaptive functions

21
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,730
over the nonadaptive functions so that we
can best be able to handle that stressor.

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,520
When dealing with an acute stress, such as
injury or fear, you may find that you're

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,030
more alert and more focused, and this is
because these are adaptive functions.

24
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,770
This is our body's way of saying,

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm going to focus everything I can
give to dealing with this stressor.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,140
You may also find that you're not
hungry during this type of stressor

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,630
because hunger and
growth is a nonadaptive function.

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,830
It's not needed in that critical
time point to be able to deal

29
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,650
with the stressor.

30
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,070
In periods of prolonged stress, growth and
reproduction may be compromised so

31
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,600
that the body can deal with that stress.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,642
This is something we often see in high
performing female athletes who lose their

33
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,330
menstrual cycle.

34
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,205
We have evidence showing that their
reproductive system does not function

35
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:31,525
normally during that period of time,
and this is so that they can

36
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:38,762
continue to engage in the physiologic
stress encountered during their sport.

37
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:42,474
So now we've learned about stress and
how important stress is for

38
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:46,122
us to think about our ability to
engage in an adequate response to

39
00:02:46,122 --> 00:02:48,810
dealing with an acute stressor.

40
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,850
So I encourage you to think about your
own work and your own discipline and

41
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,540
how you might frame exposures of
interest in terms of a stressor.

42
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,670
Understanding that these exposures
are stressors will help us understand

43
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,320
the ways in which they might impact our
physiology by disruption of homeostasis.

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,140
And when we understand these exposures
as stressors to homeostasis,

45
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,380
we can better understand the underlying
physiology related to disease outcomes,

46
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,490
and be able to develop adequate and

47
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,105
appropriate interventions to maintain
the homeostasis of the body.
