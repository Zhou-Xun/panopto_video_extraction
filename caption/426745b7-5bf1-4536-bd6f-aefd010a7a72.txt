1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,020
We think it's the same message here.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,620
She probably smells me and says, Oh, there is danger.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:22,830
And it happened the day after I got back, every time I got dragged down there.

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,430
I just kept going back down. And I don't know what I like to share, you know?

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:38,909
Let's go back inside. Wake up. They're all except you.

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,940
But you're also.

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,640
Maybe not. She's not strong enough.

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,020
You can just go up right there.

9
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:25,460
I did not want to be like, Oh, how do I know she would still be that know?

10
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:34,980
But it's just like, I don't know how to, you know, I don't like I said, it's not that different.

11
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:46,680
It's not, you know, nothing compared to what I feel like, you know, I don't know what's wrong with these people.

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:02:05,000
So, like, it's like, oh, no, it's not like you're not even.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,460
And I was just like, no.

14
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:20,849
Yes. We were going to school today. We're going to talk about organizations like Unity and then Wednesday we're going to do some examples of theory.

15
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,100
And then this Friday, I believe you have a draft of your conceptual model models.

16
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:33,460
Do you have any questions about that? Yeah.

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:44,940
Wondering they. Descriptions that can give feedback on descriptions that they submit their descriptions with the panel or should they submit it?

18
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,340
Feedback in between that.

19
00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:01,910
If you have a description of your conceptual model and that you're planning that you have it ready to turn on this Friday, feel free to turn it.

20
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,080
I think it's great to just turn it in as early as possible as soon as you have it done.

21
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,880
If you turn it in afterwards, that's totally fine.

22
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,690
Um, I wouldn't turn it in right before your final comment this year.

23
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,490
I would discourage that. So the sooner the better.

24
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:28,090
And happy to give you. In fact, I'm not. Other questions.

25
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,370
I'm excited to see what you came up with. We both are.

26
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,280
So if any questions come up between now and Friday before you turn it into favor, reach out.

27
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:49,719
So today, like I said, I want to cover concepts for both organizations and with the organizational theory,

28
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,990
I'm going to give you sort of the main highlights and then we'll spend a little more time on community.

29
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,390
So what is an organization and.

30
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:11,960
It's basically a group of people who are intentionally organized to accomplish a goal or a set of goals.

31
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:22,310
An organization also has an integrated social system that typically has sort of various inputs and resources to produce outputs.

32
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,610
So this is what Public Health is. An organization of Michigan Medicine is an organization.

33
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:38,400
The County Health Department is an organization. Some of you might be involved in student organizations that are within the School of Public Health,

34
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,740
like Women in Health Leadership that would be considered an organization.

35
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,640
The Public Health Action Support Team is considered an organization.

36
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,320
So I think you get the idea. Organizations are all around us.

37
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,330
So why are organizational change theories important and how are they sort of relevant to you?

38
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,750
So I imagine everyone in the room here is interested in employment once they're finished graduate school.

39
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:16,640
Is that a common goal you have? Okay, so all of you either work for an organization or start your own, perhaps.

40
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,880
And right now, organizational change is becoming more critical than ever in the health field.

41
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,979
I mean, the recent passage of the bill is not so recent.

42
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:38,930
It's been about ten years, but we're still sort of seeing the impacts of the Affordable Care Act continue to sort of play out on health care.

43
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,800
And because of this huge legislation and when we think about it in the context of our country's history,

44
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,410
allied health prevention professionals are needed in trying to figure out how to create more efficiencies,

45
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,419
for example, in the delivery of care both in the community and within health care delivery systems.

46
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:05,420
So many of you as graduates of this School of Public Health will rise to leadership roles in organizations you work with,

47
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,610
and having tools to be an effective change agent will be really important.

48
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,790
So another reason why organizational change theories are important is because many programs

49
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,349
developed in public health are really disseminated through organizational settings.

50
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,820
So you can develop an intervention. But when you think about actually disseminating it, it's often through various organizations.

51
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,100
So the way organizations are structured and operate influenced by their evidence based

52
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,350
practices and programs actually reach people and therefore improve population health.

53
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,879
So they're they're really critical vehicle through which we disseminate interventions

54
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,120
and thereby try to improve and improve population level health outcomes.

55
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:00,410
Okay. So there are a lot of theories and frameworks on organizational change right now.

56
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,200
Hopefully you're becoming more and more well versed in looking at various constructs of theories.

57
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,250
So you should be able to walk through an organizational theory if you saw one.

58
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,089
What I want to do is give you the gist of what we typically see across these theories.

59
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,919
So there are way too many organizational theories to cover in this class or even in the session.

60
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,870
So I want to sort of give you the gist of what we see across these types of theories.

61
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:34,370
So there are typically four dimensions of organizational change that organizational change theories aim to address.

62
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:41,600
And these are the organization wide versus subsystems change, transformational versus incremental change,

63
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,460
remedial versus developmental change in reaction versus proactive change.

64
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:58,730
So the first dimension of organizational change, often mentioned in organizational theories, is organization wide versus subsystem change.

65
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:07,910
Organization wide typically involves sort of major restructuring, oftentimes thinking about like a cultural shift.

66
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:17,570
For example, think of an informally organized group who may seek to make themselves an official business or a nonprofit organization.

67
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,720
That sort of change would be described as an organization wide change or becoming a little more official.

68
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,310
And a subsystem change, on the other hand, is a smaller organizational change,

69
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:35,270
which may include something like introducing a new product or program, expanding your hours, or implementing a new policy.

70
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,270
So you can sort of think of it as a party, sort of within the fabric of the organization.

71
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,290
So another dimension of organizational change mentioned in various theories are transformational versus incremental change.

72
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,080
So transformational change is often a dramatic shift in the organization, structure or culture.

73
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:08,280
And one example of this might be how power is maybe distributed across the organization.

74
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,030
That's sort of thought of as a dramatic shift.

75
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,549
On the other hand, like an incremental change often involves small planned steps for change.

76
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,160
That kind of happens gradually over time. And then eventually that change sort of goes unnoticed.

77
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,460
So one example might be, you know, when I think of the organization of the University of Michigan,

78
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,709
many of you may not have been around here when this happened,

79
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:48,660
but I would say several years ago they migrated our email systems to the Google Suite and they migrated everyone through a planning process over time.

80
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,170
So now it is sort of took several months.

81
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,170
So I would sort of describe this as an incremental change.

82
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,579
Now we don't really think about like the email system we use at the university.

83
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,469
Most people affiliated with the university use Gmail system,

84
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:15,300
but that sort of migration to a new system sort of happened over time to the point where we just don't even notice it anymore as a change.

85
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,100
Then we have remedial versus developmental change.

86
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,430
And that's another dimension of working on organizational change, often mentioned in these theories.

87
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:37,180
So remedial change, remedies, current situations are problems, and the changes are usually sort of sudden visible and urgent.

88
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,740
And the goal is to make an organization more productive.

89
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:47,709
So, for example, if you see many of your employees in your organization not really getting along with each other,

90
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,030
a remedial change might be to do a team building exercise or an excursion.

91
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:58,030
And developmental change, on the other hand, is used to make an organization even more effective.

92
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,769
Is the change is more general.

93
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:09,820
So a nonprofit health organization focused on serving one demographic population may expand their programs to other groups.

94
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,320
So I would that would be considered more of a developmental change.

95
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,879
And then the last dimension often mentioned in organizational change theories is reactive versus proactive change.

96
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:33,740
So reactive change is really sudden, unplanned change, often due to some sort of an anticipated or major event for,

97
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,610
for example, the head of an organization may decide to retire, stepped down due to bad publicity.

98
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:47,200
That would be a reactive change, but a proactive change is a strategic plan for a major change.

99
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:56,230
So that School of Public Health, for example, put together a strategic plan around design.

100
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,649
They've also put together strategic plans around innovation.

101
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:08,380
In the past, a nonprofit may devise a strategic plan to reach a greater number of their sort of population of focus that they aim to serve.

102
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,790
These are all examples of proactive change within an organization where there's

103
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,220
sort of some you sort of think they're a strategy to get out of uniform.

104
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:30,600
So these are those are concepts that are typically the focus of organizational change, theories that aim to make change within the organization,

105
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:38,669
so that within an organization we want to emphasize that then there is change across organizations.

106
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:46,650
And this means that the theories in this broad category typically sort of target multiple organizations within the same sector.

107
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,880
They have similar goals or serve similar populations.

108
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:59,100
So there is some similarity across organizations that make these change theories relevant as as a guide for action.

109
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:09,740
So one of the OEMs, I'll give you sort of an example of one very that illustrates this in our organizational relations series.

110
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,320
So this theory focuses on how organizations work together.

111
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,330
And the premise is that when collaboration occurs between organizations,

112
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,309
this leads to a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to a larger shared

113
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,170
goal versus the capacity of a single organization and accomplishing the goal,

114
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,829
among some. One example of this is a community coalition.

115
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,159
These that become these are very popular in public health.

116
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,640
And we've seen more and more of community coalition work over the past 20 to 30 years.

117
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,639
And the largest community coalitions are that they are sort of formal,

118
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:55,500
multipurpose and long term alliances that work locally and regionally to address a community issue or a problem.

119
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,329
Like I said,

120
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:05,700
community coalitions are quite popular in public health and have been organized around various issues such as addressing childhood asthma,

121
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:11,380
diabetes care, tobacco reduction, immunizations, just to name a few.

122
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:20,879
So they're used quite often to tackle public health issues that are sort of lend themselves really

123
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:29,790
nicely to being addressed by multiple sort of organizations that work at different levels.

124
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:39,770
There are three key concepts within inter organizational relations theory that I would like for you to know,

125
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:47,510
and these concepts are meant to sort of explain how that works form from informal to formal linkages.

126
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,019
And these can often be thought of as a continuum, and this is an important part of the theory.

127
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:02,120
So I'll sort of repeat that these three concepts are meant to explain how networks form for informal,

128
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,010
informal linkages and can often be thought of as a continuum.

129
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,930
So the first concern was the exchange or obligation on networks.

130
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:19,060
These are sort of loosely linked organizations that may exchange some resources or plan some activities together.

131
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,290
And this is often done with the coordination of a few people.

132
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:33,040
One example of this might be different sort of student groups here at the School of Public Health who decided to co-sponsor an event together.

133
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,810
And we see this happen all the time. So exchange our obligation on networks.

134
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:47,860
A nice example of this is co-sponsorship and an action or a promotional network is a little more concrete where organizations

135
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:55,810
share and pool resources that accomplish a specific action that sort of secondary to an individual organization.

136
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,490
So pooling of resources to accomplish some sort of secondary school.

137
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,959
And this is different from exchange and obligation networks in the sense that the

138
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:12,370
actions are really now tied to a goal that's shared by both of these organizations.

139
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:21,870
So one example that comes to mind is the Movember Campaign for Men's Health, which is coming up.

140
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:29,560
And there they partner with Livestrong Foundation, the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the Prevention Institute.

141
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:38,530
And all of these organizations have their own mission, but they are tied together by this higher level goal to improve men's health,

142
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,680
and they pooled resources to support the Movember effort.

143
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:54,630
And lastly, systems networks are even more concrete and mean that organizations really formally link to jointly produce services or accomplish a goal.

144
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,860
And this is usually some sort of contractual agreement between two or more organizations.

145
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:08,260
So one example of this is when public health departments have merged with Medicaid programs.

146
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:17,320
Medicaid is an insurance program for individuals and families who meet certain income thresholds,

147
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,330
typically lower income and then run by individual states.

148
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:35,200
And over the past, say 20 to 30 years, about half of U.S. states have merged their Medicaid programs with their public health departments.

149
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:47,920
So, you know, why would they do that? So there aren't a lot of resources, not as many resources in public health compared to other sort of sectors.

150
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:59,920
To do the work we aim to carry out, to do Medicaid programs in particular are incredibly expensive to individual states to actually administer.

151
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,000
And there's this public perception at times that when Medicaid merges with public health departments,

152
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:16,630
public health dollars actually get eaten up by the public health departments or by Medicaid.

153
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,060
Sorry. There's this perception that when they merge with public health departments,

154
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,889
Medicaid sort of eats up all the money that public health departments have to do

155
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:32,620
all kinds of things beyond beyond health care and what Medicaid might be doing.

156
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,540
And this is actually not true because studies have shown that Medicaid actually saves

157
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,250
money when they are when they merge with really good public health departments,

158
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:47,950
because they can do a lot more health promotion in partnership with these public health departments.

159
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:54,490
And those benefits from that sort of prevention work actually saves the Medicaid program lots of money.

160
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:02,500
So so that's a good example of a systems network where formally joining two sorts of entities

161
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,550
to produce shared services for a similar goal actually produces some desired outcomes.

162
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,240
So any questions about inner organizational relations theory?

163
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:26,560
So I started throwing a lot at you, but I want to give you sort of an idea that when you look at in organizational theory,

164
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,319
there are theories that focus on change within organizations,

165
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,590
and then there are theories that focus on how organizations might interact with each other towards a shared goal.

166
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,499
So if you are considering using an organizational theory of sorts,

167
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:50,260
you want to think about where a sort of start there might think about when then are between and then.

168
00:19:50,260 --> 00:20:01,000
What sort of things are these organizations aiming to do in terms of thinking about the core concepts of these two approaches?

169
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:19,550
So any questions before we move on to community? Okay.

170
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,460
So what is community? So community can be thought of for different ways.

171
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,740
It can be thought of as one, a functional spatial unit, sort of often defined by geography,

172
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,250
such as states, cities, towns, neighborhoods and households.

173
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:50,630
Community can also be thought of as units of pattern social interaction, such as graduate school or social media groups.

174
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,990
You know, patterns, social interactions.

175
00:20:54,350 --> 00:21:01,220
It can also be thought of as a symbolic unit of collective identity, sort of centered around certain characteristics,

176
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,909
such as sexual identity, gender, race or religion, and very inherent in any form of community.

177
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:17,690
And whatever way you define it, community can also be thought of as just people coming together for a shared purpose.

178
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,040
So a lot of different ways that we can sort of think about community.

179
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,970
But usually, you know, at the core of it is a group of people coming together around some sort of shared purpose.

180
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:41,559
Some individual view, a perspective. A community posits that individuals sort of define their community membership with

181
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,500
sort of multiple intersecting identities that sort of go beyond a single definition.

182
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,690
And for people who are seeking community engagement,

183
00:21:53,050 --> 00:22:02,140
understanding how individuals and communities view themselves through multiple lenses becomes really critical for effective practice.

184
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:16,090
So does anybody know who this is? Okay.

185
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:25,110
So this is Paolo for he he wrote The Pedagogy of the Oppressed, and he was an educator and a philosopher.

186
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:36,160
And much of the teachings, much of his teachings really have informed community based approaches to change that are really practice in public.

187
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:45,689
So it's really his philosophy that undergrads community based work and public health are the

188
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:51,200
way we sort of think about it in our discipline and the core of what he practiced in part,

189
00:22:51,240 --> 00:23:00,090
was there any human being, no matter how oppressed or marginalized or disenfranchized they may be,

190
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,010
they're capable of looking at the world critically and through dialog with others,

191
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,860
and that they become and through this sort of exchange and dialog with other people,

192
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:18,960
they become more critically aware of the world around them and they're able to transform their lives and their surroundings as a result.

193
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,920
And the core of this dialog is to facilitate learning.

194
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:32,910
It is not a it's not really a method, but it's really a dialog to facilitate learning.

195
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:40,469
And as we walk through concepts related to community based change, you'll see much of how a very philosophy evident.

196
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:52,080
And so no matter how oppressed or disenfranchized a person may be, they're capable of looking at the world critically through dialog with others,

197
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,380
and therefore being able to transform their lives and their surroundings as a result.

198
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,410
That's sort of been the crux of white need or the crux of how low varies philosophy.

199
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:15,260
So we all belong to a community or multiple communities, and there are several benefits to community participation.

200
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,750
First, the mere act of participating in community can be health enhancing.

201
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:30,500
Many studies have demonstrated that this can occur by increasing people's perceived control within communities when they can actively engage with it.

202
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:39,800
And community participation is also a basic tenet of empowerment, which I'll sort of dissect for you in a few slides from now.

203
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:48,169
Another benefit of community participation is that having community members involved in the design and implementation

204
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:56,660
of interventions that we may consider developing as public health practitioners can greatly improve their quality,

205
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:08,210
success, sustainability and reach when we involve community members in our entire communities in the shaping and designing of these programs.

206
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:14,900
And then community participation requires us, as public health professionals and researchers,

207
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,000
to give up some control in the process of designing and evaluating interventions.

208
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,149
There's a lot we can learn from that.

209
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:29,240
People actually entrenched in their own communities were thinking about solutions that benefit the whole community.

210
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,329
So. So community engaged work requires us to give up control,

211
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:42,170
but there's a lot that we can learn about those who are actually just entrenched in the communities themselves.

212
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:53,890
So we wanted to differentiate between community organizing and community building for you because these two concepts are related but different.

213
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:02,980
I don't mean the same thing. Community organizing is typically a process through which communities are helped to identify common problems.

214
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:12,220
Goals are how to mobilize resources or even develop and implement strategies for reaching the goals they have collectively set.

215
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:19,270
It essentially creates conditions for community groups to set the agenda for change.

216
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:28,600
Community organizing has a really long history and historically has been seen as a method for social change.

217
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:34,240
We've seen community organizing through civil rights, women's rights, gay rights,

218
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:46,150
and more recently in our history in this country around gay marriage, disability rights, antiwar organizing, the list sort of goes on.

219
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:55,120
But there's a rich history of community organizing for social change in our community building.

220
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:02,100
On the other hand, is more strikes based and the focus is on really nurturing and celebrating community assets.

221
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,150
So community building often starts with community organizing.

222
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:15,459
When can community building can include things as small as potlucks all the way to festivals?

223
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:21,160
You're really focused on celebrating the community and focusing on their strengths and their assets.

224
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:34,970
So there are a lot of different conceptual models used to understand community organizing and community building,

225
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,400
and we can't adequately review all of them in this course.

226
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,720
But what I want you to understand is the purpose of these models and the variety of their emphases

227
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,160
in practice or in applying these models to inform an intervention or program you may be developing.

228
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,559
You would want to think about what a particular model emphasizes to see if it really

229
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:03,139
aligns with the goals that you have and has potential to adequately guide your work.

230
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:12,260
So we'll talk about this more a little later as we talk about how to use theories and models more in depth.

231
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,540
When I walk through some applied examples for you guys through a few different sessions,

232
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:24,740
so there's there's no single unified model to really describe community organization, including community building.

233
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:30,830
There are a lot of models and as you review and come across different models that have different assumptions

234
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:36,260
about the nature and meaning of community and the emphasis of models will also be quite varied.

235
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:43,069
Some focus on communities in the context of empowerment, while others emphasize community strengths,

236
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:52,430
and other models view community as the center of practice, and others hope to sort of extract factors that can motivate social action.

237
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:03,680
So humility is also what encompasses the some of these models, meaning an ability to listen to our own internal dialog and be open to others cultures.

238
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,340
And this is really critical to code learning.

239
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:16,670
So again, there's no single model. However, there are different emphases that I sort of listed here that give you a clue to

240
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,090
whether you are looking at a model for community organizing or a community building.

241
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:36,770
So there are also some commonly referred to constructs that are really evident within many models of community organizing in community building.

242
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:45,830
So I'd like for you to know, so empowerment, critical consciousness, community capacities, social capital issues,

243
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:52,309
selection and participation and relevance all review each of these through the next several slides.

244
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:59,770
But again, these types of constructs are often used when building a conceptual model around community organizing.

245
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:14,060
So empowerment and empowerment is an action oriented concept.

246
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,030
You've probably heard this word thrown around, but what does that actually mean?

247
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,780
It's the focus on the removal of barriers and really transforming power relations.

248
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,330
And it's often more uniformly defined as social action prices for people,

249
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:38,370
a social action process for people to really gain mastery over their lives and larger structures such as organizations and community.

250
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:49,290
So this table right here shows us that power can really be achieved at the individual level, at the organizational level and at the community level.

251
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,860
I mean, for individual empowerment, the process of empowering an individual often includes learning skills,

252
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,070
managing resources, and working with other people.

253
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:09,059
Empowerment at the individual level, results typically results in a sense of control, critical awareness and more participatory behavior.

254
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:15,480
So those are the sort of outcomes we're interested in when we're focused on individual level employment.

255
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,519
At the organizational level,

256
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,960
the process of empowerment includes shared leadership and responsibility and opportunities to really participate in decision making.

257
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:30,060
So when organizations are really empowered, they're better able to compete for resources,

258
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,299
really network with other organizations within with a similar or complementary vision.

259
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,330
And they're also better positioned to influence policy.

260
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:47,430
And the process of empowering at the community level typically includes enabling access to important resources.

261
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,790
It could mean also creating an open government structure that really allows all community

262
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:59,460
members to participate in creating an environment where there is tolerance for diversity.

263
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:09,269
When communities are empowered, organizational coalitions and communities are more easily formed and existing ones are strengthened and empowered.

264
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:19,950
Communities also typically have pluralistic leadership, meaning that leadership is distributed across multiple individuals and their residents.

265
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:30,540
Participatory, participatory skills are so in an empowered community you see more people sharing power essentially.

266
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:39,899
And studies have shown that empowerment approaches have the ability to directly influence how and when communities become empowered.

267
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:45,180
Some studies have shown that how enduring social indicators begin to decline,

268
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,509
such as race and alcoholism, violence and suicide whenever faculty members engage.

269
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,650
Being chief, Marc Zimmerman does a lot of work on empowerment,

270
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:05,700
and one of his greatest contributions to the science on empowerment was really quantifying the

271
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:12,779
impacts of community level empowerment on health indicators so that he may not brag about it,

272
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:19,349
but that he thought was actually a significant contribution to our field to actually be able to

273
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:26,210
show the impact of community level empowerment on various sort of health indicators and concerns.

274
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:41,360
So critical consciousness is another key concept in community organization and community building and is often linked to empowerment.

275
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:48,260
Critical Consciousness Again was developed by Carlo PEREIRA and really focuses on reflection and

276
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,440
achieving an in-depth understanding of the world and exposures to social and political contradictions.

277
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,000
It's a critical consciousness is the ability to really perceive social,

278
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,780
political and economic oppression and to take action against these oppressive elements in our society.

279
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:11,149
And this is usually done through engaging people in dialog around the root causes

280
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:16,370
of particular social issues and how they can be translated into community action.

281
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:30,310
And then we have community capacity, which is similar to empowerment, but different power is really central to the concept of empowerment.

282
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:38,990
It occurs across multiple levels from individual all the way up to community in terms of taking ownership over the change process.

283
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,980
Community capacity, on the other hand,

284
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:49,300
refers to community characteristics that impact the ability to really identify and mobilize and address the problems.

285
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:57,100
So empowerment is power is really central to the concept of empowerment,

286
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:06,490
but community capacity is really about community characteristics that affect our ability to identify and mobilize and address problems.

287
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:18,670
There are a lot of different dimensions of community capacity and includes things like citizen participation and leadership skills and resources,

288
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,070
social and organizational networks. Sense of community.

289
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:32,170
Really understanding your community's history. Community, power values within communities and critical reflection.

290
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,680
So community capacity is often applied to getting community members to become

291
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,250
more skilled to address community issues and concerns collectively and for.

292
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,490
So if we're going to sort of intervene on community capacity,

293
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:56,040
the goal is to really get the community to become to develop more skills and being able

294
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,930
to address the issues most salient to the community in partnership with other members.

295
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,750
So in order to build community capacity, you oftentimes need social capital.

296
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:16,070
Also, capital refers to the sort of collective value that's derived from social networks, whether it's social and economic.

297
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,810
It really focuses on relationships and includes things like trust,

298
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:29,540
reciprocity and civic engagement and the benefits that sort of flow from these sort of interactions.

299
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,749
Social capital can work through multiple channels and can include information flows,

300
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:41,750
norms of reciprocity, collective action, and also thinking about broader identities.

301
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:47,630
And a lot of work has shown that lack of social capital is linked to poor health and quality of life.

302
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:00,680
So another concept, key concept in community organizations and community building is issue selection.

303
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,600
Issue selection is just what you might expect it to be.

304
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,210
It's really the process of identifying specific issues that the community would like to address.

305
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:17,360
And a good issue is often winnable, simple, specific and unifying.

306
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:25,130
It should involve the community in a meaningful way, and it shouldn't affect many people and have potential to build up the community.

307
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,840
And the issue should really be part of a larger plan or strategy.

308
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,420
There are a variety of methods available to really identify relevant issues in community,

309
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,700
including sort of door to door interviewing surveys or even town hall types of events.

310
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,469
Often,

311
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:51,890
communities are employing a combination of all of these strategies to really sort of get at the types of issues that that community should focus on.

312
00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:01,050
So people and communities are valuable sources of knowledge involving them in identifying issues.

313
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:07,260
Most salient to their community is really integral to issue selection and participation can really serve

314
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,170
as a valuable source of long term sustainable sustainability and community organizing and development.

315
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:21,570
It allows community members to really create their own agenda based on their felt needs to share power and awareness of resources.

316
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:31,230
So it's really it's all of these issues that we just went through empowerment, critical consciousness, community capacity, social capital,

317
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,390
issue selection and participation and relevance that are really key constructs that

318
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,760
come across all major models of community organizing and community development,

319
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:53,340
that you should have a pretty good sponsor if you pick up any sort of model related to community capacity, community building, community organizing,

320
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:59,729
you will see you will see these elements of empowerment, critical consciousness,

321
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,440
community capacity would want to think through how are they sort of relevant to the goals of that.

322
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:15,220
So what is switching gears and talk a little bit about community based participatory research?

323
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,730
I'm sure many of you have heard of this term before.

324
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:25,570
It's a big emphasis and they do department and the work of many of our faculty in the department,

325
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,630
many of whom have been really tremendous advocates of this method and have made

326
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:36,640
really significant contributions to the field in terms of its widespread adoption.

327
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,330
We have entire courses on community based participatory research.

328
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:46,360
So I encourage you to call them that. They're really an area of particular interest to you.

329
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:54,490
But I just want to provide you with a snapshot of CPR because it's because of its popularity and community based work.

330
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,220
So. So what is CV PR?

331
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,430
It's a partnership approach to research.

332
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:13,760
It provides equal involvement of community members in incorporating them and has all aspects of the research process.

333
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,499
This sort of partnership allows everyone to contribute and integrates the knowledge

334
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,270
gained from community members in the design of interventions and policy change.

335
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,690
There are sort of eight principles of CPR. It recognizes the community as a unit of identity.

336
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:43,740
That means the process doesn't necessarily fixate on disparate issues or factions of a community, but is about the community as a whole.

337
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:48,150
It builds upon community strengths and resources.

338
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:55,440
It's a message that focuses on what communities have to work with and not necessarily deficits.

339
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:03,390
CPR also promotes collaborative and equitable partnerships and facilitates whole learning and capacity building.

340
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:11,190
So researchers, professional experts, community members are considered equal in terms of shared understanding,

341
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,160
and everyone has something valuable to bring to the table and everyone can learn from one another.

342
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,170
And it also balances research and action for mutual benefit.

343
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:37,050
So, you know, one example of this, you know, when you mix research and action from that research, that actually benefits the community.

344
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,430
One example of this concerns like the randomized controlled design.

345
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,680
You know, when we're doing research and evaluation and a randomized controlled design,

346
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,050
you often have a control group, which means you withhold some sort of beneficial treatment.

347
00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:00,660
And in these sorts of designs, you really need to think through what that means in the CV approach,

348
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,520
because you know what is necessarily withhold something that's beneficial to communities and you

349
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,270
want to really think through your evaluation approach that does have some sort of mutual benefit.

350
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,860
And there are all sorts of rigorous designs beyond the traditional randomized controlled trial where you

351
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:25,170
withhold treatment right away that you can utilize to be rigorous in your community based evaluation approach.

352
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,950
CB also focuses on the determinants of health from a local standpoint and considers

353
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,920
how local structures are really promoting or impeding home and creepers.

354
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,570
Is it a long term process and commitment to really sustaining, changing communities,

355
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:49,739
really thinking about disseminating findings to all partners and involving members of the community in

356
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,680
the dissemination process of what you learn that in your work together is really a key element to this.

357
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,550
So I want to highlights some caveats about CBP that are often overlooked or

358
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:09,920
not well understood on CBP are is an approach the way research is conducting.

359
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:16,730
It's not considered a research method and it doesn't have a specific sort of design to it.

360
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:22,900
And it can involve multiple types of research designs and include both qualitative and quantitative methods.

361
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,590
So it's not as specific research methods.

362
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,700
We didn't have it. So it's also not a theory. It's a way of conducting research in partnership with communities.

363
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,600
And the way CBP is actually used in research is highly variable with the key principles

364
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:47,720
we just covered usually give an indication that some sort of CBP approach is being used,

365
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:56,090
and it's also only one method of several that are out there that aim to involve community members in the research process.

366
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:05,060
I'm highlighting this one because it's probably the one that's most commonly used or referred to in our discipline.

367
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:18,490
But there are a lot of different methods for community engaged research that don't necessarily fall into the typical eight key CBP principles,

368
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:26,420
but know have a sort of similar goal in the end to engage communities and partners work together.

369
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:37,729
So this is a nice diagram that really highlights how core components of CBP actually play out in practice versus

370
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:45,080
typically a partnership forms between a research team and a community or a community based organization.

371
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:54,800
They collectively sort of assess what's going on in the community in terms of priority issues and strengths and assets as well,

372
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:01,610
and then collectively design a disseminated intervention or policy evaluator and disseminate the findings.

373
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,180
And the goal is also to sustain CBP as a method for really strengthening communities.

374
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:14,360
So this process continues as community, as other sort of issues arise.

375
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,010
So it's not meant to be sort of a one off,

376
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:26,420
but it's a method of working together that hopefully translates to other sort of issues that the community aims to focus on.

377
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,080
And it's typically relevant to board types of research.

378
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:41,970
It's often used to identify multiple determinants of how it can be useful for identifying disparities in the community.

379
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:50,669
It can be useful for understanding community needs, doing a needs assessment and understanding their problems,

380
00:45:50,670 --> 00:46:03,120
but also the resources and assets and CPR is also relevant to design, implement and sustain interventions and policies with the community services.

381
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,280
It often lends itself well to these four types of these categories which.

382
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,269
So. I'd love to highlight for you how stuff like a lot of what we talked about in terms of

383
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:26,210
community concepts have actually been integrated into an actual project to address an issue.

384
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:36,679
So, so when I talk about the Choose the Healthy Path and in 1997, that which was a long time ago,

385
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,839
the federal government established an initiative to bridge the safety net gap for

386
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,880
children of low income backgrounds called the Children's Health Insurance Program.

387
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:56,340
It's essentially the the health insurance program within our country that covers low income children,

388
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,080
children with low income who may not otherwise have access to health insurance through other means.

389
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:10,129
And the purpose of this program was to really provide coverage for children whose families did not qualify

390
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:17,510
for Medicaid because they perhaps had too much income or had too little income for private insurance.

391
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:24,680
So it's sort of the in-between group. You don't really qualify for Medicaid, but you have too little income for private health insurance.

392
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:33,620
So that's that's really what the purpose of the Children's Health Insurance Program was and is for this country.

393
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:44,490
Our chip is run by individual states. States basically receive matching dollars for implementing their program from the federal government

394
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:53,219
so that federal government typically pays somewhere around 70% and states pay about 30%.

395
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,910
So then they sort of car share. It's not quite 5050,

396
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:03,870
but there is kind of sure there are shared costs and states have chosen to

397
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:08,099
expand health insurance to this particular group in about three different ways.

398
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,990
Over time, they either expand it into their current Medicaid programs,

399
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:21,899
make a separate program that's just many states have opted to have created their own names for those

400
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:28,650
programs and combination that sometimes are a combination of Medicaid and also a separate program.

401
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:37,049
So sometimes states create their own programs and have a particular name.

402
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,920
So, you know, Georgia has peach care.

403
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,870
That's what they call it. It's kind of cute. I think in Wisconsin, it's badger care.

404
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,029
So they have these kind of cute names for their children's health insurance program,

405
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:55,380
depending on what state it's in and if they created their own program.

406
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:06,190
So. This was a policy that was enacted with the goal of reaching about, you know,

407
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:11,620
thinking back to 1997, their goal was to really reach about 5 million children across the country.

408
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:20,920
Later, evaluations of the CHIP program showed that those who were enrolled in this program used more preventative care,

409
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:28,660
had better access and communication with health care providers, and fewer asthma attacks compared to uninsured children.

410
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:39,340
Asthma is one of the most common chronic childhood conditions and is especially prevalent among children with low income Americans.

411
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:45,250
So. So two years after.

412
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,540
Be. Okay.

413
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:03,959
So two years after Chip was implemented, they had less than a million children, actually.

414
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:10,410
And remember, the goal is 5 million. But even at two years after, they implemented only about a million children in war.

415
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:17,760
And because of this, the federal government did a very aggressive campaign to get their numbers up.

416
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:26,640
So they weren't really reaching their targets. And this was an issue that was really critical to East Side of Detroit.

417
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,440
There were still high pockets of uninsured children, especially in this area.

418
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:41,010
More than a third of families living in the east side of Detroit met federal guidelines for poverty, and about 3000 remained uninsured.

419
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,730
The remaining uninsured were eligible to enroll in CHIP, but didn't.

420
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:52,860
This was essentially a free program, but people are looking at it as a lot of benefits to the health of children.

421
00:50:53,580 --> 00:51:02,550
So part of the problem was that the aggressive campaigns done a draw and state level may not have resonated with the specific needs of the community.

422
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:08,250
They weren't really involved in the development of the promotional materials being put out there,

423
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:15,090
and essentially a policy was passed and people were expected to take advantage of it without knowing too much about it.

424
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,709
So as practitioners, we know that health insurance can be a good thing for people,

425
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,040
but we assume that everyone would share that same sentiment and involvement.

426
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:34,990
So because of the high rates of uninsured children in the east side of Detroit, the East Side Access Partnership was poor.

427
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,610
And this was a CPR partnership between researchers at the University of Michigan

428
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:43,930
School of Public Health and the Detroit Department of Health and Wellness.

429
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:54,850
Both promotion at the time and family independence agencies or feel fear provides and coordinates human services,

430
00:51:54,850 --> 00:52:03,640
especially for people who may need financial assistance or specific programs or services.

431
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:07,870
At the time, SCHIP enrollment was line.

432
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,600
Well, now chimp enrollment is online, but back when Chip was being rolled down,

433
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,760
field offices were one place that families could actually go to and more.

434
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:25,229
So this partnership was formed with key stakeholders around this issue,

435
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:37,980
and their goal was to really identify and bring more children into into Michigan's CHIP program, which is called My Child or Have My Child.

436
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:45,200
Again with their high rates, the high pockets of uninsured children in this area.

437
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:53,930
This is essentially a free program. Lots of folks qualified for it but weren't and weren't taking it out.

438
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,840
So the first thing the partnership started with was why?

439
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,600
Why weren't families enrolling their children into my child?

440
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,040
That's free and gives them access to care, so why wouldn't they do it?

441
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,870
So the first thing they did was about seven focus groups,

442
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:21,180
and they did this with community residents and staff at the different offices where families would go to enroll their children.

443
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:27,030
And what they found was that people found the enrollment process cumbersome and difficult to navigate,

444
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,260
and they didn't really know if they were eligible or where to go to.

445
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:42,540
There was also stigma associated with Medicaid. And so Medicaid is a program for families who essentially meet certain federal guidelines for poverty.

446
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,850
They provide financial assistance for all kinds of social services, like paying bills, food stamps, etc.

447
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:55,710
So as you can imagine, people felt some stigma around that.

448
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:01,020
And people also felt that those working at the VA offices weren't very nice to me.

449
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,270
So as you can imagine, you don't want to go to places where you're getting bad service, right?

450
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,669
So these focus group findings really help the partnership,

451
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:17,160
really figure out some of the key issues hindering people from enrolling their children into marriage.

452
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:25,440
So these were sort of the key sort of reasons that they found through the focus groups the negative treatment that these offices,

453
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,830
this enrollment process felt really complex.

454
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:36,450
They didn't really understand it was at the field offices that they would have to go to actually enroll.

455
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:40,200
So these were, again, a lot of those barriers that break down.

456
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:48,600
So going back to how little free range key really informed some of the core

457
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,710
philosophies evident in how we do public health work at the community level.

458
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,840
So like we talked about, he really pioneered the idea of critical consciousness,

459
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:07,380
which is engaging people in dialog around root causes of a particular social issue in order to get people and communities to take action.

460
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,479
So critical consciousness can really be imitated in a lot of different ways.

461
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:21,600
In interventions, you can have discussions of drama in your groups, also utilize, you know,

462
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:27,090
techniques of critical consciousness to sort of raise awareness and dialog around issues.

463
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,930
I'm for one method I want to highlight on raising critical consciousness as an intervention tool is learning.

464
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:42,660
So this is visual and it often is used as an organizational change tool to help companies and businesses

465
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:51,240
identify problems and root learning as a company out of Ohio who really develops these types of maps.

466
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:58,679
So I want to show you give you an example of what the learning looks like.

467
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:05,760
So how many of you have had a banana today? One banana, the fruit.

468
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:19,110
Why are you asking me about banana? So here is an example of a learning map route learning created for Chiquita Banana.

469
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,280
It kind of looks like any other made it version of a conceptual model.

470
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:37,140
So what do you see here? Yeah.

471
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,979
It's essentially like a summary of the business processes that go into like what does it

472
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:47,170
actually take to get a banana on your plate or into your grocery store and then your apartment?

473
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:55,180
So like starting out on the farm, it has to go through all the logistical transportation to the store, to the individual, to the community.

474
00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:00,280
So. And do you see problems highlighted along the way?

475
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:16,900
So those of you who are a banana today this is how your body and then got to some of these obstacles you.

476
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:28,209
To be honest. So I'm. So the you said access partnership partner with room learning,

477
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:34,660
the folks who create these sets of learning maps to create a learning map as an intervention

478
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:40,660
strategy to really empower families to address barriers that were highlighted in the focus groups.

479
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:52,540
So Rich Lichtenstein, who was a faculty member here at the School of Public Health for a very long time who really spearheaded this work.

480
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,410
One of his former students just happened to work for root learning.

481
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,310
So that's how they sort of got them on board with this partnership.

482
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:07,390
And so the goals of the learning maps for this particular issue was to really

483
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:12,760
highlight the benefits of enrolling children in insurance and health insurance,

484
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,350
really reduce fears and anxieties around working with the fear offices.

485
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:22,330
And you go through the ropes of how to actually get children enrolled into health insurance.

486
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:27,520
So one of the first things they did was have content meetings.

487
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:36,550
So learning consultants talk to key stakeholders, including community members, staff at the PR offices,

488
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:41,139
staff from local service agencies in order to get sort of this bigger picture

489
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,430
around each of the learning objectives and the sort of practical approach,

490
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:50,110
how people can sort of gather people's reactions and thoughts around enrolling

491
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:54,730
children in health insurance that could later be exemplified in the learning lots.

492
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:02,470
Then the consultants took the content back to their artist to really draw the maps, which went through an iterative process,

493
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:07,450
and versions were brought back to the Partnership Steering Committee who provided them with feedback.

494
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:12,970
So this was the first version that was used to get feedback.

495
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:25,730
So again, this is they want to sort of illustrate the process of getting your children enrolled in health insurance and what the benefits of doing.

496
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:31,010
This is the first draft. A little it's a little crazy.

497
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,550
One of the criticisms,

498
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:44,840
one of the big criticisms of this first version was that the path wasn't very clear to how kids went from uninsured to insurance.

499
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:55,490
It's not very clear to me, like, how do you kids go from being uninsured to insure this sort of math?

500
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:05,190
So then they did another iteration and got more feedback and.

501
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:12,370
So again, a little more clear than the previous one, but.

502
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:23,960
You know, some of the criticisms noted in this version was that they had the population of focus doesn't seem really represented here.

503
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:33,170
Like who who is this really speaking to? And the parents from, again, being uninsured to insured is still not clear.

504
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:38,700
And again, this is about children getting children enrolled in health insurance.

505
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:46,940
It wasn't really people wanted to see more parents with their children because children weren't going to the offices enrolling themselves.

506
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,930
They were typically going with earnings. They wanted to see them reflected.

507
01:00:54,330 --> 01:01:10,800
So then they came up with another version. And then May.

508
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:15,090
This is the final version they came up with. So what do you see here?

509
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:24,720
You know, when you think about the focus, the focus group feedback, what they started with,

510
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:29,150
the issues they identified with enrolling their children in health insurance,

511
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:37,400
trying to demonstrate to families how one gets from insured to uninsured.

512
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:54,330
What do you sort of see here? Yes, the path is a lot more clear.

513
01:01:54,330 --> 01:02:04,890
And you can also tell or obviously that there are two separate sections of what's the right way to go in terms of the original one.

514
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:13,170
Couldn't even really tell what they were intending for you to what path it was supposed to take and why it was better to do one version.

515
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:31,810
There's a pretty clear pattern here. Maybe you see here that sticks out to you in terms of yeah,

516
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:42,010
something that I think I'm seeing that's really cool is like the way that they address stigma is kind of showing that like it's not or like

517
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:48,280
needing financial assistance is not a for everything and like you're setting your child up for success by going down this better path,

518
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:56,170
which yeah, I think it's like a really subtle and nice way of addressing that specific concern.

519
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:06,670
Yeah. So I'm really trying to convey visually like this is really about your child's future and you know what the future might hold for them.

520
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:12,610
You also highlight the theme of focus here,

521
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:20,560
like one of the criticisms where they're kind of rude to us so we don't want to go there, which is a valid point.

522
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:29,980
But I think what this map in to highlighting was also their perspective a little bit not necessarily making excuses,

523
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:45,030
but trying to show them that there's a lot of challenges for this staff as well and sort of working in that situation and hopefully in life.

524
01:03:55,990 --> 01:04:01,690
So one of the things that they also did was develop dialog questions around the learning.

525
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:10,990
So part of doing this was to get them to really critically think about the characters on the map and how they sort of relate to their own situations.

526
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:15,070
So she.

527
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:21,530
So here's an example of one of the dialog cards.

528
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:28,250
So this one is really specific to a case worker.

529
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,850
I mean, this card would really ask folks how they think.

530
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:39,540
The sorts of challenges that James fellow worker faces affects his interactions with his friends and.

531
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:50,650
And again, as you can imagine, it ties the case workers frustrations back to the contacts he may be working in and gets individuals to really,

532
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:55,180
again, try to understand their perspective a little.

533
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:10,389
So they did a pilot of the learning maps with two groups from the community,

534
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:16,990
and they ended up conducting about 25 community meetings through different community based agencies,

535
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,250
engaging more than 300 people in the process total.

536
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:30,040
And they had trained facilitators from the community actually conducting these sort of dialog sessions with community members,

537
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,830
and they ended up training about 20 facilitators.

538
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:40,330
And I think this was huge because it did really develop the capacity of the community to continue having these

539
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:50,560
conversations if they were able to train up to 20 facilitators to facilitate these conversations within the community.

540
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:58,960
And they did a brief evaluation of how what people thought of the workshops and if it increased knowledge.

541
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:03,850
And again, most of the questions here are on a five point scale.

542
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:09,340
I mean, as you can see, the ratings were really high. And unfortunately,

543
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:18,700
this project didn't get to the point of doing a really large scale evaluation where they could actually look at whether people enrolled my child.

544
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:25,270
But it was an important first step to in order to really understand whether this sort of intervention

545
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:34,540
approach even just resonated with the community or even had any sort of impact on more proximal outcomes,

546
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:41,110
such as any sort of attitude, knowledge, change, or even just thinking about norms.

547
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:55,810
So any questions related to, you know, using critical consciousness to improve enrollment in health insurance.

548
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:13,860
And I want to highlight for you one sort of method to bring this to life.

549
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:21,329
We have a few sessions devoted to applied theory examples where I want to talk more with

550
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:29,040
you and show you how different theoretical concepts are actually woven into interventions.

551
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:36,180
So on Wednesday, I hope to do a little more of that with the various theories we've talked about so far in this class,

552
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,710
and then to bring in a little more community based work as well.

553
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:51,970
Q Any questions or on anything we covered today? Okay.

554
01:07:52,060 --> 01:08:08,250
I'll see you Wednesday then. The downside.

555
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:11,670
Granted that I'm going to walk for, like three miles back to.

556
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:28,420
50. I don't know.

557
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:39,680
Oh, what do you mean?

558
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:52,570
Well, I know that the tail section is discounted.

559
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:01,490
Yeah, it's like thing to do on the.

560
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:10,260
Come on. Yeah.

561
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:37,200
It's kind of like behind closed doors.

562
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:46,620
That takes a lot of energy to deal with.

563
01:09:47,840 --> 01:10:07,380
Today, it's not only 29, a certain amount of money.

564
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:17,730
Now you can just say into it here that lead after.

565
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:34,940
But like I said, I can see that I was talking about it.

566
01:10:35,580 --> 01:11:05,130
I can show you what it was like you want to like here the next year on the South Side, which is all about national parks.

567
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:25,530
I was like I was like, they already know that, you know, you want to do something stupid.

568
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:34,440
I already have discussions, like, really?

569
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:45,260
Not that at least in my mind, I thought profit from my friends is here.

570
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:52,200
Hey, listen, let's get together. What are you doing?

571
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:59,760
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

572
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:14,010
I mean, this is. This is what I like to hear about.

573
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:20,850
I think at least one. And I'm not sure I want to keep persevering, you know?

574
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:29,980
So that's great.

575
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,930
But that's all that I knew.

576
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:39,770
I wanted to know. I didn't know that. That's why people are so little.

577
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:46,229
Yeah, I, I am two skills in our favor.

578
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:55,709
So maybe 3 to 5 years, it's not good. And then I'm like, Oh, my God, this is these are supposed to work by hand.

579
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,850
Jim are they're doing work? No. Well, he wasn't doing work.

580
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,870
As I said,

581
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:11,410
I think we should order make sure my mother when it comes to the moderator this for used to I've never been over because it turned to a person.

582
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:17,160
She looks at me a ton of money in Texas. Oh, sorry. Would you think I'd go there?

583
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:24,719
And she said, let's putting this point across like the better south side and don't it doesn't make a difference that you have.

584
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,610
You all need to know about it, I think. Did she go to high school?

585
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:38,480
No. Oh, she lives in Virginia. Doesn't even lose those strange hate events which get this long issues such as I should like.

586
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:41,910
Just leave it be like nobody will hear people who don't like.

587
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:54,260
It's about you know yeah these people that I have problem I mean was I reading areas of the you know,

588
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:58,080
that's what the second paragraph perceived should be mostly like.

589
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:06,300
So my sister actually went to see, okay, but like so just people from my high school.

590
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,080
I mean, you know,

591
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:17,020
there's a lot of states like this looks neater like anything that you've anything that but I feel it's the same thing like they're putting.

592
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:25,160
I could screen sperm and have it. I can just like. Yeah, it's just flip on and I think it's healthy.

593
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:31,180
So I think it's a really good idea that makes that takes on stuff inside of us.

594
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:38,420
Like, Oh, God, I thought, yes, I would tie pants.

595
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,810
I mean, I don't feel it's good to have friends who aren't there.

596
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:47,450
I think you very much. Yeah. I just think it's funny because I worked in a Catholic school at the club.

597
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:54,350
We just did a good job too.

598
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:06,710
So she basically just said she's like certain culture, so it's good to see the areas that I guess I can understand.

599
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,129
But it can like me too, because it's a barrier.

600
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:19,640
But when you're talking about barrier, you can't see I which studying and stuff like that study for building societies.

601
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:26,520
Those would be like the closet where it would be like like a turkey. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:31,240
You go to that and I keep on I don't know if I'm going in person. I think it is.

603
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:37,340
Yeah. Earthquakes a lot to be you know from what it sounds like it's optional.

604
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:45,060
But like if we don't do anything because it's not training or something, I would think they would give the guy, I'm Michael Joiner.

605
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:52,010
You think he works at University of Minnesota. He is the guy who authored the paper as fast as possible.

606
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:55,640
He could run a marathon and it's like a super interesting.

607
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:59,120
It's like you have to. Yeah, okay. But interesting.

608
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:02,899
I wonder if [INAUDIBLE] get mentioned. Yeah, it's Nike.

609
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:14,260
So yeah, it would have to be a few things and then don't remember, we don't have classes 30 tomorrow and he says,

610
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:23,360
okay, I know I is it because let's be good for it I know it's all well, it's like today.

611
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,520
It's kind of better that way. Yeah. No, it's an unanticipated surprise.

612
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:44,280
It was a concept and a place where it became so.

613
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:49,620
You know, I made a couple, but still, it's just like.

614
01:16:52,050 --> 01:17:16,430
On the record. We don't have a breakdown if that's going to come out there to read the head of state and intervention areas.

615
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:25,980
So, you know, just literature like this one's actually interesting obviously from existing models really because of this fire drill.

616
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:33,330
So they're like actually finish like, oh my God, this is intense, right?

617
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:38,370
Can we have some points back? Right. That's what I think. I think that's probably I'm sure they probably agree to that.

618
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:46,350
But like, I'm nervous because I guess more because it's like 45% of the grade.

619
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:54,580
Yeah. I mean, are you thinking my since I am actually I'm still I'm not sure if you saw some

620
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:02,060
factors like this for studying self which is thing like project social community.

621
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,060
Yeah. Like a social group. That sounds good.

622
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:12,560
I like that idea. Should we make, like, a century or.

623
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:27,740
Mine was a lot more of it was just going along with this. I made it very broad because you go such, she said.

624
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:33,650
The population that we had wasn't like it was too narrow or something like that.

625
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:41,420
She made a comment on the population. Yeah, she grew so much through trawled, I think she thought.

626
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:48,450
I don't know. I was kind of confused by her feedback. I think she the only thing I remember her saying is that we like.

627
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:55,060
I think she got confused because we mentioned. A specific population.

628
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:59,050
And then like afterwards there was like more broad discussion.

629
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:10,440
So I think she just kind of got confused with that. They are the Tier two and Tier two.

630
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:19,230
Should we make another? Yeah.

631
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:27,880
I'll be back. I'm sorry just to give you guys a rundown of instances, because I know it's broad.

632
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:34,330
So like the structural, the trilateral, that's just things like gender, race and like stuff like that.

633
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:38,710
You can like you can define a little bit more when we have the full product, just not to make it simple.

634
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:46,210
And then like if we're going to look at like for example, you want to focus on non-Hispanic African-American population,

635
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,660
the best literature you're going to find for obesity is physical activity.

636
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,150
So like those communities that are most disadvantaged.

637
01:19:55,870 --> 01:20:00,520
So like there's like a direct correlation between physical activity and then increased or decreased.

638
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:05,320
Obesity prevalence among all the stuff associated with.

639
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,970
And then you can have like your own interventions and things like that. Tied to it.

640
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:14,500
But this was just like based on, like, simple literature.

641
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:27,350
I'm gonna make another PowerPoint so we can all. Remember do.

642
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:34,290
I'm uninsured. So we're on the same page, I think. Mm hmm.

643
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:38,040
Did you feel confused making the motto? I just feel.

644
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:44,159
I looked through all the slides to should how to make a conceptual model.

645
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,350
But I think. After reading all the literatures.

646
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:53,640
Actually, I don't know how to like narrow our constructs in to make a specific model.

647
01:20:53,820 --> 01:21:00,180
I mean, she said in class, but like the model that she made for her dissertation literally took her like four years.

648
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:04,610
So like I said, like 2020 something drives or whatever.

649
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:09,230
So I don't think she was expecting us to be like freakin CDC level work.

650
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:16,010
I like your idea about doing, like, individual and then, like, interpersonal and like, larger.

651
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:23,100
Factors. Should we make that like, like three horizontal strips, maybe?

652
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:31,680
I think it works like three parts. And your part is more like a social economics, like a bigger parts.

653
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:38,550
And I can see some this thing about the children's self and the parents history part where rich.

654
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:43,390
We would like ask that, like family.

655
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:49,100
So I feel like the interpersonal or not interpersonal like.

656
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:55,509
It's like with this population group that he wants to for like the issue he wants to focus on the issue that I want to focus,

657
01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:00,610
I feel like they can just branch off the same box and then you can kind of go a little bit more in detail.

658
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:06,070
So like, for example, like you can start it off at the structural deterrent because that would be an antecedent.

659
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:14,110
Right. And then his can branch off on the top or on the bottom as a matter and then like something else can branch up on like,

660
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:20,889
like you said, one, two, three. So like, like you see, all this is kind of breaking up like one on top, one on the bottom,

661
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:25,510
and you can do one in the middle, something like the others keep branching it off even more and more.

662
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:30,270
So have like a steerage being like perfect in front of all that.

663
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:38,530
That would be like. I feel like as the alleges too, I feel like we should like have it to where it's like everything.

664
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:45,400
Right. So like, I see us as important, but also race also gender looks like.

665
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,320
Like I'm. I'm confused. Like what?

666
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:55,650
Like what level does that operate on if we're taking, like, social, ecological model approach, which we don't have to.

667
01:22:55,660 --> 01:23:00,299
But I like that idea. I figure in.

668
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:04,500
Wouldn't it impact all the levels of the socially socially ecological model?

669
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:14,100
Don't know. Like I feel like your policy impacts as you age, but it's like.

670
01:23:16,590 --> 01:23:22,230
Like a motility of like like it is like interpersonal or individual characteristics.

671
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:32,250
So we don't have to complicate this either. Yeah, I just don't know where to start.

672
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:39,910
I mean, let's look at what? Look. Look at the problem. And then look at the end goal frame.

673
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:48,010
Like our problem is in the United States, obesity is a huge problem, has been for three decades, has been trending upwards.

674
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:53,320
And the goal of this model is we want to find ways to reduce that issue.

675
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:57,220
Right. So that that's the beginning of the end. And then kind of how how does the stuff in the middle.

676
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:02,230
Allow us to explain what we're trying to do from an intervention standpoint.

677
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:09,069
So I feel like you look at the main indicators that are causing this problem,

678
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:16,090
that if you were to directly affect or try to reduce those problems right away, the prevalence of the issue is going to go down.

679
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:24,160
So it's not like look at things that are like broad problems that can affect the larger scope of the issue, I think.

680
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:29,570
It makes sense. Yeah.

681
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:38,930
I'm just thinking about like where to start in terms of like merging like the two drafts you guys came up with and then we got to start over.

682
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,469
I mean, like, he has his and I have mine. We like we did the research.

683
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:48,290
We can kind of find ways to overlap them and sort of combining do we wanna all work in.

684
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:55,090
Like I just made this thing that we could work in. Model draft in our folder.

685
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,410
Yeah, I like those lines. We can put something in.
