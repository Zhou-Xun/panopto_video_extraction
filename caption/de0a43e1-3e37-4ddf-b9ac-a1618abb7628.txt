2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,948
Moving beyond the idea of energy balance,

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:13,570
another way to think about the causes of
obesity is to use a socioecological model.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,870
Just briefly, the socioecological model
places the individual in the middle

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,420
of the several contacts in
which they live their lives.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,110
So for our first ring we can think
about an individuals' characteristics,

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,370
their gender, how much they eat,
how active they are,

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,475
all those things as we talked about
influences an individuals' weight.

9
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:35,405
We can then think outside
the individual level

10
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:38,155
to the social influences on individuals.

11
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:42,465
So for children we think about parenting,
we think about peers for both children and

12
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:45,205
adults, we think about coworkers.

13
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:48,855
What in the person's social
environment influences

14
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:53,030
that next inner layer of what they eat and
how active they are.

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,200
Outside from the social level, we can
think about community, demographic, and

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,415
other societal characteristics that
influence an individual's eating,

17
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,090
and activity, and ultimately, weight.

18
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,060
So we can think about neighborhoods, we
can think about policies around food and

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,860
around activity and our work places.

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,020
All of those influence
ultimately in individuals,

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,520
energy balance and
their likelihood of becoming obese.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,070
The socioecological model also
provides a wonderful framework for

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,770
thinking about public health
interventions to address obesity.

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,230
Ideally, we are building public health
interventions that affect every level of

25
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,010
the socioecological model.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,240
So we're helping individuals
with their nutrition knowledge,

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,850
their self efficacy around healthy eating,
they're ability to exercise, and

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,360
that will positively influence
their weight status.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,420
We can also think about intervention
with the family or the peer level.

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,063
Working with parents to help them
provide healthier food environments for

31
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:52,940
their children.

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,551
And then we can think about potential
interventions on the societal level,

33
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,710
the policy level.

34
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,290
What can we do in our states, and
our federal government that helps make

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,704
making easier choices the easier choice,
so people can achieve a healthy weight?
