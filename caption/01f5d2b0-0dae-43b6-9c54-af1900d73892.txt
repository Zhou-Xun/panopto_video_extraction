1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:32,250
So what I wanted to do is talk a little bit about denominators and displaying data and thinking about data.

2
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,920
And this is important for two reasons.

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,900
I don't know, work and travel. And that's the wrong thing.

4
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,089
I did the wrong thing. That's really great. Hold on me.

5
00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:05,610
But it's really important because. Both for you interpreting what you see and then for you displaying your own data.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:18,420
It's really important. And so your choices are the phenomenon that I'm sure you, as I can understand it, perfect sense to make a stupid mistake.

7
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,290
Um. Is. Uh. Uh.

8
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,620
That you can imagine. So there's lots of ways you can do denominators.

9
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,130
So you've heard about person time, right?

10
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,460
Or people. So what's the difference between doing those and why would you do one rather than the other?

11
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:04,150
Know, I think about that. Anybody thinks about that.

12
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,190
So why would you want to do just people if you're nominated and why would you want that person time?

13
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:27,310
I know this is digging deep right into into back to Intrepid.

14
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:37,410
So what is person time? What is person time?

15
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm sitting. Yeah.

16
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,710
It's like the total amount of time each participant spends for their study period.

17
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,590
So can you can you give a good example?

18
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:10,250
So I guess, like you have like woman groups, there may be a person that spend three days in the unit and then another business gets a day.

19
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:17,930
So that's like four days of person. So why would you do that?

20
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:27,920
Because of things like party, like there may be a bunch of people going in and having to cast their ways and then if they get it,

21
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:36,320
they may have only a few people will do well.

22
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,610
So why in general do we want to do person time?

23
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:53,510
Do you think about that? I mean, what what's the difference in. So think about it this way.

24
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:08,240
So what's an incidence? What's incidence? What's the definition of incidents?

25
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,720
Look it up, remember? This is very important. What's incidence? So what's prevalence?

26
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,660
Yeah. Majority of people have the disease in American population.

27
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,790
And when? Whenever you like.

28
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,120
At the moment you're taking right now. Yeah. So that would be point prevalence.

29
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,469
Yeah. Good, Jordan. Okay. Or over time period, everybody over the time period.

30
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,390
Right. But what's the difference between incidence and prevalence, though, or in prevalence?

31
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,310
Do you care when they got the disease? Uh, no.

32
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,400
No. What about an incidence? Yes.

33
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,530
The number of new cases over a period of time. I'm sorry, but the number of new cases over a period.

34
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:21,900
So what's different about what you said? Because Jordan said that he felt like one specific point of time, more of a period.

35
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,870
Well, what's different? You said something that was different when he said it was different cases.

36
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,010
New cases. Instead, it is number of new cases.

37
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,410
That's the difference. So then there's two types of incidents. There's the incident, right?

38
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,770
Right. And then there's cumulative injury incidence, which is a probability.

39
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,930
This is ringing a bell. Okay, so which one is person time?

40
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:03,190
Is it a rape? Or is it a probability? I mean, it's a rape.

41
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,940
How come that was what makes it a rape?

42
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:15,070
You're absolutely right. Why is it a rape? Because it's like the number of new cases over time.

43
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,700
Like it's. I don't know, words. I'm sorry.

44
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,220
Oh, okay. So, like, five miles per hour is a rate, right?

45
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,140
So if we have person time, it's like number of cases per day.

46
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,010
Right. Or when we say that over time.

47
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,100
Miles per hour is time, there's a time limit. So it's not the number of cases out of people.

48
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,400
It's the number of cases of people per some unit of time.

49
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,150
And that period of time is a person day.

50
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay, so why would you want to do a rape?

51
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,320
What's the difference between a rape and a probability in terms of interpretation?

52
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,949
Yet German culpability will only tell you like the chances of that happening

53
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,960
or the rate of your life as it's happening right now in your a possibility.

54
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,690
Yeah sort of like that.

55
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:24,020
So probability is, you know, over some time, the probability would also we say like the probability that someone's get over five years, over a year.

56
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,950
Right. You don't know when when it's happening.

57
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,520
You just. So there's 100% probability that everybody in this room is going to be dead in 100 years.

58
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,170
Right. But how fast we're going to die, you know?

59
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,380
What's the rate of mortality in this classroom over the next year?

60
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,820
It's probably very close to zero and hopefully zero. Okay.

61
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,430
So they give you different pieces of information.

62
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:07,480
Now, the advantage also is if I want to do a probability, how long do I have, how much information I need to have on everybody?

63
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:18,790
If I want to know the probability that people in this room got a haircut over the next year,

64
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:26,680
how long do I have to follow everyone to make sure that I know that information here and here?

65
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,870
Right. You can only do a probability if you have complete information.

66
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,560
So. But if I have partial information, can I calculate a route?

67
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,720
Annaliese. Monica, what about anybody else? Yeah.

68
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,150
Okay. How come? Why is that so?

69
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,880
Like I calculated or even if I had personal information.

70
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,300
One if.

71
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:28,790
How come? It's like a snapshot of the current moment.

72
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,140
Well, it is only a snapshot of the moment because you were to rate its first shoot in time.

73
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:38,780
Right. But how do you calculate it? How do you calculate it?

74
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:54,139
So like, if I wanted to calculate, you know, like thinking to the party example, I, I'm looking at the time at risk, right?

75
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,800
So I how many, what's the denominator for each person.

76
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:09,230
So if I have one person and they, they got a catheter five days ago and they had a carry on day three,

77
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,710
of course, there's no working pants, so you kind of get in your head.

78
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,980
Oh, maybe they're. So.

79
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,360
Person one I have a person. One, two, three, four.

80
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:33,340
And this is. This is the case with a catheter, right?

81
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,120
And this is the party. All right.

82
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,240
So let's say they had it for five days and they had a party on day three.

83
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,470
This one, they had ten. And they don't have any.

84
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,590
They haven't had one here, seven. And they got it on day seven.

85
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,860
And this one, they've had to at zero.

86
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,059
Okay. So what's my denominator here? How do I figure out what?

87
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,220
The nominators. Yeah, I'm just.

88
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,720
Just adding about the days of the chapters.

89
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,440
So is that going to work for all of them?

90
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,580
So what's the thing about instruments? What do you have to have?

91
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,460
Yeah. Emily isn't supposed to be person time at risk.

92
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,380
So, like, once they get the event or one thing that happens, then they're no longer at risk of the event.

93
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Absolutely. So I can't just add these up because this person got to carry on day three.

94
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:47,020
So how many days did they have at risk? Well, two, depending on how you think about it.

95
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,639
Right. The risk for two. And then, you know, you could say, well, on day three, they got it.

96
00:11:51,640 --> 00:12:00,459
So they're no longer at risk. All right. So here's the this is David Cassidy, but this is the dangerous and choose events 12 to 19.

97
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,480
That's 21. Right. But I'm making it up on the fly.

98
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,120
And what's the numerator too, right?

99
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,330
Yeah. So it doesn't just. There's two. Right.

100
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,809
So this would rate would be two, the 21.

101
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:24,730
And, and so it's approximately, you know, like one out of ten.

102
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,160
Right. So, you know, point one per person.

103
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,310
Three. Right. Okay.

104
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,470
So this tells me how fast that it's different piece of information.

105
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,940
It's not the cumulative probability. Does that make sense?

106
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,660
Yeah. Where'd you get the eight? From my patient when I was five.

107
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:02,569
Oh, I just crossed it out, cause that's not that these days with a catheter.

108
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,690
But this is. This was to say this was the number of days at risk.

109
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,130
Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.

110
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,590
So, so displaying the data matters.

111
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,850
Now, there's other ways we can display the data, too. But we'll talk about that in a minute.

112
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,920
So I want this was an assigned reading, but it's very relevant.

113
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,570
I'm sure you all at least glanced at it, but it was a couple of weeks ago, so.

114
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:44,470
First of all. Really look at these two graphs.

115
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:53,650
And you can keep in mind that the duration of Castro this was just to remind me this was an intervention study.

116
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,730
They had multiple nursing units and they had a bundle of interventions.

117
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,320
Okay. Is everybody familiar with the term bundle, which means that they use multiple things at a time as an intervention?

118
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,150
As a scientist, it's a really bad idea because then you can't separate things out.

119
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,410
Now, most of you work in a lab and you know, if you trying to decode what happened with an experiment,

120
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,120
if you change multiple things, then you still don't know what was the problem.

121
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:34,660
Right. So you want to try each thing separately to make sure you can narrow it down to to what is the problem.

122
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,870
But in hospital app analogy, it's pretty typical to do a bundle.

123
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:48,670
Like you look at the literature and see what everybody's doing and try to pick the best ones and put it together.

124
00:14:49,480 --> 00:15:00,140
And so, for example, Clostridium well, plus Coolio is using classical video values instead.

125
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:07,390
Q So C diff, when it first became a real problem, there were interventions in the U.K.

126
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,100
They went for the physicians, couldn't work guys shirt sleeves because of the spores.

127
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:26,680
Right. And that was part of their magic of shutting down C diff along with hand hygiene and in cleaning and cohorting a lot of things.

128
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,200
And I mentioned this to one of the hospitals here and they said, that's ridiculous.

129
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,659
We don't do that. It's like, okay. So then it was part of the magic.

130
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,770
Now maybe it just increased everybody's thoughts about it.

131
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,670
But. But you don't know, really. It mattered one way or another.

132
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,770
The rates went down until the last two years or so.

133
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,210
So here they had a bundle and over the time they compared to time.

134
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:06,130
So time period one was, you know, before and then time two was after the intervention.

135
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,249
And over the time period, the duration of catheterization declined.

136
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:24,129
You can see at the bottom about 3%. But the number of meters per catheters patients did not significantly change and the overall

137
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:33,730
infection rates decreased by 18% when measured by infections per 10,000 patient days.

138
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:42,760
So this is the same data on the right and well on your left, that's catheters.

139
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:49,420
And this is per patient day. So I want you to take a minute to talk to me about what is going on here.

140
00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:04,230
And how could this have happened? Please talk to each other.

141
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,820
This is nothing that's not exam or anything. What do you think?

142
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:45,870
You can help that. It doesn't have to be. It's a different scale, so it changes the slope.

143
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,920
Okay, so what do we got? So what is this graph?

144
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,270
Okay. So so let's compare the graph. Is there any difference in the x axis?

145
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,040
No, the x axis are exactly the same. What is the x axis?

146
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,820
Right. So that in full is a type of catheter.

147
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,750
Okay. So each that is a different unit.

148
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,450
What are the differences in the colors of the dots or shapes the dots?

149
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,630
What are they like before and after intervention and show?

150
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,780
Yes, before and after catheter intervention. So time lines before and time to.

151
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,860
That's the time one is is the little diamond. Okay.

152
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,440
So that's what the doctor. What about the y axis?

153
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:07,940
What does the y axis? What's different between those Y-axis?

154
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,410
It's very divisive and I want to put things right.

155
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,470
Okay. Excellent. So once per device day and once per patient day.

156
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:32,140
Okay. So what seems to be going on in this one, which is per device day, right.

157
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:52,870
What are you supposed to take from this graph? What is the what is the author trying to show you?

158
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:05,210
Yeah. Jordan right. In this case with the first one there isn't it doesn't seem to be much changed because of the intervention.

159
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,390
So the one thing is the intervention. What what is what is what is this line showing?

160
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,209
What is it? What is it showing? Just the bottom line or the top line.

161
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,840
It doesn't matter. But tell me, what what is that line actually showing you?

162
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,520
Yeah. If you increase following usage, your utilized for holidays doesn't really change.

163
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:42,620
Yeah. It's almost flat. Right. Right. So in time one that despite pretty big increases in Foley rates, this is very low.

164
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,800
Right. The other thing. What's this article telling you?

165
00:20:49,760 --> 00:21:00,590
What isn't was me to point out to was I mean it doesn't like I mean yeah, I mean there's no correlation.

166
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:08,100
Right. So this is a measure of correlation, right? If it's perfect correlation, what's the big one?

167
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,590
Okay. Right. Okay, good. So what happened in time to.

168
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,980
Do the slopes of those lines look the same? No.

169
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,709
But also the R-squared value is still really, really small. Yeah, they're terrible.

170
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,900
Right? So this is the filter. The data isn't very good.

171
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:47,290
Yeah, but. But it does look like somehow that, you know, increased folli follie used pay actually slightly.

172
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,480
But you know, this, there's nothing going on here statistically, so you can't go a trend.

173
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,070
Okay, tell me about this graph. Anybody?

174
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:18,900
What are the lines showing us here? So there's a positive correlation between phone usage and education.

175
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:26,149
Right. And so square is really nice, right?

176
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,020
2.7. That's very nice. So it fits the data really very well.

177
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:55,980
And what happened between time and time to. It looks like type two might have increased the rate a little tiny bit, but probably not significant.

178
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,410
So this is important to remember what this graph is measuring, right?

179
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,600
It's telling us how there's a change in infections and falling usage.

180
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,300
Oh, okay. That's the thing to remember. Now, this is kind of a summary.

181
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:22,390
So, again, this is change in this location for 40 days and change in full usage.

182
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,510
That's what this is measuring. This isn't measuring the effectiveness that way other than comparing what happened with it.

183
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,550
Okay. So it's the line shift.

184
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,710
In fact, it goes up. What does it tell you?

185
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:52,840
What does it suggest happened here? How could this have happened now?

186
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,969
Like there was a bundle and they did a lot of different things in this bundle in terms of increased hygiene.

187
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,570
And they tried to reduce catheter duration with another one or just not use catheters unless they needed.

188
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,730
So how does that give you information about what happened here?

189
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:29,560
So I think maybe that was because it portfolios seems like that like 30% and used to be at a lower rate and now he was higher.

190
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:38,980
So that's like at a higher rate. And how could that happen? Wasn't a good intervention.

191
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:51,610
I don't know if you have any ideas. So if the intervention was to reduce catheter use altogether, or are you going to reduce it in?

192
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,510
Yes. Only people who have evidence of religion.

193
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,419
I'm sure if you read the questioning in Washington,

194
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:13,020
D.C. and the thing is that if you have an intervention and part of the intervention is just to reduce catheter use overall,

195
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,150
who are the people you're going to reduce it in?

196
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,679
Only the people who have catheters in well, not the people who already have catheters in, but the choice of who to put a catheter in.

197
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,459
Right. So, I mean, we know that people would remember the catheter lecture.

198
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,930
And then there's a lot of different reasons about why you might want to put a catheter in.

199
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,430
And some of it's just monitoring and effectively functions as a physician.

200
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,799
Right. So there are a lot of reasons that you that a physician might want to have the catheter in,

201
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,670
but maybe it's not medically necessary just because they might want to know.

202
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,990
Or if someone discovered that the risks are very low, you can wait and put the catheter in if you really have a problem.

203
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:04,350
So those people are probably at the lowest risk anyway because those are the ones you're going to take the least chance with, right.

204
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,220
You don't you don't want to put a patient at risk. If you really need a catheter, you're not going to say, oh, I'm not going to do it right.

205
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:16,830
You might try to take it out sooner, but you could just not use catheters altogether.

206
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,980
For some people. So who is left?

207
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:31,180
Are the people who are probably have more co-morbidities or other things going on which might put them at high risk of a UPI?

208
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:42,610
So what happened to your denominator? Sure, it's small, but the people at highest risk still are getting them.

209
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,170
So then what happens, Shira? They go up.

210
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:59,320
They go up. Okay. So so it looks like here that things got worse, right?

211
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:13,479
They got worse with the intervention because it didn't take into account that that people actually were using catheters less,

212
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,020
which they were supposed to. But it increased the rate.

213
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,790
It artificially inflated what you saw because the denominator got smaller.

214
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:31,750
Okay. So and here is a different graph.

215
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,670
And here this is just mapping by change in phone usage.

216
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,830
Here's the change in full usage here.

217
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:58,530
And this is a change in infections per patient day. And then it's the same thing in terms of the and this is per this is device day.

218
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:18,120
So in fact, here it looks like when the change in infections goes down when you look at the change in full usage rates.

219
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:30,700
And here it really goes down when you have a negative change.

220
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,549
So denominators matter. This is this was also in the paper.

221
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,330
It just shows that they're there. They were really worried that there was something funny.

222
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,960
But this table just showed that, in fact, the same thing happened.

223
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,170
So I just want to summarize using something that I hope you remember.

224
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,030
What is this? What do we call this?

225
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,070
A dag. Right. How do I. How am I supposed to read this?

226
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:15,800
You really want to interpret this one for me? So this tells you how it could have happened.

227
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,090
Sure. What's going on?

228
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:27,620
Oh, um, I don't know how to interpret it, but you can look at per patient characteristics and infection prevention practices, right?

229
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:35,990
As confounders impact this relationship and device use as your exposure to the infection, as your outcome.

230
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,820
So you have the infection practices actually lead to device use.

231
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,900
So the device use becomes the intermediary between.

232
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:54,110
And so if you control for device use, then you can get confounding just like you said.

233
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:04,090
Okay. So there's still a direct effect on devices which hit infection because it was a bundle, too.

234
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:10,240
But because part of this was to reduce device use altogether.

235
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:28,990
Questions on this. So when you think about this being your data, which you are going to have for hand hygiene, the key thing here is to look at this,

236
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:36,610
think about your dad is what you're trying to show and how you want to display your data and make sure it's not confounders or in this case,

237
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:42,819
an alternative would be to you could look at patient characteristics and show a different way of

238
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,010
patient characteristics affected this like you might stratify by the way that we do for confounders.

239
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:57,130
So it may be that it's important not to look just at hand hygiene in your unit, but to look by different people.

240
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:04,640
Right. Now you're not going to have an hundred days.

241
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,270
You have two days. Observation assignment. Okay. So any questions on this?

242
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,960
This is just sort of a summary.

243
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:26,240
So the device captures time at risk of infection due to the device and determination of the outcome requires knowing the timing of infection.

244
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,350
And this is perfectly appropriate for evaluating a correction intervention when the device is already in place.

245
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:40,850
But if the intervention is directed at removing the device, you're going to get the kind of confounding that we just talked about.

246
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:52,300
And Patient Days captures time at risk at the hospital, an infection rate of infection just generally.

247
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,930
Right. So it's it's like the SARS, right.

248
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:05,389
Uses like patient days at risk, but not for everything.

249
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:11,209
It's a little bit like we're because you can't the risk of a catheter infection if you don't have a catheter.

250
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:19,190
And so it makes this complicated. But if the reason that you're getting a catheter is somehow associated with it,

251
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,740
then you might want to again look at confounding to compare across hospitals.

252
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,740
So if you have a cardiovascular center where probably everybody gets hurt,

253
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,689
you don't want to be comparing to someone to another unit where that's not the case.

254
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:44,989
So that's why you look in my unit. Okay. So patient days or as you broadly compare for infection control practices,

255
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,510
but you have to take into account the potential for confounding questions on this.

256
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,200
All right. Thank you.

257
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,100
Sorry for the confusion of the time, you know. It's okay. I'm sorry.

258
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,960
No, no, no. Are you. Are you ready? Yes, I have your.

259
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:15,290
I have your. Your your updated slides right here.

260
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:29,640
And. So would you like to ask why can't you just you know, I should have gotten tired of it, you know?

261
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,430
You know, you take equal time.

262
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,760
I was gonna do this at the end. Yeah. So I'm fine now, so.

263
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,880
Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, um, what time is it now?

264
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,530
930. 930. So, yeah, so you can take an hour or so.

265
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,760
Okay. It shouldn't. It shouldn't be okay. Yeah, I.

266
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:57,310
That's fine. So you want to just introduce yourself and tell them about infection prevention and.

267
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,599
Oh, okay. So.

268
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,970
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I, I'm one of the infection prevention s.

269
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,850
I am probably on the newer end of infection prevention.

270
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,280
The infection prevention is in our department. I've been a target for six years now.

271
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,929
I started off as a hand hygiene data coordinator. So all the data that you're collecting that I was responsible for creating,

272
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:29,620
all the graphs we used to do it by hand or like manually in Power Point in Excel and then send it out to the units.

273
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,320
But now we have Tableau, which makes it so it's automatic as soon as the data gets entered and refreshed,

274
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,660
as I did that for a couple of years, and then I kind of took on some more analysts to work on.

275
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:50,410
Okay. And then I, I asked my director if I could become an infection prevention est job opening.

276
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:59,830
Oh had opened and then I applied and I think I became infection prevention s and one of the areas I first took over was the dialysis units.

277
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,850
We have to we have an adult dialysis and a dialysis unit.

278
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:10,150
We they are on there in the hospital on main campus.

279
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:18,399
There are some off site ambulatory locations, but a mission aside, it does like a partnership with Fresenius.

280
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,910
And so I don't like look over those units,

281
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:29,920
but if they do have questions that sometimes they'll reach out and then I'll answer any questions that they have their dialysis facilities off site.

282
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:40,140
I do cover other areas, mostly ambulatory care like West Ann Arbor, Livonia, and then some other areas like Brighton.

283
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:46,599
And then I only have I have three general inpatient adult units, so you're going to be observing.

284
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,650
And so I have three of those and that's in U.S.

285
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:58,450
Okay. Yeah, I oh, I just have to scroll to have to scroll or you going to do that?

286
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:06,580
Okay. So in my lecture on the dialysis, I mostly we'll focus on outpatients and we're going to go over dialysis,

287
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:15,580
what it is dialysis infections in the U.S. based on data that's available through NHS and what can we do to prevent dialysis infections?

288
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,810
How do we conduct our surveillance? What do we look for for dialysis events?

289
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,280
It's not just cause of blood cultures. There's other criteria as part of that.

290
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:28,800
And then the surveillance with and then we'll go over.

291
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:33,820
I'll look at you'll see what kind of data that I present to the units on a monthly basis.

292
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:51,020
And we'll do a few exercises. Dialysis of dialysis is the removal waste products like urea and nitrogen, potassium are extra fluid.

293
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:59,340
So a lot of patients that are on dialysis, they're not going to urinate as much as a normal person does with regular kidney function.

294
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,889
So they have to go to dialysis constantly, 2 to 3 times a week, usually about 3 hours,

295
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:10,110
depending on their level of kidney function and their that is how their extra fluid is taken out.

296
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:20,009
And then the machines are doing the work of the kidneys and then people can have either acute kidney injury

297
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:26,760
so that there's possibly a chance of recovering their kidney function or they have chronic kidney disease.

298
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,380
And there's varying levels of that.

299
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:35,190
So that's what kind of determines how long they have to receive dialysis at each treatment and how many times per week.

300
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,070
So this is a picture of a tunneled catheter.

301
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,200
This is what I mostly see. Among the patients I do surveillance on.

302
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,550
And then on the right is a picture of a typical dialysis machine.

303
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,940
Hey, there's also peritoneal dialysis.

304
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:09,770
Peritoneal dialysis can be done at home, but this requires patients to be able to understand how do they connect their peritoneal dialysis catheter,

305
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,110
which comes in a part of their abdomen, usually at the lower right of their abdomen.

306
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:19,490
And then because when they're at home, they're going to have to connect to a machine every night.

307
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:26,270
And then there's a dialysis dialysis solution that goes into their abdominal cavity.

308
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,659
And then while they're sleeping, it's doing the work it's supposed to.

309
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:34,220
And then in the morning, they have to connect another empty bag and then empty out the fluid.

310
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:42,020
So we do I don't see any adults in the university hospital that are receiving PD.

311
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:50,809
We don't train adults on it here, but we do train kids and then their parents because it actually works a lot well or a lot

312
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,160
better for children because they don't have to come into the hospital 2 to 3 times a week.

313
00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:00,950
They can do this at home and then their parents are able to be trained and can do all the

314
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:06,229
connections and disconnections and the kids just get while they're sleeping and they don't have to.

315
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,360
They can go to school and not have been out of school three times a week.

316
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,460
Oh, okay. So there's continuous renal replacement therapy.

317
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:23,899
This is more for patients that are going to be in the ICU because they're not able they're not stable enough

318
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:30,530
to handle the the different blood pressures that someone that's on a dialysis machine would go through,

319
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:37,190
that they would. They're also at a high risk for eclampsia in the ICU.

320
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:44,899
It's just like like any other patient that's on dialysis, like you're accessing their bloodstream whenever they're doing dialysis.

321
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,080
So there's a risk with getting an infection.

322
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:55,160
But for my surveillance, I do I do not look at patients that are inpatient and then they're on CRT.

323
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:13,730
Dialysis events and infection risks. Approximately 468,000 Americans are on dialysis of 75,000 of those patients receive dialysis

324
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:18,260
through a central line or like a tunnel catheter that we saw earlier in the presentation.

325
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:25,280
And the CDC estimates 37,000 centralized abortion infections have occurred.

326
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,470
In 2008. I know that that data is very old at this point.

327
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:37,130
It's the data that's most recently available from an HSA or the CDC.

328
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,030
Okay. Wire dialysis patients at risk for infection.

329
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,400
They're at risk because of multiple factors.

330
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:54,110
It's the frequent access of their catheters, inserting needles and accessing the bloodstream.

331
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,730
A lot of these patients have weakened immune systems, too. They have co-morbidities.

332
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:07,940
They also could have like diabetes or immunosuppression. And then they also have immune dysfunction from urania.

333
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,850
And then they're also at risk for frequent hospital stays and surgeries if they

334
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:18,589
have to get their catheters exchanged more often because their access becomes,

335
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:26,350
um, their access could become clouded. And then if they already have other comorbidities, they might be in the hospital more often.

336
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:33,590
And then also, if a patient who is like a Pedes, a kid, if they don't understand how to care for their lines.

337
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,170
We've had patients where they're opening the caps and they're like their blood.

338
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,750
They can they know how to unclench their lines sticks.

339
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,969
So when the blood comes out of their catheters at home or they'll suck on the ends of the catheter,

340
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:54,950
so then they're getting their saliva all over the catheter that could lead to an infection to oh,

341
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:02,810
and that infection, so that they can also they're at risk for getting hepatitis B and C.

342
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,760
So it's really important that whatever dialysis machines are cleaned and between patients,

343
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,950
that they go through the proper disinfection and then also the surfaces in the

344
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:18,229
areas where they're receiving dialysis can have be contaminated with blood,

345
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:25,900
but it's not seen. And so you could still transfer hepatitis B and C, so it's really good that they're disinfecting in between.

346
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:35,090
And so the units do audit themselves and how well we clean the dialysis machines and then the dialysis areas after patients are there.

347
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:46,830
Blood infection rates in dialysis, depending on the type of vascular access type that someone has, they can either have a fish oil,

348
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:55,470
a graft or like a central venous catheter that they each have a different rate or risk of infection with those.

349
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:02,220
And so the tunnel catheters are central venous catheters and those have the highest risk of infection.

350
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,280
And so looking at this, you would want a patient to have a fishbowl versus a catheter.

351
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,410
These are pictures of the different vascular access types. Most commonly would be a central catheter.

352
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,660
Not every patient is going to be able to have a graft or official.

353
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:28,140
That depends on if their veins and arteries are large enough to be able to handle

354
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,700
a graft official and the official is end up taking a lot more time to mature.

355
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,300
It requires going up in needle size, so patients have to get used to being poked every single time that they get dialysis.

356
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,830
It's not where as a central catheter, a tunnel line, you have the procedure to insert the catheter.

357
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,360
But then during each dialysis treatment, you don't have to poke some of the needle.

358
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:57,280
You're just taking the caps off at the ends of each of these lumens, and then you're connecting them to the machine.

359
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:01,230
So some patients don't like being poked every single treatment.

360
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:08,310
So kind of want a catheter. But we know that official is the preferred type because of the lower risk of infection.

361
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:18,299
And then the downside, though, official, is that if something happens that you can't get access, you kind of lose the vein in the artery.

362
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,380
So you can't go back and try another way of connecting again.

363
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,610
You pretty much lose that access type. Preventing dialysis infections.

364
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,540
The first thing that is like the biggest thing for our dialysis patients is there's water rooms.

365
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:42,390
And in these water rooms, we have different like treatments that water has to go through.

366
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,010
The water has to be the right temperature. It has to be ionized.

367
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:54,510
You want to be able to filter out any toxins and bacteria because that is a big source of infection for a patient.

368
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:04,020
And then so there's bi there's monthly high level, high temperature disinfection and they flush chemicals through it.

369
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:09,779
So we actually have an outside company that comes in and they will flush the whole system and treat it.

370
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,040
And they always do culturing so that they can see if there is a pretreatment,

371
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:23,430
bacterial colony count and a toxin level and then after treatment to make sure that everything is below any like levels that are allowed.

372
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:31,710
And so the unit has to make sure that this machine is running or the system's running very well every single day.

373
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,160
And then there's a bunch of alarms and they know every single alarm that goes

374
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,580
off what it's for and what point of the system that they need to look at.

375
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,010
Okay. Another way of preventing or working to decrease infections is the fistula first project.

376
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,250
As you mentioned, fistulas have a lower risk of infection.

377
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:57,000
So we always want to work towards official. Usually when patients ever have to go on to dialysis, they're going to start with a tunnel line,

378
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,480
though, and then they have to be evaluated for their access types.

379
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,290
So eventually, we want all children to be able to get official.

380
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,920
And most of our adults here. Do you have fish supplies?

381
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,379
But children, they're still developing.

382
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:17,070
And so we have to wait for their arteries and veins to mature enough so that they're large enough to be able to get official.

383
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,770
One of the big things also with infections, preventing infections to a standard precautions.

384
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:34,800
Whenever a nurse or a tech goes into a bay for a dialysis patient, they have to be wearing gowns because the gowns will protect them.

385
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:41,910
If, say, a line becomes loose while someone's being treated and the blood spurts out in the machine or there's a crack in the machine tubing.

386
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,950
You want to reduce the risk of being exposed to any bodily fluids.

387
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:53,790
So they have to wear gowns. They always wear gloves and perform hand hygiene before touching and after touching a machine or the patient.

388
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,570
And they have to wear a.

389
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,110
So before COVID, they always had to wear a face mask and eye protection whenever they were going to connect and disconnect the patient,

390
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,330
because that's the time of opportunities where they could have the highest risk of exposure to blood.

391
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:14,910
And then they practice the one needle once syringe only one time,

392
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:23,240
a lot of so they will draw up any medications outside of the area where the patients are being treated because once,

393
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:28,590
like a multi-dose vial goes into a patient area, it's considered contaminated and it's only for one patient.

394
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:35,700
So they drop all their medications outside in a clean med area, and then they bring them medications into the bay where the patient is.

395
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:44,840
Basic steps and catheter connections. And this is what the unit they audit each other on frequently.

396
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:49,230
And so every month they have to do at least two observations of other people.

397
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:59,520
And so, as I said before, they have to wear their mask and eye protection gown and gloves, and then they have to clamp the catheters,

398
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:07,980
remove the caps, and then they scrub the catheter hubs with alcohol because in case anything when you're taking off the cap,

399
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,160
if anything else, if you accidentally touch the hub,

400
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,450
you want to make sure that it's as clean as possible before you're going to connect them to the machine.

401
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,670
And then you unclip the catheter and then you remove your gloves and perform hand hygiene.

402
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:29,819
And then they would start the patient on dialysis exit site care whenever a patient's dressing is removed and minimum,

403
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:35,790
it's once a week or every seven days they're going to do care around actually to clean it.

404
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:42,930
And they also take this opportunity to look at the access and see if there's any signs of infection like pus or oozing,

405
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:52,770
and then they will clean it, apply an antiseptic, and then apply antimicrobial ointment.

406
00:48:52,770 --> 00:49:00,690
If maybe the patients being treated for an exit site infection like they might need to apply ointment and then they apply the clean dressing.

407
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,870
And then this is for official and graft care.

408
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,220
So for these, since they're accessing needle,

409
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:18,060
they'll have the patient wash their arm where the official is located and then they'll have to apply antiseptic,

410
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:29,499
allow it to dry, and then insert the needle. And then we have infection control precautions for hemodialysis.

411
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,750
And as we mentioned before, we want them to always wear personal protective equipment.

412
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,430
We want to promote vascular access, safety.

413
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,920
We always separate clean areas from contaminate areas. So the Bay Area, where the patient sitting,

414
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,459
that's going to be considered contaminated because there's potential for blood exposures and then medication,

415
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,170
viral safety with the one needle once one syringe and one vial.

416
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:03,220
And then we want to clean the dialysis station appropriately in between patients along with their dialysis machine, too.

417
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:07,630
And then we perform safe handling of dialyzer.

418
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:14,260
We don't reuse a dialysis here in the dialysis units, but some areas might reprocess their dialysis.

419
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:26,380
And then clean areas. So as we mentioned that whenever they're prepping medications, they'll do it in clean air and not in the bays.

420
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:32,440
And then they don't handle there or store the medications in the bays where the patients are.

421
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,050
We dedicate supplies to a single patient. So each patient has a container.

422
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:43,760
And so each of those containers will have like a blood pressure cuff that specifically

423
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,730
for that patient or anything that they would need for their one treatment.

424
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,260
Sometimes they put on new dressings in their supplies that they might have to carry over for each treatment.

425
00:50:54,650 --> 00:51:03,379
And then if any items are taken and when they're taken out like a blood pressure cuff or like the chair that's in the dialysis station,

426
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:12,000
they have to disinfect that. For the dialysis station disinfection.

427
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:19,440
We say that we have to wait for the patient to leave completely before you clean any surfaces down.

428
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:28,230
And then we always emphasize contact time here. So our oxidizer is our main product that we use and that has a contact time of one minute.

429
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,130
So the surfaces have to remain wet for one minute to be effective.

430
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:37,500
And then we they focus a lot on the panels, on the machines,

431
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:43,950
because there's a lot of small buttons and knobs that they have to make sure that if there's any residual blood on there,

432
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:51,839
that they really clean it off and then they have to empty and disinfect the prime case containers for the dialysis machines.

433
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:59,730
And they have a whole process for that, too. And those are usually done in a patient equipment room and they're not actually done in the bays.

434
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,340
And then dialysis and blood tubing,

435
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:12,800
and that they always have to make sure that any tubing is clamped or any caps are plugged before they move the machine.

436
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,579
And then they place or dye lasers and ink tubing and leak proof material.

437
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:22,319
So they have really big biohazard containers on their unit and then if they have to reuse a dialyzer,

438
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,399
so they follow the army standards for reprocessing.

439
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:33,650
But we don't do that here. These are examples of process measures that the dialysis unit audits every month.

440
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,979
They look at connections and disconnections and make sure that those their fellow

441
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,340
colleagues are following all the steps they need to before they're connecting,

442
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,049
disconnecting a patient. They look at hand hygiene. We have unit based observers there.

443
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,459
So it's the nurses and the techs collecting the data because their units are very small.

444
00:52:52,460 --> 00:53:01,550
So if one of you were able to go on to the unit or anybody, even when I walk on to the unit, they're going to notice me immediately.

445
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:06,740
So people are going to start performing their hand hygiene more and so they're always going to be 100%.

446
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,290
So you can see here that whenever there's a unit based observer or someone that they work with,

447
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,899
they're not going to know when someone's watching them for hand hygiene.

448
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:20,870
So they're obviously not always 100%, even though that is their goal to be 100%.

449
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,240
And then and they vary, they have a few Pedes patients.

450
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:35,120
This is the dialysis unit data. They have only two or three of their patients actually have fistulas and their number of patients fluctuates.

451
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:43,790
They that's why they only have two or three observations every month and then they have dressing changes that they watch.

452
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,799
And so those happen so often.

453
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:51,710
And some patients will be changed their dressings, the application, every treatment depending on if their dressings are lifting.

454
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:56,990
So then that's why that one has at least 15 or 20 observations.

455
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,830
And then they also watch how they disinfect the machines too.

456
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,660
And then this data actually gets reported to NHS and along with their infection data.

457
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:14,480
Yeah. So what I'm just going to ask a question. So this is obviously a very rigorous thing.

458
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:20,140
What kind of pathogens are they trying to avoid? What's the problem?

459
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,960
Maybe for like normal skin, for instance, if that's true.

460
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,160
What else should a normal skin for? But that's not what this seems to be focused on.

461
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:45,160
What what's going on in dialysis machine? Why do they need the fistula in the first place?

462
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:06,250
Yeah. I mean, I don't know if this is right, but is it something in the water with people or I'm sure like fecal oral or something?

463
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:13,959
No, it's not people. Oral. So what, what what is, uh, what kind of catfish is.

464
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,470
So they're putting something in someone's veins, right?

465
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:22,540
And we heard a lot about blood is.

466
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:32,530
Was sterile. When do you worry about bloodborne pathogens?

467
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:37,179
Bloodborne pathogens, right? Right. Bloodborne pathogens.

468
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,390
That's why there was the video and I don't have any.

469
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:44,050
What kind of those bacteria or viral?

470
00:55:47,100 --> 00:56:00,080
Viral and nearly viral. And you know what kind of pathogen you might be worried about, particularly about what?

471
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:04,190
Pathogen? Yeah. Hepatitis.

472
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:13,610
Hepatitis. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, this is a lot of this is even used to be I used to work on s r d a long time ago.

473
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:19,220
Um, at that time, there was a real problem with hepatitis B.

474
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,930
And so hepatitis B can be very stable and very hard to clean.

475
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:37,100
And yet, when we were looking at the national surveillance for dialysis machines, it was kind of impossible at the time to get the hepatitis B out.

476
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:47,810
And so they had dedicated machines once. They assumed eventually everybody would get hepatitis B with dialysis, and then they had dedicated machines,

477
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:55,840
because if you have hepatitis B near you, it's circulating in your blood and they can detect it.

478
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:02,600
And the Australian antigen, and it can go that for people and it's very stable.

479
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:09,770
So on surfaces you have to be real careful about cleaning or have a really good cleaner.

480
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:17,920
Yes. And also testing patients. They do screen patients during their first treatment for hepatitis and then they do it on a frequent basis.

481
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:22,100
After that, I think it's once a year that will test patients for hepatitis.

482
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:28,790
And then whenever that happens, they usually if there are dialysis units, some areas will not have bays,

483
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,900
but they'll have chairs more that they're stationed next to each other and they're very close.

484
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:37,220
Sometimes they'll make up so that the patients with hepatitis are in a separate area

485
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,940
so that they're not going to be right next to a patient that doesn't have hepatitis.

486
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,350
Yes, it's a real, real worry about that.

487
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:57,980
So that's a real, real cause that actually HIV is much less hardy than, you know, than hepatitis B particularly.

488
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,440
Okay. So moving on to surveillance.

489
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:12,010
So once a month, I will add another analyst that is helping me right now.

490
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:21,580
We look through all the patients that received dialysis as an outpatient for any of any one of these three dialysis events.

491
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:25,110
And they can actually have all three or just two or one.

492
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,430
So we look at plasma blood cultures.

493
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:37,420
So any culture that's drawn, even if it's like a skin organism, a kind of commensal that has to be reported because any positive blood culture,

494
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,680
it doesn't even have to be that you treated them for the infection.

495
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:43,270
It's just as long as it's positive.

496
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:54,010
And then if a patient receives an antimicrobial start or continuation, so administered vanco or something that could be even an empiric treatment.

497
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:01,930
Maybe you draw the patients like the fever. They're having some redness around their catheter, other exit site, you might say,

498
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:06,640
okay, let's just draw cultures and just start them empirically on antimicrobials.

499
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:17,919
So it could be a start on that. A start is that they were just showed up that day to dialysis and then you needed to give them antibiotics.

500
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,650
Or it could be a continuation of a hospital admission.

501
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:28,540
A lot of patients might be treated for Ace Clancy while they're in the bit, while they're admitted, but then be discharged,

502
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:38,620
but still need to have maybe another week of I.V. antibiotics, any pus that's noted around the exit site that's reportable.

503
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:45,700
And then if a patient has redness or swelling around the exit site, that's concerning for an infection that's reportable.

504
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:54,100
But if it's just like redness, maybe a Pedes patient, usually they if they were to tug on their line, their exit site could get a little red.

505
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:59,980
But there's no concern for an infection. And they're just watching to see if that redness goes away.

506
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:04,600
That's not reportable. There's a 21 day rule.

507
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:11,710
So for your the eyes that we look at for in for inpatients that one's usually 14 days.

508
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:19,180
But for the dialysis outpatients, they're like repeat infection timeframe is 21 days.

509
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,040
So it's a little bit longer.

510
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,860
So for people that do both types of surveillance, you have to remember that there is a different time frame that you have to look at.

511
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:35,560
And then this data is reported to the dialysis unit leadership and then also submitted to HSN on a monthly basis.

512
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,730
And this is in a dialysis event surveillance form.

513
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,950
So we have to report all the patient identified via information.

514
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:49,570
We know if the patient was in the adult side or the pit side,

515
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:57,940
if they were a transient patient on that, is more of the patients just coming for 1 to 3 visits,

516
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:06,010
but then they're just going to go to their a more like stable dialysis facility because our patients here that we see,

517
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:12,340
they're just not able to be seen at a regular like an offsite dialysis.

518
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:16,750
They might have other comorbidities that they're being managed at the same time that they're receiving dialysis here.

519
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,840
So they're not considered stable enough for an outpatient site that's run by like Fresenius or DaVita.

520
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:30,790
And then we look at their vascular access types because whenever we calculate their SARS,

521
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:37,810
we they take into account the type of line or the access that they had because there are different risks.

522
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:43,780
And then we also have to say what type of dialysis event it was.

523
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:48,220
And then they want to know what was the concern? Did the patient have a fever?

524
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:51,760
Were they having chills? Was there possible cellulitis?

525
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:58,059
Like, why did we actually treat them or consider them having a dialysis event and NHS

526
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:01,180
and also wants to know if the patient and of losing their vascular access.

527
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:08,920
Some patients it might take a few days, but then they'll do repeat cultures to see if a patient cleared their infection.

528
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:15,400
But if they're not clearing their infection, they might say, we just need to replace the line because the line could be the source of their infection.

529
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:20,770
So some patients will have their line extreme. So then we'll say that they did lose vascular access.

530
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,470
Some patients are hospitalized. Some patients can be seen and treated as an outpatient.

531
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:31,899
But if they're really not feeling well, then they might be hospitalized.

532
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,350
And that happens more often with our Pedes patients.

533
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:39,970
And they also want to know if a patient does die from their infection.

534
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:50,040
And so there's unknowns here, but usually because we track our patients long enough that we will know of it if one of those outcomes happened or not.

535
01:02:51,900 --> 01:03:00,930
And then denominators, we were we have to track the patients that are seen on the first two days of the month.

536
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,750
Yes, it has to be working day.

537
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:10,500
So if the dialysis unit is closed on the first of the month, we look at what patients are seen on the second and the third when they were open.

538
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:15,450
So it's the first two days that the unit was open and actually seeing patients.

539
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:20,280
And then we look at what type of vascular access they had.

540
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:22,590
So for adults,

541
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:30,480
we mostly have a denominator of 3 to 4 patients because those are mostly they're going to be the stable patients that they see or their kids.

542
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:36,610
So like in center patients and an adult dialysis unit here sees a lot of transients be

543
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,240
transient patients because they'll come in to have a line exchange or like official,

544
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:48,360
like modified it so then they'll have dialysis after.

545
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,200
So we might see a 20 patients throughout the month for adult dialysis,

546
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:59,520
but they'll only have a denominator of three or four because it's the first two working days that our denominators are determined by.

547
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:05,490
And then our side has about 13 patients that are seen every month.

548
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:15,260
Some examples of our data. So these are the dialysis events that a unit has had.

549
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:21,050
So they were able to decrease the number of dialysis events that they had over time.

550
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:27,790
So in 2019, they had a dialysis rate, event rate of 23.2 per 100 patient months.

551
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:35,870
And some of these events, it looks like it's really high, but when you look at the details of it, each infection,

552
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:43,250
it was for a period of time it was only one patient having an event pretty much every single month.

553
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:46,550
And that patient had a lot of co-morbidities.

554
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:56,329
And he we just they they said that the infection was like seated in his organ somewhere, but they couldn't clear that infection.

555
01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:00,020
So he just kept testing or being positive after 21 days.

556
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,240
And then he was always on antimicrobials.

557
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:09,290
So there's a lot sometimes you can't just say, okay, so that unit, it's all the patients are having infections a lot.

558
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:18,170
You have to look at each individual patient. And the units also implemented a connector at the end of all their catheters.

559
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,870
So that connector is actually helping to decrease the infections because it's a clot.

560
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:29,959
It creates a closed system for the catheter. So even if a cap were to come off, the connector is closed.

561
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,970
So it protects that any other organisms or like bacteria from entering the line.

562
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:42,380
So that unit has done a lot of work on decreasing their infections and they've also done process measures.

563
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:49,250
So that's why they look at connection disconnections and hygiene, because they were to figure out why are we having all these events?

564
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:57,290
And then so you have to look at both the nursing side and then patients like because patients are only in your unit for 2 to 3 hours,

565
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:01,610
three times a week. So you don't know what they're doing at home, taking their caps off.

566
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,360
If they end up bathing in water and their dressing gets wet, you need a catheter.

567
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:13,520
It's it's like care. And so there's a lot of education that goes on about how to properly bathe.

568
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:19,910
You can't go swimming. So and then if you get sweaty and your dressing starts to peel, then you need to reinforce your dressing.

569
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:25,010
So they were doing a lot of education on their patients and looking at other ways that

570
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:29,960
they could improve their nursing aspects so that they can prevent their dialysis events.

571
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,620
So those dialysis,

572
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:40,520
that prior graph was looking at all three types of events and then this is only their positive blood cultures or bloodstream infections.

573
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:46,069
So you could see that in the prior slide. They're having a lot more of the other types,

574
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:49,070
like I.V. antimicrobial starts where the patient might not have actually had a positive

575
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:54,380
blood culture or they had that redness at the exits like that was concerning for infection,

576
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,620
but no positive blood culture with that.

577
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:06,800
And so this unit has done really well at preventing their positive blood cultures or bloodstream infections over the last three years.

578
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,430
Yeah. So and so it's the question is also about how many patients to see.

579
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:21,559
I mean, the interesting thing about dialysis is you have a mix, you have patients that might have acute kidney failure.

580
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,459
And so they they might be on dialysis for a very short time period.

581
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:33,440
And then they're done. And then there's the people with chronic kidney failure who they need dialysis to stay alive or a kidney transplant.

582
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:45,620
Right. So I was wondering, like, how many people I mean, so you have you have people who are long term patients, but they they are outpatients.

583
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:52,219
They come in. So how many people it was like just I was just reflecting on that because you just had the one patient,

584
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:55,910
you know, who was there a long time, been going back and forth from home.

585
01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:01,100
So it's a different kind of infection control problem than some other units because you have people

586
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:07,400
coming in who are always at high risk and particularly during the procedure of getting infections.

587
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:14,590
Yeah, because when you have a fish or you're always at risk of getting more just to have a portal to the outside so you know,

588
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:22,190
have like what the base population is at any one time in terms of like over a month, like how many different patients.

589
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:29,330
So for our Pedes unit, they have a consistent like patient list.

590
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,559
So they mostly will only have 13 patients that they'll see straight from the beginning to the end

591
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:42,200
of the month because they so number of kids are actually on dialysis as much smaller than adults.

592
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:49,000
So they'll either place them at our hospital or they could place them at Davos.

593
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:59,089
And yeah, so that's how patients how many kids for over a year that they if they have is regular at any

594
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:04,790
1.10 like how many per month with different people over there they'll probably see like 15 here.

595
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:07,850
15 at the most because if they come.

596
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:11,220
During the middle of the month. They're going to be there for several months.

597
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:16,640
They're not going to just come and then be sent out to another location and be offsite like the adults.

598
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:20,900
And then for adults, we don't have those there.

599
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,270
There are other units that I mean, they're outpatient. Totally outpatient dialysis.

600
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:32,990
Yeah. Okay. So they have about 3 to 4 chronic in center patients that they'll see.

601
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:38,040
And then they have patients that come in for like a procedure,

602
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:45,229
like a fish diagram or to have a line exchange or like a g clotting that they'll be seen

603
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:49,969
in our interventional nephrology unit and then they might get dialysis right after.

604
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:54,080
And so that is probably 12 to 15 more patients.

605
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:58,120
Okay. So and so most of the dialysis and is actually done.

606
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:08,300
Yeah. Yeah. That they'll just come to our their our unit for one treatment after a procedure or they might be discharged from the hospital here,

607
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:15,680
but they're not ready to go back to their normal like the regular outpatient site because some patients are actually from the up.

608
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:21,860
So they need a stay here for a couple of treatments before they can be placed back at their normal site.

609
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,850
So they'll come here for three treatments and then go back. Yeah.

610
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,829
So infection control in these outpatient facilities is always the real issue.

611
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:35,090
Not that that's your purview, but, you know, I don't know.

612
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,079
I'm just thinking about that. Know, if you go to an outpatient.

613
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,840
Totally outpatient dialysis facility, that's. Interesting.

614
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:54,000
I think some patients like at Fresenius or DaVita there, they might also be I don't know what the right way to say it is like they're belly,

615
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,630
like they're functioning might be that they can actually they go to work more and they're not having all these multiple co-morbidities.

616
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:06,800
So they might be able to manage their line and take care of it better than someone that's frequently come here,

617
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:11,520
because they might be from like a skilled nursing facility that needs to be transported to our location.

618
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:17,130
Or they might just be wheelchair bound or not be able to. But like how?

619
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:20,559
Like jobs are like regular life, where they're just going to be able to ambulate and walk in.

620
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:27,860
And a lot of them are they do they're brought in on a wheelchair and have to be escorted in by somebody like a caregiver or the person.

621
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,940
So you're seeing a sort of a very rarified dialysis populace.

622
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:38,990
Mm hmm. Yeah. Adult dialysis unit at all is mostly for people that are not stable enough to be seen at an outpatient.

623
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:47,990
I'm sorry. Let's see how well you guys are paying attention to the last few slides on events.

624
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:53,990
So this first one, we only I think there's only a handful of exercise questions here.

625
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,680
So Patient one has a tunnel hemodialysis line.

626
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:03,710
During hemodialysis, she becomes hypertensive and has an elevated temperature.

627
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:09,440
The patient's given I.V. antimicrobial prophylaxis and blood cultures are drawn.

628
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:14,510
One of the blood cultures grows microbe carcass. LUCIUS It's a common commensal.

629
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:25,680
How would you report this dialysis event? You want to take a stab at it?

630
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,980
A hint is a die offs event. But what would you do?

631
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,360
What information from here would you need to report? Any stress that?

632
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:48,420
Yes. They were talking about culture. Yes. And also, what else would you report for that other type of catheter?

633
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:53,870
Yes. Yeah.

634
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:58,940
So, yes, so those are the two of the three dialysis events that we have to report.

635
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:07,850
And so we would report that and then we would also have to report what the factors were that we considered,

636
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,620
and which is why we're calling it infection.

637
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:16,340
Or we looked at giving antimicrobials, and that is because the patient became hypertensive and had an elevated temperature.

638
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:27,850
Exercise two. So Patient two is a chronic HD patient who was recently discharged from Michigan medicine for a bloodstream infection.

639
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:34,870
Antimicrobial treatments are going to be continued in outpatient dialysis for a week from September 1st.

640
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:47,979
So seven. So we know we would have to report this dialysis event would that we would consider this patient as a transient patient at the

641
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:55,120
time because they were recently discharged from the hospital until they've reached at least 13 treatments at our facility.

642
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:02,380
And then what else would we want to say for this patient?

643
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:08,860
Like, would the patient would we consider the patient having an outcome of a hospital admission for this infection?

644
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:20,680
So for like hospital admissions for an outcome, it would be that they were admitted because of the infection that was identified.

645
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:39,900
Yes. You say yes, we would report that most of this came in for bloodstream infection.

646
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,769
Just charge for. Okay.

647
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:50,860
So, yeah. So the patient was treated for their infection already while they were in the hospital.

648
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:54,940
So now we're just completing the antimicrobial treatment as an outpatient.

649
01:14:55,480 --> 01:15:03,850
So the patient's hospital admission, we would say no, because they were already they were admitted and they were treated in the hospital for it.

650
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:09,550
And so we're just going to finish up there and October. So they're not like readmitted to the hospital for this infection.

651
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:18,219
So like so we would say that they were admitted to the hospital if it was like we identified their infection in

652
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:24,610
the outpatient side and then they had to go to the ED for a further treatment and were admitted at that point.

653
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:31,020
So this is the second part of the question.

654
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:37,290
So his last his last post hospital discharge treatment was on September 7th.

655
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:45,639
And on the 29th he was note that she was noted to have run us around the tunneled access site and then the patient's spikes.

656
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:53,100
The fever started on prophylaxis treatment and has blood cultures drawn that grow enterococcus vco.

657
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:08,700
Would you report. So I'm thinking back.

658
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:12,510
So the last shoot was on the seventh, and now it's the 29th.

659
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:22,200
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's been greater than 21 days since the last antimicrobial treatment.

660
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,840
And then you also have redness around the tunneled site.

661
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:33,170
And so there are concern for infection. And then they also drew blood culture.

662
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:38,790
So you're pretty much like having all three events here.

663
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:46,480
Exercise three. Patient three has a tunnel hemodialysis line.

664
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:51,370
One day they're feeling generally unwell with fatigue and a low grade fever.

665
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,420
They go to the ed and blood cultures are drawn.

666
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,910
Both blood cultures grow enterococcus difficult. How would you report this?

667
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:13,900
So they're normally seen at your dialysis center, they're at home, they're not feeling well, and they're like, I have to go.

668
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:17,110
I might have like I might have blood infection.

669
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:21,890
So I'm going to go to the E.D. I'm not going to I'm not going to wait until my dialysis treatment again.

670
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:59,070
Maybe? No, because like you don't really know what the time period was after the first events in the thirties.

671
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:07,290
Okay. Of so for all our patients we look at for the whole month if they've had any three events.

672
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:11,580
So we would have to report this because there are outpatient.

673
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:18,360
And so we have to report that, yes, that we saw this patient and they did have a positive culture.

674
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:31,750
Because like, so this might be a little confusing, but like whenever we look at each eye collapses over patients that are admitted to the hospital,

675
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:35,469
we have to at least look at how long they've been a major hospital.

676
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:43,030
So they have to be like on day three or later or they're considered present on admission for their infection.

677
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,639
So we do have to track these like so if they were a dialysis patient and they came to the hospital,

678
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:54,460
they went into the e.D, then we would have to say no they had it already before they came in.

679
01:18:54,820 --> 01:19:00,490
So and then this patient on dialysis so we would have to report it and then we would also if this patient wasn't ours

680
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:07,690
and they showed up at our EDI and they had a possible culture that like Fresenius or DaVita that sees that patient,

681
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:12,450
they would have to report that patient and they would have to see if the patient had a positive culture.

682
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:17,650
So they look into all that like, where has the patient been the last month? Have they gone to the EDI or they admitted?

683
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:24,100
Why were they admitted? And so if anything happens, they have to report and look into each patient's details.

684
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:28,569
So that's why it is really important that we have like my chart so that we can look and

685
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:34,390
see and follow a patient really well throughout their month and their treatment here.

686
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:43,870
Exercise for a patient for has a tunneled if d line an official while undergoing dialysis treatment.

687
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:50,769
What is being leaking from the dialysis machine near the filter I.V. antimicrobial prophylaxis, vanco and stuff.

688
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:54,220
APM is administered, blood cultures are drawn and are negative.

689
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:59,260
Would you report this? So yes, you would report it.

690
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:01,690
What would you report for that?

691
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:15,610
So the antimicrobial and NHS and does ask us if we administer vancomycin for all of our antimicrobial starts and continuations.

692
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,850
We would also have to look at why was this dialysis machine leaking?

693
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,590
And we have to report that the patient had both an HD like an official.

694
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:38,940
Exercise five. A patient has a daily event, a swelling greater than expected and suspicious for an infection.

695
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:46,160
On July 31st, the swelling resolves and no other events occurred on August 21st.

696
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:51,380
He goes to have outpatient dialysis and the nurse notices he has slightly redness around the vascular access.

697
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,430
The redness is monitored during future treatments but is not treated.

698
01:20:56,870 --> 01:21:11,570
So what would you do with these two occurrences? Would you report one or both of them?

699
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:19,620
I see one. So yes, you'd only report one event.

700
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:25,230
You report the one on July 31st because that one was concerning for infection.

701
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:30,659
But then in August, when he came in and he had slight redness, as I mentioned,

702
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:35,819
like sometimes if a patient ends up tugging on their line or it just kind of becomes a little irritated,

703
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,580
it could be red, but he wasn't actually treated for infection.

704
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,620
They just monitor, monitored it. Okay. Yeah.

705
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:51,420
So even though that wasn't treated for infection and still becomes reportable, the one in August is not.

706
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:58,620
Oh, yes, the one is the one in July. So even no antibiotics were given and there was just a suspicion of infection, which.

707
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:05,099
Yeah, that's concerning for infection. Okay. And these examples, there's probably more that happens in a dialysis unit.

708
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:09,070
But for this one, just because I'm saying it's suspicious.

709
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,730
Yeah, yeah. Okay. I was just curious about that.

710
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:17,280
I mean, probably if it's a switch, it's probably going to have pus or something oozing from the site too.

711
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:22,170
Yeah, but the fact that no evidence were given and it resolved is so interesting.

712
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:31,920
Was last exercise is figuring out the denominator.

713
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,620
Okay. So we look at the first two working days of the month to determine our denominator.

714
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:45,450
So looking at August of this year, the first and second were Monday and Tuesday.

715
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:49,500
And the dialysis unit does operate on Monday and Tuesday.

716
01:22:50,250 --> 01:23:13,420
So what would your denominator be? I guess the first question is, is, is it people or is it treatment is.

717
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:48,740
Does anybody think it's ten? There will be dialysis events over the ten IL.

718
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,690
So our denominator is the number of patients you see on the first two working days of the month.

719
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:58,010
So August 1st and second would be our working days.

720
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:02,960
And so looking at this, we look at their treatment dates for all ten patients.

721
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:08,990
And so only three patients actually had a treatment on either the first or the second of the month.

722
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:12,680
So that would be oh sorry. Oh yeah.

723
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:17,360
Three. Oh, so that be patient two, five and ten.

724
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:21,920
So this is kind of an example of what we see in our adult dialysis unit.

725
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:28,070
We could see ten or 15 patients throughout the whole month that received dialysis treatment.

726
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:34,970
But our denominator so small because it's only the patients are are on first too so that's why it's

727
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:41,660
it's harder for dialysis units that see a lot of transient patients to really get a dialysis rate that

728
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:51,319
doesn't look very high and concerning because their denominator so small and so like for seniors and VA

729
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:58,040
that see a consistent number of patients that they're going to have a rate that looks more like normal,

730
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:05,360
like a normal population that you're going to be seeing because just the number of patients every month do you know like.

731
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:09,260
Is that they do the denominator like that or.

732
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:15,880
It's probably because patients are going to be seen like two or three times a week.

733
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:24,480
So you don't really count device stays for these patients because the patients could fluctuate throughout the month.

734
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:29,200
So they're going to have probably a stable number of patients like our pizza dialysis unit.

735
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:36,250
They have 13 patients and all of those patients are either seen on the first and second working day because they alternate treatment.

736
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:43,149
So I think that that's why they use their denominator, because they're going to see if a patient is a chronic dialysis patient,

737
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:49,510
they're going to be coming in either on the first or second day. And so they're going to capture most of their patients at that one time.

738
01:25:51,510 --> 01:26:00,550
So once they're on of dialysis and there's there's kind of an inherent assumption that they're at higher risk no matter what and they remain at risk.

739
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:08,260
Yes. So that that's it. So this is kind of a special case because they are people who are always at risk

740
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:12,360
of the dialysis and the associated event as long as they're given dialysis.

741
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:22,330
And even when they go home, they're still at risk because of the other things that are associated with it, like having a line or something like that.

742
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:27,010
I think that might be part of it, but it would be looked at. Interesting to look it up.

743
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:31,510
And I just think the rationale is which they may or may not explain, by the way.

744
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:43,240
So but yeah, because I'm sure there's an additional risk associated with each treatment because every time you have a treatment,

745
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:46,959
there's more manipulation and there's exposure to the machine.

746
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,430
I mean, there's every time you have a treatment, you have to increase your risk a bit.

747
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:59,400
But these people are at very high risk anyway. We don't have end stage renal disease, you and a healthy person in general.

748
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:10,630
So it's like is there an average number of treatments that adult patients typically have or is that like super hard to pin down?

749
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:14,220
No, it is pretty powerful. Yeah.

750
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:23,470
I mean, some patients only need dialysis temporarily because of some condition that they may have, but some patients are on dialysis for years.

751
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:29,560
So it really just depends on sort of the underlying condition that results in the need for dialysis.

752
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:39,350
So, yeah, that's really not there's not like any predictable end stage in when they do this kind of review.

753
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:44,560
Yeah. It's usually three times a week.

754
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:50,049
Someone is on chronic dialysis. It is typically.

755
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:55,750
And they typically go up Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday is how the schedule works.

756
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,200
Sort of like every other day before the transplant.

757
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:03,399
Yeah. Depending on the patient factors.

758
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:09,020
Yeah. Yeah.

759
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:13,340
It's it's really detrimental for patients to be in chronic dialysis.

760
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,460
So people do a lot better if they can move forward with the transplant.

761
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:22,600
But there are still a lot of barriers around that.

762
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,200
So, yeah. Yes.

763
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:39,659
That's a question. Thank you. You know, I've I've had a few I think I think I always have something to say about this.

764
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:51,660
But this is really interesting. As far as transplants go, I was in the O.R. a few weeks ago, and I had never heard of this before,

765
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:59,460
but it was, um, a person having their own kidney transplant that somewhere else in their body.

766
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:05,820
So they took their kidney. And the problem with it wasn't the kidney. It was the connector, really kidney.

767
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:08,489
And so they took it out. Well, they didn't take it out.

768
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:16,380
They did it laparoscopically, but they disconnected the kidney, kind of like shoved it around in there after that and then reconnected it.

769
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:23,790
I've never heard of that. But yeah, it was the coolest thing I ever knew was that the surgeon and I was like, Can I ask two questions, please?

770
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,020
How is this happening? Oh, I'm so glad you asked.

771
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:39,060
So it's like there there are all kinds of things happening that, you know, can help these patients who have these issues with their kidneys and stuff.

772
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:45,190
But I just want to throw that out there since you're talking about. Yeah, that is really well, let's say commercial.

773
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:50,260
I mean. Right.

774
01:29:52,110 --> 01:30:05,770
Hmm. How do you feel if you think for a moment that it all worked out in the end?

775
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:20,610
Yeah, because I was going to do that this year. All right, perfect.

776
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,780
You? Oh, yeah.

777
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:30,280
Yeah. Oh, that was hard. I feel like. So I will.

778
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,961
I will advance in my. I love that one. And we're doing a recording here.

779
01:30:37,248 --> 01:30:41,168
No. So, yeah.

780
01:30:42,548 --> 01:30:51,368
Okay. You know, I'm sorry. I'm just going to have to drink that and nothing different but similar.

781
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:57,518
I guess you want to ask yourself a little bit about your background in life.

782
01:30:58,088 --> 01:31:03,247
I know. Okay. Sounds good. Hi everyone.

783
01:31:03,248 --> 01:31:09,157
I am Jenna Burger. I am an infection prevention test at Michigan Medicine, University of Michigan Health.

784
01:31:09,158 --> 01:31:15,848
I don't know what we're called. We have a lot of names, but it's right next door. So let's see.

785
01:31:15,848 --> 01:31:21,308
I have been back at U of M since I don't even know, I think maybe 2017.

786
01:31:23,018 --> 01:31:28,448
But before that I started right after being an undergrad here.

787
01:31:28,478 --> 01:31:34,088
Um, I graduated with microbiology undergrad and I became an infection prevention analyst in our department.

788
01:31:34,508 --> 01:31:38,888
So it was my introduction here. I left and went to the East Coast for a little bit.

789
01:31:39,518 --> 01:31:40,868
I worked out there at the NIH.

790
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:47,107
They have something called the Clinical Center in Maryland, which is like the hospital where they do the clinical trials for all,

791
01:31:47,108 --> 01:31:50,587
um, like the National Cancer Institute and stuff like that.

792
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:53,618
And that was a really amazing place to do infection prevention.

793
01:31:53,618 --> 01:31:59,378
So if you are thinking about doing that and want to do like crazy stuff, that's a cool place to check out.

794
01:32:00,818 --> 01:32:05,138
Or here we are also always looking for qualified individuals as well.

795
01:32:05,468 --> 01:32:19,628
Um. Okay. So. I tend to talk very fast because I actually hate public speaking, so I am going to do my very best to slow down.

796
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:25,298
So if I start going too fast, please like wave me down to slow down.

797
01:32:25,508 --> 01:32:36,098
All right. That would be helpful for me. Okay, so here my job is to I cover the most of the well now,

798
01:32:36,548 --> 01:32:40,688
the university hospital O.R. So I do a lot of surgical site infection prevention, surveillance.

799
01:32:41,858 --> 01:32:50,438
I also cover the trauma burn ICU, which is why I'm here to talk to you today, obviously, about burn and trauma wound infections.

800
01:32:50,738 --> 01:32:54,988
So I don't know what you guys know already.

801
01:32:54,998 --> 01:33:01,568
I tried looking at the syllabus to figure out what you've already been introduced to, so I'm just going to pretend like you don't know anything.

802
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:07,838
And over. Talk a lot. Too much. Okay, so here we go.

803
01:33:08,018 --> 01:33:14,168
All right. So as far as burn wounds go, is it a click or an arrow?

804
01:33:15,098 --> 01:33:22,768
Okay, so what I want to talk to you today about as far as Burns go, I want to talk about the causes and the classifications of burn wounds.

805
01:33:22,778 --> 01:33:29,168
I want to talk about the impact of burn infections on patients and then also about classifying those infections.

806
01:33:30,128 --> 01:33:36,548
I want to talk about the risk and prevention of other infections associated with burn patients, about what trauma wounds,

807
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:42,818
concerns are about the pathogens that affect these patients, about the chain of infection,

808
01:33:43,328 --> 01:33:46,658
about surveillance, and also about transmission based precautions.

809
01:33:49,568 --> 01:33:52,568
Hmm. Okay.

810
01:33:52,808 --> 01:33:57,758
So what causes A has anyone ever had a burn?

811
01:33:59,768 --> 01:34:06,108
Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah. So I totally have definitely had sunburn before.

812
01:34:06,128 --> 01:34:09,548
That is a kind of burn. But there are also many other kinds of burns.

813
01:34:10,448 --> 01:34:13,078
The most common type of burn is a thermal burn.

814
01:34:13,088 --> 01:34:20,048
This is something that's like a flame or a flash burn, and it affects about 41 or it's about 41% of the burns that we see.

815
01:34:21,308 --> 01:34:24,608
The other most common type of burn is a scald injury.

816
01:34:25,058 --> 01:34:27,818
It's about 31% of the rest of burns.

817
01:34:27,818 --> 01:34:33,637
And this is really the most common type of burn that we see in children, especially Pedes, who are under five talking hot bathtubs,

818
01:34:33,638 --> 01:34:37,148
coffee pots, things like that that they get into that they really shouldn't be getting into.

819
01:34:38,738 --> 01:34:45,637
But there's other things that can cause burns as well. There can be chemical burns, radiation, electrical burns are crazy.

820
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:49,018
Electricity goes through your bones and burns you from the inside out.

821
01:34:49,028 --> 01:34:53,468
That's a fun one. And another thing that people don't think about is frostbite.

822
01:34:53,858 --> 01:34:58,538
This actually is functionally affects your body like it is.

823
01:34:58,658 --> 01:35:04,788
It's considered a burn. Okay.

824
01:35:04,878 --> 01:35:05,957
So interestingly,

825
01:35:05,958 --> 01:35:15,558
sunburns tend to be seasonal and we have something we call bonfire season usually starts around Memorial Day and goes through most of the summer.

826
01:35:15,868 --> 01:35:20,928
That's when we tend to see most of our burns be something related to outside fire building activities.

827
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:27,408
We also have space heater burns. Those tend to be greater in like November, December timeframe.

828
01:35:27,738 --> 01:35:31,278
And then the frostbite usually starts around February, so we get frostbite February.

829
01:35:31,848 --> 01:35:40,188
There are other things that have no seasonality at all, and that is for whatever reason,

830
01:35:40,188 --> 01:35:47,118
we almost always have an elderly patient who was smoking on their oxygen like it's at any given time.

831
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:55,998
I don't know. I don't. Anyway, so that's there's usually one in the burn ICU at any point and then skull burns can happen at any time as well.

832
01:36:00,168 --> 01:36:07,727
Okay. So for treatment and we classify burns, so there is a first degree burn,

833
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:12,798
which is a superficial burn and this is damage to the skin that's limited to the epidermis.

834
01:36:14,178 --> 01:36:17,328
The skin is intact and it appears to be pink or red in color.

835
01:36:18,108 --> 01:36:21,698
It's also really warm or hard to touch and it can be pretty painful.

836
01:36:22,188 --> 01:36:30,828
There may be swelling or small blisters. And it's as I mentioned before, sunburn is something that we would categorize as a first degree burn.

837
01:36:31,638 --> 01:36:35,378
A second degree burn is going to be also called partial thickness.

838
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:38,868
So this is something that includes not only the epidermis but down into the dermis.

839
01:36:38,868 --> 01:36:44,718
And these burns are like the most painful because of all of those nerve endings that are in that layer of the skin.

840
01:36:45,648 --> 01:36:51,318
There can be blistering and loss of skin with these ones as well.

841
01:36:51,318 --> 01:36:56,688
Usually they're also really shiny and moist and very red.

842
01:36:57,648 --> 01:37:03,678
A third degree burn is going to be a full thickness burn, and this is the epidermis, the dermis and the hypodermic.

843
01:37:03,678 --> 01:37:11,448
So it goes all the way down. And really interesting about these ones is they actually aren't painful because all of those nerves have been killed.

844
01:37:11,448 --> 01:37:15,228
So there's nothing there to really make it hurt.

845
01:37:15,588 --> 01:37:19,348
Now, the skin that's around that third degree burn, that may be a second degree burn.

846
01:37:19,368 --> 01:37:23,628
That stuff is still pretty painful. But where that third degree burn is, there's nothing telling your brain that it hurts.

847
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:32,418
Okay. So. First exercise.

848
01:37:33,438 --> 01:37:37,337
Take a look at this patient here and see if you can name that burn.

849
01:37:37,338 --> 01:37:39,618
Based on what I just shared with you guys.

850
01:37:41,718 --> 01:37:50,658
Would you call this a first degree superficial or is that second degree partial thickness or a third degree full thickness?

851
01:37:53,598 --> 01:37:56,927
First for your first degree superficial.

852
01:37:56,928 --> 01:38:00,888
Yet there small blisters and it's superficial. And we also have.

853
01:38:01,758 --> 01:38:06,788
Yeah, superficial. Very good. Okay.

854
01:38:07,178 --> 01:38:12,637
Next one. How about this burn? Okay, second degree.

855
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:16,088
Why? Because the top layer is gone. And why the second layer?

856
01:38:17,858 --> 01:38:23,248
Yep, yep. Absolutely. It's also red. And you can see it's kind of shiny in there as well, too.

857
01:38:23,288 --> 01:38:26,708
So those are exactly the things that we look for. Thank you very much.

858
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:29,828
I'm glad you guys are listening and paying attention. All right.

859
01:38:29,828 --> 01:38:33,608
And what about this one? And you said, okay.

860
01:38:39,428 --> 01:38:43,807
So we have some pale pink on the outside and then there's red around here.

861
01:38:43,808 --> 01:38:47,228
And then in the center we are seeing some white spots and these areas.

862
01:38:50,028 --> 01:38:54,538
Yeah. This is a third degree burn, Casey.

863
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:58,178
You're getting to be experts already. This is fantastic. Oops.

864
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:10,827
Okay. So in addition to the depth of the burn, we also talk about TBS, which is total body surface area.

865
01:39:10,828 --> 01:39:13,228
And this really impacts the type of interventions that are done.

866
01:39:14,128 --> 01:39:18,388
There's something called the rule of nines, and the more burns you have, the greater risk you are for other things.

867
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:25,108
Kids have a different way that they calculate a total body surface area than adults do.

868
01:39:26,278 --> 01:39:35,278
There's a lot of detail that we could go into, but just in general, patients who have greater than 20% TBS say are at greater risk of infection.

869
01:39:38,598 --> 01:39:48,168
Okay. So infections are really important to control for burn patients because 51% of burn patients that get an infection,

870
01:39:49,338 --> 01:39:53,478
those are that there's a 51% rate of mortality there.

871
01:39:54,258 --> 01:40:01,548
So infection is the leading cause of morbidity and 51% of mortality and burn patients.

872
01:40:02,028 --> 01:40:09,318
And if a patient survives that initial first few days after their burn injury, the most common cause of death is infection.

873
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:16,188
Since the skin is the largest organ on the body, it is the first defense against infection and burn patients.

874
01:40:16,698 --> 01:40:20,148
I mean, it's it's not there to protect the body.

875
01:40:21,138 --> 01:40:27,558
So burns increase that patient's susceptibility to infection by damaging both the patient's physical and immunological defenses.

876
01:40:31,778 --> 01:40:39,788
Okay. So when burned, the integrity of the skin barrier is broken and normally sterile sites become vulnerable to microbes.

877
01:40:40,298 --> 01:40:44,348
Blood flow is blocked and the environment becomes supportive to microbial growth.

878
01:40:44,948 --> 01:40:53,348
Also importantly is that internal physical barriers such as those found in the GI tract start to leak and becomes a source of sepsis.

879
01:40:55,958 --> 01:40:59,798
Have you guys heard about sepsis before?

880
01:41:01,908 --> 01:41:05,288
Yes. Some people shaking their heads. Yes. Okay. Well, sepsis is Earth.

881
01:41:05,298 --> 01:41:11,928
September is Sepsis Awareness Month. So if you haven't, take a look, you know, read about it.

882
01:41:11,928 --> 01:41:16,398
It's really interesting. It's about is extreme response to an infection that happens.

883
01:41:19,218 --> 01:41:26,928
So some indicators of sepsis are tachycardia tachypnea and changes to white blood cells and health care providers.

884
01:41:27,138 --> 01:41:33,228
Like look for these clues to identify sepsis because it's not always easily identifiable.

885
01:41:33,228 --> 01:41:39,078
There's this spot sepsis is the promo for September.

886
01:41:40,218 --> 01:41:44,118
So I bring this up because there's like a sepsis trigger.

887
01:41:44,948 --> 01:41:49,788
There's like a standard definition for all kinds of patients. And these things are, like I mentioned, temperature.

888
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:56,328
So if somebody spikes a fever, if their heart rate goes up, if their respiratory rate goes up, and if their white blood cell count goes up.

889
01:41:56,988 --> 01:42:00,528
But with burn patients, these things are happening all the time.

890
01:42:00,828 --> 01:42:07,758
So burn professionals got together and figured out this huge long list of things to

891
01:42:07,758 --> 01:42:10,938
look for in burn patients specifically like we don't need to go through it all.

892
01:42:10,938 --> 01:42:15,377
I just want you to understand that there are a ton of extra things that are going on from patients

893
01:42:15,378 --> 01:42:19,428
that people need to pay attention to in order to help protect these patients from infection.

894
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:28,158
Okay. So to classify burn wounds, I just make sure I'm keeping myself going here.

895
01:42:28,218 --> 01:42:38,568
Okay. So like the the least intense is impetigo, which is just a loss of the epithelium.

896
01:42:39,348 --> 01:42:42,977
When we start to see wound colonization, this is usually like a wash.

897
01:42:42,978 --> 01:42:49,278
So wound colonization would be where bacteria accounts are less than ten to the fifth colonies.

898
01:42:49,278 --> 01:42:53,868
On the wounds surface, there would be like no surrounding erythema or cellulitis evident.

899
01:42:54,258 --> 01:42:59,178
We're just like kind of understanding that this patient has a little bit of its flora going on in that wound.

900
01:42:59,178 --> 01:43:13,548
And it's okay for now. Beyond that, once the organism start to be greater than ten to the fifth and we're seeing warmth or pain and some swelling,

901
01:43:13,788 --> 01:43:19,878
we start to think that this is a local infection and treatment might be initiated.

902
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:26,237
Beyond that, we have an invasive infection, which is, again, that amount of organisms,

903
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:30,648
and then there would be necrosis and unburnt tissues that are surrounding that burn.

904
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:35,718
There would be changes in the burn wound. It'll be black or brown or violation.

905
01:43:35,788 --> 01:43:37,248
There's another term that they use.

906
01:43:37,248 --> 01:43:46,208
And then there can also be histopathological microbiological analysis done to help determine how invasive those infections are.

907
01:43:50,948 --> 01:43:54,938
Okay. I'm going to breathe for a second and have a sip of my water.

908
01:43:55,208 --> 01:43:59,268
Does anybody have any questions up till now? Oh, yeah.

909
01:43:59,288 --> 01:44:03,518
Just why does it do? Is there a reason?

910
01:44:04,688 --> 01:44:09,368
Well, as a matter of fact, we have a clinician in our presence who can answer that very clinical question for you.

911
01:44:11,018 --> 01:44:15,218
Sorry. What was once a week at war?

912
01:44:15,518 --> 01:44:18,758
Skin infection. Body's response. Oh, why does it do more?

913
01:44:18,998 --> 01:44:25,868
That's a really great question. This inhibits growth maybe.

914
01:44:26,198 --> 01:44:33,037
Yeah. And I think, you know, I think it's it's just part of the body's inflammatory response.

915
01:44:33,038 --> 01:44:41,258
You know, if you have an infection somewhere, then there's going to be, you know, white blood cells and cytokines and all the like.

916
01:44:41,258 --> 01:44:45,968
All of our body's immune responses are going to kind of localized in that area.

917
01:44:47,348 --> 01:44:54,757
And it often creates this kind of red local redness and more that we see not just in burn patients,

918
01:44:54,758 --> 01:45:01,268
but really any patient who has kind of a localized skin infection.

919
01:45:01,868 --> 01:45:12,788
I'm sure there's some very complicated immunologic answer I could give you, but I honestly don't know that it's like we let you go in my my learning.

920
01:45:13,058 --> 01:45:16,648
But I think it's just part of the body's inflammatory response. Yeah.

921
01:45:16,658 --> 01:45:21,428
Even with, like, mosquito bites or, like, with bee stings or like these other things that we're familiar with,

922
01:45:21,428 --> 01:45:26,768
we get, like, warm and swollen around those around those injuries as well, too.

923
01:45:27,668 --> 01:45:31,508
It's just a sign that something is not going the right way.

924
01:45:32,498 --> 01:45:36,577
It's not right. Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay.

925
01:45:36,578 --> 01:45:40,278
So we talk about NHS and a lot. Um,

926
01:45:40,718 --> 01:45:45,278
this is the national health care safety networks that gives us all definitions so that everywhere

927
01:45:45,278 --> 01:45:49,928
across the United States we're all talking about the same thing in the same way for consistency.

928
01:45:50,528 --> 01:45:54,338
So when it comes to burns, it's totally subjective.

929
01:45:54,398 --> 01:46:02,707
Like this is the burn definition. So they have a burn wound and it looks kind of gross, like that's basically it.

930
01:46:02,708 --> 01:46:08,638
And then they have something growing in their blood. So this is really where as an infection prevention is.

931
01:46:08,678 --> 01:46:12,458
I rely on the clinicians, on the unit to say, Hey, what's going on?

932
01:46:12,818 --> 01:46:18,068
They'll say, Hey, look, looks and smells kind of pseudomonas, they don't know or something like that.

933
01:46:18,068 --> 01:46:22,387
And then they will treat based on their clinical assessment because it is really,

934
01:46:22,388 --> 01:46:27,518
really difficult to get a positive culture off of these burn wounds and.

935
01:46:29,808 --> 01:46:33,198
Okay. Um.

936
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:41,028
Okay. So once there is a burn wound, the ways that we help to heal that skin is by grafting.

937
01:46:42,138 --> 01:46:47,957
As long as it's not infected. So there's a bunch of different types of grafts that surgeons will use.

938
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:53,978
There is an autographed and allograft, a xenograft, which is really interesting, but we can't get anymore.

939
01:46:53,988 --> 01:46:58,758
Unfortunately, that's tissue from a different species.

940
01:47:00,858 --> 01:47:06,557
Used to be there was like one company that would make like pig skin grafts and

941
01:47:06,558 --> 01:47:09,708
then the surgeons really liked them because they would use them temporarily.

942
01:47:09,978 --> 01:47:12,078
And then the graft would get really hard,

943
01:47:12,078 --> 01:47:20,028
like a football and pop off on its own so they wouldn't have to like go in and take that graft off again and subject the patient to another procedure.

944
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:23,438
It was actually pretty cool, but only in specific uses.

945
01:47:25,938 --> 01:47:30,438
Anyway. Then there's also split thickness skin grafts and full thickness skin grafts.

946
01:47:30,438 --> 01:47:37,968
And that just depends on how much of the epidermis or the dermis is being transferred during that those graphics.

947
01:47:38,898 --> 01:47:42,768
So if you you'll hear words like that if you ever cover a burning.

948
01:47:46,548 --> 01:47:53,058
So beyond burn wound infections, burn patients are really, really susceptible to a lot of other infections,

949
01:47:53,808 --> 01:48:01,878
bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, endocarditis, pneumonia, support of thrombosis, virus as well.

950
01:48:03,108 --> 01:48:11,838
Pneumonia tends to be a really big risk because patients who are in like a house fire will have had an inhalation injury.

951
01:48:13,508 --> 01:48:16,548
I think I actually do. I have a picture of that.

952
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:27,588
I think you do. It's coming up. Anyway, so all of these things are really important in burn patients because when your body is burned,

953
01:48:27,588 --> 01:48:31,278
it starts to freak out and it starts to push fluids in those cells.

954
01:48:31,278 --> 01:48:36,858
It pushes the fluid out of those cells. And so we need to replace a lot of those fluids in those patients.

955
01:48:37,278 --> 01:48:42,917
And whenever you're thinking about needing to replace things in patients or mess around with patients, we think about central lines.

956
01:48:42,918 --> 01:48:49,727
We think about fully catheters. We think about all these interventions that are happening, and we're helping them breathe with ventilators.

957
01:48:49,728 --> 01:48:54,408
So there's a ton of risk besides just that burn wound infection.

958
01:48:57,918 --> 01:49:05,478
And whenever you have a concern for hospital acquired infections, you do things like making bundles.

959
01:49:05,868 --> 01:49:09,467
So to prevent things like collapses and causes, we have all of these bundles,

960
01:49:09,468 --> 01:49:14,388
I'm sure I think have and maybe just talked to you guys last week about a V bundle, maybe.

961
01:49:15,348 --> 01:49:20,238
Yes. Okay. So all of those things are are what we do to prevent these infections.

962
01:49:21,228 --> 01:49:24,978
And it's just like a bundle is just like a bunch of different things together

963
01:49:24,978 --> 01:49:30,978
that you like make a check box and people make sure that they do them every day. Okay.

964
01:49:31,728 --> 01:49:34,938
I just want to touch on trauma wound infections very briefly.

965
01:49:36,498 --> 01:49:44,718
A traumatic wound is a sudden, unplanned injury that can range from like very minor things such as a skin knee or severe as a gunshot wound.

966
01:49:46,578 --> 01:49:50,658
They can be lacerations, skin, tears, bites, burns or penetrating trauma wounds.

967
01:49:51,828 --> 01:49:55,907
Um, see, despite the reduction in post traumatic sepsis over the past few decades,

968
01:49:55,908 --> 01:50:00,408
the mortality of septic trauma in patients is still really high up to 23%.

969
01:50:01,378 --> 01:50:07,308
And open injuries have a potential for serious bacterial wound infections that can lead to long term disability,

970
01:50:07,308 --> 01:50:10,458
chronic wound or bone infection and death.

971
01:50:15,138 --> 01:50:20,178
Okay. And that's it. That's just that's all I have for you on trauma ones. They're big and messy and terrible.

972
01:50:20,868 --> 01:50:29,417
So the significant, most significant pathogens that we see in burn patients are things like Mersa, Pseudomonas,

973
01:50:29,418 --> 01:50:39,198
Acinetobacter, V3 and Tera Bacteria S.A. And we did used to be really concerned about beta hemolytic group a strep.

974
01:50:39,678 --> 01:50:46,098
But really now with our antibiotics, we don't we don't see that as a major pathogen as much anymore.

975
01:50:50,118 --> 01:50:54,257
Something that's very interesting about burn patients is they are more likely to be

976
01:50:54,258 --> 01:51:00,138
to have certain infections during certain times after their after their incident.

977
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:07,668
So in the beginning of a patient's admission, we worry most about things like staph aureus and skin and soft tissue infections occurring.

978
01:51:08,088 --> 01:51:11,987
As their hospital progression goes on,

979
01:51:11,988 --> 01:51:20,868
we start to worry about other things like pseudomonas pneumonia and antibacterial resistance developing in these patients.

980
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:37,918
Another significant pathogen is fungi. So fungal infections for burn and trauma wounds can be missed.

981
01:51:40,228 --> 01:51:42,998
They're really, really hard to culture.

982
01:51:43,018 --> 01:51:53,188
Only about 30% of cultures are positive for patients who actually do have a fungal wound infection, which is kind of frustrating.

983
01:51:53,188 --> 01:52:00,148
But anyway, so most of the fungal infections are caused by like Canada or Aspergillus are the most common things that we see.

984
01:52:00,538 --> 01:52:04,978
There's also other things like nuclear rise of pests. If you guys are familiar with those.

985
01:52:06,328 --> 01:52:13,348
Canada is most commonly part of the patients own flora, whereas other things are part of the environment.

986
01:52:13,358 --> 01:52:19,468
So depending on what kind of fungus you're seeing in the patient is where you would look for different kinds of sources.

987
01:52:23,308 --> 01:52:26,588
Okay. 1104 How much time do we have? I want to.

988
01:52:26,818 --> 01:52:32,668
What, 10 to 12? 10 to 12. Okay. All right.

989
01:52:34,138 --> 01:52:41,518
And so that is wounds, infections and what causes them.

990
01:52:42,718 --> 01:52:48,058
So I kind of wanted to talk with you guys a little bit about the epidemiology of burn wound infections.

991
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:53,158
Talk about like the infectious agent. This is this is what we call.

992
01:52:56,728 --> 01:53:00,118
The chain of infection. I'm sorry. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe I couldn't remember that.

993
01:53:00,118 --> 01:53:03,597
But have you seen, like, this image before? Kind of.

994
01:53:03,598 --> 01:53:06,448
And there's like usually links of a chain that go around it.

995
01:53:08,968 --> 01:53:17,908
So if we can break the chain between any one of these sources, then we can prevent an infection and a patient.

996
01:53:20,978 --> 01:53:25,358
Okay. So things that we think about are reservoirs.

997
01:53:26,888 --> 01:53:32,618
Reservoirs for can be things like the surfaces of the burn wounds themselves.

998
01:53:33,188 --> 01:53:36,638
Also the hands of personnel. So we worry about hand hygiene.

999
01:53:36,668 --> 01:53:42,098
You guys are on that. And we also worry about inanimate objects in the environment.

1000
01:53:42,098 --> 01:53:45,698
So like hydrotherapy equipment and plumbing.

1001
01:53:47,498 --> 01:53:51,668
The over here, this is something called a patient care unit or PC use.

1002
01:53:51,668 --> 01:53:52,778
We call them in the hospital.

1003
01:53:52,778 --> 01:54:04,567
So in an ICU room, it's a toilet and a sink and there's actually dialysis hook up for in like in this little box right here.

1004
01:54:04,568 --> 01:54:08,408
There's like a drain for dialysis water.

1005
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:12,878
So anyway, so these have been indicated and mold infections in the past.

1006
01:54:13,928 --> 01:54:19,268
So it's always important to think about what is actually in the immediate environment.

1007
01:54:20,138 --> 01:54:24,008
Also cooling blankets, mattresses, linens, those sorts of things.

1008
01:54:24,608 --> 01:54:32,348
Plants are not allowed in the burn unit. There's lots of little organisms that can be living in the soil, so we do not allow those.

1009
01:54:34,418 --> 01:54:39,008
Also, the colonic flora of patients can be a reservoir for their infections as well.

1010
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:49,557
Here are some fun pictures of places to look to see if these things have happened

1011
01:54:49,558 --> 01:54:53,728
or are happening around your patients if they start to develop a mold infection.

1012
01:54:58,028 --> 01:55:04,718
Construction can be a source, the air handling and ventilation, and then, of course, flooding events.

1013
01:55:09,908 --> 01:55:16,088
There can also be major explosive events. We had an instance in the burn unit where we had a patient develop.

1014
01:55:16,868 --> 01:55:27,517
Well, actually a couple that were in their house exploded due to some activities that they were doing in their

1015
01:55:27,518 --> 01:55:35,318
house and they developed severe fungal infections and we could not figure out what the source was.

1016
01:55:37,238 --> 01:55:41,707
And they had like a multi-drug resistant acinetobacter so much that the state called and said, Hey,

1017
01:55:41,708 --> 01:55:45,968
do you know that your bug is carrying the super special gene that we are really worried about?

1018
01:55:47,168 --> 01:56:00,308
And so it's pretty bad. But anyway, so one thing that we didn't actually know until we had a Q AA meeting and a nurse who was a veteran was like,

1019
01:56:00,428 --> 01:56:06,998
What are you guys talking about? This fungi, this bacteria was pushed into their body from this explosion event.

1020
01:56:08,078 --> 01:56:14,408
It's like, oh my God. Like, I never would have thought about that without that person's experience in the Middle East.

1021
01:56:15,248 --> 01:56:19,688
Like, we see this all the time. It was seated at the time of the event, not in our environment.

1022
01:56:20,498 --> 01:56:27,578
So we all took a deep breath and relaxed a little bit once we identified that as a source.

1023
01:56:29,318 --> 01:56:34,328
So anyway, it's not always your construction. Sometimes it can be from something that the patient brought with them.

1024
01:56:36,368 --> 01:56:42,307
Okay. So there's reservoirs and now modes of transmission.

1025
01:56:42,308 --> 01:56:47,288
So transmission is primarily direct or indirect contact through hands of personnel or fomites.

1026
01:56:49,388 --> 01:56:55,208
The burn patients also have hydrotherapy treatments, which is where they take.

1027
01:56:57,218 --> 01:57:02,018
This is a picture of our tub from our tub room right here.

1028
01:57:03,998 --> 01:57:12,838
Oh, sorry. Anyway, so it's not a tub, but the sides of this bed kind of come up and it creates like a a bathing environment for the patients.

1029
01:57:12,838 --> 01:57:16,088
So we roll this into our tub room.

1030
01:57:16,698 --> 01:57:20,377
I have slides in here and then right here you can see that there's a spray hose that

1031
01:57:20,378 --> 01:57:24,818
comes down from the ceiling and it's kind of like power washing that patients wounds.

1032
01:57:25,978 --> 01:57:33,448
Um, and it's seriously intense. It's a, it's exhausting for the nursing staff that is in that room rolling the patient around.

1033
01:57:33,458 --> 01:57:36,488
Usually if they are in this room, they are sedated.

1034
01:57:36,488 --> 01:57:46,778
So there's also a bunch of anesthesia equipment as well. It can be a really, really messy treatment.

1035
01:57:47,618 --> 01:57:54,638
Water gets sprayed everywhere on all the supplies that are in the room. It's really important that cleaning of this room happens with care.

1036
01:57:57,488 --> 01:57:59,528
Okay, sorry. That's our hydrotherapy treatments.

1037
01:57:59,528 --> 01:58:05,258
There's also airborne transmission, and that has been reported, but it's not really the greatest concern.

1038
01:58:05,438 --> 01:58:14,108
And burn units, um, brakes and precaution can be a mode of transmission as well as staffing patterns.

1039
01:58:14,108 --> 01:58:19,838
When people are tired and overworked, we can have breaks and precautions.

1040
01:58:23,408 --> 01:58:27,458
Hmm. Oh, there's the inhalation injury. It's nasty.

1041
01:58:28,328 --> 01:58:31,467
Mm. Yeah.

1042
01:58:31,468 --> 01:58:36,718
I think they usually give them that cyanide, the cyanide treatment.

1043
01:58:37,628 --> 01:58:41,848
So when they have an inhalation injury like that, that's beyond me.

1044
01:58:41,848 --> 01:58:50,128
But it's really interesting. Okay.

1045
01:58:51,238 --> 01:58:56,278
So some of those factors that can affect their susceptibility to an infection is going to be,

1046
01:58:56,278 --> 01:59:04,948
like I mentioned previously that to say if it's a major versus a minor burn that 20% I was talking about before.

1047
01:59:06,188 --> 01:59:12,147
Um if they have antimicrobial resistance a history of that,

1048
01:59:12,148 --> 01:59:20,488
if they have immune suppression or any kind of dysfunction if there was the smoke inhalation or if there's an alias

1049
01:59:20,968 --> 01:59:27,718
aliases when your bowels decide to stop doing their thing and stuff kind of sticks around down there for a while.

1050
01:59:28,558 --> 01:59:33,958
Also, I involvement ocular burns are pretty intense.

1051
01:59:36,258 --> 01:59:43,878
Okay. So surveillance and all these different patients needs to be routine.

1052
01:59:44,268 --> 01:59:51,668
Do you guys know what active surveillance culturing means? Yes or no?

1053
01:59:55,028 --> 02:00:01,208
Yeah. No, no. Okay. I'll take that as a no. All right.

1054
02:00:01,418 --> 02:00:08,738
So whenever a patient comes into the burn unit, we swab them, we swab their nose for Mersa MRSA,

1055
02:00:09,398 --> 02:00:16,448
and that is us actively looking on this patient if they are cold, if they are colonized with Mersa.

1056
02:00:16,718 --> 02:00:20,408
And so that is an active surveillance culture. We are not looking for an infection.

1057
02:00:21,638 --> 02:00:27,128
For like clinical treatment. We just want to know if they are bringing that organism in with them to our unit.

1058
02:00:28,508 --> 02:00:32,317
So we do that with Mersa and our AC use.

1059
02:00:32,318 --> 02:00:38,948
We also do that with very we also do that with some other things for special initiatives.

1060
02:00:39,588 --> 02:00:54,458
So we also have a protocol for culturing transfers from outside hospitals into our burn unit for multi-drug resistant organisms.

1061
02:00:56,528 --> 02:01:02,138
And so they will put patients on contact precautions preemptively until those test results come back.

1062
02:01:04,748 --> 02:01:10,878
Um, pussy. Oh, okay.

1063
02:01:10,898 --> 02:01:15,307
So not only do we test patients for Mersa, we do active surveillance culturing.

1064
02:01:15,308 --> 02:01:17,078
When they come into our unit for the first time.

1065
02:01:17,078 --> 02:01:26,737
We also test them every week just to see if they have gotten Marcell while they were in our unit and we haven't had those in a long time,

1066
02:01:26,738 --> 02:01:31,278
so that's really great. Okay.

1067
02:01:34,308 --> 02:01:37,458
So do you guys know what transmission based precautions are?

1068
02:01:39,298 --> 02:01:44,668
Yes. Okay. Got him getting headshots. Yes. Okay. So do you know what standard precautions are?

1069
02:01:46,668 --> 02:01:51,558
Yes. Okay. I'm fine. Thank you. All right. So I can talk less so.

1070
02:01:54,648 --> 02:01:57,438
Well, now I don't know what to say about transmission based precautions.

1071
02:01:57,438 --> 02:02:03,648
We have contact precautions D, which is diarrheal contact precautions are regular old contact precautions green,

1072
02:02:04,188 --> 02:02:10,098
which is for things like carbapenem resistance.

1073
02:02:10,788 --> 02:02:14,058
Or if patients have open draining mersa wounds that are really gross,

1074
02:02:14,058 --> 02:02:21,768
they'll be our contact precautions regularly have protective precautions for patients who have suppressed immune systems for some reason.

1075
02:02:21,768 --> 02:02:26,478
And we have droplet precautions, which is what we do for respiratory viruses.

1076
02:02:29,958 --> 02:02:33,228
Most of them. We have one now where we do more than that.

1077
02:02:33,228 --> 02:02:42,228
But you know, well, COVID, COVID requires a little bit more, um, which is called special pathogens precautions in our hospital.

1078
02:02:42,228 --> 02:02:48,318
And I don't have it included here. Okay, let's see.

1079
02:02:49,698 --> 02:02:53,657
So transmission based precautions are recommended.

1080
02:02:53,658 --> 02:03:00,318
Infection prevention strategies like hand hygiene reminders, wearing gowns and gloves when you're supposed to.

1081
02:03:01,908 --> 02:03:05,987
And we actually do this for patients who have greater than 20% large burn wounds.

1082
02:03:05,988 --> 02:03:09,978
We have like a burn precaution, which is basically contact precautions.

1083
02:03:11,028 --> 02:03:12,768
And I'm really sorry, but I have a tickle in my throat.

1084
02:03:20,428 --> 02:03:27,558
I have other things that we do as part of our transmission based precautions are restricting non washable toys.

1085
02:03:27,828 --> 02:03:31,638
We have pediatric patients and the burn unit because.

1086
02:03:34,008 --> 02:03:38,028
Just because of it's the most appropriate place for them to get their care at times depending.

1087
02:03:38,538 --> 02:03:41,898
And then sometimes they will go back over to the pediatric hospital.

1088
02:03:43,788 --> 02:03:44,988
But when they are on our unit,

1089
02:03:44,988 --> 02:03:53,118
they can't have anything like stuffed animals that were from another patient or anything like that because it cannot be cleaned appropriately.

1090
02:03:56,218 --> 02:04:02,838
Get mad at me about taking away their boardgames too. Okay.

1091
02:04:03,388 --> 02:04:08,248
Other prevention strategies beyond transmission based precautions are strict aseptic technique,

1092
02:04:08,248 --> 02:04:12,298
the use of sterile gloves and dressing materials, especially for dressing changes.

1093
02:04:12,778 --> 02:04:16,047
And you guys have your classy talk already? Yes. Okay.

1094
02:04:16,048 --> 02:04:23,068
So those dressing changes, we make sure that everybody's messed up and that sterile technique is being adhered to.

1095
02:04:23,848 --> 02:04:27,537
And again, like I said, these burn patients, like almost always have a central line.

1096
02:04:27,538 --> 02:04:32,338
So all of those things are something that the staff practices often.

1097
02:04:34,848 --> 02:04:39,278
Let's see. Hmm.

1098
02:04:40,128 --> 02:04:45,138
Other things that used to be done in the burn unit were the use of things like sterile sheets and

1099
02:04:45,138 --> 02:04:50,118
prophylactically treating patients with antibiotics and leaving dressings alone and not touching them.

1100
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:58,878
And we don't do those things anymore. Now we have routine of visuals, eyes, patients, wounds.

1101
02:05:01,138 --> 02:05:09,838
Serious. Infection prevention practices are super important to burn patients to the burn team concept.

1102
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:19,857
I do a ten rounds with the burn team at least once a week, up to three times a week, and offer input.

1103
02:05:19,858 --> 02:05:26,968
Make sure patients are isolated appropriately. Make sure that all of their bundle elements are being met and offer guidance as appropriate.

1104
02:05:29,618 --> 02:05:32,068
But like I said, this is a team based strategy.

1105
02:05:32,078 --> 02:05:38,498
It's not just like, you know, doctors and an infection prevention as there is the wound management team, there is nutrition.

1106
02:05:38,498 --> 02:05:41,798
Their nutrition is really, really important to burn patients.

1107
02:05:42,098 --> 02:05:45,488
They have to get the calories in order for their skin to regenerate.

1108
02:05:46,298 --> 02:05:51,968
And there's always respiratory therapist there and pharmacy and some other team members are there as well.

1109
02:05:51,968 --> 02:05:58,278
It's really dynamic teams. Um.

1110
02:05:58,278 --> 02:06:01,698
Let's see, um, kind of skip over this.

1111
02:06:03,108 --> 02:06:08,538
Um. Ooh. Actually, this is kind of neat, you guys. This is a grafting machine technique that they do.

1112
02:06:08,658 --> 02:06:14,297
They, like, take the skin graft from somewhere on a patient's body, and then they split it all up,

1113
02:06:14,298 --> 02:06:17,748
and then they stretch it out, and then they can cover more area of someone's skin like that.

1114
02:06:17,868 --> 02:06:21,977
It's really neat. SERE technique.

1115
02:06:21,978 --> 02:06:24,078
I forget the acronym. It's got something special.

1116
02:06:25,188 --> 02:06:34,428
Okay, so all of those things that I've talked about so far are pretty globally implemented in burn units like across the country.

1117
02:06:34,758 --> 02:06:37,968
Things that we do unique to our unit.

1118
02:06:38,878 --> 02:06:48,078
Um, are that staff members on the ICU are required to wear clean hospital scrubs prior to providing direct patient care.

1119
02:06:48,748 --> 02:06:55,578
Um, I can go on the unit and my regular street clothes, but it's not okay for me to go and do patient care.

1120
02:06:55,608 --> 02:07:00,708
I mean, that would be out of my scope of practice anyway. But if I were a nurse, I couldn't be wearing my street clothes.

1121
02:07:02,758 --> 02:07:06,468
Um. Oh, we use extra PPE.

1122
02:07:06,498 --> 02:07:11,957
Oh, I'm sorry. I misspoke earlier. I said 20% greater than 20% to say, do we implement burn precautions?

1123
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:17,748
That's greater than 10%. And so then that's when we use sterile gloves and hats as well.

1124
02:07:17,748 --> 02:07:24,138
And masks. Any time those wounds are down, we call it wounds being done when the dressings are not on those wounds.

1125
02:07:25,488 --> 02:07:35,868
Um, wound rounds, I kind of mentioned that. And then we also have all of our ICU beds are private with the exception of one semi-private room.

1126
02:07:35,868 --> 02:07:46,798
Typically in that room will go people who came in together. We also do not allow coats.

1127
02:07:47,908 --> 02:07:51,928
They hang them on little hooks outside of the patient room and leave them there before they do their hand hygiene.

1128
02:07:53,248 --> 02:07:57,178
So any unnecessary items like bags and everything are left outside of the room.

1129
02:07:57,328 --> 02:08:04,258
Something that was also implemented as the use of iPads so that everyone on the rounding team doesn't need to go into the patient room.

1130
02:08:04,258 --> 02:08:10,078
You can stand outside and watch the monitor and then one person will hold the iPad and that's the only thing that they're doing.

1131
02:08:10,768 --> 02:08:16,138
And show the show the patient's wounds to everyone else on the team.

1132
02:08:21,438 --> 02:08:24,858
Okay. I said a lot. I think this is getting.

1133
02:08:27,348 --> 02:08:32,448
Yeah. Okay. Getting to the end. So out of all of the words that I said,

1134
02:08:32,448 --> 02:08:35,597
the most important things that I want you guys to remember that you heard is

1135
02:08:35,598 --> 02:08:39,377
that thermal injury results in a significant suppression of the immune system,

1136
02:08:39,378 --> 02:08:47,148
putting these patients at great risk for infection, um, for like wound infections collapse these causes.

1137
02:08:47,178 --> 02:08:55,007
V And the sepsis. So sepsis is also defined differently in bird patients because of the burn itself,

1138
02:08:55,008 --> 02:08:58,638
causing the metabolic changes that mimic sepsis and unburned individuals.

1139
02:08:59,808 --> 02:09:04,308
Infection and sepsis are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in burn patients,

1140
02:09:04,878 --> 02:09:12,918
and infection prevention and control are complex and preventing rise and burn patients and must be carefully integrated into all aspects of burn.

1141
02:09:12,918 --> 02:09:17,358
Patient care and interventions range from surveillance like that,

1142
02:09:17,358 --> 02:09:24,468
active surveillance capturing a shared with you guys also to bundle measures you know,

1143
02:09:24,528 --> 02:09:27,707
groups of activities that somebody does every day and checks the box to say, yes,

1144
02:09:27,708 --> 02:09:37,218
this patient has met standards of care that are what we say is the best to prevent infection in this patient and also transmission based precautions.

1145
02:09:37,218 --> 02:09:50,178
And then lastly, investigations. So briefly, I will talk to you about an investigation on a burning.

1146
02:09:53,628 --> 02:09:56,688
Which for a while there was happening every couple of weeks.

1147
02:09:57,108 --> 02:10:06,498
So just then. Okay. Anyway, so let's pretend you're me and your trusty data analyst emailed you this line list.

1148
02:10:07,368 --> 02:10:10,728
All right. So what is the first thing you do?

1149
02:10:13,168 --> 02:10:16,628
Yeah. Well, the first thing you do.

1150
02:10:16,638 --> 02:10:22,188
What is that? As opposed to what you think? And you're like, Gina, you did not talk about C difficile at all yet in bird patients.

1151
02:10:22,188 --> 02:10:29,228
What is this thing that you're describing to us? We've never heard of it before, which is I'm sure you guys have heard of stuff before.

1152
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:38,058
That's excellent. Okay. So Clostridium difficile and I just said that because I really like saying that word.

1153
02:10:38,118 --> 02:10:43,997
It's very fun. It causes diarrhea. Right. And this is not just like your regular kind of loose tooling.

1154
02:10:43,998 --> 02:10:50,987
This is big explosive, very stinky, very smelly, really painful and annoying diarrhea patients.

1155
02:10:50,988 --> 02:11:02,328
With these risk factors, you can be over 65, but but really, anybody can get SIDA antibiotics, hospitalizations and weakened immune systems.

1156
02:11:02,328 --> 02:11:06,498
Those are I mean, that's what we see in I've heard patients.

1157
02:11:06,498 --> 02:11:12,648
Right. So they're checking automatically three out of these five risk factors.

1158
02:11:13,428 --> 02:11:22,818
So on that list, I was sent to see if cases which usually on any unit would not be a big deal, but in our burn unit is a really huge, huge deal.

1159
02:11:24,108 --> 02:11:28,038
So if you were me, you guys, what is the first thing that you would do?

1160
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:41,608
We would ensure transmission based precautions are in place on that patient.

1161
02:11:42,118 --> 02:11:48,538
Your biggest concern, as soon as you find out that somebody has something that could affect another patient is control it, contain it.

1162
02:11:49,438 --> 02:11:56,308
All right. So what kind of transmission based precautions do you think a patient with see to these?

1163
02:11:57,578 --> 02:12:00,998
Yeah. Yes. Thank you, Matthew.

1164
02:12:00,998 --> 02:12:06,758
Excellent. Appreciate that very much. So.

1165
02:12:07,058 --> 02:12:20,588
So, yes. Contact precautions D. Okay, so contact precautions D dictates that everybody has to clean their hands when they're going into the room.

1166
02:12:20,588 --> 02:12:24,608
What should we expect anyway? But also our gowns and gloves on entry.

1167
02:12:24,788 --> 02:12:27,788
When they come out, they have to use soap and water to clean their hands.

1168
02:12:28,178 --> 02:12:32,708
Anything going in and out of that room needs to be cleaned with bleach wipes.

1169
02:12:34,008 --> 02:12:43,548
Except if you're on the burn unit where they do something special, which I will describe.

1170
02:12:44,758 --> 02:12:50,478
And the big thing about using bleach is that it's a spore site and it kills the spores that see the forms.

1171
02:12:51,528 --> 02:12:54,828
And it's very easy to use bleach because it has a low contact time.

1172
02:12:55,668 --> 02:13:05,028
And the burn unit, they happen to use something else called oxide that they mix up on the unit and use that to clean all of their implements.

1173
02:13:05,028 --> 02:13:13,028
And that is because of. Bleach allergies for some individuals that are down there.

1174
02:13:13,028 --> 02:13:17,688
So they have to use something else. Anyway.

1175
02:13:19,278 --> 02:13:28,278
So we do this surveillance of CTF testing and we review these first ten cases of hospital onset, see death.

1176
02:13:28,848 --> 02:13:33,858
And because of that, I reached out to our environmental services team and asked them to begin a really good,

1177
02:13:33,858 --> 02:13:36,287
deep, clean spore cycle, deep, clean of the unit.

1178
02:13:36,288 --> 02:13:40,788
And so that means they go around with their oxy inside and they clean all the keyboards and everything.

1179
02:13:40,788 --> 02:13:48,858
People are touching all the surfaces, all the handrails like the doorknobs, anywhere that they can claim they will clean.

1180
02:13:49,758 --> 02:13:54,118
They also have like an electrostatic sprayer that they go around and spray with, which is kind of cool too.

1181
02:13:54,138 --> 02:14:03,498
That's a little fun. And then at times when the employees who are allergic to bleach are not on the unit,

1182
02:14:03,498 --> 02:14:08,778
they will go through and use the bleach at those times as well, just as like a catch all.

1183
02:14:08,838 --> 02:14:15,018
So then you also, in addition to cleaning the environment and ensuring precautions are in place,

1184
02:14:15,468 --> 02:14:18,368
it's really important to remind the staff about why we're doing this,

1185
02:14:18,378 --> 02:14:21,378
make sure that they're wearing their PPE, make sure they're using soap and water,

1186
02:14:21,378 --> 02:14:27,228
and make sure that everyone remembers this very super special protocol that they have for their unique unit.

1187
02:14:28,008 --> 02:14:33,558
Mm hmm. Oh, I also had on their halo.

1188
02:14:33,648 --> 02:14:41,118
If you guys don't know what Halo is, it's this fun machine that spurts out like a big toxic cloud into the environment.

1189
02:14:41,118 --> 02:14:43,728
When no one's in there, they close it off. No people can be in there.

1190
02:14:44,118 --> 02:14:50,567
But the peroxide vapor does does kill spores in basically every crevice and so on.

1191
02:14:50,568 --> 02:14:54,978
Doesn't really have to stay shut. I think it's 3 hours.

1192
02:14:56,118 --> 02:15:00,408
That's pretty sure is that. I'm glad you remember how long it takes.

1193
02:15:02,358 --> 02:15:04,968
It's a few hours. I don't know the exact.

1194
02:15:06,608 --> 02:15:14,677
The amount of time that the room has to be shut down a few hours, which is kind of disruptive in terms of room turnover,

1195
02:15:14,678 --> 02:15:18,188
especially when we have, like, 50 patients waiting in the E.R. for a bed.

1196
02:15:18,748 --> 02:15:23,738
Um, yeah, but yeah, I don't remember, but it. It's a significant amount of time.

1197
02:15:24,098 --> 02:15:33,618
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this halo was done on rooms for not all CPD patients, just the ones that are there with spore formers like C deaf.

1198
02:15:33,668 --> 02:15:37,658
Yeah. And now we do it for our CRT patients as well.

1199
02:15:42,088 --> 02:15:49,888
Okay. So while all of this cleaning and fun stuff was happening, I was working on defining my cluster.

1200
02:15:50,728 --> 02:15:55,338
So and during that time period, a couple more cases showed up, which is not great.

1201
02:15:55,348 --> 02:16:02,397
So there's a couple of cases. So having four cases in a ten day time frame on this burn unit is really concerning,

1202
02:16:02,398 --> 02:16:09,058
especially since prior to December it had been four months since we had seen a case and one month prior to that.

1203
02:16:09,388 --> 02:16:14,428
So to have so many close together is it's not normal for the unit, right?

1204
02:16:15,088 --> 02:16:18,657
So we got a couple more cases.

1205
02:16:18,658 --> 02:16:23,388
They all of these patients had pretty lengthy stays. They didn't just show up and like show up with it.

1206
02:16:23,398 --> 02:16:29,608
If they've been here for a little bit and then developed it and they're all the same place on the same unit,

1207
02:16:29,608 --> 02:16:34,768
all in the same service, which is the same doctors rounding and treating.

1208
02:16:35,458 --> 02:16:38,728
And then all of these patients were symptomatic. That's what this yes.

1209
02:16:38,758 --> 02:16:41,817
Means over here. They all actually had disease.

1210
02:16:41,818 --> 02:16:45,428
Some didn't just, like order a test for Fonzie's. Okay.

1211
02:16:49,598 --> 02:16:51,247
So to figure out what's going on,

1212
02:16:51,248 --> 02:16:58,688
we reach out to our pharmacy and I.D. colleagues to better understand what kind of antibiotic pressure these patients were under.

1213
02:17:00,248 --> 02:17:08,647
After those folks took a review of our cluster patients, we figured out that they all were being treated with antibiotics appropriately.

1214
02:17:08,648 --> 02:17:14,048
For the most part, they either had a cellulitis going on, they had a pneumonia, or they had a bacteremia.

1215
02:17:14,468 --> 02:17:24,488
In some instances, there were overlaps of antibiotics, which, if you'll notice the dates here,

1216
02:17:25,208 --> 02:17:29,708
it's a pretty slim time for staffing and a lot of the things that we normally do,

1217
02:17:31,298 --> 02:17:36,098
like we might not have quality meetings or we might not have rounds during the holidays and things like that.

1218
02:17:36,098 --> 02:17:45,308
Like there can be like when I mentioned staffing changes before, that's kind of, you know, it could be a contributing factor to what is happening.

1219
02:17:47,588 --> 02:17:53,948
So in addition to the antibiotic pressure that can cause the death, there's also the environmental factors that I've kind of talked about.

1220
02:17:55,238 --> 02:18:00,278
These patients were so there's four patients and two and two were neighbors next to each other.

1221
02:18:00,278 --> 02:18:06,018
And all of them had visited our taproom. So fun that day.

1222
02:18:06,228 --> 02:18:11,358
This is the fun part about being an IP. You get to play around and like make diagrams.

1223
02:18:11,478 --> 02:18:21,168
So our first patient was in about 35 and had gone to the top of him several times over here.

1224
02:18:21,768 --> 02:18:29,358
Our second patient that popped up a couple of days later was on the other side of it, a few doors down, and then had also gone to the tap room.

1225
02:18:29,868 --> 02:18:32,928
Our third patient, same thing, was next to our index.

1226
02:18:33,108 --> 02:18:36,587
Our first patient index is incorrect.

1227
02:18:36,588 --> 02:18:44,038
We don't actually know who the index patient is. All this was happening at the same time, but they all shared this top commonality.

1228
02:18:45,108 --> 02:18:51,768
Then being close together could be significant. However, the nurses station is right here and right here.

1229
02:18:51,918 --> 02:18:59,418
This is where the nurses hang out most frequently. And so for patients that are on isolation precautions, they tend to place them there anyway.

1230
02:19:01,518 --> 02:19:10,418
It's there's less traffic in this end of the unit. So just because their neighbors doesn't necessarily mean it's significant, but it could be never.

1231
02:19:12,828 --> 02:19:16,878
Oh, this is the tab already showed that to you guys and talked to you about that.

1232
02:19:17,498 --> 02:19:26,178
And in this, too. Yeah. So this this is just a couple more pictures of like this is the corner of the top room where the bed kind of rolls in.

1233
02:19:27,018 --> 02:19:36,738
But also there's all this stuff because this is anesthesia equipment where their lines are hooked up for their medications that they need.

1234
02:19:37,398 --> 02:19:43,548
There is always so many supplies in this room that they actually can't even close the doors properly.

1235
02:19:44,208 --> 02:19:47,928
So there's potential for splashing and contamination into those supplies over there.

1236
02:19:49,608 --> 02:19:53,508
And then just kind of everything is overflowing. Like there's just a ton of stuff in this room.

1237
02:19:56,778 --> 02:20:00,248
And so because some more cases.

1238
02:20:00,838 --> 02:20:05,997
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just curious. How often do patients have to go to the doctor?

1239
02:20:05,998 --> 02:20:14,037
Like, how is that procedure? It totally depends on their type of burn, how deep it is, how much surface area it is.

1240
02:20:14,038 --> 02:20:16,798
And really, if they need anesthesia.

1241
02:20:17,608 --> 02:20:24,418
So if their burns are very painful and they can't do dressing changes in the room, then then it will happen in the room.

1242
02:20:28,178 --> 02:20:32,608
Thank you for the question. Um, okay.

1243
02:20:33,068 --> 02:20:42,158
Some additional things that we do now with more frequency is we test the p each of the sport side solution that they use.

1244
02:20:42,158 --> 02:20:50,648
There is a dispenser that pushes out water and spore cycle solution at a specific ratio.

1245
02:20:51,638 --> 02:20:57,188
And so it's extremely important that when they dispense it, they dispense it for use for like 15 seconds at least.

1246
02:20:57,188 --> 02:21:03,568
Like there's no like tap, tap tapping into your container that you're pulling the solution your spa aside into.

1247
02:21:03,578 --> 02:21:08,678
Otherwise you might just be tap, tap tapping straight water and not actually killing anything.

1248
02:21:09,278 --> 02:21:13,538
So again, these simple things that people may or may not know.

1249
02:21:14,918 --> 02:21:20,978
So because of that, we engage environmental services to share their training materials as far as the stuff goes.

1250
02:21:22,268 --> 02:21:25,358
We identified that there were PPE, complaints, opportunities.

1251
02:21:25,598 --> 02:21:30,157
Still, even after PPE reminders, there were also hand hygiene opportunities.

1252
02:21:30,158 --> 02:21:35,768
People were leaving using Purell. And also we reviewed the tavern cleaning process.

1253
02:21:35,778 --> 02:21:40,238
So that crazy busy room, there are three different kinds of people that clean that room.

1254
02:21:40,448 --> 02:21:42,488
There is a nursing staff that cleans nursing stuff.

1255
02:21:42,788 --> 02:21:48,728
There's anesthesia staff that cleans anesthesia stuff, there's environmental services that cleans environmental services stuff.

1256
02:21:49,718 --> 02:21:57,728
And one thing that I did discover is that the environmental services people would never clean any of the markers that were on

1257
02:21:57,728 --> 02:22:03,668
that dry erase board in a room because they would not touch the dry erase board that has patient information written on it.

1258
02:22:04,868 --> 02:22:11,107
So they wouldn't at ever cleaning any of those things. So when I asked nursing, Hey, when do you guys clean these markers?

1259
02:22:11,108 --> 02:22:16,628
They're like, What are you talking about? Environmental services? Does that mean. Okay, let's double check with environmental services.

1260
02:22:17,648 --> 02:22:21,158
Hey, environmental services. No, absolutely not. We will not touch it at all.

1261
02:22:22,088 --> 02:22:24,698
So when you have multiple things going on,

1262
02:22:24,698 --> 02:22:29,528
it's very important to make sure people are communicating and talking about their process and who does what.

1263
02:22:34,768 --> 02:22:38,847
Okay. We shared all the audit findings with leadership.

1264
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:46,647
It's extremely important to make sure leadership is engaged. We set up testing reminders to the residents and fellows, often on the burn unit.

1265
02:22:46,648 --> 02:22:53,818
When one person gets the death, they'd like to test everyone for death because all of a sudden everyone has it, whether they have symptoms or not.

1266
02:22:53,818 --> 02:22:59,158
We send them reminders. Please don't do that. Only test people if they have symptoms because they could be colonized with that.

1267
02:23:01,288 --> 02:23:08,938
And then we also requested that the unit do their own hand hygiene and PPE audits, and they did that for several weeks.

1268
02:23:10,258 --> 02:23:16,948
As of February 1st, following that outbreak, there were no additional cases and we declared the pandemic over.

1269
02:23:19,708 --> 02:23:23,808
With some recommendations that were limit the items in the top room.

1270
02:23:23,818 --> 02:23:26,488
It's a disaster in there. Keep it clean. Right.

1271
02:23:27,178 --> 02:23:34,738
And then we also made sure that nursing and environmental services and anesthesia are all talking to one another with the screening protocol.

1272
02:23:34,978 --> 02:23:40,468
Make sure everyone's aware of what they think they're cleaning with actually is a cleaning solution and not just water.

1273
02:23:42,118 --> 02:23:49,318
We also recommend reconsidering using a bleach process since it is a much more standard process throughout the rest of the hospital,

1274
02:23:49,918 --> 02:23:58,498
and also that the unit continues their PPE and hand hygiene audits, which they did for a little bit anyway.

1275
02:23:58,588 --> 02:24:04,168
So you never know what kind of an outbreak you're going to have in a burn unit.

1276
02:24:04,318 --> 02:24:07,888
These patients are super susceptible and it's something different all the time.

1277
02:24:11,058 --> 02:24:14,748
That's all I have. Did you guys have any questions?

1278
02:24:14,748 --> 02:24:22,758
Questions? Yeah, it really has.

1279
02:24:22,778 --> 02:24:26,098
It's not. Pertinent to that.

1280
02:24:26,138 --> 02:24:33,088
So but how does he decide what special interest to bring in Oklahoma?

1281
02:24:33,148 --> 02:24:35,728
But it has something to do with.

1282
02:24:39,558 --> 02:24:52,668
So when you're new and no one wants to cover a certain area and you raise your hand, you quickly find out why that is.

1283
02:24:53,028 --> 02:24:54,557
It's really complicated, actually.

1284
02:24:54,558 --> 02:25:06,078
And for Marissa to her and I were blessed with these really complicated areas when we're like new ideas and you learn a lot with that,

1285
02:25:06,078 --> 02:25:10,908
but you just do whatever sounds right at the time.

1286
02:25:13,708 --> 02:25:19,328
Oh, I don't know. I thought I wanted to do Pedes. I have no desire to go back and do Pedes infection prevention again.

1287
02:25:21,198 --> 02:25:27,428
So, yeah, cause you're you're dealing with all the complexities of the patients,

1288
02:25:27,908 --> 02:25:37,898
but also the personalities of the staff who work in particular areas, which can be I'm not going to say it, you know, a challenge.

1289
02:25:38,508 --> 02:25:50,438
Um, and so I think the newer IP is kind of, you know, end up taking some of these, you know, areas that maybe others don't want quite as much.

1290
02:25:50,448 --> 02:25:58,858
But, but you learn a lot. Mean I think that is really important to to touch on the fact that relationships and infection prevention are so important.

1291
02:25:58,888 --> 02:26:03,338
Yet if people don't like you, they won't come to your meeting.

1292
02:26:03,458 --> 02:26:04,118
Yeah, right.

1293
02:26:04,118 --> 02:26:11,888
And if they don't come to your meeting, you can't make anything happen because, you know, a lot of things that I get is like I'm not a nurse.

1294
02:26:12,548 --> 02:26:17,438
And I tell the nursing staff all the time that I am not trying to be a nurse, I'm not trying to be a physician.

1295
02:26:17,438 --> 02:26:23,737
I'm not trying to do any of those things, you know, like, you know, more than me when it comes to that patient at that bedside,

1296
02:26:23,738 --> 02:26:27,038
all I can do is offer my help from my perspective and the things that I know.

1297
02:26:27,728 --> 02:26:34,658
And you may not have time for that as a bedside nurse or, as, you know, a CNS nurse like you just might not have time.

1298
02:26:34,658 --> 02:26:41,918
And so I just want to be that resource to them. And I think coming at it from that way, whereas some people in infection prevention say, no,

1299
02:26:41,918 --> 02:26:52,748
this is what you have to do depending on the approach that you take, you may you know, I don't know, you may get different results.

1300
02:26:53,328 --> 02:26:57,518
Yeah. So it's just always maintaining like a collaborative attitude.

1301
02:27:00,188 --> 02:27:11,738
This is infection prevention. Yeah.

1302
02:27:12,068 --> 02:27:19,328
I think you might have mentioned this already, but I may have missed it. But I was between the burns and first, second and third degree.

1303
02:27:19,868 --> 02:27:27,128
Are there more infections but third degree compared to the rest of them or does it usually not matter?

1304
02:27:27,698 --> 02:27:30,427
I think it can depend.

1305
02:27:30,428 --> 02:27:37,928
But usually the bigger, deeper burns, the longer the patient is hospitalized and the longer it takes for their skin to grow back.

1306
02:27:37,928 --> 02:27:49,918
And so they're at greater risk because of that. Big, deep wounds are usually pretty sterile, except for, like, some deep pockets and.

1307
02:27:52,808 --> 02:27:57,398
You know, like some bacteria hiding in follicles and stuff like that, but otherwise they're pretty sterile.

1308
02:27:59,808 --> 02:28:03,708
Yeah. So length of stay is the greatest risk factor that.

1309
02:28:10,848 --> 02:28:17,238
All right. I'm not going to close this down. Anyway, let's.

1310
02:28:25,508 --> 02:28:26,478
All right.
