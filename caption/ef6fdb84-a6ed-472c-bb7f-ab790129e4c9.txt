1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,580
Good morning, everyone. My name is Phoebe Kulik. I'm the Program Manager

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,860
for the Region V Public Health Training Center. And we're happy to host

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,700
this webinar in partnership with the Center for Public Health Practice at

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,980
the Ohio State University College of Public Health.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,180
Just a bit about us: The Region V PHTC is part of the

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,600
National Public Health Learning Network. With nine other training centers

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,780
across the country, we seek to strengthen the skills of the current and

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,320
future public health workforce through continuing education and student

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,660
development. So we encourage you to check out our other training offerings

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:36,380
on our website at rvphtc.org. So today's webinar, Plan to Plan,

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,440
Introduction to Strategic Planning, is the first in a four part series.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,920
So we do hope that you join us for the other sessions as

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,520
well.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,220
Before I hand it over to Kelly Bragg, Program Manager at the OSU Center

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,060
for Public Health Practice, just a couple of housekeeping items.

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,940
We encourage you to share your questions throughout the presentation, and

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,640
we'll have time at the end for Q&A, as well as a few

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,800
breaks throughout. So you can share your questions using the chatbox feature.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,580
And in the reminder email this morning, as well as on the course

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,340
site, which I'll post a link to in a second,

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,620
there's a participant packet that we would ask you to download and follow

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,340
along with during the session. The slides are also available on that course

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,040
site. And we're recording this session.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,780
One last thing is that at the end, we'll share a brief evaluation

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,540
survey with you that we hope you complete, and this will help inform

26
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,940
our upcoming training activities, and is a requirement if you'd like to

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,560
receive CHES credits for today's session. And with that, I will hand it

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,900
over to Kelly. Thank you, Phoebe.

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,040
I just wanna make sure you can hear me right.

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,140
Yup, we can hear you. Okay, good. Well, hello, everybody.

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,840
Welcome to P2P: Strategic Planning. This is a webinar series to assist public

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,800
health agencies with making a plan to plan for writing a strategic plan.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,980
My name is Kelly Bragg, and I'm a Program Manager at the Center

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,320
for Public Health Practice in the College of Public Health at the Ohio

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,160
State University. And much of my role at the center is to help

36
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,480
local public health agencies around the state of Ohio with organizational

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,660
development projects, including CHAs, CHIPs and strategic plans.

38
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,800
So my contact information is on the screen there, and I will share

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,900
it at the end again in case you have any follow up questions

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,380
for me.

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,820
Just to give a brief overview of the entire series, our purpose for

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,160
these webinars is to prepare you for your next round of strategic planning.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,459
This course references some additional materials that are located, as Phoebe

44
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,480
said, in the participant packet.

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,920
So if you don't have the packet in front of you today,

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,800
you'll still be able to participate, but there will be times that I'll

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,120
reference it, and it serves as a nice companion

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,040
to the entire series, so I encourage you to download it and use

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
it.

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,300
The series includes a total of four one hour webinars, and each webinar

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,200
has an agenda, which can be found in that packet,

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,580
as well as I'll put them on the screen at the start of

53
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,960
each webinar. It is my intent that these webinars are as interactive as

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,280
possible, so ask questions in the chatbox when you have them.

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,520
There are some scheduled question and answer times, as Phoebe said, but

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,400
we'll try and keep our eye out to make sure that we can

57
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,380
answer your questions in a timely fashion.

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,100
And then there are a couple of times during the series,

59
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,720
during each webinar in the series that you'll be able to

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,540
do some work if you guys want to, so

61
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,280
I'll let you know when those times are.

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,460
A disclaimer before we get started, and I'll reference this again throughout

63
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,660
when applicable. While every effort has been made to assure that this training

64
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,140
prepares you to address the requirements of Public Health Accreditation

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,500
Board or PHAB accreditation, we cannot speak for PHAB and therefore,

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,560
we cannot guarantee that this webinar series will ensure that you achieve

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,376
accreditation. So and the "we" there does refer to me, Kelly Bragg, the

68
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:02,843
Ohio State University Center for Public Health Practice and the Region V

69
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:08,540
PHTC. So let's get started on today. This is session one.

70
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,960
The purpose of today is to get through phase one, which is setting

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,980
up for success; and phase two, which is defining who we are of

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,260
the strategic planning process we use.

73
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,820
Let's start with the reason. Some of you may be here,

74
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,220
which is accreditation. And for those of you not here for that reason,

75
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,180
bear with me for the next few minutes. An agency strategic plan is

76
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,120
one of the pre requisite documents for PHAB accreditation.

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,680
So in addition to helping you get where you want to go as

78
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,200
an agency, it is integral to achieving national public health accreditation.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,160
And once again, I can't make guarantees about achieving accreditation based

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,520
on this webinar series since we don't speak for PHAB.

81
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,700
The PHAB Standards and Measures Version 1.5, Standard

82
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,500
5.3

83
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,680
includes these measures for initial accreditation: 5.3.1 A states that you

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,360
must document the process used. Like most things with PHAB, you will want

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,960
to keep good records of what you've done.

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,940
Pay special attention to document who participates on the planning team

87
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,000
and what steps you use to get to your plan.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,100
Note that if you include outside stakeholders in the plan, you're not required

89
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,260
to track those as you are with your CHIP, but it's really not

90
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,380
a bad idea. Community engagement comes up a lot in

91
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,480
the PHAB Standards and Measures, so it's always helpful to have those lists

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,540
at the ready. Additionally, if you'd like to re survey any community members

93
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,160
at the end of the plan to see if it impacted anything you

94
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,530
prioritized, you'll have that list of participants ready to go.

95
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,260
5.3.2 A states that you must have an adopted strategic plan.

96
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,460
The plan must include several things, so it's a good idea to read

97
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,940
over the standards and measures prior to embarking on the process.

98
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,620
Once again, I've done my best to assure that everything is addressed in

99
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,020
this training, but it will be up to you to determine how you

100
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:13,200
fulfill the accreditation requirements. And finally, 5.3.3 A is the often

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,020
overlooked but really, really important step of proving that you implemented

102
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,940
the strategic plan. So this means that you should not do this and

103
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,140
just let it sit on a shelf. This is not just a good

104
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,240
thing to keep in mind for a PHAB accreditation, but also as a

105
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,700
best practice. Engaging staff and stakeholders in a process that doesn't

106
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,060
result in any meaningful change is a fast track way to lose engagement

107
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,980
with those groups.

108
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,460
This is really your opportunity to take a step back and plan your

109
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,260
future. And that's just a really important thing to do as an agency,

110
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,040
whether or not you're trying to achieve accreditation.

111
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,100
And I just wanna say overall, PHAB accreditation can be really scary,

112
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,700
but if you look at it as simply a way to prove that

113
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,940
you are assuring the 10 essential services of public health, which all public

114
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,560
health agencies should be doing, it shouldn't be that nerve racking.

115
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,160
It is a lot of work, and I don't want it to sound

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,900
like I'm discounting that. It is a lot of work to gather the

117
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,440
documentation you need, but you should not be just creating documents to

118
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,120
achieve accreditation specific to the strategic plan. That's really not

119
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,760
the best way to get a strategic plan that is really meaningful for

120
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,620
your agency's growth.

121
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,500
Some of your agencies may have already achieved that initial accreditation.

122
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,620
So if so, congrats, that's wonderful.

123
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,480
Just as an FYI, this is the PHAB measure for re accreditation,

124
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,700
which requires proof that you've implemented your strategic plan.

125
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,800
The re accreditation guidelines are much, much less rigorous than the initial

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,460
accreditation measures, and that's not because there's less work, but because

127
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,660
re accreditation asks that you prove what you've been doing since initial

128
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,560
accreditation.

129
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,280
It's a lot more narrative and less providing documentation. So for re accreditation,

130
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,500
you have to prove that you've implemented a plan, and that you didn't

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,380
let it sit on a shelf. You must also show your newer,

132
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,820
updated strategic plan.

133
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,600
So thanks for bearing with us, those of you not here for accreditation;

134
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,940
that does include today's accreditation corner.

135
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,060
So I just wanna pause and make sure there's no questions specific to

136
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,600
what I just went over.

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,120
Nothing coming in yet. Okay. We will move on to the fun stuff.

138
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
So to start us off, I wanna start with one of my favorite

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,960
quotes that really, I think, underscores the purpose of strategic planning.

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,680
So here are some wise words by Lewis Carroll from Alice in Wonderland.

141
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,090
One day, Alice came to a fork in the road and saw a

142
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,170
Cheshire Cat in a tree. "Which road do I take?" she asked.

143
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,560
"Well, where do you wanna go?" was his response.

144
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,720
"I don't know," answered Alice.

145
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,600
"Then," said the cat, "It doesn't matter."

146
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,720
As I referenced before, strategic planning is more than just another plan

147
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,080
you must write. It's a really, really exciting process where you collectively,

148
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,540
as an agency, say where you want to go and how you're gonna

149
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,840
get there.

150
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,640
And just to make sure we all start out on the same page,

151
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,800
a strategic plan results from a deliberate decision making process that

152
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,980
defines where an organization is going.

153
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,540
The plan sets the direction for the organization, and, through common understanding

154
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,980
of the mission, vision, goals and objectives, provides a template for all

155
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,660
employees and stakeholders to make decisions that move the organization

156
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,760
forward. So this is, of course, the PHAB definition of a strategic plan.

157
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,240
You will not need to memorize this to get meaning out of the

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,900
series. And I'd actually like to put it in some more concise terms.

159
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,380
So to be a little less wordy, it's basically a roadmap for the

160
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,500
future of your agency. I'll try not to get too much into the

161
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,800
jargon or verbiage that goes into the plan at this point.

162
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
We'll do that later in the series. But to give a very brief

163
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,960
overview, to write your plan, you will select priorities, write goals,

164
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,400
craft objectives, outline action steps. If you consider the strategic plan

165
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,180
to be a roadmap to your future as an agency, your priorities and

166
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,800
goals might be the destination of your road trip.

167
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,700
And your objectives and action steps are the route you're gonna take to

168
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,340
get there.

169
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,180
And just as important as what it is as what it is not;

170
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,040
it is not the status quo. And this is even if what you're

171
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,320
doing is really, really important. The strategic plan cannot be about maintaining

172
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,560
what you're doing. It should be about pushing the organization forward,

173
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,260
and it should be future thinking.

174
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,380
So that root word, "tain" that just popped up comes from French and

175
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,000
ultimately, from Latin, and it means "to hold." And when I'm working with

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,820
agencies on a strategic plan, I tell them that they should not include

177
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,690
words with that root in the plan. So no sustain, no retain,

178
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,380
no maintain; unless there's a very good or specific reason.

179
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,240
And an example of a very good or specific reason might be

180
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,860
if you know you're losing a major funding source like a tax levy

181
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,840
or a large grant, or you're facing a reduction in subsidy,

182
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,500
you might wanna maintain your current budget. But if all else is expected

183
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,920
to proceed at or around the current level, you really need to look

184
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,000
at how you can grow as an agency.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,440
So now, we're gonna look at the process we're gonna use for the

186
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,780
remainder of the series.

187
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,600
So this is the process we use, and is what will serve as

188
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,540
a guide for this training. This is on page three of that participant

189
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,760
packet. And this process is adapted from a model by Allison and Kaye that

190
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,900
was originally meant to guide non profit organizations with their strategic

191
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,360
plans. We have modified a bit to meet the unique needs of public

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,180
health organizations. So this is just an overview, and we're gonna get into

193
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,980
each of those phases throughout the course of the series.

194
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,420
As you're probably aware, there are many, many strategic planning approaches

195
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,860
and models. Even though here at the center, we rely on that standard

196
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,580
process by Allison and Kaye.

197
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,720
It's very, very similar to the H&M model that you may be familiar

198
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,120
with. And so here are the two, are cross walked so you can

199
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,760
see just how similar they are.

200
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,260
You do not need to use either one of these frameworks just to

201
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,700
complete your strategic plan. You should research processes and models,

202
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,500
and definitely find something that works for your agency.

203
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,740
That being said, a good strategic planning process will touch on all of

204
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,620
these steps even if they're labeled slightly differently. So I'm gonna briefly

205
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,700
define what those steps are now, and throughout the course of the series,

206
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,900
I'll go into more detail about each of them. So the phases of

207
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,340
strategic planning are: Preparing for the plan, which is when you get your

208
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,860
agency ready to go through the process, including things like creating a

209
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,740
team or determining your process, and any other preparation activities you

210
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,960
might need to think about.

211
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Phase two is when you articulate your mission, vision and values,

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,480
and that's where you define who you are,

213
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,480
what you do and what your guiding principles are.

214
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,680
Phase three is when you conduct your environmental scan.

215
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,580
And that's where you assess your situation to determine where you are as

216
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,500
an agency.

217
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,060
Phase four is identifying and developing your priorities, where you determine

218
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,200
what the key issues you want to address are, and how you're going

219
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,300
to address them.

220
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,360
Phase five is writing the plan, which is when you create the actual

221
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,480
document you will use as your roadmap for improvement.

222
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,600
Six is implementing the plan when you put all that hard work into

223
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,340
practice. And finally, seven is evaluating and monitoring the plan. So that's

224
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,040
when you make sure this plan still works for you.

225
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,430
And once again, today we're focusing on phase one and two.

226
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,740
So phase one, as I said, is that plan to plan.

227
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,260
So this is where you project your needs for the planning process

228
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,460
and assure that you have everything lined up so that you are prepared

229
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,720
to embark on the vital process of strategic planning. So this entire webinar

230
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,440
series is your plan to plan. This is where you will take the

231
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,840
time to determine who you want involved, what inputs

232
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,140
you want to consider and how you will go about writing the plan.

233
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,380
I will say that a lot of people overlook the importance of this

234
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,910
step, but please take time here. If you have a well thought out

235
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,760
process, you're gonna get a... It's gonna be easier for you to get

236
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,000
a plan that you can successfully implement for your agency and really see

237
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,440
some good strategic growth.

238
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,640
One of the most important things that you'll do during this phase is

239
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,440
to determine who you will include in the process.

240
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,840
So your first question about this might be,

241
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,720
"How big should the writing team be?"

242
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,760
And there's really no correct number of people to have on your team,

243
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,240
but I would say the max is about 15 people; and really,

244
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,680
10 is ideal.

245
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,420
It doesn't mean that you won't get input from a much,

246
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,480
much larger

247
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,760
cross section of people; it just means that you have

248
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,620
a more manageable number of people at the table during the planning meetings.

249
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,460
So depending on the size of your agency, this may mean that you

250
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,260
use your entire staff or a subset of staff for your writing team.

251
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,260
I would say the most important thing is to make sure that you

252
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,800
have a good cross section of your staff involved. So you want as

253
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,340
many people from management as from frontline staff.

254
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,240
And this is key to both getting a balanced view of the agency,

255
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,240
and I think, really important for assuring staff buy in.

256
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,340
Your staff is not just going to want to see the management team

257
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,180
making all of these decisions. So you wanna make sure that you get

258
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,900
their input and you have them represented on the writing team.

259
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,020
So after you've determined how big the team should be,

260
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,220
you need to determine who is gonna participate.

261
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,960
And you may already have your writing team set, but you will also

262
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,600
need to consider who you might want to get feedback and inputs from

263
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,960
throughout the process. So you definitely wanna loop your Board of Health

264
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,120
into the process.

265
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,740
It's really ideal to get one to two members of the board to

266
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,440
participate in the planning meetings. If this isn't possible for you,

267
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,640
make sure you survey them and keep them abreast of the planning process

268
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,860
throughout. PHAB will look for that Board of Health involvement in the entire

269
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,060
process, not just the approval. So engage them throughout and make sure

270
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,480
that you document how you engage them.

271
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,700
You'll probably wanna also include your agency head.

272
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,940
So you might call them your Health Commissioner, the Health Director,

273
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,500
or your Health Officer, a Medical Director, those sorts of terms.

274
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,120
This person really needs to be involved in the process. And for those

275
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,500
staff not included in the writing team itself,

276
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,620
you'll still wanna somehow engage them. So this can be done during the

277
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,780
environmental scan phase of the strategic planning, or in other ways you

278
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,240
might choose, such as getting feedback on chosen priorities or

279
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,900
having them vote on the mission, vision and values, those sorts of things.

280
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,500
You just wanna make sure that you keep the staff engaged in the

281
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,960
entire process, as well.

282
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,460
And finally, you may also wanna include any advisory boards you have.

283
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,280
Here in Ohio, we have boards known as District Advisory Councils that can

284
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,920
really impact the future of public health agencies. So some of you may

285
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,860
want to include groups like your County Commissioners or your City Council.

286
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,980
Depending on the governing structure of your community, think about what

287
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,240
other advisory boards can have an impact on the strategic plan.

288
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,020
As for external stakeholders, you'll probably not include them on the actual

289
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,240
writing team itself, but it's important for you to understand how you are

290
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,840
viewed in the community. So engage external stakeholders, such as clients,

291
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,000
partners, community leaders and even your competitors in the environmental

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,440
scan process.

293
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,980
Once you have that team developed, you need to identify a lead in

294
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,880
the process.

295
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,240
You need to identify someone who's gonna oversee everything, and coordinate

296
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,080
everything and make sure everything stays on track.

297
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,260
So let's talk about

298
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,900
where to start if you have a current plan.

299
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,060
So if you already have a strategic plan that you're working off of,

300
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,740
and you're ready to start your next phase of strategic planning,

301
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,340
you can use a simple tool like the one shown up here to

302
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,380
help evaluate what you liked and what you didn't like about your current

303
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,920
plan.

304
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,180
I would have each member of your planning team review the current plan

305
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,700
and complete this chart. Have them think about things like the process,

306
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,040
participants, ease of implementation, those sorts of things.

307
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,040
And ask them also to consider what is needed in the next plan

308
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,940
and what should be avoided. So this can help you make adjustments in how

309
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,960
to approach your upcoming planning process. And do this as part of phase

310
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,020
one so that you can make changes and adjustments to your process if

311
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,980
you need to based on this feedback.

312
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,340
So as I mentioned in the beginning, this is meant to be as

313
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,660
interactive as we can get with a webinar series like this.

314
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,600
So after each phase, you will get some time to brainstorm how you

315
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,340
and your agency would get the plan done.

316
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,500
So I thought... Well, on pages 12 and 13 of the participant packet,

317
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,780
there is this plan to plan worksheet. So use this as you're preparing

318
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,400
to do your strategic plan.

319
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,980
It will help you identify any needs or gaps in your preparedness so

320
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,420
that you can address them before you get too far along.

321
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,780
So we just covered all of phase one,

322
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,900
plan to plan. So you'll definitely wanna take time to answer these questions

323
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,160
before starting your plan: Who will be involved in the process,

324
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,480
and how? Are you gonna involve all staff, a subset of staff,

325
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,720
your community partners, Board of Health; how you're gonna involve them,

326
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,360
those sorts of things. Who will be accountable for assuring the plan is

327
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,220
written? And who's gonna facilitate the process of writing the plan?

328
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,640
At what point in the process do you need to get Board of

329
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,120
Health approval? And what is your estimated time frame?

330
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,780
So

331
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,500
would you guys like time to work through these questions

332
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
right now? Or would you like me to move on, and you can

333
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,620
do this on your own?

334
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,340
And just indicate in the chatbox if you want to take a few

335
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,480
minutes to look through these as a team,

336
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,620
or as a person.

337
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,520
Or let me know if you want me to keep moving on.

338
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,000
Looks like folks are interested in doing it later on their own,

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
but we did have a couple requests for maybe some examples,

340
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,420
if you can. So examples of what?

341
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,380
A completed worksheet?

342
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,340
Yeah, I guess so.

343
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,500
Or how you might fill it out, I guess.

344
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,320
So if I... And thank you all for your questions, I appreciate them.

345
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,340
So if I was gonna do this, I would sit down.

346
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,780
There's probably somebody in your agency that you've already determined

347
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,220
is primarily responsible for at least organizing this process, even if they're

348
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,200
not gonna be the one to write the plan or facilitate the plan.

349
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,560
So I would get that person

350
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,760
to meet with the key people involved in making decisions. So

351
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
if you already have your writing team, that's ideal,

352
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,120
but sit down and figure out who's gonna be on that writing team

353
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,260
to start. And then the writing team can fill out this worksheet for

354
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,560
each step before you start. So this worksheet is your plan to plan.

355
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,160
You wanna fill out all the sections of this worksheet before you start

356
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,440
any of the strategic planning. So I would get your writing team together

357
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,500
and just talk about all these questions. So

358
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,240
who will you involve in the process, and how? So talk about

359
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,940
if you're gonna get feedback from

360
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,680
staff and just a subset of staff, or your entire staff,

361
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,960
how you're gonna keep the Board of Health involved.

362
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,760
So obviously, I said you're gonna want one to two Board of Health

363
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,180
members to participate in the planning meetings, if possible, but the rest

364
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,500
of the board should really be

365
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,640
engaged in the process. So how are you gonna do that?

366
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,980
Are you just gonna keep emailing them? Are you going to present at

367
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,760
every board meeting? How are you gonna make sure the Board of Health

368
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,280
is kept up to date on things.

369
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,940
Determine if you want to tap into your community partners, and how you're

370
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,620
gonna do that. So in phase three, we're gonna talk about assessing the

371
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,080
situation, which is when you do your environmental scan. So we don't wanna

372
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,200
get too far ahead of myself, but when you do your environmental scan,

373
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,360
that's when you're gonna really survey internal and external stakeholders

374
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,840
to figure out what's going on and where you are as an agency.

375
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,580
So you might wanna gather a list of community partners together

376
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,820
that you're gonna wanna tap into,

377
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,920
either people or agencies that you work with a lot, or that are

378
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,220
important. It's important to you to know how your health department is viewed

379
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,580
in the community based on these people's feedback. So I would just work

380
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,760
through with your team, all of these questions.

381
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,840
And if you can't answer them, it's probably not...

382
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,420
You need to be able to answer all of the questions before you

383
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,900
can proceed with your strategic plan. So your first thing to do

384
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,880
is to get your writing team together and have them work through the

385
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,260
questions in the sheet.

386
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,000
Kelly, we did get a couple questions come in. Okay, great.

387
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,740
When you talk about a time frame, is there usually a typical amount

388
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,980
of time used to create all the phases?

389
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:21,100
So I don't wanna say that there's a typical amount of time

390
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,760
for all of the phases because I think planning to plan,

391
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,640
depending on where you're starting as an agency, can take a significant

392
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,420
amount of time. If you've not gotten a writing team together and you

393
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,520
don't really know how you're going to approach this, that can

394
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,020
take up a lot of your time.

395
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,120
So I will say that when I work with an agency,

396
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,440
they have usually already gotten their writing team together,

397
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,680
and our process takes about

398
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,280
four to six months for the plan writing. And then phase six and

399
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,240
seven are obviously implementing, evaluating and monitoring the plan. So

400
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,000
those are going to be the length of your plan.

401
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,720
So we always... I always say three to five years for a strategic

402
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,460
plan's ideal. So if you choose a three year timeline, it's gonna take

403
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,300
you planning plus three years. If you choose five years, it's gonna take

404
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,440
planning plus five years. But I would say to get the plan written,

405
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,560
give yourselves a good six months. You can do it more quickly than

406
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,100
that, but I think to get

407
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,440
reasonable buy in from staff, and also time to plan

408
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,580
everything you're gonna need to do for the environmental scan.

409
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,000
Once again, we'll talk about that next week, but gathering those inputs

410
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,140
and surveying your staff and community members can take a lot of time,

411
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,300
as well. So I would say four to six

412
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,380
months is probably,

413
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,480
I would say, that's the shortest you will wanna plan to do the

414
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,960
strategic plan.

415
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,500
Any other questions? Yeah, there's a couple. Okay.

416
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,740
Can you talk a little more about the typical scope of responsibilities

417
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,300
for the facilitator of the process? For example, what decisions are they

418
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,780
given the authority to make, and how do they usually delegate actual writing

419
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,480
of the plan?

420
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,120
So

421
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,820
that really depends on the power structure of your agency.

422
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,260
If you, for example, choose your accreditation coordinator to also be in

423
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,280
charge of facilitating the strategic planning process, it would all depend

424
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,820
on what power they're given

425
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,180
outside of strategic planning. So are they allowed to make decisions?

426
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,340
I would say the facilitator, in my view,

427
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,340
doesn't have extra power, but they are in charge of

428
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,600
convening the meetings,

429
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,060
doing the agenda, figuring, working through how to get the priorities done,

430
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,800
working through what objectives you're gonna have. So they are more of a

431
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,060
convener of the process than somebody who has a lot of power because

432
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,440
you want the team, as a whole, to be making decisions about the

433
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,940
strategic plan. You don't want this one facilitator to be making decisions

434
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,160
about the plan.

435
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,480
Now, if the question is in reference to who gets to be on

436
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,400
the team, that is a conversation that is very agency dependent.

437
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,550
This person might be able to pick the writing team, or the Health

438
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,660
Commissioner or Health Director role might wanna pick the writing team.

439
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,860
Once again, with the writing team, you wanna make sure that you have

440
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,440
a good cross section of your staff involved.

441
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,560
Okay. Related to that, I think: How do you ensure that you have

442
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,220
a representative sample of staff when some divisions or staff may feel that

443
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,480
they have less time to contribute to something outside the normal scope

444
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,720
of their duties?

445
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,200
So I definitely think

446
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,850
that is a common issue with public health agencies because we... I say

447
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,360
"we." I worked in local public health for about 10 years,

448
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,380
and I feel that there's always this time crunch about

449
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,540
how you're constantly being asked to do more with less. So I very

450
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,080
much understand. And

451
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,340
I just understand that question a lot. That being said,

452
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,540
it's about how you present it to them.

453
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,660
I think when you think about it, it's not that often that your

454
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,300
employer comes to you and says, "I would like for you

455
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,000
to tell me

456
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,180
what you want this agency to do. I would like for you to

457
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,440
help influence the future of us as an agency, where we wanna go,

458
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,760
where we're gonna spend our money, how we're gonna spend our time,

459
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,720
what we're gonna prioritize. I want you to be a part of that."

460
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,540
And I think if you present it like that and can really make

461
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,760
that, really sell that to them, it might

462
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,050
help with that issue a little bit. And I think you're gonna have

463
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:54,380
to get... You're gonna have to have management staff

464
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,360
really buy into this process, as well, because they're going to need to

465
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,840
give... If you're thinking about

466
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,040
nursing staff with clinic schedules, they're gonna need to give up some

467
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,700
of their clinic time to participate in this. EH staff is gonna have

468
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,720
to give up some of their time in the field to participate in

469
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,620
this. So I do understand where you're coming from, but I think if

470
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,400
you really sell it as it's your opportunity to help guide the future

471
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,160
of this agency,

472
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,000
I think if you sell it well,

473
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,820
that problem might not be as present.

474
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,900
That's all the questions for now. Okay, thank you. Thank you,

475
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,740
everybody, who asked a question; these are great.

476
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,220
So

477
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,300
I want to

478
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,980
move on to phase two. So phase two is defining who you are

479
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,080
as an agency. This involves establishing the following for your agency:

480
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,440
Your mission, your vision and your values.

481
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,840
So you may already have a mission statement, a vision statement and agency

482
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,800
values, and you may be familiar with those. During the strategic planning

483
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,980
process, you'll be given an opportunity to update these, which is something

484
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,240
that you should do every time you conduct a strategic plan.

485
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,660
These are really the guiding principles of your agency and as such,

486
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,020
you should be reviewing and updating them regularly so that they remain

487
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,720
relevant.

488
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,840
If you don't have an existing mission, vision and values, this is your

489
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,280
opportunity to generate one. And once established and affirmed, everything

490
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,940
that you do as an agency after these are established should reflect them.

491
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,470
So first up is the mission statement. Mission statements, they should...

492
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,360
And there is a... This is all covered in your participant packet,

493
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,480
as well, but it's a short statement or tagline that describes the reason

494
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,720
for the organization's existence. It succinctly describes what an organization

495
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,140
does or should do, and its customer base.

496
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,600
It simply answers the question: Why do we exist?

497
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,680
Key components of it include: Who are your get clients? What are the

498
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,260
services that we deliver? And where are we delivering these? So what's the

499
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,540
geographic domain?

500
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,020
So here are some examples of missions, and I want you to consider

501
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,780
that if you think these meet that criteria.

502
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,440
So first one up is, "To provide scientifically sound, high quality products

503
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,380
and services to help heal, cure disease and improve the quality of life."

504
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,000
So this is from Johnson & Johnson. And I don't think it's too bad.

505
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,060
It's more than 15 words, but it really does answer the question,

506
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,660
"Why do we exist?" It doesn't really cover geographic domain, but with a

507
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,140
corporation like Johnson & Johnson, their geographic domain is sort of all

508
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,720
over. Up

509
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:51,320
next is, "To create lasting solutions to poverty, hunger and social injustice."

510
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,380
This is the mission of an organization called Oxfam.

511
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,860
It is short, it's to the point, and it really does,

512
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,210
I think, answer the question, "Why do we

513
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:11,080
exist?" Up next, "To build healthier lives free of cardiovascular disease

514
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,460
and stroke."

515
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,560
So this is from the Heart Association. It's short, it's to the point

516
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,060
and it really answers that question, once again, "Why do we exist?"

517
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,040
So finally,

518
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,540
"Developing people and organizations to advance community health."

519
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,020
And that is the mission of the Center for Public Health Practice at

520
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,200
the Ohio State University. And so, it really does answer, "If we do...

521
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,780
We exist to develop people and organizations to advance community health."

522
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,880
So this final one is from Volvo. This is their entire mission statement:

523
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,940
"By creating value for our customers, we create value for our shareholders.

524
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,220
We use our expertise to create transport related products and services of

525
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,100
superior quality, safety and environmental care for demanding customers

526
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,160
in selected segments. We work with energy, passion and respect for the individual."

527
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,720
So

528
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,540
I don't think this is easy to remember. If I'm an employee of

529
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,780
Volvo, I cannot recite our mission to you if you walk up to

530
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,660
me and ask me what it is. It does incorporate values a little

531
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,720
bit, but there is a mission sort of embedded in this long statement.

532
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,780
So I think this is too long, but I think a good mission

533
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,640
that you can sort of grab out of this is,

534
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,980
"Create transport related products and services of superior quality, safety

535
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,440
and environmental care for demanding customers in selected segments." It's

536
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,520
still a little long,

537
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,800
but it is much more concise, and it gets at the criteria while being

538
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,940
a little bit easier to remember.

539
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,000
So phase two is... Or I'm sorry. Now, we're moving on to vision

540
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,980
statement in phase two. A vision statement describes what the organization

541
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,560
wants to be or wants to create in the future. It really should

542
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,060
be a little lofty and grand. I always present this to people as thinking

543
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,860
about if you close your eyes and imagine your ideal future,

544
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,200
that can inform your vision statement.

545
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,920
So it does provide a picture of the future.

546
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,040
And you want it to be seen through the eyes of employees,

547
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,580
customers and stakeholders. A great vision statement will really inspire

548
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,660
and challenge every employee, stakeholder and resident.

549
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,940
You want everybody to be able to see themselves in that vision of

550
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,560
the future. It's not bound by time or quantified,

551
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,300
and it can be external or internal.

552
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,080
So we have some more examples of these.

553
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,960
So, "A personal computer on every desk running Microsoft software." That's

554
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,740
obviously Microsoft's vision. I think if I were a Microsoft employee,

555
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,960
this would be very inspiring to me. Imagining that every computer

556
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,400
is running Microsoft software; that's very, very inspiring to me.

557
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,700
The Alzheimer's Association, "A world without Alzheimer's." It's clear,

558
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,440
it's easy to remember, it unites people around a common cause,

559
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,620
and it's inspiring. "This is what we want; we want a world without

560
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,540
Alzheimer's."

561
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,280
"Create the healthiest nation in one generation." This is from the American

562
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,880
Public Health Association. Again, I can see what the ideal future is if

563
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,980
APHA is successful.

564
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,300
And finally,

565
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,740
"People working together to achieve a culture of health." This is

566
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,120
the Center for Public Health Practice's vision. So

567
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,800
if we do everything right and we get our perfect ideal future,

568
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,180
everybody we work with will be working together to achieve a culture of

569
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,420
health.

570
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,420
So let's move on to values.

571
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,320
Whether you call them values or guiding principles or beliefs, they're the

572
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,120
core philosophies describing how an organization conducts itself in carrying

573
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,200
out its business. It's how the organization does things. Values really guide

574
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,220
your day to day behavior of all employees,

575
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,800
and are the organization's most basic beliefs. So the best statements of

576
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,900
guiding principles express the organization's attitude and values about

577
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,000
three things:

578
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,120
The way people inside and outside the organization are treated;

579
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,770
two, the way the organization is managed, decisions are made, and products

580
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:45,340
and/or services are provided; and three, expectations concerning the organization's

581
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,880
responsibilities and the quality of its products and services.

582
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,040
So on the screen are some example products... Or

583
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,120
some example values, excuse me. This list is not exhaustive, by any means.

584
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,620
Your values are up to you.

585
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,520
And you might have your writing team brainstorm some values, or even your

586
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,840
whole staff. And then your team would just work to narrow down the

587
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,700
list if it's too big.

588
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,360
Some agencies choose to use a list of words as their values,

589
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,480
and some choose longer value statements. I think either way, it's okay.

590
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,320
Just there's no ideal number. I think four to five works well.

591
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,460
So if you're doing...

592
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,740
If you're going with a list of words,

593
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,340
some agencies go further and define what those words mean to them.

594
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,500
For example, these might be your values. So you would work as a

595
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,680
team to determine what teamwork, communication, quality, respect and learning

596
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,140
mean to you.

597
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,860
And then you will work to give them definitions that mean something to

598
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,960
your agency.

599
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,260
Other agencies choose to write value statements. So this is perfectly acceptable

600
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,260
and can sometimes tell your story more clearly. These are the values of

601
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,940
the Center for Public Health Practice. So we stated it as,

602
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,460
"We believe," in these statements, instead of just using a list of words.

603
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,940
Once again, either way is okay.

604
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,500
Just make sure that these are really your guiding principles of how you

605
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,360
do what you do.

606
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,980
So now that you know what mission, vision and values are,

607
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,580
you might be wondering how to generate them.

608
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,620
So like a lot of things with strategic planning, there's no one right

609
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,880
way to do this.

610
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,020
I'm gonna give you the method I use in a little bit,

611
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,100
but if you have a system that works for you, please use it.

612
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,240
It's important to remember that even if you already have a mission,

613
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,560
vision and values, you wanna take the time with each strategic planning

614
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,740
process to review them and make sure they still fit.

615
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,660
These principles should really grow with your agency.

616
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,900
So strategic planning should lead to agency growth. So you wanna make sure

617
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,320
these are growing with you.

618
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,800
So this is my process that I use. There are three things to

619
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,480
remember:

620
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,080
Ask internal and external stakeholders for input.

621
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,420
And that includes asking all staff. So I

622
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,620
make sure we get input from all staff at an agency.

623
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,900
A group then drafts the statements. I say "group" there because it's ideally

624
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,020
your strategic planning writing team. But if you have another group that

625
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,840
you wanna use to do this, that's fine. If you wanna ask that

626
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,140
facilitator to draft them based on all the inputs, that's fine,

627
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,790
as well. Just have a group of people or one person draft

628
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,660
mission, vision, and values. And then your agency will need to approve it.

629
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,180
So how that happens really depends on your agency.

630
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,800
Do you need to have just the board approve it? Or can the

631
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,000
strategic planning team do that? So are they given the power by the

632
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,700
board to approve

633
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,800
the mission, vision and values during a strategic planning writing session?

634
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,220
These are all questions that you need to work out as part of

635
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,980
phase one, where you're planning to plan. So how are you going to

636
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,400
get the mission, vision and values approved and affirmed?

637
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,520
So for the specific process that I use, which, once again,

638
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,640
the way I do it is not the correct way to do it;

639
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,040
it's just an example. So you have a more tangible example of how

640
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,900
you might do this.

641
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,340
I send an anonymous survey to at least the entire staff and board.

642
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,660
Sometimes, we include community stakeholders. That's up to you.

643
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:36,960
And it gives them... So I define what mission, vision and values are,

644
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,200
and then the survey asks for three words or phrases that the participants

645
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,440
would like to see incorporated into each of these guiding principles.

646
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,710
So I say, "The definition of mission is

647
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,520
X, Y, Z." Then I say, "What are three words or phrases that

648
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,760
you think should be included in our mission?" Then I say,

649
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,620
"The definition of vision is... " And then I say, "What are three

650
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,810
words or phrases that you think should be included in our vision?"

651
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:08,900
Then once again, a small group of people on the writing team draft

652
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,560
the statements based on the results of the survey. And then during a

653
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,520
strategic planning meeting or strategic plan writing meeting,

654
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,980
that team approves them with the approval of the board and...

655
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,280
As long as the Board of Health and the Health Commissioner have given

656
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,400
them that power.

657
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,220
So the important thing about this is to remember to get input from everyone

658
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,800
on the staff. The more points throughout this process that you ask for

659
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,100
input from staff, the better. This gives everyone a chance to influence

660
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,660
the future of the agency. I'm referencing back to that question from before.

661
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,620
The more touch points you have with your staff in this process

662
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,140
really makes them feel... It really encourages buy in to the process,

663
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,640
which is really important for everybody. Once the plan is written and you

664
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,880
need to implement it, because people feel ownership of it, so it's much

665
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,880
more likely to be successful that way.

666
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,140
So once again,

667
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,140
we've just covered phase two. Here's the worksheet again.

668
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,320
Articulate your mission, vision and values. So you wanna take the time to

669
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,580
answer the questions here before you start your plan. So do you have

670
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:23,160
a current mission, vision and values? If the answer is yes,

671
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,640
does it answer all those questions? Does it answer, "Why do we exist?"

672
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,340
Is a brief? Is it easy to remember?

673
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,620
If you have a vision, does it provide a clear

674
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:37,120
picture of the organization's ideal future? Is it inspiring and challenging?

675
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,860
Is it brief enough to be remembered? If you have values,

676
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,160
do they still... Are they still the values of the organization?

677
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,920
So if you don't have any of the guiding principles,

678
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,960
how will you approach their development?

679
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,160
So once again, it didn't sound like we wanted to have time to

680
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,200
work on these questions right now, but I will take any questions you

681
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,020
have about articulating mission, vision and values.

682
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,420
Right, so we did have a few questions come in. Okay,

683
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,760
great.

684
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,200
I know I saw on the

685
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,020
previous slide the 15 word

686
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:20,740
suggestion around a mission of keeping it brief, but is there anything else

687
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,700
you'd like to add about suggested length of mission statement? No,

688
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,080
I think the thing is when we say...

689
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,580
15 is sort of an arbitrary number. The big thing with mission and

690
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,580
vision, really, is you wanna answer the question... With mission, you wanna

691
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,160
answer the question

692
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,120
"why we exist,"

693
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,600
and you want it to be something that your staff can remember.

694
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
You're not gonna get community members to remember what your mission is,

695
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,880
but you want it to be something where,

696
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,360
if I'm working at a health department, when somebody comes up to me

697
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,000
and says, "What's our mission?" you want them to be... Maybe not word

698
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,080
for word, but be able to say what it is.

699
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,180
I think memorable missions and visions

700
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,280
really add to people embracing them as your guiding principles,

701
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,000
and working towards them

702
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,720
as your guiding principles. So there's no right or wrong length.

703
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,260
You just, like with that Volvo

704
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,940
example, it is just too long. You just don't want something that wordy.

705
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,400
You don't want it to be a paragraph that people really can't possibly

706
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,000
remember.

707
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,480
So this next question is a clarifying question.

708
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,520
They say that they're understanding is that by writing mission, vision,

709
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,360
goals and objectives, they're actually defining their future desired state

710
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:49,400
or in other words, where they want to be. Is that true?

711
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,960
So I think the future desired state...

712
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,250
So the vision of the future is your ideal future. So

713
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,390
a public... And there are some good examples in your packet.

714
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:08,440
"A community where everyone is healthy and happy." That might be your vision

715
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,760
as a public health agency.

716
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,440
Now, whether or not you use that vision to define your state as

717
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,100
an agency, is different, and you can make that determination on your own.

718
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,500
So your mission and vision are your guiding principles. They're who you

719
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,180
are and what you want to look like. Your goals and objectives that

720
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,140
you're gonna write are how you're gonna get there. So yes,

721
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,240
it is, it's your roadmap

722
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,120
when you... It's your roadmap of how you're gonna get there.

723
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:44,000
So yes, I think you probably could say it's a desired state.

724
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,140
Do you have any specific tools to recommend that could ensure that Principles

725
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,620
of Health Equity and Public Health 3.0 are part of the strategic planning

726
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,200
process?

727
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,100
We will get into that in future sessions,

728
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,940
but because that's so new,

729
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:07,640
I don't want to come across like it's going to be...

730
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,160
How do I articulate this?

731
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,540
Yes, we will cover that in future webinars.

732
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,470
It is an emerging concern for strategic plans for public health agencies.

733
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:24,760
So we're still... We're always learning. But yeah, I will touch on that

734
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,080
in future webinars, I think probably, when we choose...

735
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,560
Probably next week, when we look at priorities.

736
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,120
Okay.

737
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,720
This next question's wondering about if there's any... If there's ever any

738
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,920
issues of copyright with mission and vision, if an agency is going about

739
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,380
this process and perhaps, unknowingly, comes up with material that might

740
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,300
be closely related to something another agency did. I am not

741
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,340
aware of any issues with copyright. I think that if it's

742
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:03,220
unknowing and you get accused of something,

743
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:08,860
it seems innocent enough that you could say it was completely unknowing.

744
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,660
I think if you look at something and you say, "That's what we

745
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,900
wanna use," and that's a concern of yours, that it might be considered

746
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,580
copyright infringement, I would reach out to the organization that you are

747
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:26,500
borrowing from and talk to them about their thoughts on you borrowing their

748
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:34,740
mission and vision. That being said, I want to encourage you to really...

749
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,820
There are some examples in your packet, but really sit back and think

750
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,740
about what you want as an agency. What do you want those statements

751
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,220
to look like for you? Every agency is different and so,

752
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,440
you might gather some ideas, or look and say, "Oh, we want it

753
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,360
to be... We want this level of aspiration in our vision."

754
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,580
But you really want it to be personalized to you as an agency.

755
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,580
So you can gather sort of

756
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:06,720
ideas, but I would say step back and make sure that

757
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,460
you're making it your own.

758
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:14,700
You could imagine, and also, depending a little bit on what type of

759
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,080
agency the other one is, if it's government versus for a private led. Yeah.

760
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,220
Yeah, I think if you're trying to use Microsoft's, no, that's...

761
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,200
You might wanna call. Yeah. All right, so this next question is...

762
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,020
I'm wondering if you could comment on conducting environmental scans

763
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,220
before defining mission, vision and values.

764
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:43,700
So I don't see why they can't sort of exist like the unparallel tracks.

765
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,100
I think the environmental scan

766
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,760
is... It can take a long time. So if you wanna get

767
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,620
started crafting your mission, vision and values as you're doing your environmental

768
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,220
scan, that's fine because you're gonna use them

769
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,940
both to guide those, the priority development, and that sort of thing.

770
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,380
That being said, when I do that mission, vision and values input survey,

771
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,700
I do that as part of the environmental scan survey. So the first

772
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,880
section is asking about mission, vision and values. And the second

773
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,240
section of the survey is doing an environmental scan survey. So what are

774
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,640
your strengths? What are the weaknesses? Those sorts of things.

775
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,900
So I think you could do them at the same time.

776
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,780
You just don't wanna get into priority development goals and objectives

777
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:37,540
until you have them established. And then the

778
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,300
next question is, "I'm wondering you can advise on how an agency can

779
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,510
be responsive to multiple guidance organizations. So for example, if they're

780
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:50,400
a Federal program in a county health department, how do they

781
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,780
land those perspectives or priorities when designing mission, vision and

782
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,020
values?" What a good question.

783
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,540
So I think that

784
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,200
it depends on the program. So

785
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,520
if you're looking at

786
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,420
preparedness,

787
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,540
that certainly has a different function in the community than WIC, than

788
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,260
local clinical services.

789
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:20,060
So you definitely want to consider what the overarching mission of whatever

790
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,000
the Federal

791
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,920
agency is. You don't want that to guide your local public health agency's

792
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,240
entire mission, but if you have guiding principles that a department of

793
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,980
your agency is working towards, you'll wanna look at those when establishing

794
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,340
your own.

795
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:42,960
With WIC, it's about assuring access

796
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,840
for vulnerable populations. With preparedness, it's protecting all people.

797
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,020
So when you're looking at those sorts of things, make sure you consider

798
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,560
those when you're giving your inputs for your mission, vision and values.

799
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:01,160
But your mission, vision, and values should be your own as an agency.

800
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,640
Any services that you're offering

801
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,180
should be considered when you're doing all of the strategic plan,

802
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:12,340
but incorporate them to the extent that it matters

803
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:18,140
for your agency as a whole.

804
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,880
So that was the last question to come in so far.

805
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,370
I guess well, we wait to see if there's any more questions.

806
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:30,160
I actually have one more... I have some specific questions for the participants

807
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,920
that are still here. So first of all, once again, I really appreciate

808
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,860
those questions.

809
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,500
So we have three more minutes,

810
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,160
and I'd like to gather some general feedback about what you need from

811
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,100
this series. So use the comment box. And this is really gonna help

812
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,360
me focus what I focus the coming weeks. So

813
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,420
let me know what your concerns about your upcoming strategic planning process

814
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,240
are.

815
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,660
Let me know what you didn't get out of your current plan that

816
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,040
you thought you would. And sort of just overall, what worries you the

817
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,560
most about doing strategic planning? So I'm gonna put the next slide on.

818
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,540
So you have my contact information. And then I'll flip back

819
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,680
and just leave these questions up so that if you think of them,

820
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,980
you can type in a response.

821
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,580
Next week in session two, we're gonna talk about that environmental scan.

822
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,220
And this is where you'll learn about how to conduct environmental scan and

823
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,060
then also, how to use what you learn in that environmental scan to

824
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:33,900
select your agency priorities. So next week is gonna actually cover

825
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,560
phases three and four.

826
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,420
And then feel free to contact me with questions, comments, concerns,

827
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,880
complements in the interim. So I'll leave that up for a second if

828
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,160
you wanna jot it down, and then I'll turn back on the questions slide.

829
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,880
Okay. Those are good questions.

830
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,520
Would you like me to read out some of the answers that are

831
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,040
coming in, and we'll be able to send you these? Yes,

832
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,380
please, send them to me. But yeah, if there's anything I can respond

833
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,710
to in real time, I will.

834
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,080
So one question is how to have a proper close out of the

835
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,680
previous plan. Okay.

836
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,200
Getting team members to understand the plan.

837
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,760
Okay. So understand the plan and where they fit into it,

838
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,120
or...

839
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,560
Okay, yeah, or just to understand the overall plan?

840
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,760
I'm not sure specifically, but... Okay. Focusing on social justice, health

841
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:37,340
equity and structural justice. Okay. Meaningfully engaging staff so it's

842
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:42,660
not only driven by the leadership voices. And I think another comment related

843
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,380
to that is getting staff excited about the process

844
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,940
so it's not just another thing to do, not something that sits on

845
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:57,620
a shelf. Right.

846
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,280
So I think while you're reading the rest of those,

847
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,140
with those last two comments, getting staff excited, it's though.

848
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,340
I think, especially if you're working on PHAB accreditation,

849
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,840
all you're doing is

850
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,500
talking about plans with people; whether it's your CHIP or your strategic

851
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,700
plan or your workforce development plan, it's plan central and

852
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,120
it can get a little like white noise.

853
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,180
And people really lose interest. I think,

854
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,960
referencing back to what I said before, if you can present the strategic

855
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,530
plan specifically to your staff

856
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:41,060
as, "This is your opportunity to say where we wanna go as an

857
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:46,000
agency. You get to participate in deciding what we're gonna focus on.

858
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,880
So you get to tell us what you don't think is going well

859
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,400
and what you think should change about the agency. And you can't make

860
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,700
any guarantees

861
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,740
that big, sweeping changes are gonna be made but at least,

862
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:02,820
this is your chance to have your voice heard." And

863
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,660
if you

864
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,940
choose not to participate, then

865
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,840
it's harder for people to have a leg to stand on when they

866
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,940
have genuine complaints about anything going on with the agency. So I think

867
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,580
if you can really just... It has to come from the top down.

868
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:22,340
Everybody has to be super excited about it. Everybody has to be pumped

869
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:26,340
about doing the strategic plan. And it has to be framed as that

870
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,110
aspirational like, "This is our time to sit back and say,

871
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:33,260
'This is where we are. Where do we want to be going?'" And

872
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,080
it's not very often that people get the opportunity to do that with

873
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,800
their workplace. So I think if you can just keep

874
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,760
pushing that,

875
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,620
you'll have a good chance of being successful. That being said,

876
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,580
I will include some more tips on this in next week 'cause that

877
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,320
seems to be

878
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:57,240
an issue for some people. Yeah, I think so. All right, well,

879
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,020
so for

880
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,380
folks still sharing their thoughts, you're welcome to continue to do that

881
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:08,140
in the chat. I would also strongly encourage you to share any response

882
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,140
to these questions in the evaluation. That will be another place where we

883
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:16,320
can document what you are interested in learning, not only from this series,

884
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,680
but from many future series related to

885
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,120
accreditation efforts, for example. Or anything else that you have in mind.

886
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,880
With that, I think... Kelly, is there any closing thoughts you'd wanna share?

887
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,980
Or anything you'd like them to do before the next session?

888
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:36,820
No, I really appreciate the questions. I wasn't sure what to expect.

889
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,320
So I appreciate the level of engagement. It helps me sort of guide

890
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,900
how I'm thinking about what people's concerns are,

891
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:48,700
and what they're struggling with. And I will make sure that I include,

892
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,080
once again, that staff engagement portion, and

893
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,240
I focus more on the Public Health 3.0 and social determinants of health,

894
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,220
and those sorts of health equity issue next week than I probably had

895
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,720
originally planned since that's such a big concern for people.

896
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,840
Great. All right, well, Kelly, thank you so much for your presentation today.

897
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,480
And everyone, thank you for your participation. And we will see you next

898
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,267
week. Thanks, everybody. Bye bye.
