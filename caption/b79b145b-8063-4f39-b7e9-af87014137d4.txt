1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,450
Go ahead. That's what you wanted to know.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:25,599
That's what happened. If you were not here last time.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:36,400
I have some handouts for you. So I'll talk to you later.

4
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:48,880
I guess I should tell you that I have dealt with this, but there's one I apparently did not print out.

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:10,990
Three more of letters that next thing I knew something about that Clayton County government knew all my stuff.

6
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,160
Okay. Make sure you call quick.

7
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:32,470
Okay. Everything is all right.

8
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,580
All right. We all came back, so that's exciting. You never know.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,750
No. So I want us to.

10
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,770
We have a few more folks who weren't able to join us the first time.

11
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:56,230
And so I'd love for them to say hello and tell us they're on the popular opinion.

12
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,240
Again, with the definition of this is an opinion that you something you most people like but you

13
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,230
personally do not like or I guess something that you like that most people don't like.

14
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:18,160
And I'm using it to learn all your names and the facts that Mary does not like Avatar, for example.

15
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,800
And I'm putting that in my brain and I'm going to learn everybody's going to learn everybody's name.

16
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:30,490
So do you want to go first or Bella or just say your name?

17
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,710
In our popular general API, you could say your program if you want.

18
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,870
Second year of the student and last couple of years, I.

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,700
I hate jeans. Oh, I miss you and my son.

20
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:57,900
You won't wear jeans. You. All right, C.J. and T.J., I am an avid student and I'm also a medical student during a master's program.

21
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,980
And then going back to school and I'll be an emergency medicine doctor.

22
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,460
Um, my so I grew up on the East Coast.

23
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:16,030
My unpopular opinion, I think it's in the state of Michigan is that if there's an empty lane and you will merge eventually,

24
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,490
it is bonkers to not use that to him for as long as possible.

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,790
You're a late merger. Oh, yeah. All right.

26
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,139
So me and the entire East Coast. Gotcha.

27
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,140
Yep, yep, yep. Use all you know.

28
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,310
Merge. Merge. When only necessary.

29
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,790
With absolutely necessary. Yep, yep. I, i, i.

30
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,370
I don't like the people who feel like they need to police my merging by state by driving between the two lanes.

31
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,880
It's like I don't like that too much. Yeah, I like it, but I.

32
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,850
Yeah, I understand. Sure, sure, sure.

33
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,310
Yeah. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. Yep. My name is during my second year.

34
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:06,390
I just did it. And my own opinion is I'm from Arizona and probably start by saying I'm from Phenix.

35
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,350
Go ahead. Yes, we'll have early football games.

36
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,750
So like the idea that like people like wake up at 7 a.m., like start like getting is just insane to me.

37
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,550
Like it's a Saturday requiring up to early to start drinking.

38
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,360
I just don't get it. Yeah, that's a good and popular one.

39
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Mackenzie. Yeah? Were you here last time?

40
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,610
I don't think so. No, no, go ahead. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I'm kind of beam or something.

41
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:50,920
Yeah. I want to go and get my unpopular opinion about like of how you understand this.

42
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,990
And camera. Are you here today? Oh, okay.

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,979
All right. Well, I have. I figured out how to print out. I'm learning.

44
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,050
I'm really going to work. I'm working on it. So this is like, all right, so I am.

45
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,180
So again, we are we have a lot to do every day because we only meet one day a week.

46
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:17,290
So I'm going to get right into it again. After next week, we will start class with our presenting the reader.

47
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,790
So that. And so for those of you who have not filled out the survey, just talk to me in the break and I'll get you assigned to a week.

48
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,500
Okay? So don't bother filling that thing up. Just talk to me during the week and in the break and we'll get you assigned a week.

49
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,740
Who who are our presenters for next week? Any questions that you have?

50
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,560
You need to do. Okay. All right.

51
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Sounds good. Okay.

52
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,940
So today we are we have a lot to do. So we're going to we're going to talk about sort of.

53
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:55,520
Sorry. I'll also I will give back up. I'm going to give you a little preamble and then I'm going to make sure that we have some time.

54
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,019
If hopefully you had a chance to watch the two videos online about I'm not going to cover this material.

55
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,010
So if but if you have questions about these materials, about schedules versus skills and sources of error,

56
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,180
we will make sure we have dedicated time for question and answer.

57
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,190
We're then going to do an activity.

58
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,500
So the value of being in person is that we actually get to do activities together, which we will, which we will do.

59
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,710
We will then revisit. We'll have a break at some point.

60
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,780
Probably after that, we'll revisit stigma, including a little bit more discussion of how we measure stigma,

61
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,749
attitudes and whether and how this is related to COVID. And then we'll have small group discussions of your project number one checkpoint,

62
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,950
which we're do 4 minutes ago or whatever, 6 minutes ago, as the case may be.

63
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:45,030
So I showed you the slide. I showed you this image on several different slides on our the videos before class, which are,

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,020
you know, again, these like headlines about, you know, depression is tripling, everything is bad.

65
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:00,240
The world's on fire. And what I'm what I'm hoping that you will get out of today and then the rest of this class is that these headlines

66
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,899
it and this is probably true of some other outcomes but it is absolutely true with mental health outcomes.

67
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,340
You must always ask how the heck were they measuring it?

68
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:19,200
What do they mean by depression? And I'll show you the example of what this one example of this headline actually the sad headline specifically.

69
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,240
So young adults report rising levels of anxiety and depression in the pandemic.

70
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,829
Okay. Well, that headline was describing this MMW R report,

71
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,959
which is the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which nobody had heard of until the pandemic.

72
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,380
And then suddenly it became like the hot thing to get. And those of us who've had it delivered forever, we're just hours into it.

73
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:47,880
Before was cool. But this this headline says, you know, mental health, substance use, suicidal ideation during the COVID pandemic.

74
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,950
So what did they actually say? If you actually go into this MMW AR, it describes the methodology and the way when they say,

75
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:04,410
I'm sorry and these this is their subsequent one, but both of these sorry, both of them measure it in the same way.

76
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,010
The way that they measure depression is this this is it.

77
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,660
Two items. So now you think back to June 2020, you're like, I can't breathe.

78
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,870
There is just a blank. It's just not found in my memory.

79
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,659
But this is what they asked people over the past two weeks.

80
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:29,340
How often have you been bothered by the following problems little interest or pleasure and doing things going down depressed or hopeless?

81
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,230
And you could have told them? Not at all. Several days. More than half the days or nearly every day.

82
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,290
Okay, that's it. That's their measure of depression. This is their measure of anxiety.

83
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,790
In the past two weeks, have you been feeling nervous, anxious or on edge and not able to stop control?

84
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,889
Right now, these two items are used as screening tools, predominantly in health care settings,

85
00:08:52,890 --> 00:09:01,950
to identify someone that you might want to either do a more formal interview with or a, you know, potentially refer them to for the first.

86
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,599
Because even if they're not meeting, even if they don't meet criteria for something they might benefit from,

87
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,290
like talking to a social worker or something. But the point is, is this is not major depressive disorder.

88
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,390
This is not a measure of impairment. This is not a measure of is this new?

89
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,919
Right. There's no mention here of like, is this always been the case or is this something new during the pandemic?

90
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,070
Right. There's no mention of time. There's no mention of intensity.

91
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,590
So other than the number of days. Right.

92
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:36,840
And so now, again, I don't know how what headline you would write if this is what you measured it, but I don't know if it would be this,

93
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:45,360
you know, so so the and we're you're going to use these tools in a minute, but our in our in our exercise today.

94
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,909
But I guess I just when you actually look at the data that produced the headline, The Measures of Mental Health, because there's no gold standard.

95
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,389
And as I wrote, as I talked about in the videos with the LED standard, leading experts,

96
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:05,879
all data, some quick measure like this is considered okay to use because it's you know,

97
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,080
it's not like there's a gold standard blood test that like, oh, no, that's the only way you would measure it, right?

98
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,830
Like there's obviously like a preferred way to measure it. So as a reminder, we talked about this last week.

99
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:25,070
The purpose of the DSM is to give us this criteria to establish reliable assessment.

100
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:32,960
That is its purpose. Give us the criteria that I can that if that if I give this, ask the same person to be interviewed by five different people,

101
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,000
that they should get about the same answer those five different times their prior.

102
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,450
The reason that this book exists in the manner that it does is that prior to the third revision in 1980,

103
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,719
there were no consistent, widely accepted operational criteria for what constituted each disorder.

104
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,170
We might have it names for these disorders, but what you consider depression?

105
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,139
What I consider depression and we talked about schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,

106
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,830
the fact that these were sort of really understood as being very different things in

107
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,290
the US and the UK meant that we actually couldn't even do basic comparative work.

108
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,589
Like is there more schizophrenia here than there is in some other place?

109
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,739
Like we could not answer that question prior to 1980. So again, our job is to get reproducible estimates.

110
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:24,710
It doesn't mean that there are true estimates, but of course most of us are interested in some some element of the truth, like know why am I it's it.

111
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,480
We're not here to just kind of measure the same thing wrongly all the time and never learn anything.

112
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,820
So what is validity mean when there's not a gold standard?

113
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,910
So this is the thing that sort of makes the challenge of mental health both challenging but interesting.

114
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,540
So so, you know, I'm sure that you've been exposed to measures like sensitivity and specificity.

115
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:56,090
I'm sure you've had to calculate this in some epidemiology class. And those are meaningful only when there is a gold standard.

116
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,900
Only relative to a gold standard. Such a thing doesn't exist for us.

117
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,629
So you'll see people calculate this. But what what a good researcher will do in the paper is say,

118
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:13,820
like temporarily assuming the psychiatrist is the gold standard or temporarily assuming this measure is the gold standard,

119
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,870
this is a sensitivity and specificity relative to this other of this other measure.

120
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,799
So instead, we sort of use these softer measures like face validity.

121
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,700
Does it look like it's a depression measure, construct validity?

122
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:33,020
Does it appear to encompass all elements of the of the thing I'm talking about,

123
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,120
convergent and divergent validity is the idea of a depression scale should

124
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,279
predict things like anxiety because depression anxiety are highly correlated.

125
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:52,729
It should not predict things like or to be less predictive of, you know, have you ever like sprained ankle or something silly like this?

126
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,180
You know, like it shouldn't it shouldn't be it should be divergent with it should be

127
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,030
not correlated with things that we don't think depression is correlated with.

128
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,960
It should be correlated with things that we think depression is correlated with.

129
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,069
So these are very few of these, if any,

130
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:17,240
I guess like criterion validity you could potentially quantify as a sort of a measure of how highly it's correlated with whatever your criterion is.

131
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,110
But these are generally not quantifiable things.

132
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,220
You know, there's a validity, sensitivity specificity allows to quantify validity, but only if we assume a gold standard which we don't have.

133
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,530
So we aren't able to quantify validity in many cases.

134
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:47,150
So the and this idea of what is depression and are the items that I'm asking people, the full set of things that constitute depression,

135
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,920
I want you to remember this when we talk about depression in the Christina

136
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,139
in a few weeks because part of what the challenge in in understanding why is

137
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:09,260
there a lot of depression in the west and almost no depression in China has to do with to what degree are we understanding the criteria differently?

138
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:16,190
To what degree are we using different words to describe the same phenomenon, but then also to what degree?

139
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:21,950
So those are sort of you say tomato. I say tomato, but fundamentally, we're talking about a tomato or tomato.

140
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,940
Right. But there's also a version of this where where there are things that don't fully translate.

141
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,780
And that doesn't mean that that's a that's not a validity problem.

142
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,750
That is a there is a or tertiary that's not a reliability problem.

143
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:43,760
That's a validity problem because there is a a truth that's existing in China that is a different truth than what's existing in the West.

144
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,569
And so our tool, which is just trying to measure tomatoes, is not measuring like squashes or whatever.

145
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,140
This is over here. Right? So the point is this this idea will come back.

146
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:01,489
I guess what I'm trying to all I'm trying to plant the seed of today I should do this graph before again pre DSM three.

147
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,219
This is where we are. This is the world we live in right now.

148
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,730
In the middle, we have reliable estimates but not valid, and we hope someday to establish valid and reliable estimates.

149
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,770
So what have you looked like?

150
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,010
You have any idea? As to why the DSM is called statistical.

151
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,570
You know this name, it's kind of a bizarre name. Like, what do you mean, like what?

152
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:34,040
Like there's so now there's probably an actual history as to where this name came from, other than it includes statistics, which it did.

153
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:44,960
But I actually think that there's a more fundamental reason why statistical that concept is important for us to think about the DSM.

154
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:53,360
So I'm sorry, I've got to reiterate, I've told you this already, but just to reiterate again, our goal is to provide reliable and that valid criteria.

155
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,599
There is no gold standard, but that doesn't mean there aren't better and worse ways of measuring the

156
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,639
things that we're going to talk about this class and we're going to spend a lot

157
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,420
of time today in activities using different tools and being able to compare

158
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,840
and contrast what are the strengths and drawbacks of these different tools?

159
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:23,750
But the other thing that is very different when we think about mental health is the difference between disease disorder and diagnosis.

160
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,400
I'm sorry, I don't want to scream.

161
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:39,980
So the fact that these so you might think there's there's probably a version of the world where there's some disease process in the center here.

162
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:50,710
Okay. And let's say that disease process is not for depression, but let's say that disease process is like this tumor stuff, cancer stuff happening.

163
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,020
Okay. A tumor is growing. And then there is this disorder that maybe we call it colon cancer.

164
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,169
And that disorder is describing this process and that process.

165
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,790
And it fits neatly within this diagnosis or within the category of disorder.

166
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,940
And then beyond that, though, there is this idea of a diagnosis, which is that somebody has tested and confirmed.

167
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,690
Right, because you can have this stuff going on without knowing it.

168
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,460
Right. So the diagnosis is not the same as having the health problem.

169
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,910
So but this is not the world we live in.

170
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:33,440
The world we live in for mental health disorder are is much more like this where you have sort of three and well, like more of a Venn diagram.

171
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:40,400
And I'll and the the fact that these three are not concentric circles is what makes this field both challenging but interesting.

172
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,530
So let me define these three words. So by disorder, all I mean is a health problem.

173
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,010
That's all I mean. So we major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, etc.

174
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,549
And we can describe that problem in terms of signs.

175
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,880
Signs are things that other people can see about you and symptoms symptoms are things that you typically report on.

176
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,340
I mean, somebody might be able to see them in you, but typically you report on them.

177
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,700
So the disorder is just a health problem. That's all it is. A disease is a known pathological process.

178
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,430
So recall back with last week.

179
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,690
I talked to you about the our doc and how they're trying to kind of figure out what's actually happening in the brain and these,

180
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,140
like fundamental neurological and neuropsychological processes.

181
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:30,020
We don't we typically don't know any of that for most of the things in our class, actually.

182
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,900
Let me ask, which which disorder do you think we have that we're going to talk about?

183
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,260
Do you think we have the best understanding of what's happening in the brain?

184
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,180
Schizophrenia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's?

185
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,490
What do you think? And I was thinking maybe PTSD just because that's something that we've spent a lot of time.

186
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,500
Mm hmm. PTSD from stress.

187
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,070
Stress? I mean, alcohol. Alcohol use disorder.

188
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,210
So the we we know the most about what's happening. The brain with drugs, drug use disorder.

189
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,360
And you might say, why is that? Why is that? Why is that?

190
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,300
Yeah. Is it because we know, like, what chemicals are entering the body.

191
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:24,170
We know what to look for. And which body are they entering like sometimes.

192
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,010
What else could they enter? Oh, yeah, we can. We can get it right.

193
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:34,879
Addicted to cocaine and see what happens. Right. So so because we have and this isn't a so this is why, though, because there are.

194
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
So what is substance use disorder?

195
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:46,720
Substance use disorder are using the the fundamental sort of reinforcement pathways in our brains directed towards, in this case, a substance.

196
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,570
That's all it is. Right.

197
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,010
But it's the same stuff that makes you feel good when you have sex, the same stuff that makes you feel good when you do well on a test.

198
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:59,360
That's all the same stuff. It's just being hijacked for cocaine. Okay. So in rats and animals and other things have that same structure.

199
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,719
And so we can that we can use animal models.

200
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,440
We have very, very good animal models of dependency that we.

201
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,899
So now do they describe what it means to, like, not be able to care for your kids because you're recovering from a hangover?

202
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,320
Of course not. Right. But the it but the fundamental physiology of of it.

203
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,990
Yes. So and we don't you know, we don't have good models in our models of schizophrenia.

204
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,640
We don't have but my my joke is I'll tell you, there's all like,

205
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:30,680
how do you know if a rat's depressed because I listen to the cure all day and you don't know who that band is, but that's okay.

206
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,400
All right. But or whatever your whatever your email sad music is, right?

207
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:39,250
That's what it's listening to. Okay, so up. So.

208
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,970
Right. So a disorder, just a health problem, disease, a known pathologic process.

209
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:51,980
So this is true for us, but it's also true for anything because that means that one disorder might have b actually multiple diseases.

210
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:58,430
So cognitive impairment is an example of one disorder that that could be Lewy body dementia,

211
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,569
alcohol related dementia, HIV related dementia, Alzheimer's dementia.

212
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,410
Right. There's lots of traumatic brain injury. Traumatic head injury.

213
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:16,010
So hungry now. Okay. So what's traumatic brain injury is trying to imagine is that to me or to the bread.

214
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,450
So but the point is, is like the same health problem,

215
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,439
the same signs and symptoms can have multiple different etiologic things that are actually causing it,

216
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,290
but they are indistinguishable in terms of signs and symptoms.

217
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,330
It also means that we might have one disease that we can view as more than one disorder.

218
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:42,469
So if any of you either have or no have, you remember, has a type like autoimmune disorder, these are notoriously difficult to diagnose.

219
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,900
People often go to multiple different practitioners. There's not a specific blood test for most of these conditions.

220
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,389
And so for an example, like my mother in law has lupus, before she finally got a diagnosis of lupus,

221
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,410
she had a diagnosis of like six other autoimmune disorders. It turns out it was lupus the whole time.

222
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,860
Right. But like, it was just sort of manifesting in these different ways. So that that again, that's an idea that there's one disease process.

223
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,420
But if you look at her medical history, you will see lots of different disorders being diagnosed.

224
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:17,059
Okay. So disorder, disease, and this is the thing that sort of that to me where the statistical part comes

225
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,440
in both disorders and diseases are characteristics of the person in question.

226
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,520
I have the disorder, I have the disease. What is a diagnosis?

227
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:34,820
A diagnosis is a procedure that is used to determine whether a certain disease disorder or disease is present.

228
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,150
It is a procedure. It is not something I have. I do not have a diagnosis of depression.

229
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,049
I have a disorder of depression or I have a disease in my brain.

230
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,010
Right? Whatever that is, it is a determination.

231
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,980
Or you can use the word assessment or you can be less charitable and use the word opinion of a clinician.

232
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:03,500
Or if I'm not in a clinical setting of a tool that is mimicking a clinician, mimicking what a clinician would do, like a schedule.

233
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,450
And I'm going to show you an example of this in a second to determine whether a disorder or disease is present.

234
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,660
So as I mentioned here, right, you can have cancer and not know it.

235
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,320
So you can have the disorder that is driven by a specific disease process and not have a diagnosis.

236
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,890
Because we live in this world of these that this Venn diagram where I can have the symptoms of depression, the disorder of depression,

237
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:38,390
which can have there's probably like 100 disease, part of depression, there's probably 100 different ways that your brain can become depressed.

238
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,430
So that's over here. There's only mild overlap of that. And then what is the diagnosis?

239
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,400
The diagnosis is the DSM criteria of having five or nine symptoms.

240
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:58,460
That's what the diagnosis is, is the DSM. So the DSM gives us the diagnosis piece, but that is not the same as the actual health problem,

241
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,139
nor is it in any way addressing the exact disease process.

242
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,590
Right. And so that's why we are that we're going too far back.

243
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,130
Okay. But that's I thought the reasons I wanted to show you.

244
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,790
Oh, maybe we'll just stop here for some questions. So.

245
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,360
So I give you the example of lupus and I give you the example of depression.

246
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:26,959
What are some other examples? Do you think that different illustrate the difference between a disorder, which is a health problem?

247
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,590
A person has a disease which is a known idiopathic process that's happening in the body and a

248
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:41,000
diagnosis which is the procedure for determining whether a disease or disorder is present.

249
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:53,060
Think about maybe your family members who've had to deal with diagnosis or difficulty getting diagnosis or be another example of this.

250
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,910
Yeah, but for my personality. And in what way would that tell me?

251
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:14,499
Talk me through your thinking. Well, I have a friend who is diagnosed, and I think they had before they could start the kind of trouble they're like,

252
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,770
oh, like maybe like you're depressed or like you're bipolar.

253
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:27,069
Went through a few things. One of. That's a great illustration of how difficult the diagnostic process can be.

254
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,780
Right. But but it also illustrates that it is a procedure because your friend has whatever they have.

255
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:38,860
Right. But depending if she gets seen by this set of providers, then this is the first assessment or this set of procedures.

256
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,950
This is the assessment. This set of procedures. This is the assessment. Right.

257
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,070
It's the I don't know,

258
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:52,780
to the degree to which we think about personality sort of having a like where it is in the brain in terms of I think took this part of it,

259
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,450
the disease part probably doesn't necessarily fully fit with it,

260
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:02,980
but it's definitely a great example of the difference between the disorder which is actually experiencing and the procedure or the what we call it.

261
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,590
What she's experiencing and what we call it. Right. Are sort of like the and those two are are not the same thing.

262
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,580
Yeah. Yeah. Rachel Okay.

263
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,880
And the connective tissue disorder for that now.

264
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:24,130
Yeah, yeah. But it's like a collection of different things that can manifest in different ways.

265
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah. Like 17 years to get an answer.

266
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,430
Oh yeah. What I have and I got a different diagnosis. Yep, yep.

267
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:38,680
Entire life. And it took a very long time, sort of like my symptoms stayed the same, those different things.

268
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,410
I got something caught in that and that. That sounds like a very difficult thing to go through.

269
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,060
I'm sorry. I'm glad you've got to answer.

270
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:55,690
My my cousin has Ella Daniel says oh yeah and it's name I mean just same thing like just it wasn't that often so.

271
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,050
Right. So here you've got you're experiencing these symptoms which are weird and like manifest differently in manifest not just

272
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,910
are potentially the same and you but differently in different people who have the same underlying disease process.

273
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:13,809
And sometimes you get in front of a a person who's going to do the procedure that knows about this condition.

274
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,800
And so maybe they may know to look for it or they know to test for it or, you know,

275
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:25,090
so part of it is like when if you think about the tools that we're going to use in this class as tools that are trying to kind of make a diagnosis,

276
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,380
then then I think that helps us separate it.

277
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,870
In some ways. It makes me be able to sleep better at night knowing that like I'm not a you know, this isn't depression.

278
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:45,910
I guess like part of it is like, you know, it's this is my this is a tool that I'm using to say this is where you are on this depression scale, right?

279
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,000
This is. And so separating out the validity. So I have to.

280
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,969
But part of it is my specialty. What good at night I have to be able to sleep well at night knowing that even though my assessments

281
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:01,000
are not valid in the sense that they are testing the and quantifying the gold standard truth,

282
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:13,749
that they are a reliable way to like kind of dip into this milieu of this person's experience and reliably come back with according to this tool,

283
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,469
this is where you are. Right. And so and as long as I keep that language in mind, like if you if you ever work with me on a project,

284
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,580
you'll hear me say things like, well, this person is depressed. I'm like, No, they're depressed.

285
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:32,650
What I would say is this person meets criteria. And I will say that's the language I use in my I try to use my papers because that is the truth of it.

286
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:40,030
They have met criteria. Those criteria may or may not be true or they may not be telling the truth about that person's mental status.

287
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:48,850
But I can. But it is true to say they have met criteria. So you another example I find like the all the flavors of like the domestic meal,

288
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:58,030
it's like really kind of trippy because at least with Alzheimer's, you can't diagnose it without a brain autopsy.

289
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,740
So like you technically can't ever say that anyone alive has Alzheimer's, right?

290
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,549
Because like, you need to see a slide of a sample of their brain.

291
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,830
And so it's just it makes it even murkier.

292
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah. It's a to just have to take the diagnosis out of the picture altogether.

293
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,100
It makes it makes it for in this case, like, almost like to take the disease part out because you have the diagnosis.

294
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,389
But I actually can't identify the disease until it. Oh it's after the fact.

295
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:32,410
Right. And so that that I think that's a great example of how the diagnosis of Alzheimer's

296
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,299
is not the same as whatever ideal pathology seems to be underlying that disease,

297
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,400
that form of dementia. Yeah. Yeah. I mean or like, or at the same time though like we do have a gold standard for.

298
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,900
Yes. So it is like in some ways it's like really satisfying.

299
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,309
And then we can see if we have a gold standard and diagnosis.

300
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,910
But that doesn't necessarily but that that is we have a gold standard for the procedure.

301
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:06,380
Yeah. So like so, so but. That doesn't mean that we have a that this procedure is itself has zero error rate.

302
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,560
So but that we have decided this is this procedure has the minimal amount of error.

303
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,520
Therefore, it is the gold standard, the minimal amount of error currently.

304
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,530
Right. Yeah. So, I mean, you think about this like with, um, like just an example.

305
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:25,520
So you could have type two diabetes or type two diabetes, especially early on in the disease process is asymptomatic.

306
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:30,300
You would have no there was you would you might notice your peeing a little bit more, but that's it might feel a little thirsty.

307
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,239
Okay. But there's nothing that you would say, like, oh, I have diabetes.

308
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,250
And if I asked you, hey, do you feel a little like you might have a little diabetes? Like, that would be a stupid thing to ask.

309
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,580
Like, because you want you wouldn't know. You're not even consciously aware of it.

310
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,799
So a blood test is the appropriate way to test. Now, there's lots of different blood tests you could do, you could do.

311
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,570
And hemoglobin I went see which we thought for a while we could use, but now it turns out we can't really use it.

312
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,070
Right. So the the gold standard here is an oral glucose tolerance test,

313
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,500
which I would guess that 4% of people with type two diabetes have ever had one of those.

314
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:06,720
Why? Because that's that's not the procedure. That is like insurance doesn't want to pay for it, etc.

315
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:11,579
Right. So the point is, is like and this is and they've decided, you know, what,

316
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,780
if fasting glucose, that's good enough for us right along with these other things.

317
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,059
So. So there are these other examples.

318
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:25,260
It's not just a mental health, but it's always in mental health that the disease, diagnosis and disorder are not the same thing.

319
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,300
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Yeah. So just for clarity, it's like the treatment that you get is something that just based on that.

320
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,260
Yep. Yep. That's your.

321
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,470
Yep. And that. And what do you think are the implications of that?

322
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,320
Well, it's it's diagnosis is like a statistical probability.

323
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:51,500
So you could be wrong, right? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

324
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:59,070
Right. So this is this is a yes. So not only is the treatment based on that, but there's the circular logic that in order to like,

325
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,180
you know, get into the treatment trial, the diagnosis is is done.

326
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,040
And those diagnoses to get into a treatment is, if ever, like read in clinicaltrials.gov,

327
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,139
like the the the screening that goes into like an antidepressant drug trial.

328
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,560
It's very much, much more extensive than than this.

329
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,629
But if you were at a primary care doctor's office in the United States, you might get asked these two questions.

330
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,650
And if you had a not very sophisticated clinician and they said, hey,

331
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,210
you've scored four out of six, that looks like you have depression here is necessary.

332
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:42,270
But that SSRI was not tested on these two questions. That SSRI was tested on a much more comprehensive schedule to assess depression history.

333
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,389
So it also kind of points to the fact that there are different procedures.

334
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:49,680
The procedure for getting into a trial is not necessarily the same procedure for determining who gets treatment.

335
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,550
Yeah. Lauren Jordan. Sorry. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

336
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,600
Kind of. I'm like it's more like, yeah, yeah.

337
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:06,710
I was talking to a friend earlier and he was experiencing, like, symptoms reminiscent of depression with times.

338
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:15,990
Really? Yeah. And then he went to someone who wasn't super skilled in them and they immediately like prescription antidepressants.

339
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,400
And then he found out after he saw that people that adult ADHD can mimic.

340
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,280
Yeah, yeah. And that's actually what he had. And none of the drugs he was taking was working for him.

341
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:34,400
Yeah. And that raises a great point, which is not only so if this is all for depression, right?

342
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,050
These three Venn diagrams, there's also I'm sorry, I can't like it.

343
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,510
Maybe there's a link drawn. I'll figure it out.

344
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:46,050
But there's also if this is the if these are the symptoms, there's also Venn diagrams of overlapping symptoms.

345
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,520
Right. Sleeping problems are common to everything. Anxiety is common to many things.

346
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,749
Right. Kids with autism have anxiety. Kids with autism have attention problems.

347
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,719
Right. Kids with autism might have sleeping problems. Right.

348
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,850
So the the notion that there's also all of that there's a there's a sequence of overlapping like a bubble graph or something that's happening.

349
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,649
So that so I want to add, this is great conversation.

350
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:15,630
I think it's really these examples really help illustrate, you know, when we think about statistics,

351
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:21,840
we think about probability, we think about sort of the the notion that there is error.

352
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,959
And that is what I want you to take away from that.

353
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:33,390
There is error in that the overlap between or there's error in understanding what you really care about are missing.

354
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:39,360
Part of the reason why we have such a poor understanding of the neurobiology of

355
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,890
most of the things we're going to talk about this class that is the disease part.

356
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,440
Part of it is because there is error and overlap in understanding the disease from the definitions of disorder.

357
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,150
This is from. Okay. And then that is diseases can be expressed differently.

358
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,030
That is the symptoms and signs that somebody has can be. Right.

359
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,370
And there is error in the process of identifying that disorder in disease through a process of diagnosis.

360
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,950
Okay, good.

361
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:20,010
So the other thing that we're going to talk about is that the other thing is, like we are when we talk about like how much depression is there, right?

362
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:26,969
What we are the symptoms of depression, sadness, sleeping problems, appetite problems,

363
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:32,440
fatigue, concentration problems, feeling guilty, agitation, thinking about death.

364
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,560
Right. Those are these are the symptoms of depression. Those we all experience, all of those things.

365
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:42,330
These are these are a dimensional sort of construct by definition.

366
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,499
But when if I'm a clinician, I need to make a decision.

367
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,629
Do I treat? Do I not treat? If I'm a if I'm a measurement tool, I'm trying to find how much depression is there?

368
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:56,180
What's the prevalence of depression in Ann Arbor? I have to make a decision. Are you in the numerator or the denominator?

369
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,300
Right. Like I have to make a decision. And that means that we are.

370
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:10,950
But we have to kind of grapple with the fact that the symptoms that are of something like depression are both common and nonspecific to depression.

371
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:19,110
So only in this what I'm showing you here, these are the symptom groups from the 19 that 1986 got about 20,000 people represented on this graph.

372
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:27,660
So the diagnostic interview schedule, what you're going to use in a minute asks every item of depression to all participants.

373
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:34,420
That's different than most other scales, which only ask questions among people who already and do endorse feeling sad or feeling disinterested.

374
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,960
Well, we'll talk about that in a second. But the point is, this allows us so that this is the estimate of lost appetite.

375
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:48,840
About 3% of people say they've lost their appetite in the past six months, not dependent on did they feel sad or anything else.

376
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,750
10% of people have had problems with insomnia in the past six months without being related to depression.

377
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,640
We don't know if it's related to depression or not, just like that's not dependent on endorsing that.

378
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,209
So you can see some of these some of these symptoms are very, very common.

379
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:09,360
But major depressive disorder that is meeting diagnostic criteria according to the DSM is not very common.

380
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,740
Only 3% of people in the sample met diagnostic criteria over the same time period.

381
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:27,170
And so no matter what we do, we're trying to to apply draw a line in the sand that is that our goal should be to draw a line that is useful for us.

382
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,710
Either it's useful because this is identifying someone who might benefit from treatment.

383
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:39,360
This is identifying this as identifying the size of the population that I need in terms of service planning, right?

384
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:47,750
So like the cutoff that we use here should have some utility, but that utility should not be to find the truth because we don't, we don't have that.

385
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,049
Okay. So yeah, so I like that.

386
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,150
So we're going to apply some categorical if you think about, you know,

387
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,010
a prevalence estimate or an Internet estimate, like are you in the numerator, are you in the denominator?

388
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,600
We have to make that those those thresholds in order to make any a clinical diagnosis or to estimate incidence and prevalence.

389
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,479
But no matter what we do, we are going to lose some statistical power to do that.

390
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,460
Right. But I think the point is that I'm trying to make here is that acknowledging that mental disorders are the symptoms,

391
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:28,199
the symptoms of mental disorders are are ingredients are experienced by all people at different points in their life,

392
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,610
course for lots of different reasons.

393
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:40,730
And the tool of diagnosis, that is the procedure of deciding are you in the numerator or in the denominator has to sort of it has it.

394
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,110
We can think about it more usefully if we think about like what is the purpose of making this threshold okay.

395
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:53,430
But if you are trying to if you are trying to look at risk factors for depressive symptoms, you wouldn't have to do that.

396
00:38:53,430 --> 00:39:01,740
In fact, you would lose statistical power if you if you categorized your outcome, you could use symptoms as an outcome in a more a gradient way.

397
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:08,940
So the other is the last thing I want to say. I think about this before I stop for questions and we'll do our activity.

398
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,990
Is that because of this problem?

399
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,439
That is because disorders like ADHD and like the because there's all this

400
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:24,269
overlapping symptoms when we apply these these kind of these cut points to say,

401
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:30,120
okay, five of nine is depression, six of 12 is a gad, whatever.

402
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,110
When we do that, we can artificially create co-morbidities.

403
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,309
That is, you know, so people say, oh, depression is co-morbid with anxiety, you know, what the [INAUDIBLE] is that?

404
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,940
What does that even mean? Right. They they share many of the same symptoms.

405
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:52,560
So when we talk about co-morbid, if you tell me that heart disease is comorbid with or so yeah, stroke is comorbid with cognitive impairment.

406
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,660
Well, now I'm interested, right. Because now that we think there's like an actual physiologic process by which the stroke.

407
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:01,260
Harms the brain. And then the brain is we can develop dementia later.

408
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:07,440
But do I think there is a a meaningful physiologic process between depression and anxiety being co-morbid?

409
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,889
Probably not, because they just they share a bunch of symptoms.

410
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,390
And so, of course, they're going to be correlated.

411
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,790
So I guess I want to emphasize that there's lots of different ways that we can think about co-morbidity.

412
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:24,989
And if you this is one of the things that the DSM still doesn't have a good answer for in terms of grappling with,

413
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:31,080
because we know that if you meet criteria, for one thing in that book, you almost certainly meet criteria for more than one thing in that book.

414
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:37,470
That is that in a lot of that we think is just an artifact of the fact that these things share symptoms.

415
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:47,480
So what what would be useful for us is under understanding comorbidity that does tell us about a known or a meaningful pathological process.

416
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:52,920
So just as an example, some of the work I do is on depression and risk for later type two diabetes.

417
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,610
Well, those two things are correlated.

418
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:02,160
It seems weird that they would be right that depression in your twenties would be related to diabetes in your sixties.

419
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,489
But we think that there's probably actually both behavioral and physiologic processes that are underlying that.

420
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:13,410
So like that comorbidity then leads to a line of research to kind of understand why,

421
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,600
because it it doesn't have anything to do with measurement, because the way you measure diabetes is blood.

422
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:27,300
The way you measure depression is talking to somebody. Right. So it's not that they are sharing signs and symptoms are okay.

423
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:33,930
So hopefully you've taken away from yours that measuring mental health is complex, but it makes it fun.

424
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,469
Again,

425
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:41,340
there's no simple indicators that can reliably indicate the presence or absence of a psychiatric syndrome or even differentiate between syndromes.

426
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:47,910
The most valid way that we do this is talking to people or observing people, which is labor and time intensive.

427
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:53,130
There are very few studies that have that kind of the the LED stand,

428
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,670
the best things that we can do in terms of and I'll show you this example of schedules in a minute.

429
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:04,979
There's very few studies that do this. Most of the studies, like the names or breakfast or these other surveys that are, you know,

430
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:14,540
their job is to just sort of like give us a snapshot of the health of the population, include very short 2 to 6 item measures of these things.

431
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:20,580
Right. And I just want you to take away from like they're useful for what they are, but they are not the truth.

432
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:26,670
Yeah. And as I mentioned, they're not readily distinguishable from other things.

433
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:32,810
And again, there's things there's I want to also make clear that there are some things that are subclinical.

434
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:41,580
So just because someone in the in this case, you know, the can to just because someone in June of 2020 said that they were experiencing some anxiety,

435
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:47,670
doesn't mean that that person should have necessarily been prescribed an SSRI, which is a first line treatment for anxiety.

436
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,140
Right. So okay. So questions.

437
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,710
Sorry, you're going to all my means today. Two questions here.

438
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,240
I'll show you a different one is that my son loves these books.

439
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:07,990
This is not a real book. But this I mean, metamorphosis, obviously, Israeli book.

440
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:14,200
This is not the cover of Franz Kafka. Okay, sorry.

441
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,350
I mean, you're like we Newbery. Okay, so let me ask a different question now.

442
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:25,730
So for those of you who are who were able to watch the videos online, do you have questions for me about anything that came up there?

443
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:32,480
So remember, this is both how you ask it. What are the sources of error and feel research more generally in survey research more generally?

444
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,680
And then what are the differences between schedules and scales?

445
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:55,570
Okay. Well, maybe this will you might generate some questions here.

446
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:07,220
So what I like you to do now is I need everybody at square two, four, six, eight, nine, seven.

447
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,460
Okay? So we don't quite have enough for any one group or three.

448
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,270
So what I need you to do is I need everybody to take one of these.

449
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:22,140
One of the every group of two. So you're like, this is so that's why I need you.

450
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,900
And I'll tell you what what you're looking at.

451
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:37,200
So as that's going around, so you are what I'm handing out to you is actual survey, the actual copies of a survey.

452
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:43,230
So this is the one of the interviews that was actually used.

453
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,800
This is not real data. This is my scratch data. In the 1993 interview, I was I was not that person.

454
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:57,270
I wasn't I don't know what has happened. But during this is the actual interview for the Baltimore Epidemiologic Kitchen Area study, Third Way.

455
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,580
Okay. So the actual survey instrument that we that interviewers went out into their households and used this other

456
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:10,739
piece of paper that your get that you're going to be getting in teams is what's called the probe flow chart.

457
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:17,729
And the protocol chart is what interviewers used to guide them through these questions.

458
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,530
So what I'm about to do, what we're going to do collectively and then you're going to do in pairs on your own,

459
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:30,470
is we're going to go through a schedule. I'm going to do this because there's you're almost ever never going to see this again, right?

460
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,559
I should say never again, but very few of the state studies that we use do this.

461
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,620
All right. So I need everybody does everybody have a repair?

462
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,430
Kind of has if we have extra. So yeah. Because you need a buddy.

463
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,330
Okay. So you need a pro flow chart and then your your survey instrument.

464
00:45:53,890 --> 00:46:17,060
There should be a group of three or I can be I can be with somebody to begin with.

465
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:31,239
Okay. So with your buddy, these are they're extra pro flowcharts because you want to actually know, will you let's just everybody try to take one.

466
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,210
And so we're we're done with those because I have one might be helpful to you

467
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,490
have a jury okay does anybody want an extra one just to have on their own?

468
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,250
If you want on on your own, just grab it from Cynthia here. All right.

469
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,290
I need you to just grab one. Okay. There's actually herring. So here's what I need to I'm going to tell you.

470
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,530
How did this work? So interviewers used to memorize this.

471
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,420
That's the first thing before we had computers. Interviewers memorized what is on the sheet.

472
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,790
Let me walk you through this. The first thing that happens is you're going to and I'm going to practice with you.

473
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:11,530
You're going to ask the question if the person says no to everybody looking at their probe flow chart,

474
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,090
if the person says no, I code probe one and then I'm gonna to go to the next question.

475
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,830
I'm going to walk you through as an example. Right? But I'm showing you how this thing works.

476
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,889
If the person says yes, the next thing is a box, a decision tree, and it says, Do I see a one and a five?

477
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,050
Only if so, code five ask on set recency eight.

478
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:35,409
That's down here. So, okay, so I'm going to walk you through this.

479
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:39,760
Don't worry if I don't see you one in a five, I keep going. Do I see one, three and five.

480
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,700
Only if. Yes I'm going to go to see C is here is probe three missing probe five.

481
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,460
If it's not, I keep going then I'm going to ask this question. Okay.

482
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,300
So this is this is letter.

483
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,530
So we're going to do this in practice, but I just want you to what you're doing is what are like going through this chart, this.

484
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:59,829
Yes, no, yes. No. I know it's confusing, but you're going to this is.

485
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,660
Okay, so here we go. So you have an I have you have a copy of what I have.

486
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,670
So this is the actual this is the original. And you have a few. What?

487
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,090
The other thing you have is this page, the depression module of what's called the diagnostic interview schedule.

488
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:19,480
This is a fully structured diagnostic and interview that is used to measure lifetime history of major depression.

489
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:32,260
Okay. So the very first question is, in your lifetime, have you ever had two weeks or more when nearly every day you felt sad, blue, depressed?

490
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:38,110
Now you see to the right it says Probe one five. Right? So that means I'm an interviewer.

491
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:46,120
I go to my pro flow chart. I've got this sitting on my lap. I don't hear it says let's say my respondents said yes.

492
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:54,790
Okay, so I say yes. I go is a15 is it class? What do I see one in five here and only one in five.

493
00:48:55,630 --> 00:49:01,180
Okay, so what do I do on code probe five.

494
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:10,780
So I would circle five right now on my thing and I would go to what onset recency down here?

495
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:16,470
Who wants to be my interviewer? I'll do this first one and then you can do it for two years.

496
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,760
When was the first time you felt sad? Blue, depressed?

497
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:30,300
Do you see where I am? Okay, so you're going to tell me that when was the last time or.

498
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,639
And how old were you? Sorry. Right. Because I'm going to write down what was the when was the first time onset recency.

499
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,060
Now I have these are my codes here. Can you believe it that people did this?

500
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:46,020
This is because this is what they did. Okay. So and we still do this with some surveys, so they're going to code it.

501
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:51,640
All right. I last had that symptom of, you know, six months ago.

502
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,790
Was it one month to six months ago or was it six months to a year ago?

503
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,070
Six months to a year ago? Okay. And how old were you when that happened?

504
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,210
Okay. And when was the last time you had that symptom?

505
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,860
I you know, last month. Okay. So I'm going to code that, too.

506
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,320
Okay. Now, I've I've asked my first question. That's my first question.

507
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:26,140
Next question. Have you had two years or more in your lifetime when you felt depressed or sad most days, even if you felt okay sometimes?

508
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,150
No, I haven't had that. Oh, thank goodness. Okay. I'm going to l for you.

509
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,760
See that. See that. Okay. Down to l four. Ba ba ba ba ba ba.

510
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:41,830
So there you can see all these interviewer instructions that this is all built into a computer now, but at the time this is what people had to do.

511
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:49,590
Okay. During a period when you felt depressed and you see this own equivalent, what do you think that is for?

512
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,590
If you don't work, if you don't like the word depression.

513
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:57,480
So if at the top here, you might have said, well, you know, there was a time when I felt really rundown.

514
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:04,200
Right. So when you felt run down, did your work ever suffer at home or at the job or on the job?

515
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:11,550
No. Okay. During a period when you felt when you felt depressed, did you become cross or irritable?

516
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,760
No. Okay. I think I'm done. No, no.

517
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,700
You're on to the next. So this this every question.

518
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:22,230
Even if even if you say no to every one of these questions, it's going to take, like 15 minutes to go through.

519
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:28,530
Okay. But now I want. Now I need a. Now let's take a look at what's under column I for column one.

520
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,910
It says Ever in lifetime. What do you see? You don't just see once in five, do you?

521
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,420
You see other things. Right. See? Probe one, three, four, five.

522
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,900
Star. Correct. Right there. The first one.

523
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:44,700
So what is that? So now this probe flowchart is going to get more interesting.

524
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:48,990
All right, so do I have a I volunteer to interview me.

525
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:56,070
Ask me or ask me. Read me the question. Yes, please.

526
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:02,130
So what? We're also very confused. Are you on the amount on l6?

527
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:13,500
Yeah. Okay. L6 l6 has there is has there ever been a period of two weeks or longer when you lost your appetite?

528
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,450
Yes, that's right.

529
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:26,160
Now, where do you need to go to go? Well, it's the probe says one, two, three, four or five.

530
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,620
So I'm on my everybody. So I asked my question and I've got my probe flowchart.

531
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,600
So. So you go to see you. So.

532
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,750
Well, here we are. So we're going. Yes. Yes.

533
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:41,640
One five. Nope. That's not me. One, two, three, five. Is that me?

534
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,850
No, no. Keep going from 1 to 1.

535
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,390
I'm just. I'm not. I'm just going to follow the arrow until I get kicked out.

536
00:52:51,840 --> 00:53:00,340
So what is the next thing that I need? You need to ask me, which is, do you tell me, tell a doctor about losing your appetite now?

537
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:11,330
Well, now what happens? Okay, so now we're going to probe to this is probe two missing for years.

538
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,310
So now where do I go? Now we got to be all right. So four missing.

539
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:23,250
So it is probe for missing for my question. No.

540
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:33,210
So from here. So what was losing your appetite was the result of a physical illness or injury?

541
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,000
I had the flu. It was so bad. So.

542
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,390
Wait, wait, wait. But listen. Okay. So now. Yes. Yes.

543
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:51,190
So go to. Go to this dot, dot and the symptom.

544
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:55,380
This is the. So I just told you I had the flu. Okay.

545
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:59,220
So, physical illness. Yeah, that's me.

546
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:12,570
So it was the loss of appetite, always the result of a physical illness or injury, such as having the flu, such as having a flu.

547
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:23,040
You know, there was a time when I was in college and it was it was really rough.

548
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,830
I didn't know what to do with my life. And would you believe it that I just I just had no interest in food?

549
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:34,410
So. So, yes. Okay, well, record it.

550
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,799
And why not? So I said so I've just. So you asked me was an always and of course now notice what I did.

551
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,330
I didn't answer your question. Yes, no. I conveyed what the story said, but now you need to translate.

552
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,080
My answer was it always the result of the flu, or were there times when it wasn't?

553
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,550
There were times that it was. So now I got to go to know now what's happening.

554
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:57,600
Prop three medicine. No, no.

555
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:12,830
So when you said it at the time was not due to a physical illness or injury, was it always the result of abuse and medication or drugs or alcohol?

556
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,250
I don't drink. So, no.

557
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:20,579
Well, what I would say is I mean, so a lot of people don't drink.

558
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,600
Let me just repeat the question. Right. Yes.

559
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,260
No, no, no. This is this is this is this not treating.

560
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,410
Okay, go ahead. You're doing great. You're doing great. Pleasure.

561
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:36,180
You were doing it. So so I would say, like, okay, that's interesting. Let me just repeat the question.

562
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:42,500
Okay. It's interesting. When you lose an appetite, what's.

563
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:50,200
Due to a physical illness or injury. Was it always the result of using medication, drugs or alcohol?

564
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:55,780
No. I told you there was a time in college that I just didn't I had no appetite and I wasn't there wasn't.

565
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,900
I don't drink. I don't do drugs. Did you use any medication?

566
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:04,000
I don't know. Just keep on saying no.

567
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,290
I said no. That's code full time.

568
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:14,310
Yes, I said he said c D.

569
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:23,680
Yeah. Uh, uh, when was the first was the first time you lost your appetite?

570
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:32,500
You lost your appetite when it wasn't due to a physical illness or injury or to medication, drugs or alcohol.

571
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:37,090
That's when I was in college and I was in my twenties. So I was trying.

572
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,350
But this is this is how a person would talk, right? They're going to tell you because they don't know what you're trying to do.

573
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,830
They're going to tell you about their life. Right. So that was perfect.

574
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,219
That was perfect. That was great. So this first one is very hard.

575
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:53,230
Okay. But once you practiced on this, you would you would know that sounds off your hand.

576
00:56:53,860 --> 00:57:01,239
Really? What? And now my job when I was the project coordinator for the 24 wave of the survey was to turn this into a computer algorithm,

577
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,770
which you better believed took a lot of time. So I know this. This is seared into my brain.

578
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,579
So now you might say, well, what the hell's a code five, right?

579
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:16,180
Why am I doing that? So these codes means you can you might be able to infer it based on this probe flowchart.

580
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:21,700
So a code one means that that thing didn't happen.

581
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:31,090
Okay. So that's so when this data actually gets downloaded into SAS or R that this variable L six is going to have a value of one,

582
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:36,700
one, two, three, four or five. Right? And so if it's got a code of one, I know that that means that didn't happen.

583
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:42,610
What if it has a code two? So a code two, the way that you get to code two is in this box.

584
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:49,599
A And so you see, if you look at the questions here, well, did you tell anybody else about it, any other professional?

585
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:56,649
Do you ever take medication or do ever interfere with your life? So if you tell me no to all of these things, that means that you had that symptom.

586
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:59,860
But it wasn't serious. It wasn't something that I want to pay attention to.

587
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:08,410
So a code to which they decide is not eligible so that they've decided that something like losing your appetite, if it happens, it's serious.

588
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,530
That's basically what it's what they're saying. So that's not it.

589
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:21,550
You're not even eligible to have that there. But there are some if you scroll down to one that's got a code, too, there aren't very many.

590
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:32,320
Well, for depression there's not there, but there are some for like other. So this proposal charges for everything, everything in this book.

591
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:38,620
So bipolar disorder or panic disorder, all of them use this exact same probe, probe, flowchart.

592
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,969
Okay, so there's nothing in the Depression module, but if there was okay, so what is it?

593
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:51,400
Code three. So code three are now in the C box, which is medication, drugs or alcohol.

594
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,729
So were you feeling that way because you were taking a drug that suppressed your

595
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,690
appetite because you were using you were using drugs that suppress your appetite.

596
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:08,200
So if the if the answer is yes, I was this that thing happened and it was happened when I was hung over that it gets coded as a code three.

597
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:14,290
So now as again, when I see that data on the back end, I know not just that you had that symptom that you lost appetite,

598
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:23,349
but you lost appetite and it was due to medication, drugs or alcohol. Similarly, code four is this physical illness or injury, right?

599
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:28,260
So you can lose your appetite because you had the flu or because lots of things can happen.

600
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:34,120
Right. So if again and and so if it gets code four, it means you had that symptom.

601
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:39,940
But it was there's a cause for it. The cause was the flu in my if I'd only had it during the flu.

602
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:50,229
And so what you can see is that the only way to get a code five is to exclude that that symptom happened because of medication,

603
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:54,700
drugs or alcohol, a physical illness or injury or it occurred, but it wasn't serious.

604
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,380
And so if something gets coded five, we call it a plausible psychiatric symptom.

605
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:04,630
That is, it is possible that that thing that happened to you had something to do with a depressive disorder.

606
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,809
Now you can compare that when you do your trading spaces.

607
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,800
So and then you ask, when did that symptom happen? How long did it last, etc., Right?

608
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,969
So you can compare the level of detail that we've just done to measure one

609
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:23,799
symptom to what you're going to do in your trading spaces thing in a minute,

610
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:30,850
right? Yes, please. So when you get like the clothing like that, obviously they'll be like, yes.

611
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:35,229
Is that reasonable? Refusing to answer the question if the whole thing is missing.

612
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:40,770
Yeah, they could refuse. Yeah, but that would also be code. Like we might we would have like a refusal code.

613
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:44,170
So we would call that like a nice. Eight or nine. Nine seven, probably.

614
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:50,950
Mm hmm. So. So then you do that for all four or all of these and.

615
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:58,390
Well. Well, but let me. Let me have you walk through the question of panic attack, which you don't.

616
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:04,420
So what I'm about to set you loose on is to do a trading spaces activity, which is not with this.

617
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:10,480
You're welcome to kind of keep messing with this. But there's there's an activity on campus that you can also do.

618
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,820
But let me see where is part of a section h section.

619
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:25,840
So where are you? So I need you to have your pro flowchart and I need a volunteer interviewer.

620
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,350
Okay, so this is the question.

621
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:38,770
This is the this is the stem. So I do I have a volunteer interviewer and the code probe, the probes and I'm looking at it.

622
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:43,149
You don't have this, but I'm looking at it. This is this is the probes that I'm looking at.

623
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:49,450
But this is the actual question. So I volunteer to interview me who who will be my interviewer.

624
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:58,150
It's only one question. Sure, sure.

625
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,399
Yes, go ahead. Have you ever had a spell or a top one?

626
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:09,410
All of a sudden you felt frightened and anxious or very uneasy in situations where most people would not be afraid.

627
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:14,740
You're anxious. That is when you are not in danger or this tension or doing anything like that.

628
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:25,710
So, I mean, I always want on this like roller coaster and I hate roller coasters, but it was I didn't realize how just long it was.

629
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:39,760
It was like rickety and oh, my God, I was just it was the worst idea that comes to you.

630
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:46,780
They just like in your head, are you are you a is that a question?

631
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:51,850
And what should you do here? What has happened?

632
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:57,280
What if what if I. What is the respondent done? Oh, well, that's good enough roller coasters.

633
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:00,550
Let me repeat the question. So I've misunderstood your question.

634
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:09,310
Right. So now as an interviewer, because we have reliable assessment, what can you ask me say,

635
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,990
hey, look, a lot of people, you know, that's not what I'm talking about here.

636
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:21,250
What can you do it? You can say, oh, interesting. And and these words are bolded.

637
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:24,910
They're underlined here, but they're bolded here. So try one more time. Okay.

638
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,770
So, but pretend like that just happened. Like, sorry when I was on the roller coaster.

639
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:37,160
Oh, okay. Well, let me repeat the question. Why not clarify some of the key points?

640
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,999
Okay. Yeah. Have you ever had a spell or.

641
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,489
It happened when you were four, when all of a sudden you felt frightened, anxious,

642
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:54,130
or very uneasy in a situation, or most people would not be afraid or anxious.

643
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:00,160
That is when you were not in danger or the center of attention or doing anything like that.

644
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:06,570
Oh, I was not in danger. I was I was paying attention when you asked the question first.

645
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:15,580
Um, well, there was this time when I was on the, the subway in DC and the,

646
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:25,510
the train stopped like the power went out and we were there for like 2 hours and it was very so I just, I felt like I was going to lose my mind.

647
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:37,540
And I got really scared. Yeah.

648
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:50,570
Well, what do you think? Should she take it as a yes? I mean, the scary thing was your idea was so great.

649
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:55,129
So. So part of it is this. If and think about this.

650
01:04:55,130 --> 01:05:00,840
Right? So now she we are so you can't see this. But the next thing is, could you tell me about a spell or attack like that?

651
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,990
And she's supposed to write down this example. So the next question is, I didn't realize I forgot that you guys don't have this.

652
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:09,380
So the next thing you should be is like, give me some more information there.

653
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:15,139
Right? And so with that information, it may be that you now decide that is really a panic attack.

654
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:19,130
That is. Or that that's possibly a panic attack, because you're going to ask me a bunch of questions afterwards.

655
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,790
So let's say you said yes. All right. So you said you decide that's the case.

656
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:32,360
Now you have a one, two, three, four, five. So let's begin here.

657
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:39,140
So you've asked the question and I have I am a yes. Is that just one in five?

658
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:43,340
No, it's one, two, three, four, five. Is it just one, three, five?

659
01:05:43,400 --> 01:06:00,430
Now what is my next question would be the part eight or did you tell your doctor about your spell or that which one is the one when you're like,

660
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:04,040
oh, I, yeah, yeah.

661
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:13,100
I talked to my doctor about it. So when you told the doctor what was the diagnosis,

662
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:28,280
she said that I probably just had a panic attack and that sometimes you forget those are your stress.

663
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,690
Okay, so that's an easy one. See, that wasn't me, but you know, it is about that.

664
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:37,340
So it's because sometimes people have.

665
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:42,980
So you're using and think about this like this thing is trying to recreate what it would be like if you were in front of a therapist.

666
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:49,430
That's what it's trying to do. And so if you knew that somebody had seen a doctor before, you'd ask what that other doctor had said.

667
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:52,100
You don't want to use that information in your own understanding.

668
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:57,559
You're not saying, again, this is like a big list, like stress, nerves, anxiety, you know, who the [INAUDIBLE] knows, right?

669
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:03,799
People use different words for it. Again, I'm not making the diagnosis just based on this, but then I would I'd want to know that information.

670
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,430
And it looks like that person likely had a panic attack.

671
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:14,120
And then there's a whole bunch of that now. And then there's four more pages to actually assess all of the things that happened and the symptoms,

672
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,660
individual symptoms that happened during the panic attack, etc. We're not going to go through all that.

673
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:21,410
This is a schedule. This is this is a diagnostic interview schedule.

674
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:29,149
This is what is used in this data. This is if you use the before your project, you use the collaborative psychiatric epidemiologic surveys.

675
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,920
This is the type of data they collected. If you use data from the National Network,

676
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:41,480
which is the National Epidemiologic Survey on alcohol and related conditions, this is the type of thing they did.

677
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,180
If you use data from NHANES, they use the page.

678
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:49,160
Q8, if you use data from surface, their use the weight, which now you're going to use in your small group.

679
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:52,970
So just again as a as a comparison to the level of detail.

680
01:07:53,330 --> 01:08:01,600
So this is a two and a half hour interview. That's what this is kind of even if even if life has just been rainbows and unicorns,

681
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,620
this is a two and a half hour interview because people get asked almost all these questions.

682
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:09,290
We don't you don't really skip out of things.

683
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:15,410
So you can understand why a lot of surveys don't include this unless their focus is on mental health,

684
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:19,760
because it takes a long time to do a good assessment of somebody's mental health history.

685
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:29,329
Okay, so we are then the thing I would like you to do now and then I'll and then I'll ask you to both do and then head into the break.

686
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:35,390
So we'll we I'm going to basically let you at it for the next you know, I'll say 50 minutes, actually.

687
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,140
Is that right? For, you know, 40 minutes, 40 minutes.

688
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:44,240
So we'll do 20 minutes of activity and then we'll take our 20 minute break is on canvas.

689
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:50,540
You will see this activity trading spaces and so in your groups.

690
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:58,400
So these are all these are all tools that are used to measure different different kind of mental health conditions.

691
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:04,129
So alcohol use disorder, depression syndrome, anxiety, this is panic and generalized anxiety.

692
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:09,080
So I want you to choose one of these three. I want one of you to be the interviewer with one.

693
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:09,769
Okay.

694
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:16,610
So if you chose alcohol use disorder, one of you interview somebody with the audit and then the other person interview the other person with the cage.

695
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,940
Okay. So you're going to be an interviewer and interviewee.

696
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:28,159
You should feel free to like I didn't ask you like didn't make the school play about like this should be the time to bring out your hamlet,

697
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:34,160
you know, or whatever or your what was, what was her name from Much Ado About Nothing.

698
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,460
Who is she? The protagonist in that one. Oh, here.

699
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:44,380
Yes, yes. Here. So the. So bring out your best Shakespeare, you know.

700
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,030
So that is. Do you do not feel you are a do not answer truthfully.

701
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,710
Just come up with whatever makes sense. Okay.

702
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:56,429
So and then this this link here is leading you just to this little worksheet to help you think through it.

703
01:09:56,430 --> 01:10:00,120
You don't need to turn this. I'm not at you don't have anything to turn into me from this.

704
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,809
But this is just a thing to kind of help guide your your doing it.

705
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:11,070
And then collectively, after we come back from the break, we will do an empathy mapping exercise where we will talk about what is the interview.

706
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,120
When you were in the interviewer, what did you hear? What did you see when you were the respondent?

707
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,120
What did you hear? What did you see? How did you feel, etc.?

708
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:24,239
Okay, so I'm going to so again, we're going to I'm going to not talk to you for 40 minutes.

709
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,500
I'll be here in 20 minutes, maybe a flag that it's 20 minutes and you should feel free to get up,

710
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:34,470
go get a drink, a little break and we'll take our 20 minutes and then we'll be back in lecture in 40 minutes.

711
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,730
Any questions about this activity? Okay.

712
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:51,880
All right. I'll choose what or what you don't want to do, and neither do I.

713
01:10:52,830 --> 01:11:00,690
Okay. We don't do that.

714
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:12,660
And I think that's one of the other.

715
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:26,300
Yeah. Yeah. I want to tell you everything you know.

716
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:38,940
Don't keep getting us out of the time.

717
01:11:39,160 --> 01:12:09,870
When we heard from the doctor, I guess I had a heart problem in the real world where I was in college, so.

718
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,680
But I'll have to trust you.

719
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:26,890
Yeah. So what do you do when you're out there?

720
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:33,730
You'll ask your question.

721
01:12:34,700 --> 01:13:11,610
Really is, do you have every right to be for all of them?

722
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:24,540
Have you thought about it?

723
01:13:29,570 --> 01:14:01,180
You know, how old were you in the last year when I was like, okay, I would I would say,

724
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:31,260
you know, I don't know all of us whether I think I feel pretty low.

725
01:14:38,280 --> 01:15:35,089
I have to tell you that I'm sorry, but it looks like it's all your stuff, so there's nothing you can tell people.

726
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:52,230
Excuse me? It's almost as if that 0.00, oh, oh, god.

727
01:15:55,930 --> 01:16:05,960
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

728
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:42,950
You're right. Well, this week or two months later, I heard you were not able to find out what's going on.

729
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:52,130
All right.

730
01:16:52,520 --> 01:17:32,360
Just because I didn't know about a10 win over 15 year old girl during the housing program, so.

731
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:40,520
Oh, yeah.

732
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:55,050
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

733
01:17:57,850 --> 01:18:18,710
Yeah. I just want to have my last year help or hurt my other relatives or friends.

734
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:26,240
I don't care what you're doing.

735
01:18:28,250 --> 01:19:19,750
Yeah. So he does the past year, and that part of the restaurant is over the past few years, but not now.

736
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:25,880
But I think there's a lot of things we're up.

737
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,050
And you know what?

738
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:35,650
I was. Okay.

739
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:48,190
Well, you know what I am doing.

740
01:19:51,100 --> 01:20:33,910
I would like to hear your thoughts on the way that some people are not ready to promote that you have ever heard.

741
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:58,630
Well, I always to try and find out whether someone is right or where the power.

742
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:10,510
I think you have to do your computer processing.

743
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:22,370
I just want you all to become very, extremely busy again.

744
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:38,700
Even though I was eight years old and I was like, Wow, that was okay, so let's help.

745
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:49,480
That's enough. If I was right now.

746
01:21:52,970 --> 01:22:00,430
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Definitely valid for myself.

747
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,510
And my mom was 42.

748
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:10,750
Him. It's really tough.

749
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:22,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right.

750
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:38,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:57,450
I know. That is probably one of my criteria.

752
01:22:57,650 --> 01:23:27,830
Yeah. I just feel like, oh, I think about it from here that it's more about different things like that.

753
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:42,690
Yeah we are so currently that another part you know what you're saying?

754
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,980
Wichita Falls.

755
01:23:48,220 --> 01:24:10,540
Sorry. Oh, my God. You know, or you know, where else is that?

756
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:33,490
And it makes you wonder where you probably get a lot of different views on how you get it.

757
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:43,760
Whether or not. Question, because this is one more thing for us to go through this.

758
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:53,870
Yeah, well, I don't know.

759
01:24:53,920 --> 01:25:05,059
Maybe it just felt like before I told you and your family.

760
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:22,010
It's not like when I go over to your house.

761
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:38,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

762
01:25:43,730 --> 01:26:10,520
I guess what I would like to see happen and that's not what happened this morning.

763
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,560
I didn't always like.

764
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:59,950
I remembered that like I never I never really heard there was something that was that was coming through that I wanted to tell you.

765
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:09,570
I like, you know, and I think it's okay to go to an exhibition and I don't know,

766
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:18,319
I think it was just playing it like it like, yeah, I've never do that.

767
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:31,850
Even like I could talk to us and I was like, this is one of the most important things.

768
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:51,110
Maybe a few thousand people, maybe. Sometimes I feel like I'm sorry that I left you.

769
01:27:51,230 --> 01:28:00,850
You know what I mean? You know that you're on September 11th, not long after the war.

770
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:27,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

771
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:39,180
I already have like a little.

772
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:54,280
On the other hand, I don't know what it's like.

773
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:11,810
I guess I wouldn't lie.

774
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:33,800
Think about it because somebody else like me about it, I would say, know, I grew up in a country where, you know, from as far as.

775
01:29:37,610 --> 01:30:01,200
But as you know, we've got a company which is actually we have got someone that's yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:10,100
I think that's more comfortable.

777
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:25,120
So I don't know, I, I don't know.

778
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:39,550
I guess it's all right.

779
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:52,809
All right, everybody. That was so hard to believe, but you've already been at it for 20 minutes, so you are now on break for your 20 minute break.

780
01:30:52,810 --> 01:31:01,209
Okay, so get up, Stretch. Go outside. When if you want to hang out here, when you get back, there is a link again on canvas.

781
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:10,900
If you scroll down to all the way down this empathy mapping that that brings you to this and all I'm asking you to do is you have to do this.

782
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:14,049
Now, we'll start off the first 5 minutes when we get back filling this out.

783
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:15,700
So can I want you to give you your full break.

784
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:26,020
But if you're I have just the way you use this as you you grab this thing and you can make a duplicate of it and then you can say, great, oops.

785
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,989
Well, you wouldn't do that, you know, but you can just make a duplicate.

786
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:35,229
And so if you're a respondent, just when you were a respondent, think about what did you hear, what did you think and feel?

787
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:38,620
And you just post your little move your little Post-it notes here, okay?

788
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:45,159
So try to make one for each circle and then same for when you were an interviewer, when you were an interviewer, what did you hear?

789
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:48,700
What did you think and feel? What did you see? What did you say and do? Okay.

790
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:54,759
And then we'll collect a big and you don't need to do this right now if you don't want to spend the first 5 minutes when we get back doing this.

791
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,760
But you are on break now. Okay. So so no.

792
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:11,980
And all right, here we go. And we want to know if you agree.

793
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:22,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

794
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:31,870
So how do I know?

795
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:53,560
I don't know what else is in front of it.

796
01:32:53,980 --> 01:33:24,330
Yeah. Yeah, I was just trying to do a job where I really feel like, what am I going to do the same for?

797
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:33,930
I do think. Yeah, yeah, I, I really like that.

798
01:33:34,630 --> 01:34:14,420
When I stopped going and I was like, not like one of my really wanted to know if you yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

799
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:20,979
I got a lot of questions that I was kind of like.

800
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:32,260
I was like, yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:36,980
I go because it. Like a French geneticist.

802
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:41,980
She also kind of depends on very much for me.

803
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:47,500
Yeah. Oh, I know that her look because, like.

804
01:34:52,720 --> 01:35:00,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:14,650
You know, first of all, it looks like, you know, all the guys, you know,

806
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:47,220
with words or like my mother today, they realize that now we have a very good one.

807
01:35:47,960 --> 01:36:02,120
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what doctor said to any real people.

808
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:17,830
I even have some sort of, like, you know, I didn't get nothing far.

809
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:37,360
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:45,880
Oh, what was your name? But I'm sorry.

811
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:52,860
I didn't mean to protect you. Yeah.

812
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:48,910
Yeah, well, listen, part of knowing that you don't have to tell everybody has to do with the fact that the school was like,

813
01:37:50,280 --> 01:38:07,500
oh, something I want them to know that I want to be able to come out with this people I like.

814
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:14,240
I remember about 75%.

815
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:26,920
Yeah, but I really don't have to worry about that more than that.

816
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:30,820
But you never know.

817
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:44,280
And then I was just thinking and then was like, Well, we are affected by this.

818
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:51,390
Yeah, yeah. I mean, so I was like, I'm not much different.

819
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:56,290
And so I don't like that in your classes.

820
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:16,840
I do that because, like I said, Supervisor, as you and I are out of the office, like, I mean, I hope that you all have the ability to do that.

821
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:25,520
Yeah, well, I had a proposal from wanted to celebrate the Mexican.

822
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:33,460
I oh, yeah. That's, that's why I was like that.

823
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:43,810
Which is like how she says, because you have to figure out it was just so relaxed.

824
01:39:44,990 --> 01:39:52,760
You know, the lines are like there were two old seasons.

825
01:39:53,570 --> 01:40:14,900
I really like the first thing I wrote about that idea that it's like, I don't like you're saying that, you know, we're out there watching your show.

826
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:38,780
She was mentioned. And you can always just, you know, kind of make it just is going to help those words that you have yet to hear all of it.

827
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:45,740
We can't help you. It's not like the drought.

828
01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:54,010
Yeah. Yeah.

829
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:58,000
No, no. Yeah. It's a real people.

830
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:02,960
I always say, you know.

831
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:08,150
I probably shouldn't say that.

832
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:20,500
But it's like, you know, I have a personal issue.

833
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:48,800
It's not like, you know, I think that my resonate whether or not I read something or other things and it just like,

834
01:41:49,150 --> 01:42:24,500
you know, I was I hate myself when I was going to put you know, it was like I wasn't sure I might as well get into nothing.

835
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:47,490
So I know that it's more of a visual skill because like, I go for the period of working and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:54,860
That was pretty cool.

837
01:42:56,270 --> 01:43:07,060
But I'm not one of the 141 regular people.

838
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:19,030
Like there was wonderful like two or three shows, you know, and then it, it, it really is.

839
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:26,730
Well it is. You can focus, but not quite way, huh?

840
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:42,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

841
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:49,340
I thought you were the one. You heard the one. Yeah, yeah.

842
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:53,989
It's a great time. Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep.

843
01:43:53,990 --> 01:44:01,930
I will do what I want you to do what I like.

844
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:12,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, you're looking at the yellow one for the Hollywood.

845
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:17,770
Never. Yeah, yeah.

846
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:32,540
Those will make it a real thing that people on the right path.

847
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:48,340
Like near the folks that might be required to supply protective gear.

848
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:56,880
Yeah, there's something like this for a while. Are you all right?

849
01:44:57,460 --> 01:45:07,270
There's three little black folks. I don't think they're going to want to get out there.

850
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:13,870
Yeah, that's great. Are you going to have this awesome.

851
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:17,640
It's a great question.

852
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:35,720
Yeah. I mean, yeah, I'm like I would certainly like a similar I remember I was just I have no idea.

853
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:44,230
I do it. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

854
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:52,650
I know there are a lot of different brands, but I would not be willing to drive through it.

855
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:58,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

856
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:04,080
Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah.

857
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:17,410
Okay. Now, though, I wanted to play hard things like, oh, no, look, it's hard work.

858
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:22,930
Or like, this is something that I would raise.

859
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:26,700
Yeah, yeah. Like every country.

860
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,239
And I'm like, very well. Yeah, I like that.

861
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:48,550
Hopefully I can play anything that over 100 people have the heart attack.

862
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:54,240
Oh, my God. Yeah, I know.

863
01:46:54,640 --> 01:47:13,710
That sounds more like you name, because that's what I hear about it, but I think it's one of those times.

864
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:21,070
Yeah. Okay. How do you get comfortable working on that?

865
01:47:21,130 --> 01:47:26,460
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

866
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:31,300
She's the one. Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

867
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:37,570
I know, I know, I know.

868
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:41,660
I remember that.

869
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:52,540
Yeah, it was sort of a high value.

870
01:47:52,840 --> 01:48:10,490
Yeah. Like when did your sister for you? Because maybe right out of high school.

871
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:40,810
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

872
01:48:42,970 --> 01:48:54,450
So I don't know what's going to be like, Oh, my God.

873
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:26,990
I think you are place one of the most important ones in all my dad's concert.

874
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:57,819
But I'm sure I did not know this and I'm like, Well, I think that I'm going to have to live with any of your kids for a few years later.

875
01:49:57,820 --> 01:50:08,200
That's something that I like to see him on like this all the time.

876
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:16,690
Oh, come on. I know it's not.

877
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:27,480
It's not about making all my clothes like everything I do.

878
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:43,770
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was reminded of that, you know, that I would you know, I'm worried about him.

879
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:53,350
Let's bring it. Bring it back. So feel free to keep getting especially with your your buddies are your your partner here.

880
01:50:53,350 --> 01:51:00,999
So I'd like you to just we're going to spend the first 5 minutes just again, when you were the respondent, what did you hear?

881
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,600
What did you think? What do you see? What you feel? You're already doing it here. Just copy that.

882
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,389
And that way we sort of know it.

883
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:15,850
And we'll I will we're going to spend a few minutes kind of putting these things out here, then we'll discuss it as a as a group, so.

884
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:25,440
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

885
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,770
I just it would it's nice if we have the as the as the unique colors and I mean.

886
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:34,130
No, which which. No, no.

887
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:40,389
All right. Well, I'm. I can't watch this. That's going to drive me nuts. Okay, so I'm just going to when I go to here, where's my go?

888
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:45,280
Here we are. It's just, you know.

889
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:56,380
Yeah, I know.

890
01:51:56,770 --> 01:52:05,160
It didn't go off.

891
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:35,220
I continue to to put you through this.

892
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:51,350
So it was kind of cool of.

893
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:03,170
Oh, yes.

894
01:53:20,770 --> 01:54:46,930
Oh. She's one of the most influential people.

895
01:54:47,120 --> 01:55:05,920
And I don't know, it's just not it's just, you know, it's like.

896
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:21,170
You just got about one minute left and then we'll we'll take a look at it.

897
01:55:28,530 --> 01:56:11,750
So we're really eager to see how it transparent.

898
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:20,120
All right. Oh, well. All right. You guys are great. So.

899
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:29,450
All right, so let's start with our goal.

900
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:35,149
All right, so let's talk about what we heard since we were interviewing.

901
01:56:35,150 --> 01:56:43,320
So for those of you who were. So, again, interviewers are in are in yellow wrap.

902
01:56:43,370 --> 01:56:51,470
Sorry my interviews and look. Pardon me. Okay. So the interviewer, you wrote that you felt you heard the tone,

903
01:56:51,620 --> 01:57:01,129
you heard the stories instead of direct answers, confusion from the respondent voicing very good.

904
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:03,510
Yes. Answers that didn't fit. Very, very good. Yes.

905
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:10,909
So this is and and this is also a very good point, like you are deciding between occurrences, right.

906
01:57:10,910 --> 01:57:15,780
So like well, I don't know, like I've you know, I've never thought about how many days in the past two weeks.

907
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:26,360
I've, you know, this is not a unit that we use for things. And all of these are important for these elements are important for sort of essentially,

908
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:33,170
if you if you recall back to the the online lecture about how do we do survey research,

909
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:37,010
these are all pointing to reasons like why we don't just start with depression.

910
01:57:37,060 --> 01:57:40,640
Right. You just kind of started with depression or alcohol or whatever.

911
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:46,009
But if you were actually doing this, you would have asked a bunch of other questions ahead of time to get the respondent used to it.

912
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:49,940
What is it like to do this interview? What are we help? What kind of questions do we ask?

913
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:53,840
What are the response scatter? You know, you might have even had a card.

914
01:57:54,410 --> 01:58:02,000
Oftentimes, if I have like more than three response items, I'll actually give the respondent a card, like a kind of a laminated piece of paper.

915
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,299
And I'm like, These are the response items. So you can actually look at it and have it in front of you.

916
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:10,070
And then you don't even have to look at me when you're telling me the answer of like how many days I'm, you know, three.

917
01:58:11,090 --> 01:58:17,560
So, so that those are sort of reflections of now I'm not saying this wouldn't have happened anyway, but, you know,

918
01:58:17,570 --> 01:58:23,570
this part of this is a reflection of that your respondent wasn't necessarily kind of in,

919
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:31,490
you know, attuned to like the sort of the mode of the interview for the respondent.

920
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:36,260
What you heard was the questions are very short that there wasn't follow up.

921
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:40,040
And so this I presume this is about like I wanted to say more. Right.

922
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:44,540
But there was no follow up that happened. Right. It wasn't even a conversation.

923
01:58:44,540 --> 01:58:47,989
Clinical language. Yes. Good, good, good accusations.

924
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:51,620
Yes. And that. Right. And then you've got these elements here. Right. Accusation, denial.

925
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:51,980
Right.

926
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:59,480
So does anybody want to sort of I don't know which one of the topics that you did here is we want to tell us a little bit more about what they heard.

927
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:03,049
Yeah, well, I guess it's not a question mark so much.

928
01:59:03,050 --> 01:59:04,640
I hope I understand. Yeah.

929
01:59:04,640 --> 01:59:10,690
We're like, if you can really say that without saying I think there's a lot of things that we did was alcohol from the civil character.

930
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:16,670
Yeah. Um, the alcohol when it was they asked questions on like what other people like

931
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:21,139
perceived like do you look to people in your life and like they would answer like,

932
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:23,690
oh yeah. Like they think I do it too much. Like, I don't think so.

933
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:30,020
That's kind of like I'm obsessed with like, yeah, it was supposed to be like neutrals.

934
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:38,330
INTERVIEWER Right, right. And then for the, the accusation when you were the, the respondent, how did you.

935
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:42,559
Yeah, yeah. So I, we also did the alcohol use disorder.

936
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,549
So the same with the case.

937
01:59:44,550 --> 01:59:54,120
Usually you just come right out of the game like, you know, do you regret the date and kind of tells you immediately like what's happened, you know?

938
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:55,770
So it's not like it was really accusatory.

939
01:59:57,650 --> 02:00:06,890
So what kind of what kind of setup do you think would have been necessary to help make that those questions?

940
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:12,680
So because remember, what we're trying to we're trying to get reliable answers.

941
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:18,840
I'm not trying to tell you the truth, but if you talk to me, you should tell me the answer, if you know what I mean.

942
02:00:18,850 --> 02:00:25,690
So that's so. What could what could an interviewer do to potentially help set that up?

943
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:32,640
What kind of things would you if you were the respondent? Right.

944
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:36,820
What kind of things would you want to be reminded of maybe before you got asked this set of questions?

945
02:00:37,150 --> 02:00:42,970
Yeah. You were trained in medicine to be like we ask people these questions all the time.

946
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:48,910
Like, a lot. You know, it's just like. You look like normal, is it?

947
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:52,270
You're just like, yeah, we ask these questions to everybody.

948
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:57,189
You know, you might and you can have like, what I often do is like because the interview,

949
02:00:57,190 --> 02:01:02,160
so like this, this booklet here is it's got a bunch of different sections, right?

950
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:11,170
So when we get to the alcohol section, which is much longer than everything you, you all did, you know that there's, there's not much of a preamble,

951
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:16,840
but it does say like the next few questions are about alcoholic beverage, beer, wine, liquor or anything else to drink with alcohol in it.

952
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,809
So just even giving a little preamble, right?

953
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:26,020
So like you could say that the next few questions are about alcohol, you know, beer, wine, liquor, anything else to drink with it.

954
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:30,130
And then in here, we don't we don't start with the key to the next question.

955
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:33,520
The very first question we ask about alcohol is during the past month,

956
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:42,400
that is what is today that 11 since about December 11th, about how many different days did you drink any alcoholic beverages?

957
02:01:43,030 --> 02:01:45,610
So this is a cognitively challenged questioning, right?

958
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:49,810
Because I have to figure out, like, okay, how many of those past 30 days on overlapped with New Year's?

959
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:55,180
And I can tell you, like whenever I ask people this question, they're always like, last month was a hard month.

960
02:01:55,990 --> 02:02:00,549
It's always a hard month. And it's sad. Of course, it's never actually always a hard it's just like that.

961
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:03,879
But they tell me that and I'm like, okay, well, just how much was it? Right.

962
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:13,060
So again, like this is we ask this everyday good. Let's move on to the the the seeing what did you see?

963
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:16,600
So this is sort of an interesting question to think about with an interview, right?

964
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:21,700
And sort of the whoops, the fact that you're in person. Okay, make it bigger.

965
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:29,980
Like zoom in. Yes. So this is something that's different, right, than if you were in a telephone interview or if you were a webinar or you.

966
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:36,710
So what did you see when you were a so remind me again, which one is the you yet trying to remember?

967
02:02:36,730 --> 02:02:41,650
You're actually watching the process of like and people will tell you that people when you

968
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:46,629
recall something you are constructing that memory as much as you are recalling it like you are,

969
02:02:46,630 --> 02:02:50,380
especially with something like out of how many of the last seven days did you

970
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:54,040
feel said you were constructing that answer as much as you are recalling it,

971
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:57,970
because you don't have a memory of how many days like you don't have that memory, right?

972
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:06,910
So you're making it. So you're seeing embarrassment staring at the shirt you have staring at the survey.

973
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:11,900
Good remembering. Yeah, good, good, good. So these are things, again,

974
02:03:11,950 --> 02:03:18,279
that and these are elements that when I train interviewers like we spend a lot of time doing exactly what we just did here.

975
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:23,169
We spent I mean, I make them interview you. You know, I only made you interview me twice.

976
02:03:23,170 --> 02:03:28,180
I make them interview me like multiple times, and then I make them recruit me into the study and I'm like, here's my cell phone.

977
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:34,479
Like, I need it. It's, you know, they'll call me and they'll, you know, and they'll say, like, all right, you know, that I'm like,

978
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:38,680
when you call me, I want you to call me exactly as if you're right, if you're trying to recruit me.

979
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:42,760
So they'll call me. And those are like, Hi, is Mismos like there? And I say, Yeah, who is this?

980
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,819
And they're like, It's me, it's Jane. You told me to call you.

981
02:03:45,820 --> 02:03:51,700
And I'm like, I don't know you, Jane, and hang up and then they'll like text me and be like, I thought we were supposed to practice.

982
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:55,989
And I'm like, Yeah, so try again, you know?

983
02:03:55,990 --> 02:03:59,379
And I mean, but I get people in my thirties, right? But you got a problem.

984
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:02,470
You got I'd rather you screw up with me than screw up with a participant, you know.

985
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:06,519
So good. So, yes, you saw people staring at a computer.

986
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:09,880
This, you know that you know, you've been to the doctor lately. It probably feels very similar.

987
02:04:10,330 --> 02:04:17,770
And then how did you think and feel? So this is something I think that we don't often remember is like that the so the respondent is feeling

988
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:26,230
nervous is feeling annoyed the but also there's the interviewer at times you're feeling nervous and annoyed,

989
02:04:26,230 --> 02:04:26,590
you know.

990
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:34,240
And so I think that like it's one of these things where this is why role play is such an important part of learning how to do this type of work.

991
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:40,560
Because you just like I'm sure the first time you tried to like I don't even know some,

992
02:04:40,830 --> 02:04:43,270
you know, do a handstand or something, it's probably not going to go all right.

993
02:04:43,270 --> 02:04:48,759
But the more that you get, the more that you practice this, the more that not only you're going to see all the different ways that people respond,

994
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:52,660
but you're going to develop your own repertoire for responding to people.

995
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:57,309
And then what we also typically do, especially we're training people for telephone interviews,

996
02:04:57,310 --> 02:05:01,389
is all these things are recorded and then you can listen to them with other people who are doing it.

997
02:05:01,390 --> 02:05:04,810
So you can kind of, you know, get feedback from other interviewers.

998
02:05:04,810 --> 02:05:14,730
Like, what would you have said here? Because people do want to talk about things, you know, and often especially like, you know, we had a, you know,

999
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:21,670
a situation once interviewing somebody who, you know, had attempted suicide and they were telling me about this.

1000
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:27,220
And, you know, I'm going through the questions because these are questions that we ask in our in our depression module.

1001
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:31,560
You know, and then you you sort of are gauging how they're feeling.

1002
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:35,610
So some for some people, this is something that happened and they want to tell you about it and move on.

1003
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:41,999
For other people, they want to go, oh, they might want it.

1004
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,450
They they might want a break, you know, or they might want to say, like, can I tell it?

1005
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:49,950
You know, like it's like, are you going to ask me more questions about that? Cause I kind of want to give you more information, you know what I mean?

1006
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:52,080
Like they want it to, even though I'm not meeting it.

1007
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:57,690
And if they and if something like that happens, I always just like, I'll take the like I can tell you to.

1008
02:05:57,690 --> 02:06:04,620
I should I should just sort of say it's amazing to me sometimes I IRBs will tell me, like, how can you ask people all these sensitive questions?

1009
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:08,430
They don't want to talk to you about this. People very much want to talk about this stuff.

1010
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:15,569
People are dying. They are very much they want to because this is real stuff like this is real life.

1011
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:19,350
And nobody asked them about this. Nobody asked them about like their suicide.

1012
02:06:19,470 --> 02:06:23,490
Have nobody asked them about the time when they, like, lost their job and like.

1013
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:28,200
No, because these are uncomfortable things to talk about here. Not only do I want to talk about, I'm writing down everything you're saying.

1014
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:33,929
I've literally had people show up to appointments with like their medical records. They're like, and you please put these in my file.

1015
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:39,030
And I'm like, Okay, I'll go make a copy. And then I stand there for however long I think is convincing.

1016
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:42,360
So I have copy medical records and then bring them back.

1017
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:46,739
I'm like, Ah, because that's, I mean, I couldn't possibly, you know, but I'm not going to tell them like, no, I'm.

1018
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:50,969
What do you do? You know, but it's this is a record. I mean, this is a record of their of people's lives.

1019
02:06:50,970 --> 02:06:54,810
And so I've also had people tell me, like, ah, is this an intervention study?

1020
02:06:54,810 --> 02:07:04,290
And I'm like, no, I just just felt like therapy because, you know, in there, you know, part of it just just giving space to talk about these things.

1021
02:07:04,290 --> 02:07:10,319
So okay. So any other things people want to comment on before we're going to switch back and I'm going to close out with the last little bit.

1022
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,980
It may other things you want to raise about the measurements here.

1023
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:19,010
Meantime, you look like you might know there's a park.

1024
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:30,920
Okay, so the last few things I want to share with you, I want I want to revisit stigma, which we we had to go through real quickly on Monday.

1025
02:07:32,030 --> 02:07:40,190
And I just want to kind of emphasize, again, like kind of the difference between what we just did in terms of measuring,

1026
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:46,370
um, in this case using tools as a procedure to decide if somebody meets criteria.

1027
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:52,220
Right. This is again, separating those things out to how we measure something like stigma, which we typically measure indirectly.

1028
02:07:52,910 --> 02:07:57,649
So now as a reminder, what why stigma like why?

1029
02:07:57,650 --> 02:08:02,170
What is the purpose of stigma? So Bruce Link argues that stigma has three purposes.

1030
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:07,250
It is to keep people down. It is to keep people in or is to keep people away.

1031
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:13,610
Okay, so stigma has again keeping people down, keeping people in or keeping people away.

1032
02:08:15,290 --> 02:08:23,870
The way that we measure stigma and most public health research is through a a construct or a measure we call social distance and social distance.

1033
02:08:25,550 --> 02:08:34,070
Long before it meant social distancing like we use here is essentially the desired distance you have between yourself and somebody else.

1034
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:39,500
It's not spatial distance, but sort of like, do you want them in your life or not?

1035
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:40,820
Or how much you want them in their life?

1036
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:46,549
So a low social distance is that is characterized by a feeling of common identity that you identify with this person.

1037
02:08:46,550 --> 02:08:49,670
This is a member that's part of your group. This person has shared experiences.

1038
02:08:50,030 --> 02:08:54,530
This is someone that I understand. This is somewhat I want to I want to hear from.

1039
02:08:54,950 --> 02:09:01,660
High social distance is more aloof. It is even disconnected with diffuse fear.

1040
02:09:01,670 --> 02:09:05,300
The other person is a stranger, an outsider, but and potentially even dangerous.

1041
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:12,559
So I told you on our last week that the way that we measure social distance is we give people again,

1042
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:18,680
this is a very different think about how different this strategy is compared to what we just did, but we give people a vignette.

1043
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:23,629
And so this is an actual vignette from a general social survey, which I read this to you last time.

1044
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:26,900
So I'm not going to reread it, but I'll show you the other one in a second.

1045
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:30,650
But you can see that we are using the word schizophrenia.

1046
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:36,210
So this person, most people in America, do not know what this means. Most people think this means like split personality or something like this.

1047
02:09:36,230 --> 02:09:43,610
They don't actually know what schizophrenia is as a condition. And so we you know, we don't describe the symptoms.

1048
02:09:43,610 --> 02:09:47,120
It's just he's got this thing, you know, he's gotten treatment.

1049
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:52,610
He's doing well know. Now, how do you feel about Jim being a neighbor, etc.?

1050
02:09:53,540 --> 02:10:00,320
This one is now not going to use the word schizophrenia. This is not going to use the symptoms that's that Jim was experiencing.

1051
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:04,850
So before admission, he was experiencing problems and perceiving the world around him.

1052
02:10:04,850 --> 02:10:09,830
He would sometimes hear voices which were hallucinations. His process of thinking was confused and tangential.

1053
02:10:10,190 --> 02:10:13,700
He would often shift from one idea to another. At times he was difficult to understand.

1054
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:18,260
So again, these are all the things that if you were watching Jim, this is what you observe.

1055
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:27,170
Bless you. So and even goes on to say that his grooming and hygiene deteriorated as he began before he got treatment.

1056
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:31,370
So that's it's very clear here. So, again, how much do you want, Jim, in your life?

1057
02:10:31,670 --> 02:10:35,959
Right. So and then the question is, is it this word schizophrenia?

1058
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:41,480
Is it what Jim is experiencing, his physical or his his actual manifestations of his illness?

1059
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:47,870
And then you can also do this to say, well, now it's not Jim, now it's John, Mary Hogan or Maria.

1060
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,359
Right. And these and so you can vary these things.

1061
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:58,249
And so it's a really interesting way to think about sort of and you what you would not only would you vary these,

1062
02:10:58,250 --> 02:11:05,970
but you would randomize who got these things. So then you could really sort of isolate like is it the symptoms, is it the characters?

1063
02:11:06,230 --> 02:11:12,340
How much of this is the is the characteristics of Jim, which in this case, he's not his race is not described, but he's described as,

1064
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:18,229
you know, his race in this case is not describe his ages, but like you can vary all of these characteristics.

1065
02:11:18,230 --> 02:11:26,390
And so it's a really neat way to think about intersecting stigmas or intersecting sort of disparate intersecting what am I trying to say?

1066
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:32,180
Just identities, I guess, as they might relate to stigma.

1067
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:36,740
And again, what would you would ask that after reading this vignette is as an example,

1068
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:43,910
how willing would you be to have this person and vignette moved next door, spend an evening worth, work closely with or have marry into your family?

1069
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:46,670
And again, these response categories here and again,

1070
02:11:46,670 --> 02:11:53,899
this is you can this is linked to this is a link to the general social survey, which is the survey that tends to just fill these.

1071
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:58,040
I wish there were that these questions were in more general health surveys,

1072
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:03,230
but they typically aren't like I'm actually not aware of a health survey that includes these types of vignettes.

1073
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:09,110
Social distance has is a persistent sort of situation.

1074
02:12:09,110 --> 02:12:15,550
So this is minor problems, which is basically how much you don't like people. So you refer everything again comparison to this, but you can see it.

1075
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:24,820
From 1996 to 2006, there's really been almost no difference, no decline in the amount of social distance people want.

1076
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:27,190
And this maybe this is surprising,

1077
02:12:27,190 --> 02:12:34,210
maybe not this that you might have suspected that schizophrenia would have high desire for high social distance, but alcoholism does, too.

1078
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:39,220
Right. So this is a very and the drug use is not on here. But if it was on here, it would be it would also be high.

1079
02:12:40,810 --> 02:12:51,220
Other studies have shown that what seems to be driving social distance is this perception of dangerousness, that this the element that this.

1080
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:54,670
So remember, what is what is stigma do it keeps people down. It keeps people in.

1081
02:12:54,670 --> 02:12:58,450
It keeps people away. So this is keeping people away, okay?

1082
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:07,450
Because that I am afraid of those people. And so if when you think about schizophrenia or you think about alcohol, dependance or what have you,

1083
02:13:07,450 --> 02:13:18,310
what you are imagining is or what is what, what that what that condition is mapping on to is fear or dangerousness slash fear.

1084
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:31,659
You have a very strong desire for social distance. So and now I guess the other thing I want to emphasize is the this this concept of familiarity.

1085
02:13:31,660 --> 02:13:38,650
So familiarity refers to like how much is not how much do you know about this condition, how much you know about people who have this condition.

1086
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:43,840
So what's interesting is that familiarity is not at all correlated with fear.

1087
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:51,580
Okay? It's it's inversely correlated with perceiving someone is dangerousness, but there's not a direct effect to fear.

1088
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:55,630
It is inversely correlated with wanting social distance though, which is good.

1089
02:13:56,590 --> 02:14:02,409
But this this tension between familiarity and fear is shown by something like this.

1090
02:14:02,410 --> 02:14:09,489
So this is a survey that looked at psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, other therapists in the general public.

1091
02:14:09,490 --> 02:14:15,760
And they were that these exact same vignettes that I just showed you, one for schizophrenia, one for major depression, and then one for a non case.

1092
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:21,909
Again, this would be a minor problem. So this is sort of the default of how much stigma each of these groups feels towards people.

1093
02:14:21,910 --> 02:14:28,570
So psychiatrists of note, actually, psychologists report the most wanting, the most social distance from all people.

1094
02:14:28,630 --> 02:14:36,310
You can take with that what you will. But even someone who's got nothing, no nothing going on, psychology does not want to spend any time with them.

1095
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:42,459
So so what I want you to see is so let's start with schizophrenia.

1096
02:14:42,460 --> 02:14:51,500
So the general public that wants a social distance of 2.96 psychiatrists want a social distance of 33.3, right?

1097
02:14:51,640 --> 02:15:02,770
Psychologist 3.03.01 Nurse So that is the medical professionals do not want less social distance from somebody with schizophrenia for depression.

1098
02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:08,230
That's not true. So people, the general public wants a little bit more social distance than your general professionals here.

1099
02:15:09,580 --> 02:15:13,570
So, you know, it is what I'm trying to say is that, again,

1100
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:19,270
there's familiarity and then there's sort of the way in which people get access to that familiarity.

1101
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:22,690
So how do people how are these specialists getting access to familiarity?

1102
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:31,400
They're treating people right and they're treating people who are not doing well.

1103
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:34,399
But with whatever treatment that is existing, oftentimes, right,

1104
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:38,270
they're coming to them potentially in a crisis or after a suicide attempt or something like this.

1105
02:15:38,270 --> 02:15:47,329
Right. So they're seeing people sort of they're at their worst, most symptomatic and consistent with that.

1106
02:15:47,330 --> 02:15:52,549
If now you go to the next step and you say, okay, so what type of.

1107
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:53,000
So again,

1108
02:15:53,000 --> 02:16:02,870
I told you about how we told you about we talked about buck verbal and the fact that stigma attitudes become concrete right in different policies.

1109
02:16:02,870 --> 02:16:10,640
So now what we're asking is, what kind of restrictions would you endorse for different for somebody with schizophrenia.

1110
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:15,200
Oh, so this is for anybody with any anti any mental illness, right.

1111
02:16:15,620 --> 02:16:22,429
So this is the the numbers here are the proportion of people who agree that that this should be allowed to do so.

1112
02:16:22,430 --> 02:16:31,069
What that means is two thirds of Americans agree that people who have that have some sort of mental illness,

1113
02:16:31,070 --> 02:16:34,549
that we should be able to revoke their driver's license. Right. This is the only information they're given.

1114
02:16:34,550 --> 02:16:37,790
This is not like after a crash or something like this is just like that should be allowed.

1115
02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:42,469
Psychiatrists and psychologists, thankfully, are less likely to endorse that.

1116
02:16:42,470 --> 02:16:45,770
Right. But the general public is like, yes, that seems like a good thing we should be able to do.

1117
02:16:47,090 --> 02:16:51,770
20% of Americans think we should be able to withdraw the right for someone to vote if they have a mental illness.

1118
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:55,420
Again, this is the general public. These professionals are much lower.

1119
02:16:56,090 --> 02:16:59,840
I'll. This is this is abortion.

1120
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:03,860
This is have encourage the woman to have an abortion.

1121
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:08,990
So the woman if the woman has a mental illness. So a 30% of Americans think that's a good idea.

1122
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:13,700
And again, lower percentages are not as low as the was to vote here.

1123
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:17,299
And then this is the thing that's sort of interesting to think about the flip.

1124
02:17:17,300 --> 02:17:20,360
So this is compulsory admissions that should be admitted without your consent.

1125
02:17:20,750 --> 02:17:26,340
So specialists, everyone thinks this is should happen and the general public only two thirds of this thing.

1126
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:28,640
Now why is that? Why the why is that.

1127
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:40,520
Yeah, I'm just thinking on like one of those things like yeah, generally people don't like to be told what to do.

1128
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:43,850
Sure. And a lot of the times they don't see that.

1129
02:17:44,390 --> 02:17:46,010
They don't see how it could be beneficial.

1130
02:17:47,660 --> 02:17:54,200
And a lot of the time, these professionals are probably seeing a lot of people who are put in against their will.

1131
02:17:54,200 --> 02:18:00,200
Yes. And I probably seen some sort of results or treatment that's going on that is probably positive for them.

1132
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:07,070
But I think in general, any or most people would be really opposed to be put somewhere institutionalized without their consent.

1133
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:14,239
Right, where a lot of these professionals are seeing the benefits of doing that or they're seeing that the risks if you don't.

1134
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:15,979
Right. So somebody is a threat to themself.

1135
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:21,559
If you can't demonstrate they're an imminent threat to themselves or others, you cannot admit that if somebody dies from suicide.

1136
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:26,540
Now, you know, this person could have been saved potentially, or at least there could have been there was an opportunity for intervention.

1137
02:18:26,570 --> 02:18:32,690
Right. So they're right. So they have very different perspectives on the purpose and the function of this.

1138
02:18:32,690 --> 02:18:32,950
Right.

1139
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:40,850
So I but is it this fear of a compulsory admission is a major reason why people don't seek care because they are afraid this is going to happen,

1140
02:18:40,850 --> 02:18:46,100
even though this is almost impossible to happen on again unless you're an imminent threat to yourself or others.

1141
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:50,600
So but again, I show this again to illustrate the idea.

1142
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:58,339
I wish Mackenzie and I were just talking about her project ideas yesterday or maybe just I don't know what day this but you know,

1143
02:18:58,340 --> 02:19:06,620
the I think the idea of you know so should should you know so the NRAI is very supportive

1144
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:10,579
of having like a list of people who have some sort of mental health condition.

1145
02:19:10,580 --> 02:19:14,510
And those people should not be allowed to have access to firearms. Right? Like that's their answer, you know, to like.

1146
02:19:14,780 --> 02:19:20,290
Right. So but if you were to I bet if you threw this up here, I think people would be pretty supportive of that potentially, like I don't know.

1147
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:27,680
Right. So I think that that there are like real policy implications is what I'm trying to say around with with these sorts of things.

1148
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:38,419
So the last thing I want to end with before you all spend some time talking with each other about your about your projects is to sort of, you know,

1149
02:19:38,420 --> 02:19:43,100
not that it's ever going to be over, but, you know, just sort of talking about how,

1150
02:19:43,130 --> 02:19:47,330
again, the functions of stigma keep people down, keep people and keep people away.

1151
02:19:48,530 --> 02:19:52,040
So these are two papers that this is this is an interesting one.

1152
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:56,410
The idea that social distancing is a public good, right?

1153
02:19:56,450 --> 02:20:02,239
So this is this is this is signaling a lot of very kind of fundamental public health law information.

1154
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:11,510
And you can our public health law theory and they talk about I'm sorry, there's a language here that I wanted to use.

1155
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:17,900
Yeah. Social distancing is a public good for which the free rider problem is particularly severe.

1156
02:20:18,020 --> 02:20:21,020
Altruism and social norms are crucial factors in overcoming this problem.

1157
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:24,709
So again, this is the idea that, like, we need to keep people in. Right.

1158
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:27,920
So the free rider or somebody who's not going to wear a mask are not going to get vaccinated.

1159
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:34,310
Right. That's the argument that they're making. And so that is a use of stigma to keep people in in terms of the mitigation procedures.

1160
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:39,170
And then you have here in terms of social distancing and stigma.

1161
02:20:39,170 --> 02:20:50,780
And what they found here is that the more the the more stigma you felt, the more dangerousness you felt COVID was,

1162
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:58,700
the more distance you wanted from other people and the more judgmental you were of somebody if they got sick.

1163
02:20:59,810 --> 02:21:04,520
So so my again, just let's just pair and share for just a couple of minutes.

1164
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:06,620
So just those are a couple of examples.

1165
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:14,540
But if, if just reflect on like the idea that like stigma, I think to me it's fascinating that we had this brand new disease.

1166
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:18,290
I mean, here's a we don't even have this work. Two and a half years ago, right? It did not exist.

1167
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:24,210
We get this thing. It ostensibly has very little to do.

1168
02:21:24,230 --> 02:21:33,799
I mean, obviously, it's infectious disease, but it has ostensibly very little to do with stigmatized kind of behaviors or

1169
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:36,410
features or things like that in the way that we think about with this class.

1170
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:40,850
And yet there may be some ways in which what we've just talked about is relevant here.

1171
02:21:40,850 --> 02:21:45,020
So let's just so either which ways that show up or maybe which way is to do not show up.

1172
02:21:45,020 --> 02:22:05,200
And then we'll so pair with a talk with a buddy for a couple minutes and then we'll share up and show them is definitely a part,

1173
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:10,510
but not when I see you.

1174
02:22:11,250 --> 02:22:19,020
This kind of thing. What were looking at exactly.

1175
02:22:20,140 --> 02:23:02,200
Yes. It's important to separate the people that I was asked to do what it is that I was I didn't have any idea who I knew about what was going on.

1176
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:25,429
And I was like, oh, I just do this.

1177
02:23:25,430 --> 02:23:42,990
And I was like, yes, I love I don't know what I'm telling right now.

1178
02:23:48,790 --> 02:24:20,120
It's it's almost like I'm like, oh, this is not all right.

1179
02:24:26,150 --> 02:24:39,200
This is like what anybody like to share what you talked about it and they bring it back in.

1180
02:24:40,250 --> 02:24:43,490
All right. What do you mean? What do you mean? Like to share what you talked about?

1181
02:24:43,550 --> 02:24:50,810
It sounds like it sounds like in some ways rang true in the examples to share.

1182
02:24:52,250 --> 02:25:02,000
Yeah. But again, I don't know. I mean, like, I consider it ultimately like hate crimes against Asian Americans.

1183
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:08,230
We're like at an all time high. It kind of just because like the virus originated there because I mean,

1184
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:13,450
they were like more at risk than a lot of people started doing a lot of groupthink.

1185
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:18,260
People like that is that is where it originated.

1186
02:25:18,350 --> 02:25:24,170
Right. Right. Yeah. That's a good example of how other features kind of.

1187
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:26,909
Our overlapping with this with this sort of thing.

1188
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:35,450
And like they, you know, you see those same types of rhetoric around whether it's around like immigration or other types of things, right?

1189
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:40,470
So I think that's a really good example. Like different types of things get tied together.

1190
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:48,179
Yeah. And what I think they're trying to, you know, like how, I mean like Trump like content and check virus and stuff like that.

1191
02:25:48,180 --> 02:25:51,959
It's like you're like really trying to know, you know, not using that, like.

1192
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:55,290
Yeah, like, you know, talk about. Yeah.

1193
02:25:55,650 --> 02:25:59,280
Yeah. Good. Other examples you talked about.

1194
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:09,760
Yep. Oh. So I was saying I used to work at a medical clinic during COVID.

1195
02:26:09,910 --> 02:26:13,330
Hmm. So, um, and I worked in Scottsdale, Arizona.

1196
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:16,060
Like, they're very intimate with the people there.

1197
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:26,200
So when, like, we'd see patients come in without masks that, like, all right, so probably cancer then they probably think it was a hoax.

1198
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:29,230
Mhm. So we kind of have like those kind of like stigmas. Yeah.

1199
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:36,489
Yeah. For sure. I was just going about talking about where it's like it became if you wear the mask or if you did not wear the mask.

1200
02:26:36,490 --> 02:26:45,520
That said so much about whether you voted for activities or you got involved with diabetes, it's like, Oh, yeah.

1201
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:49,270
And then if you were protected, you didn't have people.

1202
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:54,900
I felt like this was a stigma that if you were being reckless and you didn't have people in your life that would compromise.

1203
02:26:55,360 --> 02:27:00,860
Like, maybe that's like layers to the stigma. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and there's this element of that.

1204
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:05,739
So it's really there's a, there's a moral. Like, there were there were right behaviors.

1205
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:11,110
There were good behaviors. Right. So it wasn't these. So and I, I in the sense.

1206
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:15,040
I don't mean actually. Right, actually good. But I mean, like in the sense that that's how they were understood.

1207
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:21,670
And I feel like there was in part that that failure to like fundamentally understand

1208
02:27:21,790 --> 02:27:26,140
how stigma was going to relate to these kind of visible things is like what,

1209
02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:30,010
where public health fell on its face. It's like kind of like you can't even understand.

1210
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:40,450
Like if the goal is save lives, then we need to understand how these types of things are going to get digested, you know, in terms of a broader.

1211
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:54,490
Yeah. So there's that signaling. And then what about if someone let's see, what was another, um, those are other, other things you all talked about.

1212
02:27:55,010 --> 02:28:18,780
What other examples? There is also like a stigma, but like there was like this like crazy worshiping of, like, frontline workers that I feel like.

1213
02:28:19,470 --> 02:28:20,520
Like some. I don't know.

1214
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:32,520
It just started to feel over the top and like, uh, like I was working in the ICU for months during COVID, and I just, I mean, yeah, I mean,

1215
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:41,370
people were at risk, but I think that like, it was almost, it just became like, fanatical and like, I think, like, maybe not totally justified.

1216
02:28:41,430 --> 02:28:44,639
Yeah, well, I think there's lots of different types of frontline workers.

1217
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:49,950
Right. And so some of these may have been more sort of value added versus not.

1218
02:28:49,950 --> 02:28:58,230
Right. Um, how did as COVID spread and like what, 90% of everybody's got it now, right?

1219
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:05,910
So as familiarity spread. Do you see how that potentially how does that overlay with this that diagram?

1220
02:29:08,940 --> 02:29:12,450
So yes, yes, we have vaccine. So it is literally less dangerous now.

1221
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:17,520
But imagine we didn't have vaccines, but just still imagine that many people that you knew had it.

1222
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:23,549
Right. So as people you knew, we got it. How did that affect your perceptions of dangerousness?

1223
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:26,580
So if that person got very sick, this might have been very much increased.

1224
02:29:26,730 --> 02:29:34,140
Right. So then you would have had more fear and potentially desire, more social stigma or more social distance.

1225
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:35,639
Right.

1226
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:43,650
So you can see how in this case, where you have this actual danger that this this overlays, but also how something like familiarity just sort of.

1227
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:51,450
Well, this is I can't beat my panic. Can't be at 11 forever, you know, like that's not how like I can't live that way.

1228
02:29:51,870 --> 02:29:56,519
And things that bring it down are like, Oh, I went to the grocery store and I was okay, right?

1229
02:29:56,520 --> 02:30:03,270
Or I went out without, you know, I, I, I, whatever, like I, there was an outbreak at my son's school and it was okay, right?

1230
02:30:03,270 --> 02:30:11,280
So these things happen and then you that gives you that this is a constantly updating function, right to think about.

1231
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:19,140
Okay, good. So, so the last thing I'll say and then we're going to then we're at 5:00.

1232
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:23,290
So I, we go to 530, but I'm on a WhatsApp.

1233
02:30:23,310 --> 02:30:25,950
But whatever. Let me finish. Okay. So let me start again.

1234
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:35,009
It is the way that part of the reason, even though things like drug use and depression, etc., are also undesirable,

1235
02:30:35,010 --> 02:30:42,240
quote unquote things to be telling someone about, it is really difficult to ask someone about something like stigma, discrimination, attitudes.

1236
02:30:42,570 --> 02:30:48,300
And this is both because people won't tell you the truth, but they may also not even be consciously aware of it.

1237
02:30:48,510 --> 02:30:54,330
You know, like if you sort of you spend some time here thinking about covert attitudes, you know, for a minute, but like, if,

1238
02:30:54,870 --> 02:31:00,360
if I had just asked you, like, what did you that do you think you ever stigmatized against somebody who might have had COVID?

1239
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:00,930
Right?

1240
02:31:00,990 --> 02:31:07,889
Well, you probably would've said no, you know, and and you know, but you know, did you ever like look at some you know, if I if I could ask you,

1241
02:31:07,890 --> 02:31:12,900
if I read if we wrote the vignette of Jim Johnson, who is does not wear a mask,

1242
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:18,689
there is a global pandemic happening, you know, and, you know, he washes his hands.

1243
02:31:18,690 --> 02:31:24,149
But, you know, like you could you could imagine writing that same vignette and then asking how much distance you want from Jim in that scenario.

1244
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:31,320
Okay. So that is you remember indirectly we didn't have time to talk about it, but I want to emphasize that there's also implicit association test.

1245
02:31:31,650 --> 02:31:37,170
There is not one for depression or for a mental illness currently, but they have one for lots of different things,

1246
02:31:37,170 --> 02:31:45,600
including age, gender, gender identity and disability status, etc.

1247
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:49,229
So I think it a weight is another one. So there's and again, these, these are tests.

1248
02:31:49,230 --> 02:31:53,700
If you haven't ever taken one of these, you know, feel free to do it in the future.

1249
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:58,649
But like it's literally like kind of testing reaction time with the idea that like there's some sort of like you can't

1250
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:06,780
consciously control your reaction time and and the you are reacting faster to things that you associate together.

1251
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:15,479
So you would associate, for example, an implicit association test of race would if somebody had a high implicit bias towards white people,

1252
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:19,740
they would have a faster reaction time pairing a picture of a white person with the positive

1253
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:24,690
word than they would of pairing a picture of an African-American person with a positive word.

1254
02:32:24,810 --> 02:32:36,390
Right. So that's the way that these tests work. Um, okay, so I will stop here for questions about anything we talked about today.

1255
02:32:37,410 --> 02:32:41,250
I hope it's a long day. Very interactive with questions.

1256
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:50,750
Okay. Well, I'm going to be here. So here's what I want.

1257
02:32:50,810 --> 02:32:54,260
So you have all turned in your class project topic ideas.

1258
02:32:54,260 --> 02:33:01,430
And what I would love for you to do before you head out is with at least one person and a talk about your I mean,

1259
02:33:01,430 --> 02:33:06,620
ideally you could kind of do this in a group of two or three, but the idea of looking at your topics,

1260
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:11,360
you know, be respectful but honest in your feedback, like what? What topic seems most interesting?

1261
02:33:11,360 --> 02:33:17,420
What seems most challenging? Do you maybe happen to know anything about this topic that you can give that person information about?

1262
02:33:18,530 --> 02:33:24,349
The I will be giving you feedback on all of your topics, not just not not like do topic one,

1263
02:33:24,350 --> 02:33:29,020
but rather like this is what I see is the terms of topic want. This is what I see is the stress of topic two, etc.

1264
02:33:29,030 --> 02:33:36,769
Good luck to you. So. So you're going to get feedback from me, but I think it's nice to just kind of I haven't I actually haven't taken a look yet,

1265
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:42,799
so I'll, I'll do so as well while we're sitting here. But if especially if there's somebody who now that you've seen everybody's topics,

1266
02:33:42,800 --> 02:33:45,590
looks like they're interested in some of the same stuff that you're interested in,

1267
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:55,370
like get together with them and just kind of talk a little bit about it. Okay. So and but also if you're done, you can go out so you feel free.

1268
02:33:55,370 --> 02:33:58,489
You know what I mean? I know this is a long day, so don't I will take note.

1269
02:33:58,490 --> 02:34:01,670
Not that there's nothing you need to turn in from this or anything like that, so.

1270
02:34:02,210 --> 02:34:06,410
Okay, so I'm going to I won't be here hanging out again if you're done.

1271
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:11,300
Go ahead. But otherwise, please just take a time to take a few time to talk folks about their their projects.

1272
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:20,780
All right. Thanks, everybody. Yeah, I remember.

1273
02:34:23,700 --> 02:34:25,310
I did. I record myself.
