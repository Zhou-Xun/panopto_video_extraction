1
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,760
hey everyone. so today we're gonna

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,860
talk about Jesus in Birmingham. I guess in general. and

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,720
and hopefully we'll get finished with all that. we start on radiation radon.

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,700
and on Thursday. there's a short

5
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,020
chat with you about looking at an article from the New_Yorker

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,480
about windows of men's that had working

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,880
eight nine. actually maybe you maybe you should

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,409
go to and then you some questions. this is look at.

9
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:10,929
call me back and then ask you those questions and instructions.

10
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:16,149
you should look at a journal article that has more specific

11
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:22,489
information about issues cancer. I love you many reminders in the United_States.

12
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:28,369
and then the last question. we'll talk about that on Thursday.

13
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:35,049
alright. so additional answer. I

14
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,609
started quite a_while. bye. bye. alright.

15
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:45,749
so we're a definition answer. this is genetic

16
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:51,389
disease. this is due at some point with DNA patience.

17
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:57,269
the agent is busy today and Macy to my cell.

18
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:02,365
has these changes. this is usual control local

19
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:07,385
cellular. bye. or and it's acting up more than a hundred

20
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:14,585
different diseases. bye. they all had this problem.

21
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:20,305
so you got the cells are normal growth on Central. what we mean by

22
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:25,385
normal. the real regulation cell Road. so you don't

23
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:30,685
have_to not answer your questions about what the definition of higher closures

24
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:37,385
but. this is for John Hall. for you to understand what's going on. so

25
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:42,385
you save some tissues hyper plastic hyper place

26
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:47,685
this morning. usual number. no emergency. that

27
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:53,005
side of the individual. so increase with ration. it that

28
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:58,285
they're growing in a faster rate than normal. so this is Bob Marcel

29
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:03,589
did a bigger road faster than normal Ann this is Ron or

30
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:08,609
and this is different levels and disorders up there man. I just need that

31
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:14,429
one time down there. you have a normal time another silver place anywhere. normally

32
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:19,709
places that you have sales or marketing that you're now selling furniture.

33
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,749
I have more ability there more. they can change. so

34
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:30,029
I really something like this sort throat and

35
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:35,149
facial. we're basically lost.

36
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:40,869
something for registration doesn't look like the tissue that came from any more.

37
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:46,149
and then I'll file lot house.

38
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:51,169
so there program. so

39
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:58,689
many circumstances. which

40
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:04,045
is my cell. it's going to die you have lost of that.

41
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:10,105
just continued to sort. so time with this process. so here it is.

42
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:15,305
hey sure very well here. this is crazy. answer and

43
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:20,405
his diagram is showing you you need let us know. you.

44
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:26,285
bye. answer. wherever is coming out. skating.

45
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:31,785
make it a birthday shipment. the you can travel from one part of the body

46
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:36,785
shop on another part. so. so

47
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:41,785
yeah. Angela John this is me. have a blessed day. first for the sell

48
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:46,905
to grow. they're they're doing wrong road signal not doing what they

49
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:51,925
usually supposed to do. Annie birthday. no they don't respond

50
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:57,825
to it on silent. they can just keep

51
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:03,751
leaving Tuesday and then eventually location vision usually

52
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:09,231
Pedro. you have a taxi travels. goodbye.

53
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:14,511
alright. so that what we need bye. answer whatever. make your property

54
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:20,611
in terms of cancer. even all answers are hard to know.

55
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:26,311
alright. this is Vicky. to receive legal

56
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:31,531
tissues. so that like tissues in the breast tissue is in the skin

57
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:37,551
tissues line respiratory care. so

58
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:43,111
sorry to call us. our drive from a different type of tissue mother cereal from today.

59
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:48,991
so someone has a primary bone cancer. bye baby. like you

60
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:55,031
me. answer the phone. answer the phone. Thomas.

61
00:05:55,031 --> 00:06:00,331
I'm from the living faxes. leukemia cancer and

62
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:05,673
bone marrow. so thing yes this is Chris's

63
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:10,713
red. so tomorrow. so and I much.

64
00:06:10,713 --> 00:06:16,253
is related to the leukemia and the phone. answer the cell phone now.

65
00:06:16,253 --> 00:06:21,813
alright. alright. bye. answer probably. what's

66
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:28,073
important here. part of Genesis is important.

67
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:33,193
if you understand the series that allows you to. wanna see

68
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:38,493
if you can sick on vacation. he's the agent department that specializes

69
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:44,213
it's to come up with the appropriate intervention. so hopefully prevent someone from every

70
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:49,313
there or text treatment. if you or someone in cancer. so it's important. the

71
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:54,393
series or more than just packages. so hi Janice this

72
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:59,633
is the same as uncle John this is a tumor in general. you know that much.

73
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:05,573
and need a_lot_of different model. there's in complete agreement about which model.

74
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:10,753
where probably on the model. one Bob has the file all the cancer

75
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:16,213
but there's a_lot_of concepts to be aware of. so why this is idea

76
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:22,493
that you have process where you have this agent

77
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:27,993
followed by promotion. so usually this agent is going to involve some

78
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:33,953
operations Dean eight patient and then the promotion.

79
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:39,436
do it might be just an agent or call just hoping

80
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:44,436
to see you today isn't sufficient to cover. answer about. so something else at the

81
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:49,736
house. so try turning over and and

82
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:55,196
I hear from a vacation probably. again this is Bob here.

83
00:07:55,196 --> 00:08:00,276
this is nice and tidy and probably five to seven situations but it's

84
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:05,416
often hard to demonstrate clearly what's it

85
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:13,556
initiated versus what's up this is a test. promoting cancer.

86
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:18,736
so this is the diagram to give you something with going on here you start with the normal

87
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:24,056
cell. had some DNA damage that would be initiation

88
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:29,196
the repair of the water mechanism for DNA that we have. so we can prepare to go

89
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:34,316
back to normal you're okay but if it doesn't you got an issue so

90
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:39,542
another question. they'll start live right out_of control. so wanted

91
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:45,342
think turning off and turning off schedule. so.

92
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:50,542
so when you end up with the region premium path needs is not out in no

93
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:56,122
cancer yet. and then you have a promotion which might be reversible

94
00:08:56,122 --> 00:09:01,422
and now you got a_lot_of changes around that time.

95
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:06,762
so if you have and then you have more medication further in regards

96
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:13,862
to your number well and you have a true Cancer true new tumor

97
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:19,082
office. so this is Ashley. this is the same

98
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:25,142
sort idea need more detail. the only thing is interesting here. I'm

99
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:30,442
talking about. inquired environmental being a damage of

100
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:36,616
course we're interested in this. just court in chemical radiation viruses

101
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:41,936
and the other thing is they pointed out that many people like

102
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:47,516
a damn this is DNA exposure. but some people have a certain genetic makeup.

103
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:53,556
Harrison the patients might be Mark if we increase risk for developing cancer. that exposure

104
00:09:53,556 --> 00:09:58,756
because they don't have. for example normal DNA repair.

105
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:04,596
as an example that. okay. so you get some station.

106
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:09,696
the question is are you gonna

107
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:14,796
activation still for growth. operations and team regulations for last

108
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:20,016
night. this is Pastor James we'll talk about more the moment.

109
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:25,516
they get they get in activated. we put that all together.

110
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:30,636
eventually you get down to the national Cancer this

111
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:35,976
is. this is not a diagram is giving you example of a different

112
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:41,836
card capability. Lisa cancer. and I national man.

113
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:46,836
you know sometimes it's very specific. you know

114
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:52,016
single. well palm workers the go

115
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:57,816
to exchange in a single room. they change the product. either becomes activated.

116
00:10:57,816 --> 00:11:03,296
either should only reason this time down here. Mike this is Jessie.

117
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:08,816
this process is and all the same order. we can take different orders but still

118
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:14,156
answer. alright. so

119
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:19,976
when you think about jeans and they're all

120
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:25,176
we busy talk about tumors and prospects. so usually

121
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:30,240
this arrangement. boat before you get answer and

122
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,000
so James bring home. something that hot

123
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,760
grub control signal. anyway so this is Angie with prodigy this month.

124
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,080
but if they're not active. they should be. you don't have it in addition

125
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:56,260
the combination of the two time changes and change the responsible.

126
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,320
so this is just give you an example. what election

127
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,460
available for Molly Johnson. this is Collins Court.

128
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,060
contact cancer US population. part of the world.

129
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,240
and it just you know again you don't need to know all the plan out

130
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,980
that you can go to Ronnie this is stages before you finally arrived. carcinoma

131
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,980
is gonna invade the local tissue. potentially pass inside. you may need all

132
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,372
the things that have so these are very specific changes.

133
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:38,932
lots of DNA collection will come back to that. you

134
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:44,112
need to change the date. so but usually when you

135
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:49,112
have a second delay. usually the best way to remove the solution that

136
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:54,212
usually allows us to the actually that are approaching that

137
00:12:54,212 --> 00:13:00,212
goes with activating in the area possible. we'll talk about.

138
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:05,472
rest in the moment. we'll talk about the fifty three in a moment.

139
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:10,992
my staff rather the family

140
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:17,148
Jean. this is one. I need to do this project that

141
00:13:17,148 --> 00:13:22,288
hey don't

142
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:28,628
ever answer this many many chances very recently. Adam Alice is resting.

143
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:34,028
okay. I have problem manager

144
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:39,148
and cancer deactivation.

145
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:45,468
the tumor is Jean. two fifty three. and so

146
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:50,948
normally fine. salad and this is a difference in the Express processing

147
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:56,008
this product. so happened to the next phase is the basis division with

148
00:13:56,008 --> 00:14:02,068
for reservation that traded with cancer

149
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:07,168
and. so when you have you can be fifty three. changed you can

150
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:12,428
no longer bond. so this policy doesn't get me top signal. it was supposed to happen

151
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:18,707
it doesn't happen. the program

152
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:23,947
this is for you guys. bye. bye. just

153
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:29,627
checking in on that as well. and so you got more television

154
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:35,367
left out. you can two fifty three. it is most recently Jean

155
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:40,567
a. bye. and it's also this associate with specific exposures.

156
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:47,067
for example patient. alright. so

157
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:52,187
I'm gonna line diagram that showing mechanism. probably not but

158
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:57,827
it's not. this is basically normal. no damage.

159
00:14:57,827 --> 00:15:02,887
DNA and that and he said he might be activated. it doesn't think it's

160
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:08,967
supposed to do the rest television. it also make.

161
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:14,107
can have a successful parent night. so there's a initial basically like

162
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:19,943
bottom. it was supposed to say something wrong. so bye

163
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:25,023
bye. on the other side. if you had any

164
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:31,003
jeans that are activated. they because you have pre- existing station.

165
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:36,183
then you don't get arrested. do you need a repair. actually

166
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:42,883
two. okay. so

167
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:48,043
what are the person is Regina Thompson. please write down

168
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:53,183
to CNA. many of them are but some the genetic. so they might

169
00:15:53,183 --> 00:15:58,363
actually have a second. are they or proteins or they might

170
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:03,923
need it by the way. e-mail to you today which message on

171
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:12,863
parts of the DNA team. maybe not yeah. alright.

172
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:18,613
everyone is Amanda Ross is direct and be able to reproduce this free style. bye. thanks

173
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:23,793
hey this is Jess. this. this is probably

174
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:28,853
one or two percent of all the kind research is done at this point. but just gimme a

175
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:33,973
holler. bye. see you soon. please give me when you get ready. exactly what you need

176
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:39,413
to do. see how this all

177
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:47,073
together. anyway. alright. so call me back here in the car

178
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:52,493
and so concerning a patient. the main focus

179
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:58,073
is on chemical environmental exposures things like that. polly.

180
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:04,893
I can see or radiation or.

181
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:10,193
it's only tomorrow and so I don't know where you

182
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:15,313
at. this is Jean. this is James the packaging. that would be like rather

183
00:17:15,313 --> 00:17:20,551
than the first available. you maybe

184
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:26,931
need immunizations apology. actually ready for

185
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:32,691
tomorrow. they told I told you in relation of all patient

186
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:38,711
changes. eventually cancer spot properties.

187
00:17:38,711 --> 00:17:43,971
this is a test to sign thing.

188
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:49,191
just for your information zero. really need to that. we know some

189
00:17:49,191 --> 00:17:54,271
answers or mom or just like that. actually you can try you back.

190
00:17:54,271 --> 00:18:00,271
they don't sell anything. I have actually the

191
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:05,271
cell and maybe some Verizon meeting changed. so

192
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:10,431
not all the prices the same type cell. bye. everything correctly. so

193
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:15,611
you know with tumor you can also find cases

194
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:20,891
work. there's actually translation advance in several cell. but end up getting sick.

195
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:25,991
usually the same tissue. they're just getting together. yeah their forms et_cetera

196
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:35,771
to see you tomorrow probably five different time. so

197
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:40,871
Macias is really several people there. maybe

198
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:48,631
five to ten Broadway. perfectly normal. so the latest to shoot

199
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:53,911
me text side and then any questions

200
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:59,151
about our services. okay. it's a multi step process. exactly how

201
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:05,591
to think about that. we wanna identify the confidence factor. like you know we're

202
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:11,031
just searching for. bye. so happy

203
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:16,117
to talk to Cindy. bye hello.

204
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:21,477
team anyway you must way that you all know already. is Danielle

205
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:27,997
Jamie. he's actually talking beans. we are looking.

206
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:36,977
well it maybe more Thomas and that sort of blow that directly with me.

207
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:42,497
okay. see you later. if you usually done Rome

208
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:47,597
there longer term there. but I don't know if I actually really use the word

209
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:53,095
excellence that correlation. the. that's why we do. that's why you

210
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:59,015
Rosen Walter. hopefully not late. what does cause cancer

211
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:04,235
brown mouse or rat. just like. there's

212
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:09,435
also a short term the start emergency. they use the screen

213
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:15,275
agent for example the bye just through

214
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:21,015
which is. you said you have something chemical. you do

215
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:26,275
you change the DNA. no bacteria work

216
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:31,495
and then I hear people call each

217
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:36,575
other. I been doing. we're talking about

218
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:42,395
meeting today and in the computer. you know just

219
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:47,875
that you they're basically doing shit right. and so

220
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:52,995
we had agreed to do an experiment. what we did is we looked at the structure activity.

221
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:58,599
call we have called. we have a structure. we need

222
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:06,499
this part. this allows us to be the agent. can

223
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:13,039
you call. and this phone looks very similar to it. this is it all

224
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,099
done by computer right without even actually doing

225
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:23,419
an experiment. alright. international

226
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:28,479
agency for research on cancer. Leon Francis

227
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:33,599
the reason actually like the last word on what what percentage. this

228
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:39,659
is what it is. and they have actually talk about ten

229
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:45,319
about chemicals that are in Palmer.

230
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:50,539
this is about. what is what it is is Alyssa with reasonable

231
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:55,545
thing to think about. if you don't have a resource hey you want to

232
00:21:55,545 --> 00:22:01,045
figure out which agents might answer might not which agents. if you go out first. so

233
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:06,065
you be interested. if you be

234
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:11,085
interested. you can review the literature. bye. this is

235
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:16,225
what is any decent exposure data anywhere. that will allow you to actually

236
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:21,225
estimate what's going on. let's just assume it's supposed to

237
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:26,745
be part of gender. if there's any evidence sorry.

238
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:31,745
I was talking about how important it is in terms of how people might be affected.

239
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:37,305
the same answer. hey just me. call me. Ashley

240
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:42,445
exposure. do you have enough time to go.

241
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:47,885
sorry. you know next

242
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:53,045
year and usual thing to think of my control package today.

243
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:59,124
think about that anyway I had had a ride today

244
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:04,924
position. this is Bert. possible cancer.

245
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:12,264
they sufficient evidence meeting that we that was

246
00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:19,304
you know non- hollow reason for the association

247
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:24,424
association. we can be sure that they're for real Colorado is

248
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:29,744
there. there's not

249
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:35,044
enough information in the literature to really say anything and then

250
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:40,724
once in a great while eleven. just the last part of this

251
00:23:40,724 --> 00:23:46,944
week. thank you. see happened because it's always very hard to prove the

252
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:52,434
last. that requires a very high level I

253
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:57,754
saw that you missed our call. terribly sorry. and so they

254
00:23:57,754 --> 00:24:04,074
actually talk about eleven o'clock here.

255
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:09,354
so you know that there's a patient every single

256
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:14,495
animal. bye. one of my patients

257
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:20,014
I want you to see David John on Tuesday or

258
00:24:20,014 --> 00:24:27,314
Sunday maybe. to repeat the same thing. actually have Friday.

259
00:24:27,314 --> 00:24:32,374
they don't have that. so the suggestion is the day that we don't have an update

260
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:39,194
and tell you again. bye. this is Diane from attention.

261
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:44,234
here's why. what are you doing. shuman. and

262
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:50,082
you have like people you gonna read about like you mini reminder

263
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:55,342
the exposure time and I the radiation. but you have be ready at nine. they have a very

264
00:24:55,342 --> 00:25:01,042
height of your time to answer this question. what about

265
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:06,602
the general population. I follow up in this room. if this is reasonable to

266
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:11,722
do a CT scan on someone. given how much radiation is

267
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:18,082
being given to the person. and you probably because we don't

268
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:23,302
usually get huge amount of iodine radiation exposure from repeat a CT

269
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:28,462
over time. we're probably not gonna die. we have

270
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:33,542
not exposed that I have radiation solution from just

271
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:38,702
that study about whether or not. there's low cost.

272
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:43,702
chances are how many. same thing with animals. you know that

273
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:49,323
we did process down model because you don't have more animals and you need to become very expensive

274
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:54,842
you guys. have you down for a couple of years. the person that did yesterday it's

275
00:25:54,842 --> 00:26:03,642
Marlon. what you figure out what. hello. hi.

276
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:08,662
question cancer in history. that one level usually about half a dozen

277
00:26:08,662 --> 00:26:14,182
level. you may have a little blow that. so you're actually getting much higher

278
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:19,742
per kilogram but anyway Rosie here spare message or whatever. did you expect

279
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:24,817
me any every you do that. that way you

280
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:29,896
could do the study with maybe a couple hundred total road. all my

281
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:35,088
flowers out but I have power only only if it is the Carson agent that he

282
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:40,408
might have cancer chance to show. we're gonna need to do. five thousand

283
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:46,108
nine. which is very very. so people don't do that. so

284
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:52,948
it's on here. you see we have an observation. I hae really high

285
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:58,508
and relatively high. we're violation and we wanna extract late.

286
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:04,328
maybe just get a much lower exposures whatever the right.

287
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:09,628
so you have David here and your issues and what's going on down here

288
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:14,828
and he don't have that date. so if you any questions. if you can't figure. he actually

289
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:20,328
usually is. okay. what what type of mathematical

290
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:25,548
model response is reasonable in this situation. should

291
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:31,661
be here. first of all not at all assume

292
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:37,621
yes go to zero four there's no back. so that why very well worse than the celebration.

293
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:42,701
we're talking about yesterday. so I don't even have have a threshold on. bye.

294
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:47,761
but don't know threshold linear day. okay. you really just go down.

295
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:52,821
you know if you spoke to one of us. right about

296
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:57,881
that exposure or could be really

297
00:27:57,881 --> 00:28:02,901
near the e-mail. actually there's a higher risk. just letting of exposure that a

298
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:08,681
year or what more is people may are you.

299
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:15,281
usually when use this as the fall but there's typically like reasonable.

300
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:20,961
sale. well I think I'm gonna actually be somewhere near in like when you're on drive. we're

301
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:26,261
actually the really doesn't go up that high

302
00:28:26,261 --> 00:28:31,921
and then here in one. this is a call. Harvey. this is the idea.

303
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:37,485
remind Douglas zero. this is the idea that State regarding

304
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:42,825
mediation three zero. is alone. need

305
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:47,825
this long before it's gonna cost cancer. maybe that's good for you. which is like

306
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:52,865
the last going below zero. okay. so we're

307
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:58,205
not gonna solve today but I just want you to be aware that this is a big issue with this.

308
00:28:58,205 --> 00:29:03,325
bye. bye. okay you got the data. but you almost all of this is what happens

309
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:08,805
is people. my floor exposure. then those unfortunate words in Wingate animal supers.

310
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:14,085
you gave it to. how we gonna determine that how we gonna.

311
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:20,365
so that you can get a big argument about with with the reasonable mile about the medical mall.

312
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:25,365
alright. alright. hey there's

313
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:31,909
a big things like messages information. so for example

314
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:37,089
you gave me these animals are pretty high goes something that you want if you got it. alright.

315
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:43,269
this is me Julie. is actually on the seventh. lot of information

316
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:49,449
before those days and

317
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:54,509
we'll talk about later. information can be reversed for cancer. if it turns

318
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:59,969
out the lord. no information at all.

319
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:08,209
bye. isn't there. so Steven's receiving a package down here.

320
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:13,809
another example of. there's about

321
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:19,129
few minutes. so you got

322
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:24,269
possibly still be not because I have_to

323
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,649
write an example. this is event.

324
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:35,443
you know that type of five oh two car.

325
00:30:35,443 --> 00:30:40,483
it's very active office. you probably need to DNA. so you know you

326
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:45,503
know. bye. bye. they

327
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:51,323
can go. alright. so this just shows you how I have done.

328
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:56,783
room one is his partner Johnny shuman. so usually you have_to be a strong evidence

329
00:30:56,783 --> 00:31:01,863
event. sometimes they have limited evidence in humans are very just

330
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:06,923
sort of on the car. but very strong evidence now. I'll put those two together today. we

331
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:12,203
think you call. we're save you two eight to be here probably

332
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:17,403
Martin jackpot with Martin Johnson. three. we find a_lot_of things we don't have enough information

333
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:22,823
to classify for Ruby probably. alright.

334
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:28,023
so here's another October two thousand fourteen. I are

335
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:33,685
officially review nine hundred and seventy one different agent.

336
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:38,725

339
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:57,065
hundred fourteen dollars seats that are Carson genic. you have not received nine. probably

a larger number two one eight three. you call.

341
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:07,185

sugar substitute every.

345

364
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,830
I Daniel it's Dad again. wait time. I have a couple decades later

365
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,910
than people. why. where one

366
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:29,570
hundred percent Japanese. so the whole point here is. now you change the environment.

367
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:36,790
if you have a chance to Jean. they have Japanese.

368
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,830
they just relocated to Hawaii. okay. and so you can look

369
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:47,030
it Hawaiian Japanese compared to what why. okay.

370
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:53,610
early time line because patients in the same time period time. alright. so

371
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:58,770
what happens there. Simon. you know nothing

372
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,970
all day. not much more recently. there's quite

373
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:10,130
dance so campus Donna. I'm

374
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,142
sorry but if you come down to Japanese.

375
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:20,382
why this is Daisy Bolden with eight hundred red long enough ago. basically you know

376
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:25,462
either they were born here earlier. their young children so they basically

377
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:31,182
they did a quiet environment environment. their whole life all of their whole life. okay.

378
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:36,282
and once in a matter that has stomach

379
00:35:36,282 --> 00:35:41,362
cancer. then people the same genetic composition are still

380
00:35:41,362 --> 00:35:46,482
in and it's matter of fact their stomach cancer

381
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:53,402
is similar to what it was for a consultation. why still higher than what it is for.

382
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:58,422
currently at the same time and location wise. where

383
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:04,182
you at prostate cancer he has a very low level prostate cancer.

384
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:09,364
you know thought that he either time. but you will get why in

385
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:15,504
Japanese. it was all there like almost all my life. why way higher rate.

386
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:21,364
not quite as talk. during the same time. so

387
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:26,584
essentially this guy say. we haven't determine

388
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:32,824
what happened and environmental

389
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:38,004
cancer different. hey. why because

390
00:36:38,004 --> 00:36:43,784
it's not much that. it's not you know the difference between the people in the house

391
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:49,244
people sure Japanese. love you. bye. everyone

392
00:36:49,244 --> 00:36:54,424

393
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:59,544
now. why do wanted say. people are too

394
00:36:59,544 --> 00:37:05,024

396
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:19,092

400
00:37:37,972 --> 00:37:47,072

yeah we'll talk about this e-mail with you today. so I

402

I shift the this is an infectious agent. you don't see

644
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:16,210
the world but it's a

645
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:21,351
big issue and you get contact information glad you

646
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:27,470
the exception increases for. again everyone knows

647
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:32,551
about it. alright and this is just.

648

bye. right information.

649
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:44,077
all stages to promote changes

650
01:02:44,077 --> 01:02:49,157
and I'm not trying to go through all that. this is my

651
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:58,217
information many different steps here to help. we noticed that cancer.

652
01:02:58,217 --> 01:03:03,357
it does all kind of thing. did you late. is an example

653
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:09,557
for most growth with this information which course I can't.

654
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:14,857
just like other sales. so I just

655
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:20,057
check on that. just remember chronic. I need information. many many

656
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:27,097
circumstances in the Oregon system. so see increases the cancer.

657
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:32,257
so anyway she had a great job

658
01:03:32,257 --> 01:03:38,001
this day.. answer

659
01:03:38,001 --> 01:03:43,841
you should understand. patient key.

660
01:03:43,841 --> 01:03:49,961
you should have brought aware of this many messages. bye.

661
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:56,321
John this is Rall. the

662
01:03:56,321 --> 01:04:03,601
hey agent. the fact that we don't know for many

663
01:04:03,601 --> 01:04:09,461
chart. patients under the commerce. haven't really been taking. just press

664
01:04:09,461 --> 01:04:14,941
the number

665
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:20,641
and appreciation of our special

666
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:25,781
exposure in coverage which is very

667
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:31,061
low percentage until you get into to lifestyle related. if you could consider that

668
01:04:31,061 --> 01:04:36,601
much time. so

669
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:41,634
we just went through. questions or how because I wanted to start on. I

670
01:04:41,634 --> 01:04:46,774
know the mediation. hopefully finish it. we do the exercise next

671
01:04:46,774 --> 01:04:54,074
week. thank you. bye.

672
01:04:54,074 --> 01:05:15,994
no question. okay.

673
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:24,234
so whatever twelve or thirteen minutes. radiation

674
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:29,394
radiation five days and she's better.

675
01:05:29,394 --> 01:05:34,654
I can either be part of over the collector.

676
01:05:34,654 --> 01:05:42,024
this is the last

677
01:05:42,024 --> 01:05:47,964
one. sorry. what we call. I had radiation you

678
01:05:47,964 --> 01:05:54,864
right away.

679
01:05:54,864 --> 01:06:00,104
never said.

680
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:06,244
I regarding radiation course we have the resources

681
01:06:06,244 --> 01:06:13,224
we need for the purposes.

682
01:06:13,224 --> 01:06:18,864
and this is easier. this is actually

683
01:06:18,864 --> 01:06:24,702
the bomb was dropped here in Shima. my chichi

684
01:06:24,702 --> 01:06:29,863
this is a photo bomb. job forty eight hours later on. talk to you before

685
01:06:29,863 --> 01:06:36,542
that just need this. see if

686
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:41,863
this is you. those are just little you know little

687
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:47,482
atomic bomb. alright. bye.

688
01:06:47,482 --> 01:06:53,282
this is a photograph. I think this is Terry Shima. you have already area this is the

689
01:06:53,282 --> 01:06:58,542
middle of the city Council. this is what.

690
01:06:58,542 --> 01:07:06,222
bye. love you

691
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:12,242
very much. bye. actually. alright.

692
01:07:12,242 --> 01:07:18,962
Lawrence Howard. Gary Stansel.

693
01:07:18,962 --> 01:07:24,236
recently well available exposure to radiation. because

694
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:29,656
yeah this is Tom about it. and we actually know

695
01:07:29,656 --> 01:07:35,236
a_lot about compared to most days. we really know

696
01:07:35,236 --> 01:07:45,156
what answer

697
01:07:45,156 --> 01:07:52,216
because because these people following over time. so if this is Dean here.

698
01:07:52,216 --> 01:07:58,115
the bomb. you got the exposure and to dad. I think this is my

699
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:03,135
first four months after exposure. we'll talk a little bit later.

700
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:08,956
I have_to start radiation changes from

701
01:08:08,956 --> 01:08:14,016
cancer and wellness you know this is that. so

702
01:08:14,016 --> 01:08:19,216
is I have a meeting with Kenya. actually

703
01:08:19,216 --> 01:08:24,255
Pete by about six years after the Obama's

704
01:08:24,255 --> 01:08:29,271
job and then drop off as you get out in thirty years. there's really not

705
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:34,492
no message. I got quite different

706
01:08:34,492 --> 01:08:39,692
policy number. by remaining on. this increases in fire is Brad

707
01:08:39,692 --> 01:08:44,712
Long calling. where is along the way. see you don't see anything. you

708
01:08:44,712 --> 01:08:50,072
getting close to ten years. you can fix it and it's when when you go out to

709
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:55,252
forty forty five years at

710
01:08:55,252 --> 01:09:00,372
UCP. this is

711
01:09:00,372 --> 01:09:07,972
a test call for radiation. just remember

712
01:09:07,972 --> 01:09:13,072
waiting to see Kenya. very different.

713
01:09:13,072 --> 01:09:18,872
okay. that's probably because she cancer.

714
01:09:18,872 --> 01:09:23,912
for me. it's probably normal. very rapid turn

715
01:09:23,912 --> 01:09:30,211
out. bye phone now. bye. hey.

716
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:35,792
most other locations. the main thing to do.

717
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:41,992
alright. so. hey. hi everyone I wasn't go through.

718
01:09:41,992 --> 01:09:48,332
so it's gonna probably

719
01:09:48,332 --> 01:09:53,352
charge no charge. and it's gonna have electronic charges for

720
01:09:53,352 --> 01:09:58,552
believe and Alan is a single

721
01:09:58,552 --> 01:10:06,292
type of Adam. the phone number the number from. so you because your number from

722
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:11,352
eight nine. you know that I could be possibly negative. not tonight. if this

723
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:16,592
is a private message the number of the and the structure

724
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:22,171
the letter which shows. so to determine the

725
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:27,868
property. so that's why it's

726
01:10:27,868 --> 01:10:33,328
important. and the number is one the number truck. very.

727
01:10:33,328 --> 01:10:38,488
so was reasonable. I'm just overwhelmed with Joy. hi

728
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:43,548
hygiene hygiene is one from time. well I time going around it. no

729
01:10:43,548 --> 01:10:52,868
new truck. Terry. I'm just really happy

730
01:10:52,868 --> 01:10:57,868
and Trudy will find a way. not really doesn't. okay

731
01:10:57,868 --> 01:11:04,488
can treat him. you have two new truck.

732
01:11:04,488 --> 01:11:10,768
okay. so that's an example. where the

733
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:15,948
Broadway neutron way all the same.

734
01:11:15,948 --> 01:11:21,308
and alright you know eighteen hundred something time

735
01:11:21,308 --> 01:11:27,227
electronics. basically you can have hydrogen gas.

736
01:11:27,227 --> 01:11:32,527
if you had gas with a number of all things pressure.

737
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:37,827
normal. if you have the same thing to Terry. wait

738
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:43,027
wait. bye. changes doesn't change

739
01:11:43,027 --> 01:11:48,047
the chemical properties for

740
01:11:48,047 --> 01:11:53,307
him. so when you get too many or too few.

741
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:59,067
neutron when it's unstable. probably I hate it.

742
01:11:59,067 --> 01:12:04,367
either particles or electronic or magnetic

743
01:12:04,367 --> 01:12:09,567
radiation and what type of energy

744
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:15,767
is on. this is Adam and particle

745
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:22,667
article article going to change.

746
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:28,322
James Cole. well this actually changes went out.

747
01:12:28,322 --> 01:12:33,342
alright. when you either

748
01:12:33,342 --> 01:12:40,642
article. so this is many. I'm not in radiation

749
01:12:40,642 --> 01:12:46,222
non- electronic control

750
01:12:46,222 --> 01:12:51,602
and go through your transformation. Regis is stable. number right this day.

751
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:56,602
so here's an example of the cafeteria. hey it all. also

752
01:12:56,602 --> 01:13:01,882
have the very poor example. and what this is insane. okay.

753
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:07,869
start with rain two thirty eight Simon this is Rob. and

754
01:13:07,869 --> 01:13:12,889
we need to Kay. it is missing out article. any changes to the store and

755
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:18,149
two thirty four five eight two thirty eight. just you know

756
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:23,509
five two thirty eight. this phone number.

757
01:13:23,509 --> 01:13:28,790
so this is two eight two three eight two three five

758
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:34,429
three zero at any time. press pound or not you're ready.

759
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:40,589
and not got a message.

760
01:13:40,589 --> 01:13:45,689
Anthony has home cascades. out uncle sometime.

761
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:51,310
just noticed remember when is out. you see this number. changes what

762
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:56,449
it is but the number. drop by for you do that every time. drop

763
01:13:56,449 --> 01:14:01,729
in for data. it doesn't change that number. but

764
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:06,814
it changes hey Hayden. we'll see you later.

767
01:14:18,594 --> 01:14:24,174
anyway love you. bye. okay.

768
01:14:24,174 --> 01:14:30,334
we'll come back later. alright. bye.

769
01:14:30,334 --> 01:14:35,375
just doing a conference previously and you should recharge in about hour. very

770
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:40,854
important because usually when you do that. so you have extreme weekend.

771
01:14:40,854 --> 01:14:47,334
do things like you take. so.

772
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:52,554
alright. so have_to pro time to neutron.

773
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:57,634
if you wanted to know how horrible this is Ashley

774
01:14:57,634 --> 01:15:04,535
normal. usual not hearing you try

775
01:15:04,535 --> 01:15:09,615
Andy this is Reggie. very short

776
01:15:09,615 --> 01:15:14,695
message. is

777
01:15:14,695 --> 01:15:20,115
the lifetime article. there be electronic

778
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:26,155
over the phone. what's up. thanks a_lot. bye-bye. bye. they're ready.

779
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:32,675
what's special about the law. it is very very

780
01:15:32,675 --> 01:15:39,354
high speed money. alright bye.

781
01:15:39,354 --> 01:15:44,854
four four five.

782
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:50,395
so the high velocity. Jim this is Energy. article and

783
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:55,515
multi time and actually concentrate more more

784
01:15:55,515 --> 01:16:01,952
energetic shorter way. thanks bye. neutron

785
01:16:01,952 --> 01:16:07,392
this is normal. if you can come up with other circumstances. and there

786
01:16:07,392 --> 01:16:12,833
are very high energy nations well and they can also change

787
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:18,712
interior. Dave over radio active days.

788
01:16:18,712 --> 01:16:25,512
so here's the diagram of. alright go to pro time to neutron

789
01:16:25,512 --> 01:16:31,552
electronics. you have already x-rayed. I

790
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:39,652
don't have charge course. all after magnetic radiation travel.

791
01:16:39,652 --> 01:16:44,833
okay. so here's again. you start with. this

792
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:51,092
is gonna be important return the radon radon to twenty six. it's Ray.

793
01:16:51,092 --> 01:16:57,572
eighty eight. from time three and it has

794
01:16:57,572 --> 01:17:03,086
a strong one hundred and

795
01:17:03,086 --> 01:17:12,606
forty. anyway.

796
01:17:12,606 --> 01:17:17,727
anyway I'm in the house. it's gonna sound final

797
01:17:17,727 --> 01:17:23,106
always to from time to New Johnson

798
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:29,326
at four. total cost was time. and so it's still

799
01:17:29,326 --> 01:17:34,946
the time difference. it's not radon any more.

800
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:40,986
and we'll wait for the atomic way

801
01:17:40,986 --> 01:17:47,906
that. okay. alright. haven't heard already.

802
01:17:47,906 --> 01:17:52,966
you'll hear me say later this is important. so

803
01:17:52,966 --> 01:17:58,046
I'll for radiation.

804
01:17:58,046 --> 01:18:03,119
we'll go through this is the

805
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:10,259
positive. very short this

806
01:18:10,259 --> 01:18:15,418
morning just now. talk to you soon. hey radiation. we got

807
01:18:15,418 --> 01:18:20,759
some paper work oh three two well yeah the radiation tonight because

808
01:18:20,759 --> 01:18:26,679
the people who you think on my office. and this is only has the same thing.

do have. alright. alright. bye. partly

812
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:49,079

813
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:54,079
bye. go through pretty important stuff. alright

814
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:59,193
