1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,830
Our vacations are different and they're really fun for everyone.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,340
I know. I know. I had to. We have to be good.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,810
Otherwise we wouldn't do something. So this one here.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:20,560
I love it. Yeah, it's about. Maybe I'm only going to be passing through the secondary sources.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,559
Yeah, but you don't carry that.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:36,170
They're always looking for something from, you know, where they were.

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,320
It's like the most professional thing. I, I know what I'm going on this week.

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,940
So this. It's like Michigan football.

9
00:00:49,010 --> 00:01:01,559
Yeah, it looks like some of these things, but one of them, you like a few of them that makes them every single time that they was caught.

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,020
And part of the reason, you know, I did yours.

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:21,300
I think my ideas, you know, that when maybe after 20 I think seven best reasons why I guess or something.

12
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,610
Oh yeah. I mean no girls know.

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,060
I mean, the validation. I do write like a huge paragraph.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,260
All I know is that I wrote something like right now.

15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:42,749
I wrote about how like I was like like but that's like she so supportive and like, the shooter.

16
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,990
And so it goes like the first year.

17
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,750
Oh, yeah. You know, we do like today. I'm still here yesterday.

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,650
So we're just today. Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:08,580
Just a minute. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I honestly think those are like know, I think they were trying to find out.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,990
We just want to work on feelings.

21
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:20,490
I think I sorta I tried to use these verses by car tempo and then I just change the numbers.

22
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:34,200
But then I got confused because like, I don't feel like working on it.

23
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:41,130
I just like because it's just so much for self sheet that I was like, why don't you just look at what was happening?

24
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,920
And I was like, So I'm here, I'm like a single fireman.

25
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,450
So it's like, Yeah, yeah, there's only one.

26
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,799
Because, like I said, topics and data and years.

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,540
But then it also said Years on it's better, but they only give like one time period.

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,079
I was like, How would you like to do something where I could just one?

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:16,630
But there's, there's two, but each have multiple parts. But like the first one is just like what is facing what I mean.

30
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,730
So it's like exploding those words.

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,930
I mean, I just try.

32
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,720
Yeah, she's really interesting. What do you think?

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:42,980
You kind of let me know for sure. I'll keep my eye on maybe something goes.

34
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:51,720
And so I wasn't expecting that. Okay, so I'm like, Oh, Mom, that's my friend.

35
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,470
15 seconds or something. Yeah.

36
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:08,220
Just like so I think that's what I would just like out of recording in progress that, you know,

37
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:22,440
so introduce yourself to some question as to what you think about computers, which I do, yeah.

38
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:39,240
Regulation. Yeah. I mean, I know she's I feel like she's just like, yeah, yeah.

39
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,210
Yeah. They feel like they're usually good about that because I feel like, you know,

40
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,630
some of those things like organization, something, that's what I feel like they usually do.

41
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:12,810
Like sometimes like, yeah, you have to kind of, you know, like it's just like sometimes like, oh, good for you, but I don't like it.

42
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,630
And then that's kind of the conversations that I am doing, you know?

43
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,169
I don't know if I'll put you on it anymore like that in terms of being.

44
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:41,080
Good morning, everybody. So let's continue our conversation on this issue right now.

45
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,160
If you start working on this issue, an analysis with your table,

46
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:58,060
that means that we can summarize the real problem in an on a table where we can list all

47
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,620
the possible all the decisions we can make now on all the states of nature in the future,

48
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:15,160
all the situations that can be that can arise in the future and the consequences of our decisions now.

49
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:25,960
So we usually with our decisions on this side of that, in the column, on the side of the table.

50
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:33,970
So each row is one decision and then the state all day exclusive, a state of nature on the top of the table.

51
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,150
So each column is one different, the state of nature.

52
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:52,570
So and then what we do is that for each Intersect form at the intersection of every decision and every state of nature we list, they pay off.

53
00:06:52,870 --> 00:07:02,709
That means the positive or negative value that we are receiving because we make the decision now and then these things happen in the future.

54
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:08,710
Right. So that's one step decision and decision for all of you.

55
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:17,650
Make a decision and then nature makes sense, a stake in the future and you don't know what nature is going to do in the future.

56
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,290
Right. So you have to anticipate,

57
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:28,630
you'll have to think that the business decision now to maximize the opportunity to be to achieve it all that you want with you.

58
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,520
So in some cases, you want to maximize profit.

59
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:40,070
Some cases you want to minimize loss of time. You want to minimize the opportunity lost.

60
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:50,740
There's a lot of different kinds of goals that you might you see in this case who are going maximize profit.

61
00:07:50,930 --> 00:08:01,510
Right. So we want to what what we did last time is we started these this problem on

62
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:09,430
the assumption that I that we go on the probabilities of the state of nature.

63
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,700
Right.

64
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:39,620
So we are you know, they a probability that we know the probability of the fate of nature and the probabilities of the state of nature out of two one.

65
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:57,830
And what we are going to do and where we're going to do it is a disputation of expected monetary value of each decision.

66
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:06,810
By just multiplying the probabilities time they pay off that you get for each end a state of nature for every decision.

67
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:20,270
Right? So last time we we we found that if we go for stocks, even these probabilities of the state of nature,

68
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:31,129
our monetary value is going to be $2,745 versus if we go for CB, we go for 20 $400.

69
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:39,140
So if we are maximizing this benefit, if everybody if we are making a decision based on that, we will go through a thought.

70
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:50,660
Right. And that reflects the the knowledge that we have of the potential appearance of the state of nature.

71
00:09:50,660 --> 00:10:03,770
So in the future, for example, you know, most of the time we know that's going to be an average market and then they will get 20, 7000 versus 2400.

72
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,250
The probability of a poor market is very small. 5% is there, but it's 5%.

73
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:21,169
So you all you're willing to risk is -600 because that's a very small state making 2400 here that

74
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:29,810
you are willing to make to reach the is -600 because you have the chance with the stocks to,

75
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,670
you know, make more money in other in other situations.

76
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:44,389
All right. So in essence, you don't have to make all these computations in your head.

77
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:53,720
All you have to do is compute the expected monetary value and go for it later on, even if these two values are very close.

78
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:05,809
And then you say, well, I, I can give all a little bit of this effect in monetary value, a few dollars for you in order to minimize my risk,

79
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,950
then you can switch if if those values are very close,

80
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:19,510
but the one solution is much less risky than another one, then you might change your decision based on that.

81
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,480
But that's it. That's a preference. That's how you feel about risk, right?

82
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:37,969
If I if we ask and inspect the monetary value of is system you we'll talk a little bit about your your feelings the subject

83
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,110
these feelings about race is going to be different later on and see how it can be incorporated in there in the computation.

84
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:52,300
All right. So this is remember, we are making decisions on the risk, right.

85
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:06,200
And before we said we were making decisions under uncertainty when we didn't know anything about the probabilities of the state of nature.

86
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:16,000
If we don't know, then we use rules like maxi, max, maxi mean meaning max regret that do not involve probabilities of a state of nature.

87
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,770
God will allow you to express your certain kind of attitudes about making decisions.

88
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:32,569
Always want to have the opportunity to maximize the my profit to one, to the opportunity to hedge.

89
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,250
So I want to prevent big losses and nothing can be known.

90
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,870
I want to prevent big regrets that say they meaning max regret.

91
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:51,860
But in this there's the second case making decision on the risk is going to be the most common because you have an idea.

92
00:12:51,910 --> 00:13:02,790
Joey Most of the time we can collect information, but we have some idea about the probabilities of the the events that might happen.

93
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,100
So this is where we where and we have a spectrum.

94
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,190
One is that anybody would rule, what would we do?

95
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:22,700
And then we would do is start right and then we will get 27, 45 now the second day, then the next.

96
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:33,160
And. She?

97
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:55,020
So next we a we go for ethics.

98
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:01,380
What decision should be made according to the expected of the laws, this issue.

99
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,530
So this e0l stands for expected opportunity laws.

100
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:15,890
So assume that your your media something knows that I gave you and that the expected opportunity laws is

101
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:28,320
simply what the opportunity laws you as as as we talk about is the amount of money that you are foregoing,

102
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,350
that you are making, that you are losing because the people need the best position under each state of nature.

103
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,750
So you will make a thousand, but you are making 500 things like that, right?

104
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:50,010
So we develop the as the day opportunity load tables on the table for the we are going to use every great table with probabilities now.

105
00:14:50,520 --> 00:15:14,650
So this is this is what we you. Okay.

106
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,840
So what I'm going to do is go strong again.

107
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,520
The opportunity will say, Well, I don't really need that in there.

108
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,090
I already did that before.

109
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:53,049
So is it that right able if you remember how we build that big red table for each decision and it's state of nature for each state of America,

110
00:15:53,050 --> 00:16:00,880
we figured out what is the best and then that the best decision as every grade of zero.

111
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,309
But the difference from the best decision for each state of nature is the

112
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,390
amount of money that you're making because you didn't make the best decision.

113
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:19,150
So, for example, if you decide to go for a dog, then you how in poor market are you going to be making 2400?

114
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:24,880
But you are losing. Instead, you're losing since hundreds of the difference is 3000, right?

115
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,579
2400 miles, -600. So that state, that's India.

116
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:44,030
So very quickly, I'm going to repeat that table here or both table and reader table, I call the table,

117
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:58,270
you know that the same thing of opportunity, those tables that you are familiar with, both nomenclature.

118
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,200
Right. I mean, if you remember the opportunity, those tables.

119
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:18,470
I'm going to go because the structure here of the bay of table boba, we eat right here.

120
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,110
We're not used to the land use. Right.

121
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:33,240
And if we stay for months, is it so important that.

122
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,140
So I have the same things they had before?

123
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:53,760
But now, if you remember, I'm going to create a formula for that that takes the the pay off and subtract that from the best in the column.

124
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:01,290
So this is going to be equal to the corresponding pay or arguably the maximum first.

125
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:09,900
So I'm going to get the maximum of 8.3. So that's going to be an X and then parentheses.

126
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:21,989
And then I'm going to highlight this column and I don't want I want the the columns to change, but not with rows when I copy the formula.

127
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,150
So I am going to fixed things that rows.

128
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:34,800
So they would, they'd go to our signs before two, three, two, one, two, three, three will remain the same.

129
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:44,070
And when they copy that formula that, that and the column is going to flow to them see the so from from C to the need right.

130
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:56,280
So maximum of that minus the stuff that I'm I'm going to be the, the the entry that I ever waiting.

131
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:06,900
So in this case is the that includes C 32 and I want that to flow all around the table when I go B because I want to say when it fails.

132
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,550
So now we have a 33,000.

133
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,360
But if I want to simply.

134
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:30,490
Copy that formula. So I get my opportunity. Those people in Joe did two things about the opportunity table that you need to remember.

135
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:41,920
They should be at least one zero in every one of them, at least one corresponding to the maximum, not on the maximum pay of the column.

136
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,760
So you always have to see at least one zero.

137
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,060
You can have 20300. Everything is the same but at least one, right?

138
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,730
So this is the maximum video four.

139
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,370
See these, this is the maximum payoff for a Starbucks and you know,

140
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:13,180
for the average salary for the maximum pay of of four for for the maximum payoff on their average market and the maximum you pay, they're good.

141
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:27,220
And so and when we see the values are not zero simply the regret for not making the decision corresponding to that zero.

142
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:36,699
The simple thing that I wanted to remind you about the opportunity loss table is that you kind of have a negative number.

143
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:49,050
So the table is is non-negative and they have zeros being in every column, but only zero from positive number because you don't have a negative three.

144
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:59,770
Right. So if we review something that we have, you know, something that we mean, we are calculating the maximum minus all the other.

145
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:05,040
And so all the other entries are smaller than the maximum.

146
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,670
Therefore breath is always going to be positive or zero.

147
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,830
They are. So it's a non negative table.

148
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:23,950
Okay. So once you have that, we can do exactly what we did with the inspection monitoring body.

149
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:30,970
And we hope you will always think that opportunity loss of this opportunity log.

150
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:39,360
Is this simple? Simply the counterpart of respect, the monetary body.

151
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:48,180
So you are not going to have you're not going to have a different solution than respect the monetary value.

152
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:55,710
So whatever you get in respect of monetary value of this, I we think you're going to get this opportunity as a solution.

153
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:02,340
The idea is the same type of is the same simplification value from a different angle.

154
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,139
So it's not like they maximize sound.

155
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:16,860
Mixing means that you could get oh for maximum set because I want the ones who might get the profits as large as possible.

156
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:24,480
Then I pick a stocks or a max. Maxie means because I want to hedge against big losses.

157
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,530
Then I basically need.

158
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:35,250
You are not going to get different decisions when you deal with as the in my money if anybody or anticipated opportunity looks okay.

159
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:46,290
So then what we do is take the expectation of of every bread aisle as we did before.

160
00:22:46,300 --> 00:23:00,460
This is going to be the sum problem. All the probabilities of the state of nature, and those are amply over.

161
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,810
And then times, you know,

162
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:17,889
the first role or stocks that we create for stocks and then I get we get the 150 and then every regular for 95 and regret is something bad.

163
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:30,550
So we want to minimize our regrets. Right. So therefore the immediate one regret is that is what we're thinking and that that corresponds to stock,

164
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,560
which is exactly the same decision that we made with respect to monetary value.

165
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:44,810
Now. This is going to be.

166
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,250
The decision stops. Remember, the answer is not 150.

167
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,700
The answer is not in 2745.

168
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:09,590
The answer is what you do is your decision. Your decision is unknown for a start because the expected monetary value is going to be 2745.

169
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,309
Right. Which is the maximum specter might run here.

170
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,810
The answer is dogs, because I'm going to have a meaningful regret.

171
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,870
BE So this is an expectation.

172
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,260
This is going to be law, not that I'm going to receive.

173
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:42,830
If I go for a stop, I'm going to give you a huge opportunity loss if I but if I choose stocks and some poor market up here,

174
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,050
but it's only 5% chance that that happens. So.

175
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:57,620
All right. So I'm then, you know, for this dog's the other other opportunity losses are zero.

176
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:05,080
Okay. So they can look at this number because it's going to be important.

177
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,680
The meaning one aspect is opportunity loss. What do you think he means?

178
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:20,600
So what do you think it means? That you look for a dogs, you get immediate money and you get that respect and opportunity.

179
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,260
Dollars 150 This is $150 month.

180
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,130
What? What are those 150 or.

181
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:44,460
It's an expectation, the amount of money that you are meeting, you're losing because you didn't make the best decision on each state amendment.

182
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,510
But that means that you go, No, you don't have a crystal ball about the state of nature, right?

183
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,120
You don't know exactly what's going to happen in the future.

184
00:25:54,510 --> 00:26:02,220
And if you had perfect knowledge about what happened in the future, you could you could always pick the best.

185
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:10,200
So you were you so unexpected that what would 50 means that this is the amount of money that you are

186
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,760
missing because you didn't have perfect information about the future and you didn't have a crystal ball.

187
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,340
So that this is what you're looking for then to decision.

188
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,260
If you vote for it,

189
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:33,600
you get an expectation of form 50 aspect a monetary value because you didn't have increase to make you realize what's going to happen in the future.

190
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:42,680
If you had, then you could have a sweet job. I know that I'm going to have a poor market though, and therefore I don't foresee these.

191
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,839
Oh, I know I'm going to have an average market.

192
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,950
Then I'm going for a stock or a good market. Then I'm going for a stock.

193
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:57,990
Right. If you in advance know what's going to happen in the future, you can switch your decision and then your regret will be zero.

194
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,140
But because you can't, you have to make a decision now and you don't know what's going to happen in the future,

195
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:14,690
then that's why you have these meaning one regret that you can look lower than that and you're the one that is below that.

196
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:23,790
So that's a set way into what if you had perfect information, what would you know, how would would change?

197
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:34,310
Reason? Yes. So what we just calculated here is the same as the Minimax regret.

198
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,620
But we take into consideration the probability of nature.

199
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,890
Correct? Correct. So now you have information about how you know possible.

200
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,970
How probable are those the state of nature in the future?

201
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,240
We thought you didn't know. Right. You have no idea.

202
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:04,180
Good morning. So it needs.

203
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:19,290
So the question is how much should it be willing to pay to obtain the markets for God?

204
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,610
That is 100% accurate. Okay.

205
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,240
So let's let's take a look.

206
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,880
And these are these videos that you just want to take a look at the three of them.

207
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:48,959
Okay. So let's remember, all you know right now are new probabilities of a theoretical, you know,

208
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:57,120
that the information and and we are now, at least at this point, trying to make a decision between the stocks and see these.

209
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:03,030
I, I don't know what's going to happen in the future, but I know these probabilities.

210
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:11,190
Right. And now my question to you is, suppose that I am the person.

211
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:20,220
I am a perfect forecaster. And I can tell you in advance now what's going to be the future.

212
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:26,430
So I can tell you with 100% accuracy what's going to happen in the future.

213
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,720
And then, you know, let's see if you hire me.

214
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,190
Right. So I. Okay, I'm your perfect forecaster.

215
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,100
And then your question is, okay, tell me what's going to happen in the future.

216
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,720
And they said you are going to have a poor market.

217
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,310
Definitely a poor market. What then? Then you make the one decision you make.

218
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,290
I see. You get to see the. Okay. I think.

219
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:10,520
Definitely. And you're going to be making 2400, right? Because I call you in advance now and say, okay, baby, how much would you pay?

220
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:18,590
You pay me for that information? 725 725 because it's my hourly rate.

221
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,309
Why is. 725 Well, that's the hourly rate.

222
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:28,910
So and it didn't even take you an hour to come up with that information.

223
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:38,420
So it's a good deal. So you think it'd be very cheap, right?

224
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:46,280
Yeah. Let's say that I gave you, by the way, it's not 7.5.

225
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,960
Word is. So.

226
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,640
So you. I gave you the information.

227
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,370
You made your decision, right? And I ask you to pay me.

228
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,330
And then you are a profit maximizing individual.

229
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:16,370
And if I ask you to pay me, you're going to say, Oh, you know, I pay you zero because I would have made that decision anyway.

230
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,570
Right. How would I know that you then make that decision?

231
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:28,340
Okay. You said you didn't make me win anything. You didn't make me gain anything because I wouldn't make that decision anyway.

232
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,540
You can tell me anything.

233
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:39,700
The fact is, I already gave you the information, so I didn't have any leverage on, you know, on how much you you're going to pay me now.

234
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:48,920
I myself and I said, next time we're going to have a contract first and you are going to pay me in advance.

235
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,070
So we're going to say this is how much you're going to pay me.

236
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:59,570
So you pay me in advance. We have a contract, you pay me in advance and then I make I gave you the information.

237
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,520
So how much would you be willing to pay me in advance for that information?

238
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,030
And that is what we call the value of perfect information.

239
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:14,240
So how much is do you know how much your business is worth to you?

240
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:23,060
My perfect information. My knowledge of this is what you're going to have in the future before you make your decision.

241
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:33,960
Like that's the point. So this is how we are going to do is calculate that to.

242
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:50,500
Okay. So you're going to move these to spring and you're going to say, okay, David is going to.

243
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:58,180
So suppose that I hire these four cops and he said that I am going to have a poor market.

244
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,540
So which decision would I make?

245
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,220
Well, I would make these rights and I will be making 2400.

246
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,840
And then you recorded 2400, right?

247
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,930
A maximum of both of these values.

248
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,360
So what if he said that I'm going to have an average market?

249
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,190
What decision would I make? You go for stock. So you mean 2700?

250
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:38,440
And the same thing. If I if I said, oh, you're going to have a good market, then you immediately to stop because you're going to be making 4800.

251
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:51,070
Right. The thing is, you don't know which one I'm going to say, but you know that wherever I said you would be, what you would be,

252
00:33:51,970 --> 00:34:01,420
you you'd be able to switch to choose the value that is best for you, the decision that is best for you.

253
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:11,800
That's the difference. Right? So whatever this whatever forecast I give you, you immediately can decide between CDMA stocks.

254
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:17,139
So you don't know which this which is state of nature I'm going to forecast.

255
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:25,630
But you know that these are going to be your possible earnings and those are the three possible payoff for you.

256
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,790
Now, what is the probability that I said that you're going to have a poor market?

257
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:38,740
5%? What is the probability that you said that I said that you're going to have an average market, 85%, and this good market 10%.

258
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:51,040
So on expectation how much money you are going to be making because you can change your decision to what goes to my forecast,

259
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:55,450
then this is going to be the some product.

260
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:08,660
Of the probabilities here. Obama and the streets of New.

261
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,229
And is 2895.

262
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:24,970
So you say okay. You say, okay.

263
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:36,370
So if if I hire this person on this big station, I'm going to get $2,385.

264
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:44,380
So and I will be able to switch between the storms and the city.

265
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,920
But what happens if I don't hire this person?

266
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:58,180
What would I do if I don't hire this story? It will be your decision if you don't hire me.

267
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,090
Suppose that you're going to have any forecast about the future.

268
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,780
Right. You don't have any perfect information about the future.

269
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:15,610
You don't know that what the future is going to give you, except that you have 5%,

270
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:20,090
85% and 10% probability of having a poor, an average or a good market.

271
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,750
What message would you make in that situation with no extra help for me?

272
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,800
Stocks. You'll go for stocks, right?

273
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,030
Because the storms will give you 2745 on expectation.

274
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:44,720
Right. So this is. The maximum expected monetary value.

275
00:36:53,510 --> 00:37:06,750
A misnomer here. This number here is called the expected monetary value on their perfect thing for me that the.

276
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:20,220
Monetary value.

277
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,480
Under their free. Information.

278
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,310
And the expected monetary value of their specific information is, as you know,

279
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:49,590
is if you hire a person with perfect information about their future and this is the amount of money that you an expectation are going to make.

280
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:58,380
And if if I made my decision all by myself and I said stocks, then I am making 2745.

281
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:08,400
If I instead I make a decision based on what you are going to tell me, instead of making a decision now I hire you.

282
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,300
I wait until you give me the your forecast.

283
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,159
Then I will be making an expectation. 2895 Okay.

284
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,639
So you'll say how much do you pay this person?

285
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,629
How much do you pay?

286
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:35,700
The event has perfect forecaster are you say by myself I can be making 2745 and with the forecast before forecast I'm making 2895.

287
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:46,060
So the difference between the two is how much more money perfect information makes me realize actually and the difference between the two.

288
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,749
So I'm going to equal to this.

289
00:38:51,750 --> 00:39:03,710
Number nine is number is $150 and $150 is a very important number.

290
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:08,549
This is what we call the expected value of perfect information.

291
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:19,790
So. Is is expected the value.

292
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:48,520
Well, very fitting for me. So this is when you see the.

293
00:39:52,820 --> 00:40:00,350
These these nomenclature in the I acronym that states strength the value of pertinent information.

294
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:19,340
The other one that we are that we calculated before is the acronym is the and the key is the monetary value under perfect information.

295
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:28,220
Right. This is the aspect the monetary body, the perfect information, these 2895 and this is the aspect, the body of perfect information.

296
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,030
Right. How much money would you be willing to pay for?

297
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:39,560
Perfect information? So maybe that's your answer that you'll pay me $150 no more, right?

298
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,379
So if you pay me more than $150, you're losing money.

299
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:53,330
So you don't want to do that. If you pay me $150, then you are exactly as I reach.

300
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,270
Exactly as. You know.

301
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,719
Well, as I said, you were using your suspect a monetary value.

302
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,780
So you take away all the advantage of my imperfect information just by giving that back to me.

303
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:23,820
But if you pay me like $80 you are still making, you know, you'll be willing to pay me $80, $90, $100, because that's less than what I make.

304
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,600
Can you weigh in on top of the spec, the monetary value?

305
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:39,239
Right. So if you say if I say, well, I am this perfect forecaster, I am going to charge $100 for my forecast.

306
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:50,010
You say yes. But if I say, Oh, I am a perfect forecaster and I want to charge you $200, are you saying no?

307
00:41:50,100 --> 00:42:01,829
Not in detail. Right. So and remember, the expected value of perfect information depends on two things.

308
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:08,640
First is the accuracy of my forecast. So we are we are assuming right now that my forecasts are perfect.

309
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:12,990
Okay. We're also on this thing. So the game, right.

310
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,829
You will be willing to pay more money if you were going to be making more money.

311
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:31,420
So it doesn't depend. So I cannot have a fixed rate for any any problem because that depends on how much you're making in that.

312
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,020
In a problem, that's what you're willing to pay. So this is what you are willing to pay.

313
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:48,610
So if I say, well, I charge $1,000 an hour and he's going to take me an hour to do that, you say just go do something else like that.

314
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,820
That's a. Why is this number important?

315
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:08,110
Because, you know, nobody has perfect information, but you are going to receive help in terms of marketing campaigns, internal marketing studies,

316
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:25,690
in terms of, you know, forecast about the future, in terms of, you know, any add on information that will help you figure out what the future is.

317
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:36,910
And those, you know, those processes cost money and you're going to pay a consultant where you have to be investing in it.

318
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:42,010
So for individuals who can make the analysis decision and you need to know

319
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:49,450
how much would you be waiting the maximum that you would be willing to pay to

320
00:43:49,450 --> 00:44:03,820
get that information and to get that information to get that information of the future before you happen to see if your investment is feasible or not.

321
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:13,240
So if you are dealing with stuff that you know is is not going to make even with perfect information,

322
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,260
is not going to make you mean much more than if you box right.

323
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:27,310
You are not going to invest in there being a mechanism to forecast the future because it will worth it to you.

324
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:38,740
On the other hand, if the you are not sure about the state of nature in the future and knowing the state of nature,

325
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:47,410
what's going to happen before the carbon sink, you know, makes you makes a big difference in your respect and monetary value.

326
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,060
Then you are going to invest more. But let me let me give you an example.

327
00:44:53,050 --> 00:45:09,740
Suppose. Suppose I have two decisions that I can make and it is going to be a decision A and B is going to be as it should be.

328
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:19,399
And they say that I'm going to get a decision C here and this is going to be a state of nature.

329
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,690
One is a state of nature to.

330
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:33,020
And this is a state of the. And I'm into that.

331
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,750
This is .3.6.1.

332
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:43,130
Right. So I'm making this up as we look.

333
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,890
And the entries are going to be saying this is going to be 3000.

334
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:15,310
This is going to be in 100. 2929 522.

335
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:21,670
We we are going to be mine.

336
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:31,360
And, you know, this is going to be a.

337
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,490
510.

338
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:50,129
This is going to be 650 and this is going to be 450.

339
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:55,090
490. Okay.

340
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:03,950
And you do you do you do your analysis and you figured out what is the expected monetary value.

341
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,470
And they say that that I do respect the monetary value here.

342
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:25,990
And I think this is going to be this problem. Oh, my.

343
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:34,390
Probabilities of the state of nature and the entries for each table.

344
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:44,140
All right, then. I have. So since 1969, 95 or 49 or 99.

345
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:52,450
So therefore, I'm going to make a decision that each of me is going to be the one that maximizes respect and monetary value.

346
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,930
So now I come to you and I said, okay, you make 995.

347
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:09,250
But you know, what about if I can tell you in advance how whether you're going to have a state of nature,

348
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:16,090
one, two or three, how much money would you pay me? Without doing any calculation how much money we in.

349
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,630
Take a look. I'm thinking you win the lottery.

350
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:37,790
You. You are making them by yourself. 995. But I offer you information.

351
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:45,610
Now, let me. Let me tell you how much money you pay.

352
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,360
You'll pay me. Take a look at the entries of the table and the entries on the table.

353
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:55,640
What about if I tell you that you're going to have a state of nature?

354
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,170
One. What decision would you make me?

355
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,480
What about if I tell you that you're going to have a state of nature to what decision you make?

356
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,340
And what about the state of an interesting. Me again.

357
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,080
So I would change your decision. Drop my information.

358
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:23,130
It's perfect. But it has value zero to you because you wouldn't do anything differently.

359
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,680
Right. Yeah. You are really making the best possible decision.

360
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:36,319
Yes. Because Decision B dominates all the other decisions for every state of nature.

361
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:44,150
You have the biggest outcome with this economy. So why would you need me to tell you that you know the same thing if us if you

362
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:50,989
compute this monetary value of the the this picture about imperfect information,

363
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:57,620
you'll come up with you. So that's it.

364
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:07,600
That's that's a point to tell you that this baked in value of perfect information depends on different things, right?

365
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:16,850
It's things that you are dealing with on a probabilities of a state of nature and the accuracy.

366
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,020
In this case, I'm telling you, the accuracy of my information is perfect,

367
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:28,790
but is worth it because you are not going to do anything that is like I is like I tell you,

368
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:37,940
you know, you have to make a decision based on whether the sun will come up tomorrow or not.

369
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:46,700
Right. And then you hire me and you're going to say when the sun come up tomorrow, I'm going to say yes, but you knew that anyway.

370
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,730
So why would you want me to repeat that?

371
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:59,300
So, right. So if there's something that if there's something that you're going to do anyway, right?

372
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:09,109
So you eat my, eat my information cannot change my your decision then the value zero nine.

373
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:18,130
So now. As of the things that you can see.

374
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:25,870
But there is another interesting fact that we see here,

375
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:38,950
and this is remember that they expected that the minimum respected opportunity lost is was 150 and the minimum respected opportunity loss is always,

376
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,880
always the same as the expected value of perfect information.

377
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:49,270
So if you want people you respect and want to give value, perfect information, you can do this.

378
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:58,550
You can do it this way by subtracting the day MVP from the debt,

379
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:11,950
by subtracting the maximum EMV from from the MVP so that they won 50 or simply computing the expected opportunity loss and taking the minimum.

380
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:21,100
So these correspond to the decision that minimize this that opportunity loss that 150

381
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,620
just means this is on this potentially the amount you are losing because you couldn't

382
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:31,449
make the best decision in every situation and you couldn't make the best decision

383
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:35,370
in every situation because you didn't have perfect information about the future.

384
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:38,740
You see how how they relate. Right.

385
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:51,489
So I say, why do you have that $150 regret is because, you know, I'm not able to switch.

386
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:56,950
I'm not able to in advance know what's going to happen so I can be the best decision.

387
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:03,400
So I'm this I am I am, you know, thinks with the stocks, right.

388
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:09,550
And the stocks will have a regret of 150 because I only change my decision.

389
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,190
That's because I have made the decision.

390
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:19,800
So we have instead of, oh, I know something is going to happen, I make the best decision and then something not right.

391
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:26,220
So this number and this number are always the same.

392
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:36,520
It's good. Okay.

393
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,450
So now that you know all the.

394
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:51,450
INS and outs of the. Respect and monitoring bodies and so on and so forth.

395
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:57,040
How about if we just solve another problem?

396
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:03,690
I'm going to start, you know, solving another problem and then you'll finish.

397
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,240
Okay. So what I want to show you.

398
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,940
Things that you can do to build the spectrum on a daily at the base of table.

399
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:40,930
All right. So let's go to. So we didn't win all of 15.5.

400
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:59,860
And now. We have proven 3.3 and 3.4 from the handout that I gave you.

401
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,610
And that's the problem. 3.3 is pretty much the same.

402
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:21,040
But let's go to from 3.4. At a certain point, a load monitoring device goes to clinic.

403
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,490
We really do $20 per day to own and operate.

404
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:29,680
You are able to rent the device to patients for $200 per day.

405
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,120
Either demand on a given day for these units exceeds the number you own.

406
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,390
You will satisfy your patient's needs by obtaining.

407
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:43,330
They require additional units from a supplier at a cost of $150 per day.

408
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:49,960
Your revenue for the device, unfortunately, is still only $3 per day.

409
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:59,590
And. You must decide how many of these units do on your marketing department estimate.

410
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:05,730
The daily demand for these devices will have the following the probability distribution from 0 to 5.

411
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:14,410
Right. And so construct the field table, the available matrix that the model see that multi decision problem.

412
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:22,490
And then let's do a pessimistic, optimistic and expect a monetary value.

413
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:30,010
Okay. And so we have to date the device cost $20 per day.

414
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:36,460
You rent the device one at $100 per day.

415
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:50,799
The demand on a given day to the you have to get it and your revenue for the device is $100.

416
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,480
So let's take a look at the data, what we know about this.

417
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:07,840
So we're going to get another spreadsheet leader and.

418
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:26,130
So so we have we have to, you know, type of revenue, right?

419
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:35,170
So they have rental revenue actually one is a $100 per day rent and then two different cost.

420
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,090
One is 20 and the other one is is 150.

421
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:47,810
So the revenue. Good morning, Cavs.

422
00:57:51,700 --> 00:58:02,430
Revenue is $100 per day. When it rains ultimately, and then we have regular cost.

423
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:27,250
It is $20. And then the rush cost or even all that extra cost is the total cost for the roadshow and there is 150.

424
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:37,769
So that's what that's what we had. So then what?

425
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:51,940
What what we need to do is build a veiled fable to give you your payoffs for different, you know, a state of nature and and and decisions.

426
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:56,239
Are you coming? Right. What are the state of nature in this case?

427
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,560
You can use events. Sorry. Can you zoom in? So we.

428
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:14,490
Yes. Look, it's one of those Beethoven estates of nature.

429
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,150
What are the things that you cannot predict? What will happen in the future?

430
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:22,750
You hope you know the probabilities, but you don't know exactly what's going to happen.

431
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:30,880
What is random in this and in this example from.

432
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:50,999
So remember that your decisions now are how many of these machines you need to install right for you based on that decision,

433
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:00,150
on what units are demanded and the man that you exactly don't know what the demand is going to be.

434
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:09,380
Right. We have an idea based on how many units are you expect to be demanded then then you make your decisions are made with thought.

435
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:16,560
And so you have, you know, different possibilities of the demand in the future.

436
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:22,240
So the demand can be for a unit.

437
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,210
We have those here from 0 to 5.

438
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:36,300
We didn't have any demand from those who live.

439
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:56,660
And in. Those are going to be is states of nature here.

440
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:03,350
I want to make sure that I labeled this correctly.

441
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:10,310
So I'm going to merge all these cells.

442
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,500
I'm going to call you the title. They the.

443
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:39,790
In units. Then you also know the probabilities of these daily demand.

444
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:49,710
And these are. Five, ten, 2035, 2010.

445
01:01:52,180 --> 01:02:00,130
So it would be a rise and.

446
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:09,910
When he. The five.

447
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:20,820
20. And.

448
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:33,410
I mean, you always want to make sure that they are up to 100%.

449
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:42,480
There's always some chip here and some.

450
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:56,699
100%. Okay. So now those are the estates of nature.

451
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:02,100
So I want you to tell me what would be your possible decisions?

452
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,850
The possible decisions is how many units to a stock.

453
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:13,060
So how many can you stop? What you be your range of possibilities.

454
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:23,850
Between zero and five, between zero five. You don't want to you know, there's a possibility that you're going to need anyone.

455
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:27,120
So you have to consider the possibility that you would stop any.

456
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,040
And and then you have one, two, three,

457
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:37,260
four or five that you don't want to stop more than five because you'll never have the demand for more than five.

458
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:41,340
Right? So then therefore, your decision will be.

459
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:51,240
You know. We five.

460
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:13,100
They will your. So in this case, I'm going to merge this going to right 90 degrees.

461
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:30,740
And this is going to be you and you and the dogs.

462
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:49,260
Each year. These one.

463
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:03,130
And the man and his dog. No.

464
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:07,270
I think there's a section I need to make.

465
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:19,270
You know, they get their pay of how much money I am going to make if I don't if if I have to.

466
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:26,710
If I stop zero units and and and I have zero units of daily demand.

467
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:36,700
Right. So, for example, if that happens, then my cost is going to zero in revenue is zero zero.

468
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:43,600
Right. But let's let's do another one.

469
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:48,550
Why do you find this site list of the zero units that I have in the mind of one?

470
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:57,670
What would that have? We have a demand of one.

471
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:03,600
So what's going to be my cost? I have to rush that unit.

472
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:11,500
Right? Because if I stop no units and somebody won a unit, then I have to rush in for $150.

473
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:17,050
Right. But I can only charge $100, so I'm losing $50 in this case.

474
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:32,090
So you have to go. So we have six I think you have to have 36 entries, two for the payoff table that you need to get, that you need to compute.

475
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:38,540
Let's see if we can compute that easier than for one by one.

476
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,740
Right. So we have here.

477
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:57,730
We think through. They think this only sustainable move is a little bit down.

478
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:14,139
Then I'll see you later. But then what happens is this is going to be the unit's dog.

479
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,230
So we're going to call that day supply.

480
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,620
And this is going to be the daily demand.

481
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:24,250
So I'm going to call that demand. So this is going to be my demand.

482
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:36,280
The universe is still going to be the supply and the union's demand and the state of nature is going to be the name.

483
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:45,620
Right. And then after that, I can compute the total revenue.

484
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:49,490
My total. Because I can get total revenue.

485
01:07:53,100 --> 01:08:04,890
Little cross. And in a way, you.

486
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:21,190
Rather than the recording that they're putting up video here for, the next thing I'm going to do is probably is nobody.

487
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:33,330
Get it done very next to the revenue it enables.

488
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:41,700
So what I want to do is, is name these sales as these labels here with these people.

489
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:50,240
So I'm going to highlight. The remedy, the labels on they and their values.

490
01:08:50,720 --> 01:09:07,100
And I am going to go into a new formula the and we could create a name from selection formula three a name from selection.

491
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:16,730
And then I want those cells in column C to be to be name as the labels in economy.

492
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,830
So that's going to be the left column.

493
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:34,270
So now if I click on revenue, who's got the revenue from this post of life will close in in total revenue is going to be totally red.

494
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:41,120
But with an underscore, because we we're going to have a space as of the names of sales.

495
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,030
Right. And this is going to be total cost and is going to be males.

496
01:09:46,610 --> 01:10:03,710
And so now what what I want to do is create some formulas here that if I enter any value for the demand and supply starts or the baby the man,

497
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,440
then I get my pay right away.

498
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:26,360
So let's say if I get a supply of three, right, and I have a demand of five, so supply of three under the mantle fight and that's totally arbitrary.

499
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:30,349
So I just put in three and 5 to 2 the middle of the formula.

500
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,600
So you come up with your name now.

501
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:46,460
So now tell me a formula for the total revenue, how much revenue I am getting if I have a supply of 300 and multiply.

502
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,510
Not because we just talked already. I'm going to use the red.

503
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:11,970
Yeah. But the formula, even if it's going to be day revenue times day and then the amount because we always have to satisfy the demand no matter what.

504
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:16,910
Right. So it can be by bringing a brochure order.

505
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:21,310
Oh, we have to stop whatever. But we have to satisfy the demand.

506
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:31,530
And, and the our revenue is $100 per unit going to go to the very, very unit like that, ten times, whatever.

507
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:36,780
How many people want. So is it going to be equal to.

508
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:50,320
I could call that evening the very rare times in between them.

509
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:57,830
Does it matter if it is over and over? So that's my formula.

510
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:01,910
Revenue times demand. That's a total right now.

511
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:07,020
What about the total cost? Although I compute the total cost.

512
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:15,900
Well, depends. Right. That is I you know, whether whether I have to write an order or not.

513
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:26,660
Right. So one the first. There's always a cost associated with this $20.

514
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:32,480
Right. So there's always this regular cost that is associated with the unit that is.

515
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:45,560
So how many units you know, how many units do I pay $20 for?

516
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:54,760
So it's $20 times what I five that regular cost $20 more of this $20 than the supply.

517
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:58,510
Right. So this is the unit that I found.

518
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:05,930
So it's going to be always first the supply for the regular cost.

519
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,880
Times the supply. Right?

520
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:22,130
But to that, I need to add. And it's not caused.

521
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:24,130
Right. What does what is that extra cost?

522
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:40,180
Wondering what's it's going to be the demand minus supply times the extra cost that which 150 button but not all the time.

523
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:44,829
Right. Is only if the demand is greater than the supply.

524
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:51,430
Because if the supply is greater than the demand, then you don't need to to bring anything.

525
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:56,290
Right. So how about we can do two things.

526
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:59,650
We can do an if statement here. Right.

527
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,540
So I can do that. I'm going to show you two ways to do this.

528
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,900
First, I can say, okay, this is extra cost.

529
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:19,750
Eight times. And then if.

530
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:26,120
If statement is the man.

531
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:39,950
Greater than supply. So there's going to be demand mine wide.

532
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:56,520
Minus supply. Otherwise zero because you don't have any answer necessary.

533
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:04,900
So that formula will take care of the total cost.

534
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,490
Right. So it's the regular cost time supply.

535
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:14,080
So that's when you stop first and they extract calls if you need to rush,

536
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:21,880
any units you figured out is going to be one with around $50 times the number of units that you rush.

537
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:27,190
And then you always rush that in my mind of supply, because you need to satisfy the demand,

538
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:33,220
but only, you know, you you don't want to have a negative, you know.

539
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:40,660
RUSH Or here so they knew that the units that you are missing are the ones that

540
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,540
for which the demand exceed the supply by the number of units that people demand.

541
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:57,840
But you have or you can have your units, it's done for them.

542
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,430
Okay. So that will do. I'm going to show you.

543
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:06,930
So are you satisfied that I will do? Okay.

544
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:12,370
Let me show you another way to do this without an F pace.

545
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:17,229
Okay. So you can do the same thing, several new things.

546
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:22,840
And by doing that, this is going to be the max.

547
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,940
The demand miners.

548
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:39,050
Reply. 440.

549
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:45,300
And so that demand exceeds the supply.

550
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,460
That's going to be a positive number and a positive number and zero.

551
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:52,740
The maximum between a positive number and zero is a positive number.

552
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:58,350
If that is, if the demand is smaller than the supply, so you don't need any extra,

553
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:05,520
that number is going to be negative demand, minus supply and the maximum between zero and a negative number is zero.

554
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,840
So that's going to be exactly the same as the statement.

555
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,850
But with noise. So we had.

556
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:27,950
Okay. So we get the total, of course, is 360, and therefore the payoff is always equal to the total revenue.

557
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:42,310
Are not. Under the coordination.

558
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:47,830
So we have 140. You know, the trick is now.

559
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:53,680
Now, we may have, let's say, two and five.

560
01:17:54,160 --> 01:18:03,430
Then we have my pay of these ten. Let's say if I have the supply of one and the demand is five.

561
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,800
Now we have a payoff of -1.7.

562
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:16,750
Right. So we have a mechanism that if they have any any value for the demand at any value for the supply.

563
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:26,050
I have my pay of here. So what I want to do now is translate all these numbers to this table here.

564
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:31,540
And in order to do that, we are going to create a two way table in itself.

565
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,600
Are you familiar with the drawing table? You are going to get from your income, right?

566
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:48,580
So in a two way table, what we are going to do is have computations in excel in the in in a spreadsheet.

567
01:18:48,940 --> 01:19:01,000
So if I put these numbers in there, they the top row, any number of that in the top row or in the first column?

568
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:04,750
Any place in the spreadsheet.

569
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:11,379
Then the spreadsheet will change. And then I'm going to collect whatever it is that I want to collect.

570
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:17,050
In this case, they paid off, and I'm going to put that at the intersection of that supply and demand that right.

571
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:18,700
In order to do that,

572
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:32,349
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go over here the formula for the over day element that I want to replicate in this table,

573
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:38,260
that I want to keep track on this table. And that element is what you pay, right?

574
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:41,350
So I'm going to right here, instead of putting the formula,

575
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:50,170
I already have the formula to that equal to the table because I already label that that sale failed.

576
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:55,750
So I still have 120 negative.

577
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:59,409
You know, want that 120 to show you.

578
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:07,330
One is the one that we simply going to form on sale and on.

579
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:12,100
And they say that the response is.

580
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:22,910
I feel.

581
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:43,180
And then. You is the fun caller and then I'm going to put that white so it goes merging to ground so you can and you wouldn't be able to see it.

582
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:51,340
Right. And then one more thing to do is I'm going to highlight this table.

583
01:20:53,200 --> 01:21:02,710
It holds the including the formula. And then I'm going to go into data and then what if analysis?

584
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:17,070
And then data table and then I'm going to take the there's a row of inputs right these zero want to set that that say that

585
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:27,720
the input role right and and this is telling me in which cell in this spreadsheet do I want to include these values.

586
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:38,850
I want to put these values in the cell that I call them on the right hand and the column input.

587
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:51,600
So this is a column of simple. I want to take each one of those numbers and I'm going to put that in the spreadsheet on on a cell that I call supply.

588
01:21:56,330 --> 01:22:00,170
And if I did. Okay. I have my tape.

589
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:08,170
I. You can form an allegory one.

590
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:25,070
And you know, from here you can answer all these questions, all the questions that they are asking the.

591
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:33,680
Go for it. We'll finish. Whatever question you have will finish on Thursday.

592
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:39,380
Remember to do one thing if you have any information, if anything.

593
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:51,650
So answer some questions and to answer some questions in my office hours on Thursday and we'll probably finish this problem on Thursday.

594
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:58,010
If you haven't finished that by yourself. But it should be should be a straightforward answer.

595
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:38,450
Really? I was reading 36 years ago when I got my rights and it's going to be okay.

596
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:44,870
Yeah. It's just going to get lonely.

597
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:50,450
Whatever it is.

598
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:58,220
I thought you were good with that.

599
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:03,360
It's not easy to go online. Oh, okay. So you are meeting.

600
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:08,240
Oh, that's so. That's. I think it doesn't really exist.

601
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:14,140
Oh, okay. So what did you.

602
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:30,500
A little rust. Yeah. Come right after.

603
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:40,480
Oh, yeah. I don't have much time.

604
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:53,950
All right, fine. I feel like I was starting to do that, but I just.

605
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,753
I'm not sure if, like, that's not what I feel, right?
