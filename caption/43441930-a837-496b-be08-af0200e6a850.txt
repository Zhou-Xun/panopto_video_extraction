1
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:56,310
Yeah. I didn't want to go like that.

2
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:06,610
Good morning. I was.

3
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,890
Good morning. Happy first day of fall.

4
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,730
So welcome back. And today, we'll be talking through the second day of describing programs.

5
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:38,000
So what we'll do today, I have a couple of announcements and just, you know, very briefly review what we talked about on Tuesday.

6
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,870
Then today, we're going to get into theories of change and most of our time will focus on logic models.

7
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:54,620
And then I will talk through the assignment, the logic model assignment specifically.

8
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,730
So announcements, Hannah and I have noticed that there have been people adding.

9
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:09,050
So if you are new to the class and you're not in a group.

10
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,330
So for those who are new and don't know there is a group project,

11
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:22,100
please see me after class so we can just make sure you're in a group because the first group assignments due next week.

12
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:33,260
F y i. I added an example of a logic model in the files today, and if we have time, we can.

13
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,960
I want to go through it. In class.

14
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,999
But even if we don't have time, just know that there is a kind of a completely example logic model in the file,

15
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,200
in the files, on canvas, in the lecture section.

16
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,440
And then finally, your quiz should have opened.

17
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:09,260
Actually, I think I have it opening at noon. So your first quiz is opening at noon and you have until.

18
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,240
Next week, so well into the 29th to complete it.

19
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:24,000
All right. So those are announcements. And then again, I'll talk about the logic model assignment at the end of class today.

20
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:37,270
All right. So let's jump in. So, like I said, we're talking today again about describing the program.

21
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:47,259
And I got some good questions after class via email about exactly who kind of

22
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,780
drives or who drives and informs the information that goes into this this part.

23
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,980
So I just wanted to clarify that, you know,

24
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:11,050
say we completely strip away all participatory aspects of an evaluation process and just keep it to its most simple elements.

25
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:19,930
If that's the case. The information that feeds this part of the evaluation.

26
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:31,420
So describing the program, so information about context, information about the logic model and the outputs and etc. that comes from the client.

27
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,190
And I realize that the way that I spoke about it on Tuesday is a little bit fuzzy,

28
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:49,120
in part because it doesn't always ideally turn out that way where the client does know what information needs to go into this section.

29
00:05:49,660 --> 00:06:01,300
But if all things are ideal and you are an evaluator working on a project with a client base,

30
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,290
the information that goes here should be coming from them.

31
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,910
So. Activities, etcetera, etcetera.

32
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,230
Everything else is evaluator informed.

33
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:23,670
So when they when we get to focus evaluation design, we're gathering credible evidence that's evaluated or informed.

34
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,360
So again, we're moving all of the participatory aspects.

35
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:41,659
As an evaluator, you are the one that's kind of leading the information that would go into evaluation, design,

36
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,740
data collection, etc. But when it comes to logic modeling, that information is coming from the client.

37
00:06:52,610 --> 00:07:02,059
Now, again, with that said, in real life. So any of you decide to continue down this path, don't be surprised if you're working with somebody.

38
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,430
And they really don't. They don't really they know that they're elements of a logic model.

39
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:17,030
But your role is most likely going to be a role where you're providing some capacity building and some shape to what it is they've already.

40
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,720
What they're doing. I like to think of it as asking.

41
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:33,140
Wise questions so that a bit clearer that you're not making up this information.

42
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,440
Ideally, you're getting it from the client. Now keep in mind for the assignment.

43
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,820
It's a little different, but you'll be pulling information out from a source.

44
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,850
But I will again talk about that later. All right.

45
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,820
So just, you know, just to remind you, what's the goal of this particular step?

46
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,170
It's really to clarify all the components and then intended outcomes of the program being evaluate it.

47
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,480
And why is it important so that everyone's on the same page?

48
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:15,980
And also because this is what's going to drive the creation of evaluation questions.

49
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,730
Can't ask questions about what you don't at least have some understanding of.

50
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:36,060
On a Tuesday. We talked about me to address by the program stage of development and context.

51
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:43,130
These are things that would go and. This particular section of the evaluation plan.

52
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,100
Today we're going to talk about two through five. First.

53
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,150
We'll talk well on that first, but we'll talk about expect the outcomes.

54
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:08,260
So think of kind of a key framing question for this is what are the goals and objectives of the program that are expected to be achieved?

55
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,710
We'll talk about activities in a framing question for that.

56
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,480
What program activities are believed to lead to these expected outcomes?

57
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:29,640
We'll talk about outputs. So what are the tangible capacities or products produced by the program's activities?

58
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,940
And we'll also talk about resources or also known as inputs.

59
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,790
What's needed from the larger environment for the activities to be implemented successfully?

60
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:54,650
And one thing that I want you to observe, especially if you are new to logic modeling and feel a bit unsteady or are wondering How do I get started?

61
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,430
You can start here too. Two Developing outcomes.

62
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,430
Oops. Wrong way. And then activities.

63
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,230
And then you start to fill in a little bit more with the outputs and your resources.

64
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,270
On Tuesday, I ask you to think about.

65
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,580
Just to kind of let it sit and marinate in your brain.

66
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:33,610
The potential differences between a conceptual model of a program and then an operational model of a program.

67
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:40,300
Because today what we're going to talk about is that conceptual and that operational

68
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,380
and how they're similar and how they're different and how they work together.

69
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll give you the disclaimer that for the assignment, you do not need to create a diagram of a theory of change.

70
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:07,420
But I would highly recommend that you think through a theory of change in order to help guide you through the logic model development process.

71
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:21,020
So we'll start with a theory of change before you can evaluate a program or even plan the operational aspects of a program.

72
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,590
You need to have a basic theory of change.

73
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,150
A theory of change is exactly as it sounds.

74
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,980
It's a conceptual model of how you expect change to occur.

75
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:44,010
So at its most basic sense, what it does is that it will articulate a problem being addressed.

76
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,590
Then it will show you what staff can do so those activities.

77
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,040
And then they will show you what they expect to get or achieve from those activities.

78
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:04,430
So those outcomes. Here is a basic a very basic theory of change.

79
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,680
So you can kind of see it in action. And I thought you were going to have the light.

80
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,990
You made me say, okay, fine. So problem.

81
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:27,270
So the problem here. You're, you know, put put your public health professional hat slash health educator hat on.

82
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,270
You see a problem. Parents are struggling with children to get them to eat nutritious foods.

83
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:43,520
Johnny is not about that broccoli. Or Susan is not about those Brussels sprouts, even though they're absolutely delicious.

84
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,720
Um. But. Here you are a professional.

85
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:56,830
You've been trained, so you know that you can do something. So as a professional, you're going to do this.

86
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:04,840
You're going to, as part of your organization, offer skill building workshops are working with kids at mealtimes.

87
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:15,780
And then your theory is that if we offer these skill building workshops, parents will have the skills they need to support healthy eating.

88
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,850
John is eating broccoli. Susan's eating brussel sprouts is super awesome.

89
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,700
So right here, you already have. You.

90
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,370
Now this is the basic theory of change. But then you can take this information and feed it into a logic model.

91
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,660
You got two outcomes right here. You got your activities right here.

92
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:48,899
You got your problem. So theories of changes in logic.

93
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,790
If we do this, if we provide these activities, then we should see results.

94
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:05,220
So here's an example of a theory of change that is more closely aligned to what you would see formally.

95
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,490
So you can see that there are some strategies at the top.

96
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,590
And so this might pertain to the strategy of an agency.

97
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,780
For example, it might be food gatherers.

98
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:30,320
And they have to gather gatherers has specific strategies to make sure that the community is eating healthy.

99
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:37,360
So or, you know, so, for example, let's say they are providing workshops.

100
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,410
Or actually strategy will actually be more.

101
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:52,940
Broad. So. So that. It's more like providing education.

102
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:03,379
And the reason why theories of change try to stay broad at the strategy level because it allows you to the

103
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:10,460
room to be able to identify any number of mechanisms by which you can provide education to a community.

104
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,300
If I'm providing education, I can provide.

105
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:25,630
You know. Well, sure I'm not. And I'm by the way, I'm not claiming that any of these things are actually effective in themselves.

106
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:34,840
If it's one thing we've learned over the years is that giving somebody a brochure is probably the the least thing you can do.

107
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:47,470
And the effects reflect that. But anyway, so there's a strategy that says Workshop, I see your face.

108
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:55,190
It's supposed to say Workshop. My handwriting is your life.

109
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,660
But as I say, Evan, it did look like an E, too.

110
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:07,880
But you provide education so that community members know.

111
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:24,570
Or community members have knowledge. And so that they intend to eat better.

112
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:38,450
Then they do eat better. So that they are healthier.

113
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,070
Now. Yes, that's, you know, a bit simplistic.

114
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,150
But. What I want to make sure that you understand is that what the theory of change is

115
00:16:54,150 --> 00:17:03,630
doing is really digging into the theoretical aspects of the programmatic work.

116
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,540
If you were developing a conceptual model, you would have evidence for this step.

117
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,480
You have evidence? Right here, too.

118
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,520
So how do I know that providing education leads to community members having knowledge?

119
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:34,000
Then now have evidence that humanities members can have knowledge about healthy eating.

120
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:44,160
And so on. So I'm continuing to kind of work through not just the boxes, but my evidence also relates to the aerials as well.

121
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,180
I know that if I if humanity members have knowledge.

122
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,120
That that will connect me to intending to eat better.

123
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:05,000
So that's what your theory of change is doing. This example, by the way, is from Annie Casey.

124
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,640
I got too excited. They just put this out. I was like, Whew. If I had known about it, you probably would have read it for class.

125
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:22,730
But unfortunately, they just put it out. A nice, nice informational brochure about theories of change.

126
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,049
So one thing I just pointed out, programs, theories of change.

127
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:36,050
Rely on evidence to support your model. You are saying that in evidence?

128
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:45,290
You know, ideally it is peer reviewed evidence, but sometimes you are also working with problems and new solutions.

129
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:54,650
But you still should have some type of evidence, whether it is observational or exploratory work.

130
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,180
That's saying. I think this is going to drive this.

131
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:09,530
Some type of documentation or justification that says this makes sense.

132
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,730
The theories of change also help clarify core elements of the program strategies.

133
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:26,810
Say. For example, I say and this happens a lot in public health, we make jumps way too fast.

134
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,590
So say I, they're providing education.

135
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,760
Leads to healthier eating. Well.

136
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,570
It's not that simple. That's what we've learned in public health, that it doesn't go that fast.

137
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,460
So working through this process helps you check your assumptions.

138
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:59,169
And theories of change, for example, have also helped us learn that it's not as simple as saying,

139
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,430
If I give you education, you will eat healthier, you will have knowledge.

140
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,760
We've learned that there's all kinds of other mechanisms that are and factors that are operating.

141
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:23,570
So doing that process kind of helps you unpack what connections you are seeing in terms of outcomes and your path to outcomes.

142
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:31,100
And then finally, it helps parties groups better understand where to invest time and resources.

143
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,210
For example, if I learn. That.

144
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:46,140
Yes, we we've provided education for years and we haven't moved the needle on healthier eating.

145
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:55,610
Maybe there's another strategy we need to. We need to also kind of engage them.

146
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,150
And so I provided the example of food gatherers.

147
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:07,889
One thing they've done is once they realized that it just wasn't about and I'm not saying this in a negative way,

148
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:15,230
that they're partners of mine and I really love them. But even they would say that in the years of operating,

149
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:22,040
one thing they learned is that it's not just about making sure the food is there and providing education on how to prepare it.

150
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:30,780
They advocate for. Solutions related to.

151
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:41,420
Social determinants of health. So they know they have to advocate for better working conditions or at least

152
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:48,090
endorse those types of social determinants or social determinants of hunger.

153
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,160
Actually, for them, they specifically say of hunger.

154
00:21:54,110 --> 00:22:02,780
So they adapt their strategy because they realize that they need it to also put some resources and some time and

155
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:10,640
to addressing the social determinants so that it wasn't just putting a bandaid on what's a more complex problem.

156
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:16,370
So that's why we do our theories of change. They help us be able to think through that.

157
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:27,510
Once we have a theory of change and again for the project, I would advise you to kind of come up with a base,

158
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,749
you know, under make sure you understand the basic theory of change.

159
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,590
You don't have to write the entire review around it.

160
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,630
But we use that information to start building a logic model.

161
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,700
And logic models are operational. I can't look at.

162
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:52,180
This outcome map. But I can't help but clean up.

163
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,000
I can't look at this outcome map and know how many staff do I need?

164
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:06,419
How much? What resources do I need to, you know, implement a program?

165
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,410
And in fact, I can't look at this and tell you what the program is at all.

166
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,190
I can tell you what outcomes I'm expecting to come from it.

167
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,190
So your logic model is going to start to fill in some of those other operational aspects.

168
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:33,080
So it's a visual way and a systematic way of presenting, perceive relationships among the resources you have,

169
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,380
the activities you plan to do, and the changes or results that you hope to achieve.

170
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,920
And give a more detailed representation of how a program is supposed to work.

171
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:55,240
If a logic model is done well, then completely somebody should be able to pick it up who is, for example,

172
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:02,920
replicating the program and have a really pretty good idea of what they need to do to operate the program.

173
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,700
Logic models get used both in program planning and program evaluation.

174
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,760
And I'm going to give you the disclaimer that to me, they all are just part of the same continuum.

175
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,390
So if language gets fuzzy, I'll try to catch myself and only talk about it in the context of evaluation.

176
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,830
But they really do get used in planning.

177
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:43,000
So when you're developing the program and then evaluation, regardless of where at what stage of development, that evaluation takes place.

178
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:52,960
So some things, some ways that logic models are used in planning, clarifying programs, strategy and goals.

179
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,680
So again, thinking about the theory of change model,

180
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:08,340
identifying the most that desire or most important desired outcomes that we can't achieve always the outcome,

181
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,030
all the outcomes that would eliminate a problem.

182
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,170
What we're trying to do with programs is mitigate.

183
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,930
The problem. We're trying to find ways to lessen the less than the magnitude of it.

184
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:37,770
So logic models in the planning stage are helpful for that also helps us identify required resources and partnerships.

185
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,020
This is where it's particularly helpful to kind of start at the outcome state or

186
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,719
outcome level of a logic model and walk backwards because it allows you to see,

187
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:58,890
oh, well, I say I'm going to serve 500 youth, but my budget, if I'm going to actually do that, this is the budget that I need.

188
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,230
And then finally it lets you it lets you set priorities and timelines.

189
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:15,360
How long, for example, is it going to take in program land to an implementation land to achieve the outcomes that you are seeking to achieve?

190
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,900
You know, again, if you say I'm going to provide workshops to 500 youth.

191
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,030
In their hour long and the groups are only ten people each.

192
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,270
Well, then, I've got to think, for how long is it actually going to take me to do that work realistically?

193
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:50,080
So the logic model through that process is helping me say, okay, why realistically, if I want to get through these 500 students at ten people a pop,

194
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:57,400
that's going to take me, whatever the math is, if it's an hour long workshop, I can do the math today.

195
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,820
That's how we use it when we are planning.

196
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:14,370
And I wanted to just point out is that sometimes even if you're working in the field, you'll get questions about.

197
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:23,590
The terminology and whether or not this terminology is in the planning world or the valuation world.

198
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:38,540
So your answer is both. Ideally logic models are being created before the program is implemented.

199
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:46,070
So ideally it's happening in the planning stage. Realistically, it can happen across the board.

200
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:56,480
I've created logic models for programs they have not existed yet and are part of a grant proposal proposal.

201
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:04,850
I prepare logic models as the program was going and I prepare it logic models for programs that have ended.

202
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:17,410
Again, ideally. Logic models are where appropriate, are done beforehand.

203
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:27,360
I won't make it more complicated because not all situations and not all programs, especially systems change initiative.

204
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:31,959
You can't really create a logic model for something before those for those

205
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,900
types of efforts because they're constantly in flux and responding to context.

206
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,490
But let's, you know, keeping it at the public health, individual level, program level.

207
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,989
Ideally, you're doing it beforehand. In evaluation.

208
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,310
We use logic models basically to tell us what we're evaluating.

209
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,610
So what questions should I ask? What?

210
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:09,560
Where are there areas and points of access for data collection that won't be too much of a hindrance to program staff?

211
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,790
I'm also well determining when the collect data.

212
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,740
Do I do it after this series of workshops, for example, or do I do it at the end?

213
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:32,230
So the logic model helps me have a picture of what the program looks like in its full operation.

214
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,700
So I can insert, if you will, the the evaluation into it.

215
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:43,110
Yes. So are you talking about lots of models right now or are you talking about you?

216
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,890
When you're doing the evaluation. Model.

217
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,820
Yeah, it's the same. It's the same tool, so same logic model.

218
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:03,550
But why we, how we use it is differently based on whether or not we're coming to the space as a planner or an evaluator.

219
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:17,340
Yes. Will we ever use it two times for the same client?

220
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,390
Yeah. I think of logic novels in some ways as a living document.

221
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:33,889
So, you know, if I especially if I have like a long term relationship and engagement with the client, will make a logic model and revise.

222
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:41,660
It will go, you know, they might go through a iteration of their program and then revise it at the end.

223
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:57,960
Yeah. Yeah. So like a formative, like, you know, intro assessment and then, um, like a final assessment.

224
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:06,270
So, you know, I used it that way for one project where they, I interviewed the staff, we created a logic model.

225
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,890
Then they and I walked with them through that entire year of programing.

226
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,660
Then we all kind of revisited the logic model at the end.

227
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:26,010
And you know and it's not also I should point out there's also not in stages is like.

228
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:36,069
I can use it for evaluation and planning at the same time helping them, you know,

229
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,860
for example, figure out how to plan for the future or how the plan, how they expand.

230
00:31:43,450 --> 00:32:01,100
And I can do that while I'm collecting data. It really just depends on the means of the project.

231
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:10,220
So if the project is supposed to be for an evaluation, generally we will make it for the evaluation purposes.

232
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,000
Sometimes you get an error and it's like, Oh yeah. Or like just.

233
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,240
You know, kind of doing something. And I'm not saying in a negative way. That's how I grew up in the nonprofit world.

234
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,510
People were just kind of like, There's a problem. We got to do something.

235
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,890
Let's, uh, make some workshops, let's go.

236
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,660
I mean, you know, write some, ya know, and that's not a bad, I mean it's not a bad thing, it's just is right.

237
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:43,170
Like you see a need, you want to address the need, especially, you know, more grassroots programs but.

238
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,960
So the the needs of the project kind of dictate which way you're using it.

239
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,330
But again, you can use both of them at the same time. Or both of those.

240
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:05,330
You know, you can use it for all those reasons at the same time. So what are some characteristics of useful ones?

241
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:14,930
I like this comic because. Again when you are.

242
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,760
Coming from the perspective of there are some problems in this neighborhood and I need to just get to work,

243
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:27,430
that this might be the logic model that emerges.

244
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,950
Or it just might be an issue of formatting too. So.

245
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,260
That's another thing is the formatting easy to read?

246
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:47,480
So a useful logic model one is going to actually display those logical links in some form or fashion.

247
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,150
It could be arrows. It can be just the way it's laid out on the page.

248
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:03,890
You know, we in in the US we read left this is don't tell anybody left or right after I have to do this sometimes light left.

249
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,380
I think I was in the dark before I really realized the difference, and I have a confidence in that fact.

250
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:20,010
Logic models should also be simple. They may detail, but visually they really do need to be simple.

251
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,120
And so sometimes the simplicity can kind of mask the complexity that's underneath.

252
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:33,240
Remember that this is a tool that's meant to help inform a process.

253
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:44,550
So. You may work. You may be in the position where you need to say, hey, I know that there's you know, there's.

254
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,650
Aspect of responsiveness to your programing. That's okay.

255
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,809
You don't have to not respond to needs when you see them.

256
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,500
Just because the logic model doesn't doesn't reflect that.

257
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:06,180
You also want your outcomes to be measurable. Oh.

258
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:18,479
I mean, especially if you are doing this for evaluation that the outcomes need to be written in such a way that you can actually again look at

259
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:28,950
the logic model and know and have a sense of what type of measurement you need to do to say that this program has achieved its goals.

260
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,110
Much like the if there is a change, they use a if then logic.

261
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,070
If we have these resources, then we can provide these activities.

262
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,350
If we provide these activities, then we can produce these outputs.

263
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,940
If we produce these outputs, then we can secure some outcomes.

264
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,530
And then if we secure outcomes, then we can contribute to impact.

265
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:13,470
Unless you are just like the the best program planner ever, no one program is going to completely make an impact on a problem so that it is solved.

266
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,770
So I put, you know, contribute to impact.

267
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:24,919
And so when you're modeling impact. What you're talking about is what is the counter?

268
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,030
What do you estimate the contribution of this program will do?

269
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:37,170
They'll make more sense when I show you that example. So what are the basic components?

270
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:47,260
And please feel free to ask questions as I go. Especially when we get to outputs.

271
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:55,300
So your inputs are your resources. Those are resources that are available to you.

272
00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:00,430
Dedicate it for the program and or use by the program.

273
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:07,720
So anything you can think of and these are tangible and at times intangible resources,

274
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:15,370
examples of tangible resources, money, infrastructure like buildings.

275
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:27,210
Program materials people. And tangible examples might include relationships.

276
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,300
Reputation. Longevity.

277
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:40,850
So actually I probably will relate to reputation, but whether it's tangible or intangible,

278
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:46,820
the idea is that you can draw from that to be able to help the program go.

279
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:58,800
And then that takes us to activities. So what activities are we going to do with the inputs in alignment with the mission?

280
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,300
Ideally a program should relate to the mission.

281
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,120
If your mission is serving youth or relates to serving youth.

282
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,230
Ideally, the program is not serving.

283
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,320
Adults. That's straight forward.

284
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:28,819
So as an evaluator, that's a check because you can say, hey, you know,

285
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:34,760
your mission is you serve this neighborhood, you serve the west side of Ann Arbor.

286
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,490
But there's a lot of participants who are in Ypsi.

287
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,330
Is this program. One you should be doing.

288
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,970
Do you have the expertize or the reputation or the.

289
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,230
Access that will help your program be successful.

290
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:02,700
So after you look at the activities it takes you to, outputs and outputs are tangible.

291
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:16,110
They are tangible deliverables or products that have come out of the program and it is framed in reference to program participants.

292
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:29,010
So. Blank number of participants receive a workbook related to healthy eating.

293
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:38,640
Blank number of people learn or spend or receive, rather.

294
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:44,930
Receive 5 hours of instruction on cooking healthy foods.

295
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,830
These are tangible products that can be counted.

296
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:59,840
And what they're doing and what the outputs are doing is linking you to the outcomes because the activities.

297
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,660
Have something that come out of them. They don't just automatically lead to outcomes.

298
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,820
Wouldn't it be possible to have a. Output.

299
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:24,510
Download. A different level of intensity. So can you have any tangible outputs?

300
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,420
You could. I mean, there could be a program where you would have.

301
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,460
Relationships be an output.

302
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,790
You just need a way to. That. A survey or I could say like mental health.

303
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:52,750
I mean, how do you. So it's it still needs to be something that is.

304
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,170
Coming before the outcomes and not.

305
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,960
Any kind of change in condition. So.

306
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:10,370
For example. If you modeled relationships as an output, that's not the end all.

307
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,290
Be all is simply a product that's going to get you to whatever outcomes you've modeled.

308
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:28,610
So the only example I could think of is, for example, if I were evaluating like a coalition and I wanted to know do members.

309
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:40,700
Like part of the you know, the objectives is that members of that coalition develop a network that allows them to.

310
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:53,430
Partner on grant opportunities. So the partnering on grant opportunities, that kind of purpose of the relationship is what I consider the outcome.

311
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,110
But then in order to get that, you have to have a certain amount of relationships.

312
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,410
So that's when it would become an output. Yeah.

313
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:13,620
And so really it really is meant to kind of close the gap and prevent that jump from activities to outcomes.

314
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:24,270
Sometimes there aren't a lot of outputs, but generally what you're modeling is outputs are the number of parts like numbers of.

315
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:34,320
Number of participants. Number of hours.

316
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:43,380
Number of, you know, you could do number of relationships is usually a number or some type of thing being counted.

317
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,980
Like I misplaced my clicker. Outcomes.

318
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:05,340
Outcomes are those immediate or just generally specific measurable changes in program participants level of functioning.

319
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,149
So this is where you start to see the change. So your outputs that are the outputs are not changes.

320
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:16,500
The outputs are simply products that are the start of change.

321
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,400
And then finally impact.

322
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:31,200
That's a fundamental intended or unintended change occurring in organizations, communities or systems as a result of program activities in general.

323
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,260
It's within 5 to 10 years, and this is kind of a public health way of thinking about it,

324
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:44,160
where we're playing the long game in change in terms of changes in population health.

325
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:59,020
You might also see this and other. Fields like economic development, where the where the change, where there is a long game.

326
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:12,800
You got to play the long game. What you see here is actually kind of a very kind of basic logic model.

327
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,760
But you can accommodate more complex program designs.

328
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:28,330
And all for the purposes of public health and the type of especially individual

329
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:33,130
level programs where the change is meant to happen at the individual level.

330
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:40,750
It's helpful to kind of start to parse out the outcomes, especially.

331
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:51,440
And complex modeling, for example, like this really helps agencies think through the social problems that they're addressing.

332
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:59,930
So up here, the system conditions part of it. Just think of that as the problem, the problem in the context.

333
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,270
So again,

334
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:14,750
it helps agencies think through what they're addressing and the mechanisms by which they expect their activities to lead to that long term outcome.

335
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:24,780
And that long term impact. So the model that's on this slide.

336
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:31,690
The way we conceptualize of short term, intermediate and long term outcomes.

337
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,600
You're sure short term outcomes are immediate outcomes from the program's intervention?

338
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,330
So, for example, learning. You know.

339
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:51,720
90% learn something. 90% gain knowledge about.

340
00:45:53,050 --> 00:46:00,430
Something. 90% have a more positive attitude toward something.

341
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,170
Your intermediate outcomes are changes and actions.

342
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:10,570
So this is your behavior and actions and behaviors and practices.

343
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,580
80%. Do something.

344
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:21,770
80% apply a skill. In something.

345
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:33,990
And then finally, your long term outcomes are changes and conditions stemming from actions, but specifically only in the program population.

346
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:37,440
So you're the people that you are working with in that.

347
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,080
And that at that specific time. So.

348
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:49,610
70%. Continue to do something, for example.

349
00:46:51,140 --> 00:47:01,520
And so what? Parsing the outcomes this way helps is especially if you're like applying theory, you might, for example,

350
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:15,770
be evaluating a program that has that has used help believe model or theory of plant behavior where there's

351
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:26,140
very specific steps and constructs that lead you from knowledge to behavior and maintaining behavior.

352
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:35,660
And parsing outcomes also is helpful to understand how you're going to get from the outputs to the larger social impact.

353
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:47,430
And I'm looking for something. And then they actually write down on the idea.

354
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:52,890
I wrote down the impact. I want to go back to impact because.

355
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,750
Impact is a little different than long term outcomes.

356
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:05,360
Something that I see very commonly is that long term outcomes and impact are blended and honestly.

357
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,560
You know, you're going to continue to see it.

358
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:18,920
But technically what your long term outcomes, your long term outcomes only apply to the program participants those who are actually.

359
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,570
Actually. Ah ah. Have participated in your program.

360
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,620
That's why we use the word program parties, program population.

361
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:40,630
That population, that group is different than those who would be eligible or being targeted for the program.

362
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:49,750
And so think about it this way. So. If Ann Arbor has like.

363
00:48:53,290 --> 00:49:00,050
500 k youth. And Ann Arbor.

364
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,860
But so that when I model impact, I'm modeling impact on that number.

365
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,280
But that's not you know, I'm not offering a program likely to 500,000 youth.

366
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:24,580
I might only be a model and I only have the capacity to offer to.

367
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,980
100 youth. Every year.

368
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:42,200
That. Is who? I'm writing my outputs.

369
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:56,760
Through my long term outcomes to. And in public health.

370
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,410
When we are modeling programs.

371
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,800
Ideally what we're doing is contributing to impact.

372
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:13,390
So I also am attentive to thinking about okay, if I say want to.

373
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:20,000
Reduce. So I want to reduce.

374
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:27,989
HIV infection. In Ann Arbor.

375
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:34,110
You? By 5%.

376
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:49,870
I've got to do the thought process to know how many youth do I actually need to work with?

377
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,610
Oh. In ten years.

378
00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:02,650
How many how many youth do I have to work with every year to try and make a ten year impact?

379
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:12,229
On a program. So if we might if we're aiming for like some kind of impact, we should start there.

380
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:18,620
Like ideally because, you know, ideally we, you know, can ask for as much money as we want to to run a program.

381
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,080
And so ideally, I would start here. Unfortunately, that's not the world we live in.

382
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:33,510
So often times we're starting here. With the outcomes and then modeling the impact going backwards.

383
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:38,830
Does that make sense? For the assignment.

384
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:45,880
I'm not really expecting you to model impact because it just a little bit it's just a little bit further down.

385
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:54,720
I feel like we need to go in the class. But I will, though, be looking to make sure that when you write out outcomes.

386
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:00,370
That they're reasonable for who you're serving.

387
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:09,310
Like it. So if you say something like reduce HIV education or reduce HIV infection.

388
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:18,040
In Ann Arbor. You've. Then my question is going to be, oh, so you're serving in all of Ann Arbor.

389
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:28,910
Um. So you're and then you're at it, and you'll make it more targeted toward the youth that you are able to serve.

390
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:48,760
Yes. If.

391
00:52:50,970 --> 00:53:03,230
Also that some. Good idea. And just because in public health, what are our programs are like?

392
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:10,660
Our interventions are really driven on the ideas that we're trying to create, create some or elicit some population level change.

393
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:18,030
So, you know, so, you know, I always say in public health, we don't care about people.

394
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,059
We care about groups. So we're looking at a group.

395
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:29,010
We're looking at what's a problem for groups, and we're trying to knock that down at a population level.

396
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,710
Whatever the population is, it could be a city, it could be the country, it could be the world.

397
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,479
And so. If we had.

398
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,530
Yeah, we had as much money as we could have.

399
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:51,930
Then we would start at impact because then we would just develop the program around that goal.

400
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,560
But unfortunately, that's just not the way our world works.

401
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:08,060
Yes. Where I didn't hear the first part of the program overall, though.

402
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,950
Programs. Why?

403
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:18,500
While I. Yeah. Yeah, stuff.

404
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:18,790
Yeah.

405
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:30,340
The program goal, the program goal and impact are often tied together so that the impact is providing some shape and some specificity around the goal.

406
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:42,340
Yeah, that's a good way of thinking about it. Any other questions?

407
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:57,000
Okay. So, have you built this thing already? You know, I mentioned it's helpful to start at the outcomes.

408
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,780
And then identify activities that will bring those changes about.

409
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,850
And so that kind of helps you get that basic theory of change down.

410
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:20,560
So remember, your theories. Your theories of change are basically what activities are you doing to get what outcomes?

411
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:29,010
And that's why I say it's helpful to start with the theater change model, even if it is a most basic model.

412
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:50,290
Sorry. Recording. I'm thirsty. Um, after you do the activities, then that's a good place to start thinking through the resources.

413
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,920
What resources do you need to be able to do those activities?

414
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:01,780
So hopefully, like you start to see this is kind of where that operational aspect comes in.

415
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:11,830
I mean, in addition to the activities and making those more specific, um, you know, starting the plan around what resources you need to be successful.

416
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:18,990
And then finally you are identifying the outputs which will produce the outcomes.

417
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:29,610
So for example, if you are if the staff are presenting presenting information and.

418
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:35,360
The outcome should be that participants learn how to do something.

419
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:41,810
What's the tangible? Evidence that they gained knowledge.

420
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,979
They were sitting there. They might have been sitting there for a certain amount of hours.

421
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:55,160
They might have gotten the workbook, etcetera, etcetera. And it's helpful to use smart guideline.

422
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,520
So in the reading, one of the readings was about smart guidelines.

423
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:06,930
You want to be specific, what's your goal? Well, the subject of the goal, what action is being performed?

424
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,440
And that's just a way of saying, be specific, what's happening?

425
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,460
What's what's it doing? What are you trying to do?

426
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:24,900
The next thing is that you want it to be measurable. So how much change are you expecting and what's the initial reference point?

427
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:31,460
What were the indicators that you were going to be looking at and measuring?

428
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:40,310
You also want it to be achievable. You know, in part this relates to specificity.

429
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:44,630
Is your goal attainable within a given time frame and resources?

430
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:53,350
For example. If you only have one month to implement a program.

431
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,260
It's probably not feasible or realistic that you are going to.

432
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:06,170
Work with everybody in the in the county or work in every school district in the county.

433
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:14,660
So is it an achievable goal? Obviously, you have usually have more time than that realistic.

434
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:21,650
And this is also related to achievable given the time, given the external constraints you might have.

435
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:28,490
Is it realistic? Are you, for example, is this a goal of, you know.

436
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:40,640
Instructing. Youth in Washtenaw County to learn how to all use condoms.

437
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,970
How to. Okay.

438
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:56,210
Let's just leave it at that. Condoms. But part of the county is super rural and against all forms of comprehensive sex education.

439
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:01,180
So that's the kind of contextual factors that you're thinking through.

440
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:09,150
And then does it accurately reflect the scope? Generally there's some scope that you're working with them.

441
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:19,890
And so whether you know, some boundaries that you're working in, do the components that you're putting in that logic model fit within that?

442
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:28,180
Scope might relate to funds, for example. And then finally, what's the time frame for a completion or measurement?

443
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:39,900
Specifically when it comes to your longer term impact and your impact for longer term outcomes and impact.

444
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:55,290
And as you might imagine, especially when you are adopting a CRE approach to evaluation, this process is going to be participatory.

445
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,940
And various people can be involved. It could be.

446
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:08,110
Community members. It could be. No program staff.

447
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:16,600
It can also take place in stages. You might, for example, start with staff, develop a logic model,

448
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:23,290
do the work of confirming parts of the logic model with program participants, and do revision.

449
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:33,420
Why? Because. Valuable insights really do come from speaking with different groups.

450
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:37,530
So ideally it's not just program staff, even if it's.

451
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:45,270
Program. Administrators who are taking a look are also contributing to the conversation.

452
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,980
It also helps everyone kind of get on the same page.

453
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:57,000
Sometimes organizations, they really like to have a facilitated logic model session.

454
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:03,850
Later on this semester, I get to fly to Boston.

455
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:08,360
They buy from Boston. Or Connecticut or.

456
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,260
Actually, it's Connecticut I thought was Boston. You are.

457
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,080
You heard of it? Okay. I'll say, cause I like Boston.

458
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,879
Like, I'm not going to make you mad at me, but I get to go there.

459
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,670
Yay. Um, but actually, I remember it was Connecticut.

460
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:34,960
It's not Boston. But they want they specifically just want a retreat where they do logic modeling because they're not on the same page.

461
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:40,490
So they acknowledge that. We don't even know like you might think.

462
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,430
I think that person thinks the programs we do are for this.

463
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,940
You know? You know, they are over there, especially because we're working in the remote world,

464
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:59,940
that there's also decrease opportunities for informal discussion that kind of contribute to that shared understanding.

465
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,350
So this process of building the logic models is really not just so they can present it to funders,

466
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:14,420
but also so they can say, we all understand this program to be doing this, this program to be doing that.

467
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:21,270
And all of these are part of our larger strategy. And as I said.

468
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:26,070
But the Fort Box group works to develop, test and refine program logic.

469
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,680
So they they are living documents.

470
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,830
You may model it, find that some assumptions were incorrect.

471
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:43,590
You can remodel it or revise it so that it more accurately reflects your understanding.

472
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:49,920
Or even if the program changes, you can reflect those changes in the logic model document.

473
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:58,090
So what are some benefits of using logic models?

474
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:08,410
As I mentioned, it helps to build an understanding and consensus among investor parties so it can be used as a dissemination,

475
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:19,030
um, dissemination product as well to community members, for example, who might want to know what's this program?

476
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:25,480
It enhances accountability by keeping invested parties focused.

477
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:35,910
You know, evaluation, again, is about accountability. And what drives it is our organization's.

478
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:42,350
Or those implementing a program, are they being accountable to those that they are serving?

479
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,890
And truthfully, it's often required by funders.

480
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:56,390
So. We do it. It's helpful for them.

481
01:03:56,810 --> 01:04:01,050
It's helpful for us to. Sorry. Do you have time for.

482
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:08,360
To show you this logic model. And again, it's the example is in your folder.

483
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:14,740
So. You, even if you don't have it with you right now.

484
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,960
I put it up this morning. Don't feel like you have to try and write everything down.

485
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:26,930
But I do kind of want to show you how. I thought through this logic model.

486
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:35,450
Or at least how the some of the principles I'm talking about are reflected in it.

487
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:44,970
So here you have a city or a problem city A they have an infection rate that is three times the state average.

488
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:51,450
And the community does not trust the public health professionals who conduct HIV prevention interventions.

489
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:57,510
They don't like them. And I know you. I think you're just telling me this.

490
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:07,170
That's not uncommon. And then and this is based off of a program that I actually did and.

491
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,190
So. It's it's not.

492
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:19,710
It's very feasible. Let's just put it that way. Although I've made up the numbers, the context.

493
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,600
So why don't maybe they don't trust the professionals?

494
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:31,740
Because of this, 80% of public health professionals in Syria come from and reside outside the community.

495
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:40,110
And even though there is a local university that has a very lovely public health department and they offer scholarships and everything,

496
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:47,700
only 5% of the high school students in that city go to the university, much less are major in public health.

497
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:55,320
So they don't have. So they have two problems. They've got a high HIV infection rate.

498
01:05:55,950 --> 01:06:06,540
And then they also have a disconnect between public health and the community or communities that are in the city.

499
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:16,739
So the organization that does this program, so they have certain inputs or resources and you can see some of these are tangible.

500
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:21,300
Some of these are intangible funding from a foundation that's always good.

501
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:26,850
The organization's been around a long time and has a positive reputation.

502
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:39,059
They've got community campus partnerships, so they have access to researchers who would love nothing more than to pull up data, do research,

503
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:49,980
etc. And then they again have this local university with this lovely public health program that locals have no interest in so far.

504
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:57,180
So they decide to design a program with kind of a basic theory of change,

505
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:07,380
that if you expose high school students to public health and offer them a practice in it, they'll become interested in public health.

506
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:17,070
And the other basic theory is that if teens are the ones talking to youth about HIV infection, that they'll listen to the teens.

507
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:23,880
So two basic theories of change. So in response to that, they do two things.

508
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:29,489
They provide a daily summer program with two staff.

509
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:36,750
So two staff are coordinating this program where students learn about public health.

510
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:43,799
And because they also want to make sure that the people who are on the ground most

511
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:50,490
immediately are familiar and have a relationship with this high school students.

512
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:58,080
They're responding to the trust. Two summer college interns that actually come from the community.

513
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:07,690
So then what are the outputs? So I recruit, you know, as staff, and I'll talk through this as if I'm the staff.

514
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,800
Just to make it simple. I'm.

515
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:19,650
You know, recruiting 20 students to participate in this program over the summer.

516
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:26,130
They complete the program five weeks. So see the specificity in the time.

517
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:33,120
Then they create and implement a project, an outreach project.

518
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:42,120
So that tells me if I'm staff picking this up, I need two staff or I need another person and I'm going to recruit 20 students.

519
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:52,640
Then those outputs are tangible evidence of the start of this chain of outcomes.

520
01:08:53,500 --> 01:09:00,630
One. Short term outcomes. So the Sunnis of students walk out the door for the last time after that five weeks.

521
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:05,430
90% of those students should have learned new information about public health.

522
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:10,130
80% of those students should have learned about HIV prevention.

523
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:16,940
I'm assuming that there was probably 10% that were laughing or 20% that didn't want to listen to what I had to say.

524
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:22,010
But then notice when and. But again, specificity.

525
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:28,600
80 and 90%. And then note there's a drop when I move from short term the mid.

526
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,220
Why? Because there's always a drop. There's always attrition.

527
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:41,140
Especially when we go from knowledge or attitudes to behaviors.

528
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:51,090
We just know theoretically you're going to see that. So I estimate 50%, 50% of students.

529
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,270
So I started with this 20. Now I'm down the ten.

530
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:00,300
50% of students follow up with community organizations about shadowing a public health professional.

531
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:06,990
70% of those students increase their engagement in HIV prevention behaviors.

532
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:11,730
So most, you know, think about it this way. I'm connecting these two right here.

533
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:18,660
And these I'm connecting. Remember, part of the benefit is thinking through this logic.

534
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,280
So if I got short term outcomes, there's going to be some mid term outcomes.

535
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:33,200
And then 50% of students. So not all the ones that changed their behavior, their their individual behavior.

536
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:38,810
50% of the students are going to share some information with a peer after the program's over.

537
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:46,920
That connects to that. So then what's going to happen next?

538
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,480
Well, again, another drop. So I get to the long term outcomes.

539
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:58,110
So I saw that you got that ten. But I started with 20.

540
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:09,780
Now only 30% of those 20 per year are going to express an interest in majoring in public health and actually go to the university.

541
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:15,600
So what's that? What's the math on that, Tom? Uh, six.

542
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:23,730
Six per year. So I started with 20. Now six of them per year are going to go to the local university.

543
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:32,820
And. 50% continue to engage in HIV prevention behaviors.

544
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:41,979
So again, see the drop. No, no, no.

545
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,880
Drop here. That's nice. So everyone's. Everyone's still talking.

546
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:53,810
I don't know. But. So part of the logic that you're thinking through is where might there be a drop?

547
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,720
What do I estimate the drop to be? You can find that from peer reviewed evidence.

548
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,110
You can find it from experience.

549
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:09,820
Sometimes if you have a program that's been running for a long time, they have data to support where the drops happen.

550
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:24,320
Yes. You can put the time on the longer term outcomes.

551
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,570
It makes sense. And you can sometimes.

552
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:31,970
Sometimes people will put time. Especially if.

553
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:38,090
They're using this for evaluation. So instead of just saying.

554
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:46,350
50% of students follow up what community organizations, blah, blah, blah, they might add.

555
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:53,620
By. Six months. After program.

556
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:59,220
So as an evaluator, I now know. Guess what? There's a measurement point right there.

557
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:05,070
See, I got my measure six months after the end of the summer or end of the five week program.

558
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,810
I got to at around that time ask them. How many of you have shadow?

559
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:18,840
And program planners will use the time as well so that they just know the follow up.

560
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:28,380
Yes. It's a program we wanted to follow up like a year on.

561
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:37,910
Oh. What about over the phone activities?

562
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:44,690
Is is the follow up part is that a programmatic follow up like they come?

563
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:49,070
Do you mean like the students will come back and do like a refresher program or something like that?

564
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:56,880
So. If if the follow up is kind of like a second.

565
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:04,810
Second stage of programing like it's meant to have some therapeutic effect and create additional change.

566
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:08,950
I might model that as a different program.

567
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:20,530
So one example where that's common is in youth mentoring programs where because especially now the evidence suggests that the

568
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:26,350
high school students you mentored and the awesome programs where they came on Saturday morning and learned a lot of stuff.

569
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,800
When they get to college,

570
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:36,090
it kind of washes out of their hair because it's a much more intimidating environment than Saturday morning prepare them for.

571
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,140
So mentoring programs are increasingly adding college success.

572
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:46,750
So the follow up is actually its own program, where the high school students,

573
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:52,110
who are the ones who are eligible, the ones that participate, are the eligible ones for the college success.

574
01:14:52,920 --> 01:15:01,500
So that's an example. But if I'm just following up, just to know, did they continue or maintain change now, I'm not going to model it separately.

575
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:04,710
I'm just going to add it in here. So, you know.

576
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:09,680
Yeah. In the same way that I just added this one. Right. The six months.

577
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:17,730
I would add it to one of the outcomes. The question.

578
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:23,000
So think about that. And I want to point that out.

579
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,560
What you're modeling here are therapeutic components of the program.

580
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:33,530
Yes. If staff are coordinating a daily program.

581
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:37,040
Yes. They're going to have to hire these interns.

582
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:43,070
Yes, they are going to have to gather materials.

583
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:54,660
They have to rent space. All the obvious logistical things that are part of running a program but are not therapeutic.

584
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:04,950
Those all need to go in there. We're really just talking about those that connect to the theory of change.

585
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:14,450
The game. It does get tricky. You have to think about, is this activity meant to actually make a change?

586
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:19,450
According to the theory. Change, yes. So about.

587
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:36,420
The kind of. Yeah. There they are arbitrator for this example but the how you assessed the numbers you set the numbers based on.

588
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:43,660
Data or evidence or some other form of evidence. Peer reviewed articles.

589
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:49,770
That might have implemented the program and they.

590
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:54,100
Brought out what they. You know, what they saw.

591
01:16:55,260 --> 01:17:07,330
Epidemiological data. If a program has done the program, like done it before, and they've seen what it generally looks like.

592
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:11,390
You get that, too? And that's valid evidence.

593
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:21,360
I mean, if they know every year, you know, they lose ten people between short term and mid-term, that's ballot evidence.

594
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:28,830
So you should account for it. So you and it's also just about estimating.

595
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:35,370
I'm not expecting for the assignment, though, you know, not the disclaimer at the bottom.

596
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:44,620
I'm not going to expect you to model actual numbers. It is again beyond the scope, but.

597
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:55,500
I think. Learning more about epidemiology is really helpful for public health professionals to kind of know what goes,

598
01:17:56,310 --> 01:18:03,480
be like, what's the math and processes and formulas behind all that data we like to quote in our in our report.

599
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:18,560
That can help you think through. And so just now over here is the time, over seven years, 10% decrease, 10% of high school students.

600
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:26,010
That's based in you know, the assumption here is I've done some math to get from.

601
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:35,850
Long term outcomes. The impact. So any questions before I go on to.

602
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:40,990
But I think that's the last slide before the assignment.

603
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:43,390
Any more questions about logic models?

604
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:55,860
And I will warn you, if you've never done this before, the outputs are going to be probably be part of the hardest part for you, you know.

605
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:59,920
So as a group. Stay strong.

606
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:04,750
You'll get through, I promise you. That's why I always have a logic model draft assignment.

607
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:10,030
Which speak in which logic?

608
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:15,070
Model assignment. So. You may have through one assignment.

609
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:21,870
And now it's time for another one. This assignment is due September 29th.

610
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:29,360
It is part of the final evaluation plan. So remember I said that you have a final assignment.

611
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,260
It's an evaluation plan. This is a draft assignment.

612
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:39,060
That will go eventually into the final evaluation plan.

613
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:45,810
And so that means that this is a group project. If you have not connected with your group.

614
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:57,110
I encourage you to do so. Day. Unless you all have some other arrangement for only one person is doing it.

615
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,530
I'm.
