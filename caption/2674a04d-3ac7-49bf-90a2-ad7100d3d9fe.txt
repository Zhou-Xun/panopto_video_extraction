00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:08,668
Hello and welcome to Coursera, mini instructor guide. To access your course,

2
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:18,478
log in to Coursera with Umich credentials. Once you have logged in to Coursera, with your Umich credentials, on the top right corner,

3
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:26,268
you will see your name with a drop down menu. Click on your name and select Educators admin.

4
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:32,538
So once you have selected Educator admin, you will see your course tile here.

5
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:38,988
I have, you can see on my screen, I see all the courses because of super admin access,

6
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:50,748
I have access to all the courses. You have as an instructor will have access to your only course.  Say the course to access your course.

7
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:57,468
I will show you an example. So this is what you see on your screen and you have access to your course.

8
00:00:57,468 --> 00:01:05,138
This is your course tile. Go ahead and click on your course tile.

9
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:11,198
Once you have clicked on your Coastie, you will see different sections for your.

10
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:18,528
If this is your first time, you will see this session died here.

11
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,408
You will see all these vision as well.

12
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:29,708
Original vision if you and there will be a good side which will say, of course, name and the session which is on.

13
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:34,598
To access the coast, click on this.

14
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:51,248
Once you have clicked on this section, you are in course as an instructor and this is how the course is set up and in the back.

15
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:55,478
This is remember, this is your admin. You are not alone.

16
00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:02,258
Now, you can do a lot of stuff in here. The course is already set up for you to do.

17
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:10,508
And we see the sequence of the items in which they are.

18
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:18,158
The first thing is this is the course description of Fox, not the course description.

19
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:26,888
This is a model description box. This is where you fill a short model description for for a particular week,

20
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:37,508
which is usually one model is one week no learning objective, which will already be set up for you in the in the course.

21
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:46,328
First thing, which you need to know is that you can change the sequence of the item by just dragging and dropping.

22
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:56,828
Go to the left hand side of this item. You will see this hand marker simply press and you can move this stuff like this.

23
00:02:56,828 --> 00:03:03,338
This way you can change the sequence of the item if you wish to change it at any point of time.

24
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:12,228
Now, the second thing which you need to know is with all the coaches will have a syllabus item like this,

25
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:16,798
of course, syllabus once you click on the school syllabus.

26
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:26,548
And this is where the students will see students, would see the students just click on this link and it takes them to the top.

27
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:33,738
This is how they access to Philip. Let's go back to the.

28
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:40,128
Now, I know that you know that you can move the items up and down and change the sequence.

29
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:44,688
Let's move to the other part, which is which would be useful for you.

30
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:53,388
That is resources. Now, you see here on the left hand side, there are two type two menu items.

31
00:03:53,388 --> 00:04:03,678
One is asset library and one is ResultSet. I said library is what we see as an admin in the back end, students don't see.

32
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:15,048
They only see resources, so. What is the difference is basically asset liability contains all the assets in the polls, whether it's a video,

33
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:24,438
whether it's a beating and stuff like that, so how to use and access to the forces for the student?

34
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:32,868
They thought it was a space where you can provide supplemental materials to the students or you can say to after this session,

35
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:39,888
you had mentioned that you would like to give them a reading you can add to the resources section.

36
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:47,628
So resources you click on and resource and then there comes up an item, which is a new resource.

37
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:59,658
Click on the edit item. You have to protect the title to this and then you hit this button.

38
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:08,808
You can add a PDF or if you want to write something and you may remember that even if you add something here,

39
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:24,448
the space asks you to write subtext so you can write something like that once you have a written hit publish.

40
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:33,628
No. You see here someplace else to deliver this, just simply click to Spot.

41
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:45,018
So whatever you put in the resources, there is one point here that students don't get notification when anything is published in the.

42
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:51,088
So if you are publishing anything in the resources for the students to access for them to work on,

43
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:57,148
send them an announcement for them to see that something has been added to the source.

44
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:07,678
This brings us to what I mentioned announcement similar to can with you can send out the announcement of students on the platform for that.

45
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:15,898
What you will do is go to learners, step 110 learners, select announcements.

46
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:22,498
Once you're an announcement, you will enter the subject here and write the body of the announcement here.

47
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:30,358
One drawback here is that in this platform, the announcement speech, you cannot attach files.

48
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:37,258
So that is why we mentioned that if you want something for the students after your phone session or anything,

49
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:46,168
which is not already on the platform in their sequence of content, you are them that in the resources and send them an announcement from here.

50
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:53,588
This is how you send the announcement that the second creature you will use the most.

51
00:06:53,588 --> 00:07:02,268
Next comes the important feature, which is creating not to create your items.

52
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:08,598
This is how you will go to creating this is creating.

53
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:17,988
And this is where you will see assignment grading manager and operating formula has already been set up.

54
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:26,998
You don't need to worry about that rating formula. You need to work in this type of assignment.

55
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:32,638
OK, now this is a course which does not have any submissions right now.

56
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:37,528
I will go to another post which will show which date.

57
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:46,288
I will show you how you can play it. Excitement's.

58
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:55,188
Take, for example, this. Discoursed Spring, Summer and winter 21, let's let's go to this section of this sports,

59
00:07:55,188 --> 00:08:04,008
because this has, um, assignment something like click on this type of grading.

60
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:10,408
Yes. You see all the tabs here, um, assignment leading you to many different reading formula.

61
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:17,688
Click on assignment grading. And you will see a list of all the assignments here.

62
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:25,908
Say you have to grade this assignment. This is a staff graded assignment and there are quizzes as well, so quizzes are autocratic.

63
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:31,818
You don't need to worry about quiz items. Quizzes are, by default, autocratic.

64
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:37,498
All the assignments which are staff graded assignment, you will have to correct them.

65
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:43,308
So we have to get this assignment, which is lab assignment one and click on this one.

66
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:48,258
I select the students. We have to wait for this student.

67
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:56,678
I click on the student's name. And this is how you will see the submission.

68
00:08:56,678 --> 00:09:06,338
This is the submission by the student, by the student as a document, you will see these two options give inline feedback and points.

69
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:11,708
What do you think? This area might vary depending on how we have built the rubric in the assignment,

70
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:18,538
but mostly it will look like this where you will be able to provide points for the assignment.

71
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:25,768
Now, what does this do? You can see here that you can provide points and then you'll be able to comment,

72
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:32,408
give inline feedback is a feature which you will use to provide comments, detailed coverage.

73
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:36,618
So I click on Glueck, inline feedback.

74
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:45,438
And what this does is this opens up the submitted assignment photos of the student right here on the platform itself.

75
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:52,728
So by using these tools so dispensable, I can you can annotate at any place.

76
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:55,508
Right. And then.

77
00:09:55,508 --> 00:10:07,948
By using this common box tool, you can provide particular places once you have done that, you can click to save Button and all those annotations and.

78
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:16,518
Will Bisek, so you've and you've provided feedback, you've provided the point once you have done these things,

79
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:23,648
you hate to say, but once we have hit the button, the point will be saved for us to get.

80
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:29,738
Now, this while we're talking about this Groody,

81
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:37,688
there's another thing which we need to know is that grading on Goldfeder is done in terms of percentages.

82
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:40,598
You see here the student test scores, five or five points.

83
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:46,658
That is hundred percent say there comes a situation where student test scored three or five.

84
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:57,158
But student challenges the grade. You agree they should be increased, so you simply cannot change the points on the platform.

85
00:10:57,158 --> 00:11:03,308
You can change only the percentage in which the student has scored.

86
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:12,848
To do that, you will have to do it on this edit button you see here, assignment rate is 100 percent safe with 80 to 90.

87
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:19,718
So you'll have to calculate that. How much is the percentage of of the change and then want to change this thing.

88
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:31,468
And you hate to say this, but once you have hit bottom button there, you will have to this point in the game to make the final change.

89
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:37,188
This is how you will clear the assignment that you see this.

90
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:41,298
Despite this menu item here, items tipping exceptions,

91
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:51,238
this you will use to provide exceptions to the students of accommodations so some students need.

92
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:56,368
Extension for an assignment or is the number of attempt you will click on this

93
00:11:56,368 --> 00:12:01,978
item setting the exceptions item deadline currently is this you will change it.

94
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:10,948
And or if you want to change the maximum number of attempt, this is where you will make the changes and hit the button again.

95
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:16,328
So this is how you will create the assignment.

96
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:23,148
And once you have granted all the assignments for the students, you will be on this page to this assignment,

97
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:35,948
one you have created for all the students here, what you need to do is select all the students from this checkbox and click this icon.

98
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:43,028
And click this make great discipline once you have selected that, it continue.

99
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:50,708
What this will do with this sweet release the play to all the.

100
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:55,868
Next is. Great book,

101
00:12:55,868 --> 00:13:09,148
this great book manager is the space where the careers are being calculated continuously as you keep on treating the assignment for student.

102
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:24,328
Now, uh. This you can use also to export a sheep, which you can use to upload in the animal protein axis.

103
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:29,998
You can make changes to the date from here as well, right?

104
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:34,828
You want to change the you don't want to go into the assignment for a particular student.

105
00:13:34,828 --> 00:13:41,038
You can change the training aspect of it.

106
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:46,468
This isn't great that this is updated continuously as you keep on creating

107
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:51,628
assignment assignments based on the training formula just keeps getting updated.

108
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:56,488
Now, what I mentioned was you can export this great produce in the Pilbara next year.

109
00:13:56,488 --> 00:14:04,048
What you would do is you will click on this icon, which don't add up to is export.

110
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:07,978
Once you click this, it will generate an Excel sheet for you.

111
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:18,478
And you can use that, too, if you want to use that right away to help both the grades on the next list, you can use that.

112
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:28,858
Or you can. As you can see in this course, there are only four students faculty might have done just upload to create manually in the indexes.

113
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:38,448
This is how you use. Next is.

114
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:51,638
Settings that the settings menu. This when you once I click on this, this is where you will see all the items listed at the site,

115
00:14:51,638 --> 00:15:00,518
say you want to change the deadline of the assignment for all the students, you will come to settings, to the assignments.

116
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,298
You want to change the deadline for this assignment.

117
00:15:03,298 --> 00:15:16,518
You click on this edit icon and select the date time, whatever you want to change the assignment to save and then hit the save at the bottom.

118
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:25,138
OK, so this is how you will make changes to the timeline of the assignment.

119
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:28,548
You can make all the changes to the availability of the assignments,

120
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:37,498
it's an assignment you want to hold on to for a little straighter because you do not want students to take a look at it again and say,

121
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:47,788
if this is this is the assignment you choose, you click on the spirit. I can select availability, you make changes and then you save one to save.

122
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:59,858
Here you hit this button, OK? Let's go back to the content.

123
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:08,618
Another aspect that you need to know is see, as I mentioned, you can add content readings to the resources section,

124
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:15,098
but there's another way with another way or place you can add the content if, say,

125
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:25,068
you want to add another reading to a particular week, what you will do if you click on this reading and.

126
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:34,368
This will add a new computer, you click on the the McCain, you come here, you keep this title to the title,

127
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:43,068
you come here, same as you attach the patch to the document and then publish.

128
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:49,388
Do not forget to publish. This is what saved the item for the students to feel.

129
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:58,528
And while we're talking about population, one thing to keep in mind is that once you publish, the item cannot be unstoppably.

130
00:16:58,528 --> 00:17:02,738
So if you want to make change to something, you will have to leave that item.

131
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:11,438
How you will believe that? I can say you have that long document here in this building and you publish unpublished.

132
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:19,568
You will have to delete this item from here and create a new.

133
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:23,998
So you can see here, this is how the.

134
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:37,828
Is one last thing which we need to take a look at is look, you know, we will see by clicking on this, you will see how the students view the content.

135
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:44,818
This is what the page looks like. So is the overview page, the big one?

136
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:54,838
And they see all this content in the in the sequence which we have set up in the basic assignment they see over.

137
00:17:54,838 --> 00:18:09,208
Do they see the due date and all that good stuff? Let's go back to the.

138
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:19,438
Another thing which you need to do on the platform once you have access to the platform, is set up your own section to set up the zoom section.

139
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:27,698
That is, you will go to learners, you will go to life events once you are in life event.

140
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:35,008
Let me go to another quote to show you how this works.

141
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:38,828
The to to events.

142
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:50,948
Now, you will see this battle meeting, when you click on this actual meeting, you will be guided to step by step through statute of limitations.

143
00:18:50,948 --> 00:19:05,688
You will also be provided with a document which guides you step by step to schedule your sessions on this platform and you can refer to that document.

144
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:13,158
So these are the important things which you should know to maneuver your course while the course is running,

145
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:23,208
if you have any questions at any point of time for you to reach out to our e-mail address, which is SBX instruction at Humiston.

146
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,137
Thank you.
