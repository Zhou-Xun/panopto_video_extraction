1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:26,370
As soon as I got a problem that he was like, I feel like she had the reasons for doing so.

2
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,470
Right. Yeah. Hey.

3
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,720
Good afternoon, everyone. You are looking for the policy for 513.

4
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,660
You're in the right place and hopefully section nine because there are two policy loves on Fridays.

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,500
So we will get to it.

6
00:00:51,570 --> 00:01:05,130
So today we're just going to do an overview of how policy will go and there's going to get an idea for the policy Section nine.

7
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:14,740
Okay. And it'll just be a review of the next upcoming assignments and weeks.

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,250
So hopefully will be useful and we can leave a little early today.

9
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:32,670
So my name is T.A. and I'm a first year agent piece, but I have some background with working at the CDC and with the Lucile Packard Foundation,

10
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,230
which is the fundraising arm for the Children's Hospital at Stanford.

11
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,180
I am pursuing HP not because.

12
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,710
Like I really love it. But because of that, I think I like it or not.

13
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,630
But I'm not, you know, I don't know what I want to do. Maybe consulting, maybe in health care administration.

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,890
We'll see. And then, yeah, that's good.

15
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,200
So we are going to I think this room is small enough that hopefully we're going to know each

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,300
other by the end of the semester and at least or four of us or with our groups anyway.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:22,950
So if we could go around and just state your name, pronouns, apartment and then share what you're looking forward to learning about this class,

18
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,080
what you intend to pursue, and then any topics you're interested in.

19
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,250
And then I, uh, go ahead and do it.

20
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,760
The, uh, the roster here.

21
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,390
Um, so do you see your name? And we'll do alphabetical order.

22
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,710
I think some of the easier. So is all the structure is.

23
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,730
Yeah go ahead and just my name is on Michigan.

24
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:04,110
I remember you and and I'll probably have a favorite day which is in a school of information.

25
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,559
And um, basically I'm an interactive student so I didn't know much about the US and because it seems so out of this class,

26
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,250
um, I want to learn more like around the US information works,

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:23,090
but it seems like policies and the improvements that are in the U.S. and therefore I think, uh,

28
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,420
I hope we'll learn a lot of that in this upcoming lecture because we will be,

29
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:38,400
there will be like role playing, like the U.S., like yourself or class management person.

30
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,550
So hopefully we will write some address on it.

31
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,800
Are you there? What about Amber?

32
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,120
What about Amy? And then, um.

33
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,680
Andrew. Which one? Yeah. Okay.

34
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,099
What you want to do, so is say your name or department or pronouns or she's like,

35
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:17,100
and then what you're hoping to learn from the class or what and what you intend to pursue for your career and health science department.

36
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,540
And then of I have no idea when this thing you know what I know you want me to thank here.

37
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,290
Oh we're going to learn today. I just I just want to start my earlier 2 seconds.

38
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:39,959
Um, I just want to slow down that I have a fellowship and stuff like that.

39
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:49,890
But I mean, email is set up and you should I'll give him a thank you for discovering the one sex teacher in the class.

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,739
So now there are so and I want to say thank you for that.

41
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,950
But anyway, welcome and have a great weekend making sure I'm okay.

42
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,460
Yeah, that is totally fair that you have no idea what to expect for this class because I really just know that this is,

43
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,540
I think, a requirement for fee for your program probably.

44
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,320
But hopefully we're all going to get away with learning something about college.

45
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:26,890
You got to help me. I like her world, but totally fine.

46
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,310
Fine. Please join us. We're just getting started with introductions, I think.

47
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,700
Okay. Next we have Benjamin. Are you here? Yes, I am, Ben.

48
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:51,510
And now? Yes. And it all sounds over to the other.

49
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:02,250
Oh, God. You think it's interesting? I, for one, did not think, Miles, that was interesting when I had to take it.

50
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,700
So there are the stories interesting for you. Oh, all right.

51
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,139
Burnley. Yes, Burnley. My name is from the church on the site.

52
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:21,270
Your student in the E, Christopher Edward. And I am excited for this class because I feel like we don't learn about health care management.

53
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,260
Like even the policies that go into that or even just how I feel divided.

54
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:32,910
I feel like most of my information is just through personal life and anecdotal, so I'm interested in just learning the foundations of that.

55
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,620
So then it's like you're burning something and then leave.

56
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,740
But yeah. Firmly, yes. Um hum.

57
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,960
Um hum. Yeah. Um hum.

58
00:06:50,590 --> 00:07:00,050
And I still have no idea how to get there.

59
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,880
Love the honesty. Yeah. Christina.

60
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,070
I'm Christina. I'm a second year here in the department.

61
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,250
I suck. So I'm. I'm, like, filled with this class.

62
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,810
To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of policy.

63
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,730
You know, it's like a very political I live in Switzerland, but this hospital going outside my comfort zone, which is always good.

64
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:33,170
It is good. I like what Bernanke says it just a whole lot of policy unless you an environmental health promotion, a policy concept.

65
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,120
But yeah. Thank you, Christine. I appreciate the honesty.

66
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,129
Daniel okay,

67
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:54,610
so my name is Daniel of the Scorpion and then I intend to learn more about the previously unknown since bruises and then start a new life.

68
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,910
It's important to show that health policy is actually very effective.

69
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:07,420
Okay, great. I welcome. And we'll definitely, like analyze some cases that whether or not we thought it was effective.

70
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,620
And so we'll get to that.

71
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:22,659
Thank you, Daniel. David. Hey, guys. I'm David. I'm here and grown out in a second year student and I'm excited to break down different

72
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,540
policies and kind of take a big policy and turn it into something more concise.

73
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,939
Yeah, let's turn it into more something more concise.

74
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:46,300
Yeah. So, like, take a big policy and kind of be able to explain to like a fifth grader something that I'd like to work with that uh oh, I think.

75
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:58,060
Oh, yeah, those part. Yeah. Okay. My father also works for Secretary of State in the Human Compensation Program.

76
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:09,340
Yeah. Ideas she heard from. Can you share what you're looking forward to learning to sponsor your career path you want to go into?

77
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:24,610
I learned about this area before, but I'm quite interested because this semester also chose another example courses.

78
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:37,020
Yes, we are in that close together. Yeah we learn about management or what heard.

79
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,590
So Jason hi my name is Jason.

80
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:50,710
You see him? Pronouns I, him and DHS and H and I'm excited to learn about budgeting.

81
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,690
Okay. Okay. Yes, I think we'll learn more about those in the lecture.

82
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,340
That's the only on the syllabus. I'm not gonna say.

83
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,300
Definitely. I think that's all right.

84
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:27,340
Um, g you just, you know, Kate, Catherine and I are the first year in the program,

85
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,760
so I'm really looking forward to digging into some of the policies that hasn't really been taken out of us yet.

86
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:44,530
So I think can kind of I'm kind of, you know, just in the sciences, I'm really just wanted to learn about, you know, health systems and policy.

87
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:54,880
What do you think? So, Krista, Krista, actually, I work here, page two here in the chemistry department.

88
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,100
So I'm kind of interested in how the science, everything, I mean, first in going to physical chemistry.

89
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:08,200
So health care for you, it would be good to know how are you doing this as an elective.

90
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:16,800
And then Krista Kyra. I'm not surprised.

91
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm sorry. Excuse me. My name is Matt. I am a second year master's student in chemical biology,

92
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,380
but I'm doing the precision health method graduate certificate, which is why I'm here for this.

93
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,459
I'm interested. It's a lot of my background is like basic science,

94
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:39,410
but I am interested in kind of the more health policy aspects of things and then interfacing with it, but never actually working with it.

95
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,130
So right. Not Meghan and Meghan.

96
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:50,280
She her parents are no department of health care workers in general.

97
00:11:51,690 --> 00:12:05,759
Okay. Thank you, Morgan. I'm a first year and HPV and I've had policies just like in classes that have a policy class to the first semester.

98
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,910
I am so excited about that. Great.

99
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,300
Thank you for your excitement. Or.

100
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,810
Or you say yes. Naturally.

101
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,260
Sure. Sure. Okay. Hi, everyone. My name is Tricia.

102
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:32,249
I'm a first year MPH student in which, as I also use Sheena pronouns and I'm looking for I've never taken any policy classes in public health,

103
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,830
so I'm looking forward to the future.

104
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,260
Productive. Hi, I'm Rebecca. I'm a first year HP new student.

105
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,610
I'm looking forward to just learning about how public health policy and everything works in general.

106
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,460
Great for HPV. Yeah. What is going to be in there?

107
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,440
And then the health promotion and policy options. Okay. Remy.

108
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:16,740
Yeah, hi, I'm Remy. I am the second year industrial and hygiene concentration within DHS, MPH, and I use her pronouns and I am excited for this class.

109
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,080
To echo what Bradley said earlier, I just have never been exposed to the policy side of health care.

110
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,469
I've only seen the political side and with preventative medicine.

111
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,400
So I think it's great. Thank you for your excitement.

112
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,930
Sarah, I everyone, my name is Sarah and those are her pronouns.

113
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:47,430
I am a first year student. I'm with basic knowledge, the policy that I would like to avoid, but is potentially an attempt to avoid.

114
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:56,200
That's a fair statement. Thank you, Sarah. Sarah with an H is not here because she mocking Sophia.

115
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,889
Hi. I go by Sophie. Sophie. She knows I'm a first year MP.

116
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:08,340
Soon I'm looking forward to seeing how the health policy development process goes.

117
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,999
Yeah. Um. Hi everyone.

118
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,290
My name is Timothy. I am a second year student in the DHS program, and I have.

119
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:32,850
I've never taken a policy class before, and I like to learn a lot about how healthcare works in the U.S. is like, yeah, great one.

120
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,750
I really appreciate it.

121
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,680
Yes. Hi. Okay.

122
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:54,350
Hello, everyone. My name is Amber. I'm a second year dual degree genetic counselor and I'm taking well, I'm excited for this class.

123
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:04,950
So this is something again, like when I go on the clinical space out explore of the health system on a national policy standpoint.

124
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:10,529
Sonders In particular, I think, Amber, thanks for speaking up.

125
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm really excited for most of you saying you're interested in learning the policy side because

126
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:22,470
that is very much Sarah mentioned like integrated and inevitable in the public health space.

127
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,600
Um, so happy to hear your statement.

128
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,870
Did everyone get a chance to speak? Okay.

129
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:44,330
There's the green platform in. Oh no, it was I just clicked on your name and she said, oh no, no.

130
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:50,610
I, um, we'll talk about attendance in a bit, but.

131
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,780
But I'm not actually looking at it this way. Okay.

132
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:05,130
So, again, thank you so much for going over your names and introducing yourself.

133
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,610
I hope to learn one's name by the end of the semester. But so I will likely have to ask.

134
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,780
But your name is again next week, so you could just give me some grace with that.

135
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,340
That's a lot of names with not only professors in this position.

136
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,960
Yeah. Uh, so some general expectations, if you could.

137
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,740
If you're not going to be here in class, you could let me know in advance, um, through email.

138
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:46,419
That would be great. And then if you have any class related questions, please use the candidate's discussion board for any general questions.

139
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,580
Because if you have a question, likely someone else has the same question and we can benefit.

140
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,260
There's one because our arms are friendly. And then there's, um.

141
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,650
Everyone can benefit from asking a question and getting an answer.

142
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:12,310
So this is the policy lab so that the discussion section or public health 513 As you probably heard on Monday,

143
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:22,240
Monday's class will be lecture from Dr. Kennedy. And then, uh, Friday's class will be applying those lectures like the case that you read.

144
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,560
So it's a lot of group. It's only group work in this section.

145
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,540
Um, so really important to come prepared.

146
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,490
Okay. Read the case before class.

147
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,340
And then, as you might remember,

148
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:57,280
thank you for participating in the discussion expectations with the smaller groups on Monday because we are getting into policy situations.

149
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,940
Some topics could be unwanted.

150
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,600
Controversial buttons can bring up some discomfort among discussion.

151
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,319
So we do want to set boundaries and be respectful during discussions.

152
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:24,430
And these are some of the ways that you all came up with while we do that in this space on Fridays, I think just pointing out.

153
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,800
That we do want to give others an opportunity to speak and listening with an open mind.

154
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:38,459
I think it's really easy to be set in our own ways, in our thinking,

155
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:45,000
but we need to especially acknowledge that people think differently than us and respect that.

156
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:55,440
So an overview of canvas. Hopefully you all did the pre course assessment because that unlocks basically the rest of canvas.

157
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,160
So please be sure to do that assessment if you haven't already.

158
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:10,830
And then for two day, we're going to talk about what we are doing in this policy lab specifically.

159
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:18,460
So there. We each week, we're going to do a case analysis all in this class.

160
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:27,840
It's going to be grouping groups of 4 to 5, hopefully five, because I think there's 30 people in this class.

161
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:35,160
So each week we're going to come prepared by reading the case.

162
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,480
So. This is going to, like I said, be done all in class.

163
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:52,559
I want to come around and then I've never been in this class.

164
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,350
It's really the type of site. Yeah, something like this.

165
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:06,240
But hopefully it being tight can make it a little easier to do the group or in the class.

166
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,190
So there's not a propulsion lab anywhere. That's not going to be any like home where we can expect from this class.

167
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:18,090
Because everything, like I said five times already, it's going to be done in class and then the slide deck will be due shortly after class.

168
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,850
You do not need to do any external research you're going to have.

169
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:31,410
Then one group is just one slide that. So each group will submit a slide and then.

170
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:45,030
Yeah. Hopefully no one in the Wednesday section is going to for do their thing their clubs because it is very much subjective.

171
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,540
And it'll be pretty obvious if there's any plagiarism going on.

172
00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:02,910
But for case analysis, this is essentially what you will be turning in situation questions, hypothesis proof, action, and then alternatives.

173
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:12,540
We're going to go over this, but the actual deliverable that you'll be turning in on Friday will have six slides minimum,

174
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,590
and I would say no more than ten slides.

175
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,140
So we're not asking for a lot. We expect you to do it within the class.

176
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,390
So it'll be it'll be doable.

177
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,320
Yes. Just to correct the differences between this 515 section and the one that they're interested in scientism.

178
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:41,310
The difference is that you were assigned to this one and the GSI is different, but they are going to be doing the exact same work.

179
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:49,170
And then, as mentioned, the groups that you will be in will be in this class will also or will join those groups in the class.

180
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,290
And. Yeah.

181
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,320
So it's not like you can hop over because you'll be inside both groups, if that's what you're thinking.

182
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,600
Somewhat. Somewhat, yeah. So unfortunately, it's going to be done in this group.

183
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,990
Ah, you have. Hopefully. Or making friends.

184
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,590
Just like a clear vanquisher. Are the cases? Are these legal cases or these case like summaries?

185
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,310
I just have it in our. Yeah, great question.

186
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:37,050
So Professor Kennedy did or did release the case that you will be purchasing their mix of why they're not legal?

187
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,720
You know, I can't say that I haven't looked through all of them, but I don't think there are any legal.

188
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,800
It's not like I want to like. I think there are about 5 to 10 pages ish.

189
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:59,220
Okay. So not too dense, but it's essentially a situation that's happened in the U.S. And then reading through the we I think that,

190
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,400
you know, we have to buy the course back or and we just find all the cases online if you can.

191
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,560
So like, are they publicly available documents that they just put together?

192
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,920
So if you are an Internet sleuth, feel free to look at that.

193
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,590
Because for our purposes, we only need you to have the cases so that you can participate in these.

194
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,520
Like that's the only deliverable you will be turning in are the slide decks.

195
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,450
With that said, you can't do the slides without reading the case.

196
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,930
I don't know. They're available. On the Internet.

197
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,040
But they're available through Harvard Business, education, whatever.

198
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,470
And I think it's $50 per pack. With that said, we're going to be in groups.

199
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:51,960
And if you want to disperse the PDFs amongst your groups or amongst the class, I don't know anything about that.

200
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,479
Yeah. You're saying it's not appropriate for the whole semester?

201
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,970
For everything or for everything. Perfect for that.

202
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:08,730
Yeah. It's like. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:19,140
Like I said I don't know any like I'm not requesting you turn in your like it's a PDF after you buy it.

204
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,370
That's all I'm saying about one thing. Yeah.

205
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,670
You know, in many cases looking at over the course of the semester.

206
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:42,450
Great question. I do not, um, I'm not prepared to answer that question, but I think it's, I think it's on campus.

207
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:49,800
I mean, it's, it's at least ten, I want to say, because each week all we're going to be doing, they're going to do one case a week.

208
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:58,340
Yeah. Yes. I just I think that's that's hard work because like 14, 14 sounds right.

209
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,870
Yeah, but once a week. Thank you for that.

210
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:23,710
Okay. Yeah. So if you want to do some work, think the case based on the law of both the legal and the law that.

211
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:31,360
Yeah. So I'm going to go through that right now. What you're actually doing, what you're actually going to do for each case.

212
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:39,040
So this hopefully would be a lot easier next week when we are hearing a case.

213
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,490
But this is just an example.

214
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:52,090
But the first thing you're going to do for your case is you're going to identify whether it's a problem, decision or evaluation.

215
00:25:53,110 --> 00:26:02,889
And earlier on, I think Dr. Kennedy had shared on how to read, how to analyze a case which will be really helpful,

216
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:10,420
but that'll that'll define what a problem was, what a decision and what an evaluation is.

217
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,280
And then this section is only worth one point. So don't get caught up to too much on here.

218
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,020
Like I said previously, it's could be fairly very subjective.

219
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,470
And what your side that is going to be, you say it's a problem.

220
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:31,740
Just back it up with evidence. What's the problem? If another group says that's a decision, that could be right, too.

221
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,290
They could. They just need to back it up with evidence.

222
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,650
So on the slide deck or when you actually do this, don't just say a problem, period.

223
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:46,390
You have to say it's a problem because X, Y and Z and give evidence.

224
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,070
So, for example, let's say we read something about the opioid epidemic.

225
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:05,630
We're going to say this is a problem because between 1999, 2017, 400,000 Americans died from an opioid overdose.

226
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,500
Despite knowledge of the problem, it's the overdose deaths have been only increasing.

227
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,950
So that would be one slide, and that is how you would get through that.

228
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:24,290
And then you have the recurring questions and supporting contacts.

229
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:31,460
So these are questions you need to answer after you've decided whether it's a problem or decision or evaluation.

230
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:40,850
And then these are the are there any issues related to health equity and systemic racism that need to be addressed?

231
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:47,239
You want to focus on underlying mechanisms within the policy and management specific decision.

232
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,110
So you really want to be specific on this.

233
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,810
And again, no outside research is needed.

234
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:05,260
It's there if you'd like, but everything you're going to do is going to be based on the case and then your knowledge from readings and lecture.

235
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,360
So I. Um.

236
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:24,310
The health equity component is not optional. We want to have you dig deeper on why inequities exist.

237
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,970
So you can't just say this has some inequities.

238
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:38,500
Once, like, for example, if you say COVID has really exacerbated inequities in the United States,

239
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:50,890
give us your reasons why were more groups of four more certain races dying out more or higher proportions?

240
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,110
If so, give us that detail.

241
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:11,850
So this is just going back to the pretending that we read about opiate case would be an example of how a sentence you could have for the problem.

242
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,170
And then who is responsible for the problem?

243
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:30,580
Again, just hopefully I'll be more conceptual once we read the case and then these slides will be shared over the weekend.

244
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,830
I don't think I can let you go through that in your own time.

245
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:45,670
Read the hypothesis section is going to be the.

246
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,000
Bulk of your discussion, I think with it being worth five points.

247
00:29:54,170 --> 00:30:03,980
So this is going to be an issue where you state your recommendation.

248
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:09,830
If you think they could have done something better, tell us here.

249
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:22,720
And then. Really? For this hypothesis.

250
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,800
It shouldn't. Be a kind of just this could be better worded.

251
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,640
So instead of just saying improve physicians pain management training.

252
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,070
You could say it like training physicians on pain management.

253
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:54,090
We've been training physicians on pain management would decrease opioid deaths and then say why you think it would decrease opioid deaths below.

254
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:07,410
And then you have more examples of hypothesis C is from the slides.

255
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:16,490
So plenty of examples like the proof and action part of the slide.

256
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,190
It's the evidence you have to support your hypothesis, the hypothesis that you made,

257
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:30,780
and then you would discuss how you would implement the decision that you're going to recommend.

258
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,320
And so the proof explains your hypothesis.

259
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:44,660
And then the action is what you're proposing to solve the how you're proposing to solve the problem.

260
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,710
And there can be multiple actions.

261
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:57,450
Um, again, very, very conceptual right now I feel like because we haven't actually seen the case, but hopefully it'll make a lot more sense next week.

262
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,520
Lastly, we want alternatives and weaknesses.

263
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:10,680
I think in policy you'll find that whatever you're going to propose, there's always going to be opposition to whatever you propose.

264
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:18,360
You could say this will save a million lives for mothers and babies, and someone will be like, Well, that's too expensive.

265
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:28,050
So we really want to have you thinking on the other side and recommending to alternatives,

266
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:34,710
because you'll see that in policy or on the Hill they will start and they are then like legislators,

267
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:42,090
we'll start with like the pie in the sky, ask of what they want, knowing that it's going to be brought down and diluted.

268
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:56,910
So or just like that, please present alternatives to whatever you're calling because we need backup plans, essentially.

269
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:11,219
And then in addition to that, there would be a witness slide that just kind of assess what you're proposing.

270
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,760
And like realistically, we know that there are weaknesses and a lot of things.

271
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:22,770
So it's just having you look at the big picture idea, again,

272
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:34,860
this is a minimum of six slides that have the following six bullet points there and then no more than ten slides.

273
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:46,860
So regarding late work, each student is eligible for a one extension.

274
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:56,700
So say that you are not able to go to class and complete the group for your group will still do their work, turn it in without your name on it,

275
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:03,140
and you will be responsible for doing the case yourself in the slide deck yourself and you'll turn in a separate piece.

276
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:18,299
Um, and then you will be, this will be, you can do this twice for this semester.

277
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,760
So if you know that you're missing more than two classes for the semester, please let me know.

278
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:29,520
And we'll work with Dr. Phil or Dr. Kennedy to figure something else out.

279
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,680
But ideally this, like I said, running this is really focus on group work.

280
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,610
So when we pick our groups and then the class,

281
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:48,240
make sure that they're going to be there for your group because it's a lot easier to do this with more people, I think.

282
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:57,540
Yes. And then I will be holding one office hour a week.

283
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:08,480
And I just want to just see if anyone or a majority of you would not be able to come Thursdays 9 to 10 a.m.

284
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,560
I can't I know it's really hard with everyone being in different departments,

285
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,810
but if you already know, you can't please just like shake your head or you can.

286
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,850
Okay, you can. Okay. Wood Tuesdays three.

287
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,360
Or work better.

288
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:35,770
And then I just this is the general consensus that I want to put still might be these dates, but just because I have another section as well.

289
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:42,400
Scheduling is hard, but please, I'll be available through appointments if you need.

290
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:49,900
And then, as Dr. Kennedy mentioned, if we're going to last, she will also be holding holding office hours twice a week.

291
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,320
Oh. Um. And then please only attend either mine or Dr. Kennedy's office hours.

292
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,940
No, there's three other jazz eyes, but those are meant for their sections only.

293
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:08,300
And then that is also a reason why you're assigned to certain sections.

294
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,510
Yeah. Any questions so far?

295
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,310
Yes. So all the different sections of the slides that we did in class.

296
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,190
In this class, you said that all the information we need is in the case itself.

297
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:29,659
Like you don't need to branch beyond that. Correct. You're welcome to Google stuff, but all the information would be in the case file.

298
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:36,290
Is that so? Yeah. If it's not that, we'll go over it through before and before you all get into groups and we'll discuss.

299
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,130
Mm hmm. Will these slides be available for us?

300
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,770
Yeah, these slides will be available this weekend. Dr. Kennedy will be posting it all them.

301
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,220
And then before we sign up for groups.

302
00:36:49,730 --> 00:37:02,570
Just a note that for policy lab, please be sure you have your course pack available to you and actually do the readings before class.

303
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,340
Because like I said, we're only going to have 40 to 50 minutes in class and we want to be prepared.

304
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:13,579
I know with a lot of classes, readings are not necessarily required, required,

305
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:19,549
but for this class it is for the case study itself only to be done before class.

306
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:22,880
So it's super important that that's done before class.

307
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:27,580
Uh, yeah, great.

308
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:40,630
If everyone can go on to campus and then we will pick groups with working families.

309
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:58,520
What we want to know, and I think I could do this, I think it's useful.

310
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:08,840
This is an interesting I think they're just.

311
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,850
Yeah, exactly what's going to happen in that class.

312
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:31,010
That's fun. And I think if we make an important and very successful in this interview.

313
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:39,829
Okay. So if you go and some people and so on the course home,

314
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:44,020
if you go into the people and then if you go to in group there and your yours

315
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,970
might look a little different than mine because I have an instructor view.

316
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:57,620
But if you find the case analysis group somewhere within people's emotions and groups, you should see if you scroll pretty much all the way down.

317
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,260
Nine You should see Case Analysis Group. Nine and then Tam Dash Friday.

318
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,320
Please only join a group from Tampa Friday nine A through nine.

319
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:21,319
As I mentioned, we do have 30 students in here, so everyone's going to have five people in a group and these are limited to five people.

320
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:27,500
So if you all want to just form groups or randomly put yourself in a group and joins you.

321
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:37,129
Yeah, that's cool too. I know we have some people who are not here with us today, so they will be adding themselves in at a later point.

322
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:44,300
If you have four out of five students decided today or like four of five students already joined in your group today,

323
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,190
just expect the fifth one to be there by next week. Yes.

324
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,760
Are the letters assigned to a certain case yet? No.

325
00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:01,010
So we're all going to do the same case? Oh, yeah. So the letters don't mean much except for organization purposes.

326
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:14,270
You said Andrew. Yeah. Make sure has TAM does Friday nine eight through nine because story B is German satisfying we knew from.

327
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,160
I don't know. I do? Yeah. I hope I didn't.

328
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,830
Yeah, I don't think I am.

329
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:46,740
But, you know, I, I us on the money.

330
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,720
I would say. Yeah, like, you know, I'm not letting.

331
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,340
Oh, you know what I'm wondering?

332
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:18,270
Are you sure? Because it looks like to me and thanks very much that we were going to do because I was like,

333
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:28,950
Yeah, because maybe we can switch to plug and play new switch to anytime.

334
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,820
And I'm just thinking, okay.

335
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:45,660
Yeah. You know, in case we're doing, you know, we're doing the same people, you, we're all just one group, which is both group is doing so.

336
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,300
Yeah. So I figure like everyone in 530 is doing the same test.

337
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,680
So even in the other room. Yeah, even in the other rooms. So why do we have to buy the whole course back?

338
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:59,340
For only one case, for the whole class? Yeah, I mean, I do know what I mean.

339
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,010
I mean, as an instructor, I can just say that the course pack is available to you as a student.

340
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,990
I know what you mean, and I'll leave it at that. So do we know what case we're doing as a class?

341
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,170
Yes. Dr. Kennedy has posted the case.

342
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,860
Okay. That you need. And it's $50, so.

343
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,120
But it's $50 for a whole set of 14 if you're willing to use one.

344
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,430
No, no, we're going to use all four. Okay. Yes, sir.

345
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,030
So, okay, as we go through each week, we'll be a different case.

346
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:35,910
Sure. But the class, everyone in 513 will be doing the same case.

347
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:41,820
It'll. It's the same court stuff for everyone. Gotcha. And so the ether and anthrax, that's the different case.

348
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,890
No, that doesn't mean anything. I'm just trying to figure this out. How this is organized and why this.

349
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,190
So there's 14 cases, let's say. Yeah.

350
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,720
And so there's 14 leaks, let's say.

351
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:59,309
Correct. Every week we do a case together. One group is assigned to leave the case.

352
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:04,440
Or this section? No. So within your group, you're going to do your own thing like that.

353
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,500
So you go back and you're the term. Whatever you join 99 being.

354
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,620
Okay. Okay. Okay. So there's five people in your group total not going to hear about you.

355
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:21,540
Each Friday you will come to class prepared by really doing the three, reading the case, and then working on your slide deck.

356
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:28,350
Sure. The only thing you're turning in is a slide deck. Sure. I don't know if you have your old cases.

357
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,680
I got you. I got you. Okay. Okay. So you're at the end of the day,

358
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:39,990
you're going to receive five different sets of slide deck from the five groups that are working here on the one case from the court in case one,

359
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,510
you know, six because they're 30. Sure.

360
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,670
So different slide deck six slide decks at the end of the day.

361
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:54,780
Okay, I got you. So a lot of redundancies on your end.

362
00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:01,240
Well, like I said, it's very subjective. And one case is one group can say that this is a problem.

363
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,090
Another can say, listen, it's going to be different from this and it's always going to be in this room.

364
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:16,710
Yes. Okay. So while we're working on the slide decks as a group will be in this room when we come back.

365
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:23,030
Thank you for the question. And then the one that I got into it.

366
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:29,009
Yeah. Okay.

367
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:34,470
Has everyone assigned themselves in a group? Does anyone need help picking a group?

368
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:47,910
Listening. Okay, great. Like I said, if you are only 4 to 5 or two out of five, please stop your group to be filled by them by next week.

369
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:55,050
And then that is all I have for you all today. And I will. We have a milk Monday, so there's no lecture.

370
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,580
But we'll see you on Friday. Thank you.

371
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:05,340
Let me introduce my group by. Let's go.

372
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,990
You ready?
