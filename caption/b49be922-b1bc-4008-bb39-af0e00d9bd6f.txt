1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:13,200
And not seem to be able to really talk like that.

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,770
Like me.

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,620
Hi. Hello there, Professor.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,010
Back at you. Good to see you. Oh, my goodness.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:44,640
I can go in there and Ryan, give me a thumbs up if you can hear me, okay?

6
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,440
I mean, I know what you mean. You joined us.

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:11,940
I just want to make sure you could see the screen and you can hear me. I need your hands to talk to your thumbs up in the chat.

8
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,630
Thank you. Television.

9
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,550
Okay. It's going to be a sparse class. I know that. I'm ready.

10
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:32,370
I know there's a career expo going on, and I think it's going from 4 to 6 today for many of your classmates.

11
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:41,010
So I think if we're going to have sort of a sparse class, but we'll we'll get on with it and we'll have some recordings going forward.

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,799
I will turn off the music here after we do sort of our icebreaker, but crank cranking up at this one the other day.

13
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,100
So I thought I'd share it with this poor creature hitting iceberg.

14
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,360
What happens next remains to be seen. But that's great.

15
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,230
That is not to say anything about anybody's religion. We're not going to do that.

16
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:09,509
But it was just funny. And then I've been into bad jokes and you can't read them on the bottom.

17
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,130
But what they say is that I hate my job.

18
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,610
All I do is crush cans all day. It's soda pressing.

19
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,040
I it's bad. So, you know, it's corny and it's going to go there.

20
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:41,870
And then the other one is and all of the inventions of the last hundred years, the dry erase board is the most re remarkable.

21
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,299
Got it. Okay, good. Very good.

22
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,620
Had to share in sharing them all day. And my colleagues have been just really killing me with bad jokes in my email.

23
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:08,970
But there it is. And so for the icebreaker, we kind of got a smaller group, which is good billion dollars to $5 billion.

24
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,320
And without the obvious of calling an accountant and an attorney and a loved one, what would you do?

25
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,940
But you do it with $1,000,000,000.

26
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,090
And I almost wanted to add a little extra on there and say that was public health related.

27
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,560
But I don't I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do I want you to spend it the way you're going to spend,

28
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,100
because I'm sure I got money, so I'm going to start over here, billion dollars or so.

29
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,490
And then I would buy my parents a house that I was doing and others will buy a bunch of houses in different climates.

30
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,329
But I was like, the only thing I don't want.

31
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,360
And then I'll be like sort of like know like a scholarship program.

32
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:22,350
Like I have a mortgage finance and I'm thinking of thinking about good times, as simple as anything else.

33
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,430
So, I mean, with $1,000,000,000, I'll do whatever I feel like doing.

34
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,220
Yeah, I was just curious. Okay. Yeah, that's cool.

35
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,690
I'd be smart with it.

36
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:47,730
Trying to be somewhat like reasonable lifestyle for that is a lot of that but not not only like people at but also not have to worry about.

37
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:59,790
I really do do stuff that's more enjoyable than versus more money driven like a career that would be maybe more fun instead of financial they were.

38
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,269
Got to get to work one day a week. It's a great question.

39
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:21,940
I mean, I would love it if I had a retirement period and then build a duplex in my home state and then probably my house.

40
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,669
And my second is $1 million.

41
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:35,390
Where do you go to do this? I'm going to hiring a manager to manage her wealth manager.

42
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:44,470
Very good. What's the latest? What's the second part of the interest now in use the interest from the wealth.

43
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,940
Look it to keep the man in the bedroom. Yeah, that's fair enough for me.

44
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,810
Okay. All right. Burning billion dollars. What are you doing? Uh huh, yeah.

45
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,220
I couldn't spend a billion. I tried. I don't think I could.

46
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,380
Yeah. Steer loans, house parents, take care, everyone. And, uh.

47
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,100
And then he's. What the reason I probably give as much as they put away the Gates Foundation,

48
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:16,930
maybe [INAUDIBLE] pay off my mortgage pretty good if my husband's doing well.

49
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,950
Okay. And then probably pay off, like, my family's, like, mortgages and just they have houses.

50
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,700
And then probably the same thing as the interest,

51
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:37,569
like I would put it in the bank and then or some kind of investment that would yield high interest rates to reach billion dollars,

52
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,620
which again, I probably donate a lot of it because I couldn't keep the money for myself.

53
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,960
So I to charities that I heavily research understand like their records and stuff like that when money is actually going.

54
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,880
And then I would also donate to my parents, like get them to retire,

55
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:59,320
move somewhere like the beach or something and then yeah, I don't know, I'm just like keep living off the well.

56
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:09,669
Okay. Yeah. I think first thing I would like buy a house for my parents, maybe need another house, you know, a couple of billion dollars.

57
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,850
So it's $1,000,000,000.

58
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:22,120
You know, I would probably also donate the money to like research, like cancer research, animal like charities and stuff like that.

59
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,779
And then I would probably buy myself a car too, just thinking about it.

60
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:36,999
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think I would definitely have to donate some of it,

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,420
but also an idea I talk about with my parents a lot because they're engineers is building like tiny homes, like designing tiny little.

62
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,079
Have you seen like HGTV? Time I was watching the videos.

63
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,920
It's like my like cathartic thing to do. So I feel like I would probably spend quite a bit about investing in like building

64
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,150
really nice ones and maybe like flipping them into Airbnbs or maybe even just like,

65
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,080
oh, like giving them to housing opportunities for like low income folks.

66
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,190
A mix of probably, yeah, I'll get $3 billion where you get a lot of money.

67
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:18,579
I would probably also donate a lot of it to like public school systems and, and like pay off debt and help my parents.

68
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:27,069
And then if I didn't have to like go into the corporate world, like maybe start a bakery or something and, you know, just do something I enjoy doing.

69
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:34,750
And, well, we've I cannot. I can. It's like baked goods, bread, like really getting my friends.

70
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,150
Um. C Probably, definitely.

71
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:51,670
Every time I've had some records from Guy, I would definitely grow my money for like invested some in causes that or companies are,

72
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:59,410
you know, police bribery and probably I don't I don't know what it is.

73
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,130
I've never thought about it that much. Oh, I'm sure everything I want.

74
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,600
I would also give food to friends, which, by the way, I have something falafel wraps from Jerusalem Garden.

75
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:19,000
Because you bring that to that I right. Yeah. I only have six left so you can fight among yourselves just sharing with the glass a few.

76
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:28,690
So the question is you got $1,000,000,000 without you obviously calling a lawyer and an accountant and your loved ones,

77
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,350
what are you going to do with it? So we'll give you a minute. You guys knew that. I know.

78
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,729
You just want answers. Okay? It's really great investment idea.

79
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:46,900
You guys can all get in on it. I'm going to build a summer camp for adults, and it's going to be like this huge summer camp that everybody.

80
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,980
There's all these things that people love to do. You would love it. You know, such a good time.

81
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,170
And I'm going to Char and there's going to be like beautiful cabins.

82
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,730
It's going to be really nice place. You could do like glamping or not even camping.

83
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,150
Or pull camping, whatever it's going to be in Colorado.

84
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,170
And it's going to be really expensive for like corporate retreats and like pretty expensive for just adults.

85
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,930
And then it's going to be free for kids who don't get to usually go to summer camp.

86
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,530
So like kids that live in the city and don't experience the wilderness and it's going to be awesome.

87
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,120
So you guys can all come for free admission.

88
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:36,210
Yeah. To the adults and kids. Yeah. Million dollars, which do not subsidize, uh, open my own restaurant and go traveling.

89
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,740
Okay. What's what's on your food trends?

90
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,129
All right, love. And is there a special dish we don't order from?

91
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,770
You? Probably do. So I know how to do a lot of such wonderful Sichuan gardening.

92
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,660
Yeah. I mean, do you foodies join you guys?

93
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,710
Potluck $1 billion. What are you going to do with it?

94
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:13,580
I mean, I also like the idea of opening up because, you know, it is actually still his whole idea.

95
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,669
The whole thing just going is God at times too. Okay, but we don't Chinese.

96
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,820
We don't know, you know, maybe just maybe like, like, like plate.

97
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,060
Thomas Yeah, it's kind of this little drinks cocktail come for the social.

98
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:40,140
Yeah, look at it like, you know, with the shelter and then trap and then.

99
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,569
Okay, very good. And my business woman who just walked in with her business suit.

100
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,360
I see. What. What would you do with a billion that.

101
00:11:50,790 --> 00:12:01,350
Honestly, I don't believe anyone makes that much money, so probably give 94% of it away and see what could make it be done, not the housing crisis.

102
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,990
Okay. All right. Lofty goals and there is love to hear it.

103
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,650
Just coming up, the presentation for today here.

104
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:23,290
And she was screaming, you can if you want to this.

105
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
All right. Thank you for sharing. Truly appreciate hearing that.

106
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:40,409
I've heard a lot of philanthropic but also just empathy and sympathy for your parents truly appreciate that and go parents risk can just

107
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:49,110
bring back bring them back take care and you know I've had a little bit more time to to think about that and and I it's global health for me.

108
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,870
It's it's finding there's definitely some personal things, definitely some interests living off some interest,

109
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,770
but also some global health things that I would do around the world.

110
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:04,799
Just thinking from sort of your concept with the big adult lifestyle, but you know,

111
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,530
in different, different stages of a world and sports and I guess, yeah, you never know that.

112
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,180
Just remember, Professor, when you hit the see.

113
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:37,130
Okay, let me get to the right screen here and it's like, all right, so it's interesting.

114
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,470
Right. Right. I'm assuming you can see this.

115
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,950
I've tried to share the screen with you, so let me know if you cannot see it.

116
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,489
And it's just Spencer.

117
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,760
A week ago, you guys his name came to mind. I do believe I'm going to be expecting Aaron's joining us on Zoom.

118
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,260
So if you guys can periodically look to see if anybody needs to be admitted to the Zoom room,

119
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,340
I appreciate you don't need to pay attention to it, but I still want to forget it.

120
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,999
If I'm up here and just give me a something and I'll go back to it.

121
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So of good. How are you? Good. So the class question was doing dollars Billion dollars has just been granted to you.

122
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,580
You found out without the advice of an accountant and an attorney and a loved one, what would you do?

123
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,740
I would open a senior pet rescue. Oh, I don't think I want to say winner a winner.

124
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,140
Tom Andrews, too, says the best thing in several decades to Ann Arbor Senior, part of like $1,000,000 per year.

125
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,840
I think, John, it's some of the Gibsons right here. It's probably donate some to give to your parents.

126
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:55,100
Yeah. Okay. Very good. Very good. We had we had restaurants, too, you know, parents.

127
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,600
Interesting. Yeah, they did great. So. All right.

128
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:09,050
So moving into this week in next week's courses, and I'm going to actually have to take a step back for a second.

129
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,550
We've talked I need to talk to these two things.

130
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,500
I need some. I did not bring my little notepad, so I need somebody to start attendance.

131
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:31,210
I didn't want to forget that. And then second, let me turn off this music because I will to do some things like hours.

132
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:46,480
And then it meets in the middle. You want to. You know, we're just so in the middle.

133
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Just do what you want. We'll stick with one of those officers from Texas.

134
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:06,320
He's pushing them into the box. She charges.

135
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,879
All right. Why don't you give us a little bit of a step back and the reason why is it sort of then we will get back to this.

136
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,810
But I went down the path of looking at an employer, looking inside an employer and looking at human resources.

137
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,040
And what what are we talking about with human resources in health care?

138
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,040
And that's important. And we'll get back to that.

139
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,330
But for this session and the next session, I wanted to sort of take a step back a little bit and talk about public health leaders,

140
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,740
why they're so important in organizations.

141
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,530
And what they can drive, what it looks like getting down to sort of some grassroots examples.

142
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,920
Next week, I want to talk about workforce,

143
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:03,159
workforce planning and really looking at the external national indicators that will help

144
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,229
you guide your work when you're looking at workforce planning as you become leaders.

145
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,110
And what do we need to consider and what are the things we need to do?

146
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:18,160
So today is sort of a tag team with next week just taking a step back and looking at, you know, public health.

147
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:26,679
And so, again, the title of this session is really just what is it appropriate to use public health leaders in an organization?

148
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:34,870
And the learning objectives really are, you know, what does it mean to team leadership, team collaboration,

149
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,950
looking at an organization and understanding the effectiveness of what you can bring as a public

150
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,429
health leader in that organization and how you can challenge those who don't want to challenge,

151
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,149
but how you can bring a different vision to others.

152
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:57,670
And B, when you're at the table, especially of your coworkers and colleagues that you're going to be working with,

153
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,399
trying to implement initiatives as you go forward, what else can you bring to the table?

154
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,500
And many of you have seen as you worked in your internships and by the way, the papers have been great.

155
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,300
I didn't have word salad. I had some really great papers and I know I've got a few more left, but I really appreciated what you gave me, so thank you.

156
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:25,750
But I wanted to have you understand what you were looking at in that organization, because what were the what are the collegial conversations?

157
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,659
What was the collaboration among those leaders and who really brought forth a lot

158
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,490
of the public health or health care concerns for from an internal perspective?

159
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:48,340
So, you know, I want to go back to the CDC is really look good.

160
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,880
I know I'm like I you to take a photo of people in class.

161
00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:01,150
That's how they dress today. So I want to go back to what you heard in the beginning about public health.

162
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,090
And I'm going to move this in a different direction eventually.

163
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:12,820
But again, you heard me say the mission is really to fulfill society's interest in assuming conditions in which people can be healthy.

164
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:22,030
And I'm read that just a little bit differently to really sort of engage in forces class in employers mission

165
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,390
should be to fulfill its employees interest in assuring the conditions in which those employees can be healthy.

166
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,240
Little bit of a different twist on public health.

167
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,880
Again, when I look at it from our perspective, there were 51,000 employees at this point in time.

168
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:46,330
We want to assure conditions in which people can be healthy. And you've heard me talk a little bit about that, but that's sort of the basis.

169
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:53,290
And then as an employer. Right, I want to find a way to increase the probability that competent personnel can

170
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,430
be available to provide and perform services required by an organization.

171
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:06,440
Right. And. When we ask the question of how is an organization healthy, we need to look at not only.

172
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,590
Again, you've heard me say it before the mission, but the goal.

173
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,090
And then I talked in the beginning in the couple of courses we've talked about just the labor and the and

174
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:25,339
the the actual interactions that the staff or the labor force has between the health care providers.

175
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,020
That's also important.

176
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:40,040
And I'm saying that because when we think about you next year, five years from now as a health care leader and you're working with your staff,

177
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:50,660
I unless you're just an independent consultant and you're looking at the health of that population, again, they actually are part of a community.

178
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,850
They, too, are part of a bigger, larger public health perspective.

179
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:03,740
You heard me say the benefits that we provide go to our employees and they take it elsewhere to get services.

180
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,649
But now that you're actually becoming a leader, you're actually helping support,

181
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,850
create and assuring conditions in which people can be healthy from the inside.

182
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,360
From the inside, with your staff. And I ask the question, who should lead that?

183
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,700
Who's responsible for that? Isn't just a job.

184
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,070
And if so, why? So my discussion question is really?

185
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:37,430
How do you think? A little bit. And I know the billion dollar question was a little hard and I wanted that to be purposefully.

186
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,219
For those that came in, I asked, if you had $1,000,000,000,

187
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:50,810
what would you do in some ways with what would our health care delivery system look like if all CEOs were public health leaders?

188
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,420
Not all of them are public health trained. Many of them are clinically free.

189
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,630
When you think of your pillars, you think about the work that that's being done in health care.

190
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:11,920
Many will assume the role of finance. Many will see a CEO role in health care because they're good at finances.

191
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,589
Many will. I've seen lawyers. I've seen finance people.

192
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,899
I've seen physicians. But we also have our public health leaders.

193
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,020
And I do know that some of my friends graduate from this class of CEOs.

194
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,820
I get it. And they put a different spin on that, that health care institution.

195
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:44,560
So I'm going to ask just for general discussion, knowledge, what if think about the U.S. in every single health care system had a public health.

196
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,280
Leader engaged. And I'm going to go back one slide.

197
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:57,200
And sort of have you engaged in the first the mission right.

198
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,100
To assure conditions in which people can be healthy? Would that transform the health care delivery system?

199
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:08,660
Would you think it would transform the health care delivery system?

200
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:16,640
If all the CEOs for all the health care systems that deliver health care are public health leaders.

201
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,590
And bring my balls and I'm going to walk up these steps and tap on somebody.

202
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,480
But I'm going to go in this direction. Somebody in this direction.

203
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:43,899
What are you noodling on? Is it. I want to say yes, however annoying that health systems to respond to just reimbursement from insurance companies,

204
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,160
I think there has to be pressure on that end to to fund or to make.

205
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,950
Public health initiatives and preventative care, things of that nature are more lucrative.

206
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,680
So then align health systems to want to shift in that direction more easily.

207
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,240
So the payer system would be a problem that zero I'm hearing.

208
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:14,590
So you you're not opposed to the idea of all CEOs being on it, but if they can't fund it, it may not get done.

209
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:23,070
So what would be so how would a public health leader be different than someone who grew up in in the financial world?

210
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,530
So now you've got a CFO who just the region said,

211
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:34,630
we want we want this person to be the CEO of health care system versus someone who had a public health background.

212
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,080
What what what do you think is going to be most important in that leadership and a different

213
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,200
perspective to where they'll probably try to create a like just with the patients they may have this

214
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:55,120
creatively how are you doing companies you get those public health initiative solutions despite any

215
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,930
sort of barriers that's creating pipelines develop like physicians or retain work for this or.

216
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,180
Reevaluating how they're doing. Community benefit, right?

217
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,220
What does that actually look like? A free organization? Mm hmm.

218
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,709
And so there's external and internal strategies that this person would think differently about for our health care systems.

219
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:25,060
Right. And then the staff and employees that they're managing from a public health perspective could possibly look a little different.

220
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,040
So I'll look to the middle section. Are you doing?

221
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:38,090
Well, you are doing them.

222
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:53,330
Oh, I am. Yeah, I think they're very different.

223
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,020
There's running privatizations and running of non-profits are incredibly different.

224
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,600
The mission driven aspect of it is incredibly different than a stakeholder, a shareholder driven mission.

225
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:12,410
You know, Milton Friedman was a huge advocate of maximizing shareholder profit versus the nonprofit's mission of,

226
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,960
you know, serving, serving the greater good.

227
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:23,300
So I think that all CEOs or public leaders, I think public health would have a drastically different vision.

228
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,000
And perhaps I think for the worse is my best. Just skin sculpting.

229
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:42,329
I keep picking on you. I think that there will be a lot more focus on preventive services, and it may not happen right away.

230
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:49,830
But I think long term that can lead to complication like, let's say emergency emergency visits,

231
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,670
which can save money for all of the medical care systems.

232
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,920
I think there's a lot more focus on addresses, which obviously is a problem.

233
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:05,430
But again, I think all of these kind of like the more long term, you'll see more of the long term benefits later on.

234
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,389
Right when you're trying to assure conditions so that people can be healthy

235
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,950
from an external standpoint and serving a community to an internal standpoint.

236
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:25,040
You want to sort of ensure that, especially if all the CEOs in my mind were public health leaders,

237
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:31,520
we'd be looking at structured, we'd be looking at process, we'd be looking at flow.

238
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:39,290
We would then want to see outcomes. That's still true when you have somebody in a financial track that becomes a CEO.

239
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:45,140
But think about the path by which a patient would actually take that care.

240
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:52,459
We focus a lot in health care delivery systems on the services, the services, the services, the service, what's the product?

241
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,660
What are we producing? What, what? What does that patient flow look like?

242
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,930
So that at the end result, we've got to fill them, right?

243
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:08,690
And when I work within health care systems or work within private practices,

244
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,209
the one question on the table is internally and externally, how do you know you're healthy?

245
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:21,260
And you've heard me say that, yes, you have your financial health, but there's other things that you as a leader need to be concerned about.

246
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:31,790
And bringing that forth to the table. And when you do that, it's that, well, I'm going to get to the stage as well.

247
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:39,139
It's really making for certain that the labor force that you are trying to engage,

248
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:46,440
that you are trying to provide an opportunity to deliver the best quality.

249
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:54,830
And thank you very much that they can. Is on solid footing.

250
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:04,790
And so next year or years from now, when you're becoming a leader, looking at your role from a public health lens,

251
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,479
not only just the role and the responsibility on that job description that you need,

252
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,260
but what is the what is the larger mission that you're aligning with?

253
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,300
And are you doing that from your place in space?

254
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,690
For what you are managing.

255
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:29,660
It's not just you're going to have metrics from others basically stating you need to hit this milestone, you need to have this particular metric met.

256
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:39,620
But if you're not begging the question, then you're just continuing the churn of a health care system that's just delivering a service.

257
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:46,550
But is it delivering a service so that you're sharing conditions where people can be healthy?

258
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:54,260
Your employees specifically. And I I'm asking that question about who's responsible.

259
00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:01,980
And when I think about all of I think about all that's in it in our health care delivery system.

260
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,790
You know, that that I've been engaged in that you were futuristic be engaged in who's a bond symbol for all these things,

261
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,930
health and well-being, health insurance, Medicare, wellness, community health.

262
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:21,380
There's just so many pieces to this and there's only so many public health leaders to go around.

263
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:27,650
Right. So you you're going to be working with individuals who will need some of this

264
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,180
graduate school training that you're getting to help them understand why you're

265
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:40,219
trying to align to a mission and why you're an extension of a CEO and a c HRO when

266
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:46,100
you are leaders and it will be your dialog that will help convince alignment.

267
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,430
It will be your your conversations.

268
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,030
That helps. And what I call this this the soup of things.

269
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,360
But I'm going to take a step back, too, and say, let's think about COVID.

270
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:04,470
Let's think about the pandemic. It's going to make a pregnant, pregnant pause there.

271
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,199
COVID. We've been together for two, two years.

272
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,350
It's still not done with us. Variants are still out there.

273
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,520
If the public health leaders did not step up.

274
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:29,060
Who was going to. Is it the CFO guy knowing how to talk about immunizations and masking and social distancing?

275
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:38,260
And I'm just trying to get you to think about. Where is the right places and spaces for your work?

276
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:46,780
When things happen in an organization and your employees will be asking the same question, should they look to h.r.

277
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,700
For everything? And i've already shared that i'm not h.r.

278
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,450
Certified.

279
00:31:54,310 --> 00:32:06,790
So how could someone who's just certified an agent transactions really help an organization and your employees feel as if they can be healthy?

280
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,050
How are you? How will you challenge that? What is your style to do that?

281
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,700
And again, when we think of COVID, what ended up happening?

282
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:23,820
And many of. Think about where you were in the March of 2020.

283
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,170
Where were you in March of 2020? Were you? You were not.

284
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:34,290
You were just trying to integrate a school. Some of you were in multiple places, but you were not.

285
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,610
Right. You're most of us were.

286
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:48,440
But for Michigan, we went remote. And immediately we had luckily we had President Mark Schlissel,

287
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:59,000
who was was a clinician in and biomedical sciences and understood what was going on from the perspective of the the cellular move that was happening.

288
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,460
But I was moved and he knew enough to say, I don't have all the answers.

289
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,740
Who do I go to? I am asking you.

290
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,470
Will you be one of those people, especially when you are managing your employees?

291
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,740
This is what I think we should do. This is what I understand to be my role.

292
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:27,590
I can speak forward in talking about this is how we can assure conditions so that people can be healthy.

293
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,200
This is what I know. How will you be a part of that team?

294
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,940
And even if it's not a pandemic.

295
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:44,170
Keeping them in front of you, keeping that available in in your your actions, things that you should be doing as you're leading.

296
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:53,080
So when we talk about COVID, he brought together an emergency team from across the campus.

297
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,760
And at that point in time, I believe it was 120 individuals.

298
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,730
But what he wanted to make certain that the community understood was that everything we do will be publicly.

299
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,690
Health was nice, not where it was, will be public health informed.

300
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,850
It will be public health informed.

301
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:25,520
And so when I transfer that to, okay, now COVID is sort of moving along and I'm going to share some, some some dynamics that happened.

302
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:32,030
But what I think about today. Public health infrastructure.

303
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:37,300
How many are aware of your county health departments? Are you aware of Washtenaw County Health Department?

304
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:47,070
You are where you are. Do you know what they do there by county health departments, do you think?

305
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,590
Not really specific about Washtenaw, but I,

306
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:59,409
I at least when I work at local government we usually conduct a community health needs assessment every 50 years or so,

307
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,590
and then we determine the type of public health programs that we want to implement based on the needs assessment that we establish.

308
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:11,200
So that could be like diabetes care in our at least in our particular department.

309
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,680
It was like vaccination site. It flew by ICE.

310
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,010
I mean, immigration in Washtenaw County does the same thing with them monkeypox vaccine and COVID.

311
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,980
So if you have computers. All right. I know you're on Google, Washtenaw County Health Department.

312
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,640
Tell me what you're seeing from what's on the.

313
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:42,290
Just shout out what you see. The regulations for the school districts care for COVID 19.

314
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,130
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. K through 12 vaccine rates and what they need to have and what's going on.

315
00:35:51,520 --> 00:36:01,960
And not only are they caring for the health of the county citizens, which include you because you are here, we partner with them.

316
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:14,350
The point being is that today part of my role is to manage the public health infrastructure so that we are ready.

317
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:23,230
We are ready. We work with the county health department to to make certain that we are as informed as we can be.

318
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:29,380
But I can be at the table with a public health background saying, this is my county health department.

319
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,070
This is what we see. This is what's happening here at the university.

320
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,259
These are the measures we want to take and work with my epidemiologist and work with clinical labs.

321
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:45,930
And work with. But. Through COVID and go back to March 2020.

322
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,760
We had a large group come together to be publicly health, public health informed.

323
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,720
And then we created we created the.

324
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:07,500
Campus Health Response Committee. To ensure that we managed employee health giving given an example.

325
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:14,890
You are in charge of two people.

326
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:21,210
50 people. And you find out that you that you have some major health concerns.

327
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:27,090
What health concerns from your employees and their emailing you and them telling you

328
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:32,590
things are going on and what are you going to think about that employee as a resource?

329
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,329
How are you going to assure conditions for that person to feel healthy?

330
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:40,170
Because they're going to feel stressed. They're going to worry about their pay.

331
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,480
They're going to worry about their job.

332
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:50,910
I mean, these are all things that will preclude you from delivering the quality care that your employer says that you want.

333
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,100
So how are you linking with your employer and what they're aligning with to let you be able to do your job?

334
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:05,530
What? What does that. What does that look like? And we have to figure out how to manage the employee health.

335
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:15,490
And the person responsible is a group. And you look to those who have that experience to guide you from a public health perspective.

336
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:26,690
Right. So you can have different CEOs, but as long as they are collaborative and willing to coordinate and all the way and sort of move in a direction

337
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:32,830
that they don't have all the answers and they bring on the proper people on the team is going to be appropriate.

338
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,910
Is is appropriate. You will be called to be on a committee or a team and work in that place and space.

339
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:48,740
What are you going to say to help assure conditions for people to be healthy, especially when when a health care system is labor intensive?

340
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:57,679
It is labor intensive. I put in the resources to the slide deck and I will not click on it because once you get this one that you can click on it.

341
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:06,460
But there's an article about a. See a CEO who is not publicly trained going to his board, too,

342
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:16,500
for one last financial case to recommend that he would like to have paid family leave for his employees.

343
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:21,120
He heard that through his organization.

344
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,970
They made a case. He's going to do so.

345
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:31,720
When you think about those employees that you're managing and they get paid family leave, just not, you know, maternity leave.

346
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:39,100
It's. Putting in a condition for them to know they have an opportunity to be able to engage with

347
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,450
the employer in a more healthy way because they don't have to go begging for something.

348
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,930
You've given them the option. You've given them the possibility what you hear from your staff and what they need.

349
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,060
Turn that into something. Because they're looking for ways to make.

350
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:01,800
That environment, that culture. The conditions are working and healthy for them.

351
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,080
You're going to see, I promise you,

352
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:11,069
and many of you who have already managed staff know that you hear a lot of information from people that you manage in your staff.

353
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:17,460
But if you can turn that into something that could be a bigger win for the organization from a public health perspective,

354
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:24,330
you're sharing that mission and that goal that you can then have competent people being able to do the job.

355
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:32,130
But in the same vein, keeping your labor force engaged with you the multiple, multiple benefits.

356
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,530
So with COVID. You know, we had to really think about who's responsible.

357
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,780
And it came down to a committee of I think we're a committee of 24.

358
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:52,160
And the the director of the Campus Health Response Committee was Dr. Robert Ernst, who is now the chief health officer.

359
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,700
That's the gentleman I support as chief of staff.

360
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:04,790
And one of the things that we had to really dig into if we were going to be the public health leaders of this effort in an organization,

361
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,860
was make for certain that those leaders knew immediately what our vision of health was going to be,

362
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:17,510
getting those groups together to understand what's happening. What is the organization's vision of health in March 2020?

363
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:25,010
What did healthy look like? Would anybody have known that for any staff member we went.

364
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,470
And it's funny, but we went remote right on a Friday and that Saturday we heard about.

365
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:41,910
Now think about COVID. No vaccine and the danger that it posed to an individual when transmitted with no vaccine.

366
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,850
We heard about so many parties, it was like, Oh, no.

367
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,130
What? What did health look like? We hadn't.

368
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,620
We hadn't prepared for it. We weren't ready. But we had experts that we could rely on.

369
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:06,230
And the first thing we needed to do was make sure that organizations vision of health, that the organization has a vision for what is healthy.

370
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:13,220
So when you're managing your employees health, what is your vision for your group?

371
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,630
What is your vision for? You just want to come to work. To work?

372
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,880
Or do you care if they're sniffling or bent over to give?

373
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:28,820
You know, what will be your mantra because you're setting the tone in the culture as a leader.

374
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,530
What will be your mantra and what are you aligning yourself with your vision of your organization?

375
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,740
Senior management needed to be needed to participate and be committed, especially if it was going to be public health.

376
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:52,100
Right. Making for certain that individuals and we received a lot of wonderful feedback from individuals who didn't understand public health.

377
00:42:53,690 --> 00:43:04,219
Everyone seemed to become epidemiologist March 2020, and they all had opinions about what we should be doing and or not doing.

378
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,010
And I mean, honestly, it was amazing to watch,

379
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:15,770
but we we wanted to make certain that senior management understood the education your employees need to understand what you're saying,

380
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:22,650
what you're doing, what you're trying to convey. And committed to resources.

381
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,250
I mean, we saw from a federal level, tons of money came our way.

382
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:37,050
That was the first time in my life and maybe may you enjoy this, that I had an unlimited budget and I was like, stuff I can do so much here.

383
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:42,350
Federal government said here, this is what we can do. And so what was the plan?

384
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:47,610
What were we going to do with that to make and assure all the conditions so

385
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,919
that those employees were healthy enough to provide the services they needed?

386
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,000
Because, again, the labor intensity for what they were doing was necessary.

387
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,930
We saw what it did to health care system and nurses. We saw that.

388
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,800
We saw that workplace policies in the work environment.

389
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:12,700
I think we all are aware of the vaccine policy. Assuring a condition that someone can feel safe when they come to work.

390
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,860
And we had side by side issues with them. Your employees are going to come to you and say, so-and-so didn't do.

391
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,780
So-and-so is not complying with what are your policies?

392
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,860
What what is it that you want to have in the work environment to rally together so that we're all healthy?

393
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:36,430
Diagnostic informatics and health metrics. Has anybody looked at the dashboard lately?

394
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,120
Has anybody ever looked at the Amazon blueprint COVID dashboard?

395
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:51,980
Okay. It's out there. It's still out there. We're still using it. But when we looked from a public health leader, we knew that our our very smart,

396
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,770
academic, research focused university will want to know what's going on.

397
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,600
What do we look like? How many people are vaccinated, how many people are dying in the hospital?

398
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:09,829
Your employees are going to want to know what's going on and what are you going to share with them so that they feel they can trust you,

399
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:14,660
that they're walking into a healthy environment so that they can be in a healthy condition

400
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,280
to understand what they're going to provide you when when they come to work for you.

401
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:28,999
You'll hear more about the diagnostics, informatics and health metrics from my colleague Denise and from both Brian's a little bit later,

402
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,300
but that was majorly important, and I'm going to go back to a little bit that later, because from an H.R. perspective.

403
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:46,190
In every single thing that I basically said to you in the last 25 minutes, I was completely involved, completely a partner at the table.

404
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,239
When I say senior management participated and was committed, they were absolute committed.

405
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:57,650
And what I'm going to eventually share with you a lot of the factors in the areas that H.R. took on so that they could be a partner,

406
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:06,950
so that our employees and our students could have a healthy environment, that they can work in healthy goals and program elements.

407
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,209
What were the response metrics? What were the things that we needed?

408
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:19,640
If we triggered have additional conversation and pivot on, what will what will that look like for your organization?

409
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,380
Right. You got 25 employees and 20 don't come to work.

410
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,700
You've got to pivot. You have to pivot. Something happened. Something went wrong.

411
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:35,850
What was the root cause? What was happening? Was was there a flu outbreak on your on your clinic?

412
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,840
And you got five people showing up to work? How are you going to pivot? Did you know that was coming?

413
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:44,610
Did you know that ahead of time? Is there a policy mandated policy that you have to have the flu vaccine?

414
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,460
Because I do know that that is a thing for Michigan medicine.

415
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:55,790
And they are considering, if you know, what other what other immunizations need to be mandatory.

416
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:07,229
What I'm showing conditions so that people can. Be healthy and work in a healthy environment and that you've got competent people able to come to

417
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:15,150
your come to your aid to help produce the services that you need to produce value based plan design.

418
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:21,120
I put that in there because as is anybody familiar with value based plan designs.

419
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,849
Okay. This some? Yeah. Are you saying. Yeah. I don't know if you're doing like this.

420
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,140
Like I know how you're saying. I know a little bit. Oh, okay.

421
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:37,810
Share with me what you think. I don't have any thoughts right now.

422
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,540
Very good. I know. Very little. Okay. Okay.

423
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:48,170
RB rb s. Based on these relative value scales.

424
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,280
Anybody? I'm just curious.

425
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:58,839
Sometimes I think that some of the classes are teaching these things and I'm and might be saying things that you haven't engaged in yet,

426
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,010
but I could have sworn by now. You would have had that. But that's okay.

427
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,349
Go ahead. It was like playing football.

428
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:11,620
You could sort of like prep for service. So like admission will be factored in there.

429
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,630
And like you said. Right. Right. You have to visit with managers, also look after them.

430
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:24,609
Right. Right. And so there's there's just different. We talked about compensation and we talked and didn't go.

431
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:30,219
And I asked, does anybody know what an asso administrative service organization or fee is?

432
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,500
And explain that a little bit.

433
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:44,200
But it's just a different type of payment system and having it be value based on the continuum stream of what is being provided.

434
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,809
And I'm going somewhere with this and that when we think about our our health care system and what we're producing.

435
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:56,320
And you talked about the payers, right? And if we can bill for it and get paid for it, then we can do it.

436
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:06,140
But. What value is the employee providing in order for you to provide value to that

437
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:13,280
patient so that we feel we can appropriately bill for that value to a payer system?

438
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:19,400
What value? There's a return on an investment.

439
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:26,580
I get that. But a VOA. What value on investment does that employee bring to you and do you care?

440
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:39,440
Why should you care? Why not care? There's there has to be something of value that's designed for that employee.

441
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:47,580
And you're delivering these messages. Not only are you saying, all right, we're going to have a staff meeting.

442
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,690
What is that agenda look like? What does your staff team meeting agenda look like?

443
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,920
I can tell you H.R. cares. They want to know exactly what you're dialoging.

444
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:08,170
What exactly are you saying? What messages are you giving? Because you, like I said, you are the extension of delivering these messages.

445
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,990
You will provide. The value.

446
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,990
You will be the senior management participating and committing.

447
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,980
You will be the one pulling the diagnostic information and sharing.

448
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,410
Why leave it to somebody else? Why leave it to? Why leave to just a chart.

449
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,380
But what are you learning in that organization from H.R. and from the leaders to be able to do that?

450
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:44,830
How are you connecting? What does that look like? There's always we you'll hear again from director of benefits are chronic care.

451
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,330
You know, we have a dashboard that we look at chronic care. Again,

452
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,440
let's just say you've got five employees and you got one going on on maternity

453
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,759
leave and two have diabetes and they're in a diabetes prevention program.

454
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,909
So how are you managing what are you saying to them?

455
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,560
Do you care to talk to them?

456
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:11,740
What value are they bringing and what are you giving them of value to manage that chronic condition and managing that employees health?

457
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:18,999
Do you feel like you should be responsible for managing the employees health or should it be someone else's responsibility?

458
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:27,980
Should it just be our. I'm just I'm just curious to know I'm coming up to I don't remember.

459
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,510
You know, I did wait. She?

460
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:38,860
Okay. What's your job? Good job.

461
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,980
I was like, I think I know. But then I said, okay, so give me more confidence.

462
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:52,110
Do you think you should be responsible for your employees health? Oh, yeah, I think so.

463
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,920
Especially if you're in a leadership position. What would that look like?

464
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:09,870
So I think one of your goals, right, is to manage your employees schedules, making sure that they're able to have a positive work life balance.

465
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,790
And so whether that's having one on one conversations, seeing where they are in your state.

466
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:23,860
So what if I told you I have I have diabetes and my foot hurts and I really got to go see my doctor.

467
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:32,050
I'm going to possibly need an instrument and FMLA. And, you know, I'm one of two of your employees and you rely on me a lot.

468
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,330
What is that conversation?

469
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:43,690
Well, I think that conversation would have been had before hiring that person on, so that would have been taken into consideration before.

470
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:49,320
Preexisting conditions are a term of hiring. Should they be?

471
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,850
Anybody. It was a very.

472
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,350
I'm not challenging what you're saying. I'm I'm just. I'm pulling apart the onions about it.

473
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,910
Just curious, but I want to finish what? I want to finish what you have to say, but I want to get back.

474
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:12,720
Yeah, go ahead. Oh, I think it's important. But also, sometimes I feel like it could potentially come off as discriminatory.

475
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:18,150
Maybe some people don't want to share their preexisting condition because they're scared of.

476
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:25,370
Not getting the position or something happening in them, not being able being able to get time off.

477
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,510
So you keep going. And so frequencies you would have.

478
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,700
But now but now I'm your employee didn't share it with you.

479
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:42,640
And I will tell you a personal story. I was seven months pregnant when I interviewed for the administrative director for a cancer center,

480
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,670
and they just thought I was a big woman so I would be a woman.

481
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:52,340
I would, if you can imagine, I was £219, had gestational diabetes.

482
00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,120
And so, yeah, it's quite interesting to know what an employee is going through because then what happened?

483
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:05,489
I got on their medical plan, I had a whole bunch of things, but I'm just let's keep going on.

484
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:11,640
That was that conversation because you will have somebody coming to you with some concern or condition

485
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,560
and how are you going to manage that comes and are you please take please take that to h.r.

486
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:23,550
Wow. Okay. So i think that's the conversation is there what are the single points of failure then?

487
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,120
Like what roles or or only their responsibility?

488
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,780
I mean, seeing where if that can be reallocated to someone else.

489
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:37,740
And if not, that will probably then be brought up to of us if we have a budget for someone to take on a temporary position.

490
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,240
So. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Totally heard you.

491
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:52,800
And at that point, does does the employee feel as if you listen to them?

492
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:59,340
Was that a. When you think about a trusted culture, trusted environment,

493
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:07,379
somebody coming to want to and I'm not asking you to answer, I just I really don't I'm begging the questions.

494
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:13,140
And these are the things you'll have to deal with and explain and understand that with.

495
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,059
And there might not be resources for temp employees, but for the most part,

496
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:23,250
how how would you want to get that employee back to being whole and assuring conditions

497
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,970
so that person feels healthy to come back and do the work that they need to do for you?

498
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:37,709
Those are tough conversations. And my my advice is when you hire in as a leader, really, really, really listen and work with your h.r.

499
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,530
To determine what conversations are.

500
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:51,360
Conversations you can or cannot have you can empathize you can empathize with that employee understand their concern.

501
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,780
You can sit and listen. You can document.

502
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,680
And you can share with them based on this journey.

503
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,250
I'm going to do all that I can to ensure that your work is taken care of.

504
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:09,880
That person walks out of your office feeling as if they were heard, seen and respected.

505
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,870
You haven't really said what you're going to do, but you listened.

506
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:21,580
Engage your H.R. can help you with those conversations, and they're called crucial conversations.

507
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:29,680
Rubber Meets Road. A lot of my public health leaders get in trouble with doing a lot of H.R. work,

508
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:37,540
but it's work they have to do, and there's work that they have to align and be committed to and engage in.

509
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,300
Thing the next one, you're going to have all sorts of things coming at you from.

510
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,830
I don't have enough gas money to get to work.

511
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,240
That's financial, social, intellectual, spiritual, physical.

512
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:59,990
And I shared with you earlier that you're going to want to know what your employer provides so that you have.

513
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:05,870
One of the things I learned is to have like a little sight cheat sheet of just the phone

514
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:10,700
numbers and information and sharing and links and that so that when someone comes to me,

515
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,579
you know what? I don't know that I have all of the answers for you.

516
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:20,840
I hear what you're saying, but I want to make sure that you have the right resources to get what you need so that you come back to me.

517
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,580
And so I'm going to be able to give you X, Y and Z. It's just it's a style.

518
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:32,930
It's a way. But all of these panels are going to be something that that you're going to have to engage in at

519
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:39,530
some point in time in your career if you are managing employees and at your age are can help,

520
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:45,730
this is where they can help tremendously. And so what does that look like for h.r.

521
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,970
And i got it. I got to go this way because i can't see it on my screen.

522
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,629
But when we talked about covid and we talked about h.r.

523
00:57:53,630 --> 00:58:03,200
And assuring assuring conditions by which an employee or area can be healthy so that the goal is,

524
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:08,750
again, people can come and do the job that they're doing in a very competent fashion.

525
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:16,190
That's we looked at from an H.R. perspective, multiple things, the little green financial panel.

526
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:23,000
We looked at expense management, hiring freeze. The existing program was put in put in a hiring freeze.

527
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,209
Why did that matter? Because you're going to stop recruiting COVID.

528
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:35,720
We're under COVID. No vaccination. People want to know, how are you going to keep us safe and healthy?

529
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:42,860
Let's put in a hiring freeze so that we don't have a number of exchanged people coming in from what this is a world renowned place.

530
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:48,980
People coming in from all over the world bring bringing different versions or variants of things.

531
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,639
Right? So employee hears that, oh, we're in a hiring freeze. Okay, that's good.

532
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,230
So I just got to work. I mean, you've been working, you got it. And we're good, right?

533
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:08,720
So you start to build that confidence to support freaks, having executives who are going in different places and spaces to learn.

534
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:16,040
We stop that so that our faculty couldn't go and bring something back immediately.

535
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:21,799
Looking at again assuring conditions, looking at assuring conditions, compensation.

536
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:28,060
Freeze. Now, that's interesting. Why would that?

537
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:35,800
Why? Why would a compensation freeze? Relate to assuring conditions of income.

538
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:47,880
And Third place Boys Creek Union on topic.

539
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:59,230
So think in terms of hire a compensation freeze assuring that you have the financial resources.

540
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:03,310
The government gave us money to do the work we needed to do.

541
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:13,180
But we also knew that we needed to hire, freeze the pay freeze and freeze the compensation so that everybody understood we're all in this together.

542
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:19,060
What you're doing is a unified approach to make sure that we keep the doors open and no.

543
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:24,040
One. And as a matter of fact, you may have heard all of our executive leaders took a 10% pay cut.

544
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:29,590
Our athletic director, Schlissel, all of the executive leaders were committed to doing that.

545
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:33,660
They participated in that way. Professional development and travel.

546
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:38,020
Travel. Freeze. Again, it's the same as tuition support freeze.

547
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:49,240
We do have staff development that we froze in that going forward so that when we think about what can I do as a leader,

548
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:54,310
you're looking to some of that with H.R., but then this is what you're going to have to deliver as well.

549
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,070
What would you do? And so. When you're looking at the health of your employees,

550
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:08,440
what do you have in control that you can do to assure that someone's hearing what's happening in your work environment,

551
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:15,429
that you're in control of that saying I'm trying to make this playing field level and fair for you to have conditions

552
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:22,690
where you can come in and feel like you're doing healthy work or you can you can be healthy absence from work.

553
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:33,460
I vividly remember getting the call. Hey, guy, tell me what you think about if we provide 80 hours of paid time off.

554
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:40,200
Would you then provide time off for your diabetes person?

555
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:44,900
Jen. How would you make them use that?

556
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,110
That's a good question. I respect that.

557
01:01:52,110 --> 01:02:00,299
And I, I, I, I'm a little and I get a little giggle when, when I know it's a it's a it's a complex question and it's confounding.

558
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:06,000
And you may need some time to research, but honestly. March 2020 March 2020.

559
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,550
Did I have time? Did I have time to think about any of this when I had time?

560
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:17,630
Hey died. What do you think? About 80 hours of PTO time?

561
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:25,740
I was like, yes, we are going to do that because it's it's showing caring and empathy and trust.

562
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:31,049
And, you know, we could we could do it. We had we'd frozen everything financially.

563
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:35,580
So we kind of knew what our what our margins were. We knew how many employees we had.

564
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:46,490
We knew and it was for it's 80 hours of emergency paid time off to cover someone, your your loved one who received COVID or you had coding.

565
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:47,790
It was specified.

566
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:57,060
So we we hedged on some numbers and some diagnosis is an absolute and to this day, those those 80 hours still exist if you didn't use it.

567
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:07,840
Because God is still with us. You could still you can still tap into those 80 hours keeping in as prolonged federal emergency paid sick leave.

568
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:15,760
Many were you many of you aware of what the federal government did as far as the opportunity to take time off, paid sick leave, how you could.

569
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:24,130
Okay. So the federal government came in and basically stated that it would pay for 80 hours.

570
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:29,670
So above above our 80 hours there was another 80 hours.

571
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,360
So now our employees have 160 hours.

572
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:38,530
Not sick time, not vacation time. This was true. Call the time.

573
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:43,180
This is March. Well, this is April 21, but this is a reflection of what we were doing.

574
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,270
So back then, this is what this is what we have.

575
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:59,470
And this is what public health a public health informed leader working with H.R. is going to support and do to ensure conditions are healthy.

576
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:08,780
I am excited to say that I just received, I didn't just receive but gave me a report on absenteeism and it was phenomenal.

577
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:13,370
It was really phenomenal because of some of the stuff that I'm going on right going through right now.

578
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,660
The we thought we would have huge absenteeism.

579
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:27,820
We didn't. We found that people wanted to hang in there because they got a chance to choose their own.

580
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:31,480
They had to work remote. They really didn't take time off.

581
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:37,989
They wanted to make for certain that this employer continued to provide the services it needed to provide.

582
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:44,320
And they hung in there with us. And we we showed them our caring by doing a lot of this, that we will continue to keep our finances.

583
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:48,250
We will continue to allow you time to take off that you need.

584
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,320
But it's it's it's definitely a win win for us to do.

585
01:04:53,710 --> 01:05:00,640
But how would it feel is you as a leader, you're in you're either in Michigan medicine or on campus,

586
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:05,850
and you've met your managing individuals and you tell them, I have no time for you.

587
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:11,170
You have to use all your sick time. And we know how long COVID can take.

588
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:19,490
How is that going? How will you feel as a leader trying to deliver that message, or will you feel better saying you have 160?

589
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:26,590
And this is how we're going to manage this and this is how it will work. And, you know, success of plan and scheduling, as you said, going forward.

590
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:33,790
Childcare K through 12 relaxed standards for work from home, promoting work from home.

591
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:39,520
I think you you all knew that we we haven't ton of a lot of people who work from home.

592
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,470
There's a unique situation about this working from home.

593
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:55,239
My computer is saying it's going to be. In this working from home aspect.

594
01:05:55,240 --> 01:06:06,640
You met female medical residents who are currently in their program, March of 2020, who had kids struggled.

595
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:13,650
Struggled and basically stated, How are you expecting me to stay in this program?

596
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,190
Become a future medical leader. And I'm at home.

597
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:20,610
I have to be with my kids. How is how is this possible?

598
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:29,850
What does that conversation look like? What conditions are you ensuring for her to be healthy and to come back and be within a residency program?

599
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,109
Being able to think about that. There are there are answers.

600
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:45,700
But I'm just posing the question to you that. When something happens in your organization in a specifically in your area of leadership.

601
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:51,240
What are you thinking about? What will you think about? How will you care for those employees?

602
01:06:53,250 --> 01:07:00,000
Continuing on, we put in the vaccine. We put the vaccine in place, made it a mandate.

603
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:08,550
And now you just have to be up to date with the booster. At this point in time, assuring that people are conditions such that we are healthy.

604
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:13,860
Mask order. Thank you. Thank you.

605
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:17,940
The three you're wearing, for whatever reasons, that's fine.

606
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:25,980
But we now have personal choice to do that, assuring people have the right to wear a mask or not.

607
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:30,150
March of 2020. None of this was important.

608
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,260
None of this was in place. We had to develop this as we went along.

609
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:41,280
As a public health leader. And so, again, when I ask you, when is it important for a public health leader to be in an organization?

610
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:48,690
It's not just in a pandemic. There are other things that you can do that will happen on your watch as long as you're at the

611
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,770
table that people understand your concern and what you're trying to do to assure conditions.

612
01:07:53,730 --> 01:08:00,840
Speak up. Speak out. Do we have to work with your employees to make sure that they feel that you're hearing them?

613
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:08,819
And these are the things that you're going to do to put in place work at home, work on site, mental health and wellbeing just by a show of hands.

614
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:14,220
How many people believe nationally the mental health the mental health landscape was impacted?

615
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,540
I absolutely love that. Absolutely.

616
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:26,240
And so knowing that in March of 2020, we were we were already talking about burnout.

617
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,899
We were already talking about things before COVID hit.

618
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:35,180
And now it just exacerbated it. So now fast forward two and a half years later, what are we doing?

619
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,760
We did something. What are we doing now?

620
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:46,809
I do know that we have a chief mental health officer for the students, Dr. Lindsay Mortensen, who is taking on that role.

621
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:56,350
And I do know that the campus side is looking at a mental health czar to continue figuring out it can't just be, hey, employee, you've got benefits.

622
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:01,060
Go find low find. Just go find your therapist and do that.

623
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:08,590
What are the systematic things that we're putting in place so that that we can control?

624
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:16,690
So that mental health is not a concern for us, that we are not carrying just someone else's mental health concerns when they come to work.

625
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:23,230
Right. I mean, you know, it just kind of puts people I am so sick of my job.

626
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:27,990
And you heard my dad joke earlier. I'm sick of my job. It's so depressing.

627
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,150
So, you know, it's.

628
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:35,360
What? What are we putting in? What are we putting in place? What?

629
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:41,590
What? Did we think in March 2020 and where did we think we would in?

630
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:46,060
But then again, what were some of the lessons learned that we can continue to do?

631
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:54,220
Because as a health care leader, your H.R. is putting things in place for you to speak to, for you to have, for you to understand.

632
01:09:54,550 --> 01:10:02,740
But how were you giving information back from your public health perspective and what you're seeing with what you're managing as a leader?

633
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:10,709
You all will become public health. Your specific in Health Services Administration.

634
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:14,010
I get that. But all people are going to here's all you did school public health.

635
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:22,020
So you have now become generalists in public health and will want to hear your opinions.

636
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:25,080
And I strongly suggest that you share them.

637
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:32,250
Clinical Assessment Employees Occupational Health Services serves as a point of coordination for employee health and safety.

638
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:37,050
Health issues related to COVID, voluntary suspension, and a weekly surveillance program keeping.

639
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:44,250
I it's an it was a great program that we put in place.

640
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,500
But again, trying to assure conditions.

641
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:59,760
So our employees could go getting tests in an asymptomatic way and learn what's going on in addition to where does it really going to go,

642
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,790
especially our employees, where are they going to go from symptomatic standpoint?

643
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:11,220
So faculty and staff and students use the CST program and that again was public health informed.

644
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:15,630
H.R. understood.

645
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,560
Exactly and we have not. Number of testing sites will decrease this spring summer.

646
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:24,840
That was April 20, 21. I think it wasn't even January.

647
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,800
I think it was May of this year. We we stood down two of those sites.

648
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:35,550
And we're considering now, as we're moving through this pandemic and trying to get in a readiness phase,

649
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,080
you know, how much how much more of the testing program do we need to have?

650
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:43,980
It needs to be public health informed. But who's going to deliver that message?

651
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:48,480
The employee who likes to go to the testing center. That could be your boy.

652
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:55,290
Where do I go? Where do I go? What does that mean? Well, I do know that in benefits.

653
01:11:56,450 --> 01:12:00,480
You can get up to eight tests. On your insurance plan.

654
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:05,570
And you can get that every six months. So where do I go?

655
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:10,410
You know, that benefit that you have. Why don't we look into that and I'll get you off the benefits for.

656
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,540
Now you're a trusted source and you feel like you're he help.

657
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:19,610
It's some of the small wins and in showing conditions and some of them are big wins in assuring conditions.

658
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:25,250
But your role will be to assure those conditions, and I will make sure I'm into all my slides.

659
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,780
So I think this is my last slide. Yeah.

660
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,600
Unless, like, I'm asking you.

661
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:43,420
To challenge yourself when you are the next leaders to keep an eye open for areas by which you are leading from a public health perspective,

662
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:52,959
because you are impacting not only just what the patient provides through your employees, but how the employees provide the work they need for you.

663
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,350
And you are then providing to the employer of your choice.

664
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:00,489
It will matter. That whole alignment has to matter.

665
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:03,860
That has to be part of your responsibility.

666
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:07,690
So, look, keep an open eye. You're the next generation of leaders.

667
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,850
Where are you going to take us? Where are you going to pull us? What do you hear from staff?

668
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:16,270
How are you going to be creative? How are you going to engage? How are you going to make this a healthy, healthy environment?

669
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,930
How do you know it's healthy? I'm asking you because you'll be in control of it.

670
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:25,860
And what does that look like? How compassionate are you? Look for inclusion.

671
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:31,950
You know, we talk about the D in the E, but also look for inclusion.

672
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,430
In what? Looking at.

673
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:40,650
All of the operational administrative responsibilities you will have.

674
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,970
Who's not at the table? What's not at the table? What are we missing?

675
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:50,390
What do I heard from my staff that I should include? That the employer should include write that up and send it to somebody.

676
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,840
You never know how far that's going to go. Develop diversity of thought.

677
01:13:55,650 --> 01:14:00,420
Looking at that balance of not only just doing the job that you're doing,

678
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:06,840
but doing it in a more balanced, deeper way to understand what you're actually impacting.

679
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,250
You're not just impacting bed stay. You're not just impacting.

680
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:25,190
Needle sticks and trying to reduce that. You're you're actually aligning and and diversifying your thoughts so that it's it's a greater alignment

681
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:30,200
of what you're doing because you're going to be a public health leader in an in an organization,

682
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,130
but also work with your age. There are things that your H.R. can do.

683
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:38,150
So you're not alone if you've got an idea, hey,

684
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:44,630
can we or who can tell me about or because that makes you a stronger leader in the eyes of your employee.

685
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:54,060
And that you have information, you've researched, you've cared, but you've seen it from a bigger perspective other than just you can't produce.

686
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:59,300
Okay, let's write that up and and you're gonna kind of deal.

687
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:04,980
I've seen management like that and it's very scary in an organization and it's one

688
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:09,360
that spreads relatively quickly than you heard me say before people leave bosses.

689
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:14,909
I really want to make sure that you see yourself as a public health leader making an impact

690
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:20,639
to your employees and how you can ensure conditions are the right conditions for them.

691
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,880
But also working with your H.R. to do that, because there are things that they can do or be creative to do.

692
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,620
Again, like I said, with COVID, it became public health led. We didn't know.

693
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,740
Those are all things we could do. But April 20, 21, that's what we've done.

694
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:44,730
And we now have a public health infrastructure. We now have a small county health department in the University of Michigan infrastructure,

695
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,769
because we have literally you've heard me say 50,000 students, 50,000 staff.

696
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:50,850
That's 100,000 people.

697
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:59,790
Why would we not want to track and monitor and understand and provide things, but also provide things to our management and our supervisors to say,

698
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:07,079
here's another tool, but what are you hearing so that we can be creative and what it is we're doing in both ways?

699
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:10,409
It happens in both ways and places and spaces.

700
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:15,480
So next week I'm going to talk about workforce planning.

701
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:22,379
I'm it's it's really interesting material and leaving you with some tools to

702
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:27,840
help you figure out your workforce when you've when you have to plan for it.

703
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:32,700
There's a lot of things from a national local level that will be helpful.

704
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:41,370
But workforce planning, it's when we look at it from the University of Michigan perspective, you're looking at 51,000.

705
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:47,370
What do we what does that look like? It is more than just a job description, job analysis.

706
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:53,220
It's more than that. It takes into account a number of different factors when we look at workforce planning,

707
01:16:53,580 --> 01:17:03,510
because it depends on the health care that we are delivering specifically and our mission of being research and what have you.

708
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:06,510
So I will leave you with some workforce planning tools next week,

709
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:13,080
but this is to take a step back and think as a public health leader, you will be in your decisions.

710
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,750
All right, see you next week.

711
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:34,450
If anyone knows how to turn the lights up in this room, please let me know, because it's just it is a little free for you can have it all you have.

712
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:52,229
I know when you try to work it out entirely like everyone else.

713
01:17:52,230 --> 01:18:00,270
I've been hearing this from people I love my car and I need a ride.

714
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:05,040
And so they haven't. Let me answer your question. Thank you.

715
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:13,170
So I do want to hear about all that.

716
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:21,900
They got $2 billion dropped on you. What go exactly? If I had $1,000,000 to the beat, I hope you got to do enough.

717
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:26,610
You got to put it out and not hold any people.

718
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:35,180
Obviously, things are calling out. I'm calling attention to home. I love the raffle that's already been destroyed.

719
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:40,320
Why not try to get that one up? So how are you?

720
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:46,190
What is it that you are trying to address if you go to Hollywood Boulevard?

721
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:51,399
No, I didn't. Like I said, this is like in the United States.

722
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:56,219
That's a socialism. And how would you want to do that?

723
01:18:56,220 --> 01:19:01,500
They're doing my vote. I got sick when I was 19.

724
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:09,020
I would be able to with would be a word about why you should go.

725
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:13,740
Because I feel like you'll regret your life.

726
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:27,140
I want you to be so wasted. So they would miss me, Rico So it's hard to think about it, but now I want to do it so.

727
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,640
And I think there's a lot more.

728
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:36,930
I hope this was you. I had to take a step back. I see.

729
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:44,250
I think what you're doing is aligning with this, so I hope that comes in the workforce this week actually.

730
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:49,390
How was the. Your fair or exposed? Did you go? How did it go to the holes in the Telsey Advisory?

731
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,840
Oh, very good. I'll be on the panel tomorrow. Oh, yes, you will.

732
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:58,325
Yeah. We'll see you then. Talk about mental health. So, again, it's a theme from the.
