1
00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:02,172
I know it's early.

2
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:03,152
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:03,152 --> 00:00:05,623
So, today we're gonna talk about the genetics of cancer.

4
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:08,432
So, I thought I would start with just a little bit of background

5
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:11,400
on cancer cause I see some familiar faces who've been in my class or

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,970
have heard me talk about this before, but not everyone.

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,591
So, just a little bit of background.

8
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:21,505
>> So, this is a bit old at this point, but it's pretty much the same,

9
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:27,541
in terms of the rankings now, for men, the top three cancers in terms of new cases or

10
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,680
incidents are prostate, lung and colon.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,090
And then for women it's breast, lung and colon.

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,243
And then you can see,

13
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:38,240
some of these other things that make the top 10 list down here.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,166
And it's interesting cuz, we don't really hear about a lot of those other cancers as

15
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,761
frequently as we do the top three.

16
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:52,461
So, does anything in there surprise you guys?

17
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,300
You seem interesting, yeah?

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,877
>> Kidney cancer.

19
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:01,140
>> Yeah, what about it?

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,769
Yeah, I mean, it's only 5% but, once you get out of the top three,

21
00:01:05,769 --> 00:01:08,620
each one only contributes a small amount.

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,631
And it's interesting too.

23
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:13,850
It's pretty high up on them, but it's very much lower for women.

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,791
>> So, kidney cancer is more common in men?

25
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:22,347
>> [INAUDIBLE] I mean, pretty much anything you can think of, right?

26
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:26,630
It's anything that I wear in the body that cancer.

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,050
Cancer can arise in pretty much any tissue.

28
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,130
It's just exceedingly rare in some tissues.

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,760
One of the ones I think is really interesting is small intestine cancer.

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,152
I mean, it's vanishingly rare, like a handful of cases over the past few years,

31
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:41,700
or something like that.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,385
Which is really interesting, cuz it's literally connected to the stomach and

33
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:48,191
the large intestine, which get cancer fairly frequently.

34
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,890
So, it's a little bit unusual that it wouldn't.

35
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,460
But I mean, it's just a hodgepodge of a lot of things really.

36
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:54,981
What else?

37
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,371
Anybody see anything else interesting?

38
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,988
>> Yeah, >> [INAUDIBLE]

39
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:11,450
>> So, note that this is only melanoma.

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,291
So, there are non- melanoma skin cancers which are extremely common.

41
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:20,743
This is from population based registry data, and non- melanoma skin cancers,

42
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:25,324
[COUGH] Excuse me, are not collected by cancer registrie, for a couple of reasons,

43
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:28,400
partly because they have a very different prognosis and

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,190
disease course than melanoma.

45
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,599
So, non-melanoma skin cancer is really not nearly as serious, and

46
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,210
usually it's not life threatening, the way that melanoma is, right?

47
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,224
The other thing is that the way we get all of this information for registries,

48
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:45,054
the reason we can have a population based registry for cancer is because,

49
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,825
it's a pretty serious disease.

50
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:51,598
People go to, kind of a limited number of hospitals and pathology departments and

51
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,101
things like that to be treated for cancer.

52
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,089
And so, in any geographic area,

53
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,373
you can go to, >> [COUGH]

54
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,686
>> Those institutions that treat cancer

55
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:04,720
patients and get pretty much all of the cases, or all of the cases right?

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,914
Whereas non-melanoma skin cancer is treated in a doctor's office, right?

57
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:10,739
You just go to the dermatologist or even a primary care physician,

58
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,420
they just take it off and you're done.

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,466
So, it would increase the administrative burden

60
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:20,521
exponentially to include those cancers, yeah.

61
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,660
I saw one more hand.

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,020
>> Yeah.

63
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,050
>> You're not sure.

64
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,870
>> Yeah.

65
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,466
>> Okay,

66
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:29,797
>> [LAUGH] >> You and,

67
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:31,168
>> [COUGH]

68
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:31,966
>> [INAUDIBLE]

69
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:34,431
>> It's more common in women, yeah.

70
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,650
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,920
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Yeah.

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,981
>> Not even on the list for a moment.

73
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,411
It's much more common for men, and it's the fourth most common cancer.

74
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,500
And it's so weird cuz you almost never hear about it.

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,796
Does anybody know what the big risk factor is for bladder, in the US?

76
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,870
It's a smoking associated cancer.

77
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,041
Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor.

78
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,780
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Yeah.

79
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,000
Where do you see that?

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,070
Oral cavity and pharynx?

81
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,857
>> [COUGH] >> [INAUDIBLE]

82
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:06,779
>> Yeah, so head and

83
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,390
neck cancer is a little weird.

84
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,471
Oral cavity and pharynx are definitely smoking and alcohol associated, and

85
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,750
both together is worse than either alone.

86
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,461
That's sort of the traditional risk factors for

87
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:23,891
head and neck, which is oral cavity pharynx, hyper pharynx,

88
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,440
Like kind of everything here, nasopharynx.

89
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,510
Interestingly it's become much more common in men.

90
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,560
Oral pharynx which is, I don't believe included in that,

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,600
has become much more common in men and like tonsils cancer because of HPV.

92
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,990
Oral HPV infection is now a cause of that.

93
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,941
It's a cause of men and women, I shouldn't say it's only in men, but

94
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:50,343
for some reason it's been HPV associated or, for NGO cancer has been increasing

95
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:52,670
exponentially in men over the past 10, 20 years.

96
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,311
Yeah.

97
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:59,900
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Yeah.

98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,468
So, I think I may have that, there we go.

99
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,046
>> Okay, cool.

100
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:04,551
>> Look at you, you're like psychic.

101
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:05,551
You knew what the next slide was.

102
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:09,456
So, this is in men, [COUGH] And so, you can see this is since 1975,

103
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:15,040
because that's when we started collecting population based registry data nationwide.

104
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,301
And so, these are incidents numbers.

105
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:19,871
And so, what do you guys see here?

106
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,190
Yeah, the big elephant in the room is prostate cancer, right?

107
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,642
Anybody know what that's about?

108
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,320
>> Donors.

109
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,490
Yeah, absolutely.

110
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,070
We introduced the PSA test in 1992.

111
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,320
The PSA blood test for cancer.

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,630
Prostate cancer was introduced in 1992.

113
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,322
And it's interesting you see, it increases a lot, but

114
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:43,221
it doesn't come all the way back down.

115
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,170
So, when you introduce a new screening cancer that shifts the stage a diagnosis,

116
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,940
you would expect to see this big peak.

117
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,946
But then you would expect it to come all the way back down, the fact that it

118
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:58,085
doesn't indicate that we have a lot of over diagnosis of prostate cancer,

119
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,333
now that we have the PSA screening test.

120
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,724
Thankfully, lung has been coming down over time, it's good news.

121
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:08,841
Mirrors smoking rates almost perfectly by about 10-20 years.

122
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,200
Colon cancer is coming down, that's probably due to screening patterns.

123
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,651
People are using colonoscopy more screening.

124
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:20,460
So, that's sounds like I said two different things, right?

125
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,321
The prostate increase because of screening.

126
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,080
But colon came down because of screening.

127
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,230
That's because when we're screening for prostate cancer, we're looking for cancer.

128
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,906
And if you're looking for cancer, you find it more often, and

129
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:31,485
the incidence rate goes up, right?

130
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:35,333
When we're screening for colon cancer, we are looking for cancer, but

131
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,710
hopefully, we're gonna find polyps, which are the pre-cancerous lesion.

132
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,112
So, if you find a polyp and you take it out, before it ever becomes cancer,

133
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:46,031
then you've reduced the number of cancers that get diagnosed.

134
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:46,730
Does that make sense?

135
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,919
So, kind of whether you're looking for a pre- cancerous lesion, or for a cancer,

136
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,461
determines whether, what impact it has on incidents in the registry.

137
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,983
Sorry, >> [INAUDIBLE]

138
00:06:57,983 --> 00:07:00,821
>> Skin cancer is coming up a bit.

139
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:06,282
Yeah, [COUGH] Some of this has to do with tanning being,

140
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:13,050
it used to be that women carried a parasol, and covered their face so

141
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,550
that they could remain pale, which was fashionable.

142
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,517
And then, people attributed to coco chanel in the sixties, right?

143
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:23,678
That she came back from some vacation all tan and

144
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:26,560
suddenly everybody thought that being tan was the thing to do.

145
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,066
So,, tanning practices had changed and

146
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:34,574
the appeal of tanned skin being healthy looking, and

147
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:38,697
attractive or the beauty standard has changed.

148
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:43,685
And so, tanning bed use, especially among young people is

149
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:47,691
an extremely high risk factor for lung cancer.

150
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:51,427
Don't do that, I was super glad to see zip tans turned into a coffee shop,

151
00:07:51,427 --> 00:07:54,461
cuz coffee reduces the risk of liver cancer, it turns out.

152
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:56,141
So, [LAUGH] >> Drink coffee, don't go tanning.

153
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,740
Well I'm done, that's my advice.

154
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,080
>> [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] Don't smoke, drink coffee,

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,396
don't tan all set.

156
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,259
>> We fixed it.

157
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,856
[LAUGH] >> I don't know if that,

158
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:14,450
I can't tell you if that just cancels each other out.

159
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,540
But alcohol is a carcinogen unfortunately.

160
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,210
So, these are the rates among women, the incidence rates among women.

161
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,340
Again you can see, colon coming down, breast goes up.

162
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,575
That's one where when we screen,

163
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,720
we're screening for cancer not a pre-cancerous lesion.

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,159
So, mammography became a big deal in the late seventies, early eighties I believe.

165
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,857
So, then we start seeing more.

166
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:41,357
There's also a lot of hormonal risk factors related to breast cancer,

167
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:45,332
childbearing patterns, use of menopausal hormone therapy,

168
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,211
use of oral contraceptives.

169
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:50,683
All of these things are associated with a slight increased risk of breast cancer,

170
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:53,980
delaying childbirth, having fewer children later age at first pregnancy.

171
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,246
All of which are kind of good things as women move into the workforce,

172
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:05,542
and have more control over conception and childbearing,

173
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:09,343
but they do increase breast cancer a bit.

174
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:13,482
>> And the last time, [INAUDIBLE] Much decreased,

175
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:15,050
>> So, you're talking about PRCA,

176
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,649
one and two.

177
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,382
We're gonna get into that next time we're gonna talk about familial cancer

178
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:20,210
syndromes.

179
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,603
Familiar cancer syndromes are important, but

180
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:27,520
they actually are a tiny slice of the ideological pie.

181
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,510
S, if you look at the attributable risk percent, for

182
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,580
familial cancer syndromes these kind of inherited genes, it's tiny.

183
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,350
The risk that they confer to an individual if they have them is huge.

184
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,351
But because they're so rare in the general population,the vast majority of

185
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:46,140
breast cancers are not related to break a one and two.

186
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,201
So, you wouldn't necessarily expect to see and

187
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,280
effect kind of the population level of testing.

188
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,190
That makes sense?

189
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,550
[COUGH] I think that this little dip down that we've seen here in the past 10 years,

190
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,856
is because people stopped using menopausal hormone therapy,

191
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:04,811
after the results of the trial came out suggesting that it increased risk.

192
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,020
I don't just think that other people think that too.

193
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,920
I didn't like just make it up.

194
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,966
>> [LAUGH] >> I think the consensus in the field

195
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:16,200
is okay, and I agree with them.

196
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,750
So, you'll see lung cancer is a bit different for women.

197
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,908
It's now starting to come down.

198
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:24,890
In the post 2010 time, because the tobacco epidemic and

199
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,130
women really kind of lagged behind the tobacco epidemic in men.

200
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,170
So, the time at which when smoking peaked and fell off was a bit later.

201
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,034
So, it's coming down on women too, good news.

202
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,720
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Uterine is actually going up now,

203
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,440
at the end it's it's a little hard to see because of the scale.

204
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,471
Uterine cancer is actually increasing quite a lot in the population.

205
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,961
One of the biggest risk factors for uterine cancer is obesity.

206
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,881
So, we think that's what's going on there.

207
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,991
All right, cancer deaths, top three are the same.

208
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:59,362
They just flip a little bit, lung rises to the top for death.

209
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:02,835
With them prostate and breast, taking the second slot for men and

210
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:04,930
women in Colombia 3rd.

211
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,200
But then, you start to see the other things change quite a bit pancreas becomes

212
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,190
four, for both.

213
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,870
So, what that tells you is that pancreas is a rare cancer.

214
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,800
It was pretty far down the list for incidents, but it's highly lethal, right?

215
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,690
If you get it, its survival is poor.

216
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,960
So, that's why it comes up to the top ovary same thing, right?

217
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,940
It's very rare in terms of incidents.

218
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,170
But if you get it you're more likely to die of it than other cancers.

219
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,180
Yes.

220
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,560
>> Are, I'm not sure that's the correct way to ask this.

221
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,919
But, are ovarian and breast cancers like highly,

222
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,100
If you get one you're much more likely to get the other?

223
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,410
>> Not always.

224
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,808
So, if you have a bracha one or two mutation,

225
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:48,560
those mutations increase the risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.

226
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,155
So, bracha one or two is a hereditary inherited cancer syndrome.

227
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:57,929
Inherited breast and ovarian cancer syndrome that,

228
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,485
those are linked in that way.

229
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:04,002
Actually for a lot of risk factors, that kind of oral contraceptive use for

230
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:07,035
example, decreases the risk of ovarian cancer.

231
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:09,760
But increases a little bit the risk of breast cancer.

232
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,882
It's much more complicated than that, because the data that we have is on women

233
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:18,310
who are getting those cancers now, who took the oral contraceptives 30 years ago,

234
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,161
when they were totally different than they are today.

235
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,071
And like the hormone levels were totally higher and all kinds of stuff.

236
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:28,522
So, that space of like hormone therapy and oral contraceptives and

237
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:31,040
cancer risk is messy and really hard.

238
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,180
But, a lot of these things kind of tend to seem to have slightly opposite

239
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,571
risk factors, hormonal and reproductive risk factors.

240
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:41,168
Kind of, if they decrease ovarian they might increase breast a little bit,

241
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:44,320
if they decrease breast they might increase ovarian, you know what I mean?

242
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,422
So, some of them are going the same direction, but

243
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,451
they have similar risk factors.

244
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:53,309
Like a lot of the hormonal childbearing kind of things are related to both of them

245
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:57,459
sometimes in different directions, but the genetic predisposition of bracha one or

246
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:59,340
two increases both.

247
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,711
Does that help?

248
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:05,547
Anything else on here, you guys are excited about interested in questions?

249
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:08,941
Okay, and here's the death rates, we have death from no

250
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:13,470
longer just 1975 because we've been collecting mortality records for

251
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,371
a lot longer than cancer incidence data in population-based registry, right?

252
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,920
So, we have mortality data for a long time ago.

253
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,300
So, you can really see this is men.

254
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,636
You can really see the scope of the tobacco epidemics influence on

255
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:28,380
lung cancer.

256
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,870
I mean, I think that's astounding.

257
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,060
Lung cancer used to be rare.

258
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,148
It used to be the weird cancer that the doctor will call all the residents in or

259
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,172
whatever be like, my God, you gotta see this,

260
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,461
we've got a case of lung cancer and as smoking took off.

261
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,957
I mean, it's, [COUGH] Far and away, the biggest one,

262
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,930
like a third of cancer death, is lung cancer.

263
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,020
If we erased magically cigarette smoking.

264
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,883
I mean, leaving aside the influence on other cancers and

265
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:56,120
all of the other things that it has an effect on.

266
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,934
I mean, you could just magically erase the third of cancer deaths, order to assert,

267
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:07,050
which from a public health perspective is kind of depressing a little bit.

268
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,780
We've made a lot of progress, which is good news.

269
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,451
I mean, you can see the progress there, right?

270
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,580
But, stomach cancer is another one that's kind of had a impressive trajectory.

271
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,766
Does anybody know what that's about?

272
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:24,651
Any ideas?

273
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:30,590
One thought people have is the food preservation and refrigeration.

274
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,790
So, we used to salt food to preserve it.

275
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,781
And there are actually some, in particular places in the world they eat.

276
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:42,853
I think Cantonese style salted fish is one that is still like, I Arc says don't eat

277
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:47,130
that, because it increases, especially children, increases the risk of cancer.

278
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,073
So, I think sometimes these older or assaulting kind of methods were really

279
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:53,990
common for preservation back in the day were not great.

280
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,846
The other thing is Hpylori,

281
00:14:55,846 --> 00:15:01,170
is a bacterial infection that actually increases the risk of stomach cancer.

282
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,047
Causes ulcers too.

283
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:07,311
But when did antibiotics come around?

284
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:11,185
Like World War II, like about here and comes down there.

285
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:16,373
And we didn't know that H pylori was causing stomach cancer.

286
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,775
But if you're taking antibiotics for something else,

287
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:21,237
you might be conveniently killing your H pylori as well.

288
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:23,017
So, good news, we have less stomach cancer.

289
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:32,299
Here's women again, long you can see just it never gets

290
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:36,778
nearly as high as in men, the scale on these is the same.

291
00:15:36,778 --> 00:15:43,343
But it is certainly lagging in terms of progress in women's one cancer,

292
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,767
but it's starting to come down now, good news.

293
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:54,287
Anything else on here, Yeah,

294
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,216
>> Is the dip in the uterine cancer.

295
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:02,425
Do you know much about that and how it started out, kind of,

296
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:06,998
>> Nope, sorry some of these we

297
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:10,432
don't know, yeah.

298
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:17,968
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> How do people die of cancer?

299
00:16:17,968 --> 00:16:22,875
So that is so basically like if you had a tumor that never metastasized and

300
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,825
invaded your organs probably wouldn't cause a problem.

301
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:30,682
But essentially what happens is that the cancer cells kind of escape the original

302
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:33,757
site through circulation, lymphatic fluid, whatever it is.

303
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:36,965
And then they essentially colonize another organ.

304
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:41,897
And basically over time that stops those organs from working properly

305
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:45,419
because there's more tumor than normal tissue.

306
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:50,458
So that's eventually what

307
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:54,621
happens kind of system

308
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:59,228
failure, yeah, okay.

309
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:03,824
All right, so this is just showing you that the tobacco use and lung cancer

310
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:08,809
death rates nearer each other almost perfectly by about a 10-20 year lag.

311
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,059
There are important racial disparities and

312
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,228
differences by sex [COUGH] in cancer rates.

313
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:19,816
So generally men are at higher risk for cancer than women historically.

314
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:23,210
That has been because of in part because of higher cigarette smoking in

315
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,135
men than in women.

316
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:27,573
But there also is perhaps some hormonal factors or something like that

317
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:31,375
are associated, although no one's really nailed down exactly why this is.

318
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,976
But generally if not in terms of incidents,

319
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:39,843
there is an important black white racial disparity in the US

320
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:45,020
such that African Americans have worse outcomes from cancer.

321
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,438
Generally speaking here are the death rates, black men,

322
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:50,820
white men, black women, white women.

323
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:59,747
I've talked a lot about the US cancer is an important global issue as well.

324
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:04,354
But the kinds of cancer that are important in developing countries tend to

325
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:08,304
be different than what's important in developed countries.

326
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:12,797
There are a lot of infection associated cancers that may be more

327
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:16,460
common in some developing settings than in the US.

328
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,589
So for example,

329
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:22,844
cervical cancer is one of the most important cancers among women worldwide.

330
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:24,991
It's not really an issue in the US.

331
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:27,490
Because we have a very robust screening program.

332
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,687
Pap smears are very effective.

333
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:33,038
Pap smears are much less effective in a developing setting.

334
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,725
Their sensitivity is really poor.

335
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:39,077
So you have to come back basically once a year or pretty frequently in order to have

336
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,982
them frequently to determine if you have changes in the cervical cells.

337
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:46,557
So women who are developing setting who may not be able to come that

338
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:50,205
regularly to the doctor for screening, it doesn't work as well.

339
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:53,399
And the other issue is that the way you read, perhaps you have a pathologist look

340
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,365
at the cells and say if they look at normal or not.

341
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:59,766
So if you don't have a lot of pathologists available to read cervical smears,

342
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:02,047
then perhaps smears don't work great.

343
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:05,504
So people are working on other kinds of screening programs,

344
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:07,751
high risk HPV DNA testing for example.

345
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:12,366
In these other settings and trying to come up with a better way liver cancer is

346
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:17,137
another one that is very common in ASIA for example parts of Asia and in Africa.

347
00:19:17,137 --> 00:19:22,443
That is associated with in large part hepatitis B and C infections.

348
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:25,817
[COUGH] So you can see that some of these infection related cancers

349
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:26,949
are more important.

350
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:32,081
So the green here is liver, that's the most common cancer in these

351
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:37,410
areas here over, lung cancer is still an issue everywhere, right.

352
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,928
[COUGH] Anything else here you guys think is interesting.

353
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:45,751
Yes.

354
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,400
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Yeah.

355
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,709
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> No they do it's just, colorectal is

356
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:59,706
a common one and a lot of developed countries perhaps they've done better?

357
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:04,519
Maybe what this is suggesting is that they've done a better job of getting rid

358
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,421
of lung cancer, tobacco control and so Colin floats more higher up to the top.

359
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:13,597
[COUGH] The other thing is that [COUGH] excuse me and I can't off the top of my

360
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:17,858
head remember if Australia does or does not do PSA screening routinely.

361
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,117
But most of european countries do not do routine PSA.

362
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:23,546
Screening for prostate cancer because of the over diagnosis issue.

363
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:29,191
So prostate cancer is always kind of top of the list for the US.

364
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,394
But that's because we screen other places.

365
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,109
That doesn't appear to be as big of an issue because they don't screen.

366
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,345
So sometimes the differences are in screening practices.

367
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:42,183
Sometimes it's a real like risk factor difference in the populations [COUGH]

368
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:45,361
>> To those countries where and

369
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:53,185
like the southern part of the African continent where the [INAUDIBLE].

370
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:57,400
>> Yeah, was an HIV associated cancer.

371
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:05,105
I saw one more question over here, yeah.

372
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:10,056
>> I'm not sure [INAUDIBLE] >> So we actually don't know a lot about

373
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:15,746
lung cancer in relation to bathing and jewel and E cigarettes.

374
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:20,074
The reason being because people who are old enough now to get lung cancer

375
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:24,551
are people who basically didn't have bathing available to them when they

376
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,507
were younger.

377
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:28,548
And most of the older people who are vaping are using it as a smoking

378
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:29,386
cessation tool.

379
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,173
So you absolutely cannot.

380
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:35,533
And people who are getting lung cancer now you cannot tease apart vaping e

381
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:38,621
cigarette use and traditional tobacco use right.

382
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,749
You can't look at only vaping and

383
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,666
see how it affects one cancer risk right, >> To new,

384
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,611
>> To new people who are getting lung

385
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,426
cancer now like 68, right.

386
00:21:47,426 --> 00:21:49,284
So when they were young,

387
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:54,070
I mean it's only been available for the last what like a decade.

388
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,790
So, it's what you do in your earlier years,

389
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,095
maybe that is really affecting your lung cancer risk.

390
00:22:00,095 --> 00:22:02,680
So these people have usually a profound lifetime history of smoking and so

391
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,317
they're trying e cigarettes as a way to quit.

392
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,519
So you can't look at E cigarettes or jewel or

393
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,386
anything like that in the absence of cigarette smoking.

394
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:13,346
That's you guys and people younger than you who are doing that, right.

395
00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:16,205
And you guys are not gonna get lung cancer until you're 68.

396
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:21,373
So the problem is we're not gonna have population based data

397
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:27,973
to see what happens with E cigarettes and lung cancer for another 40 years.

398
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,613
So we're trying to do animal studies.

399
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:35,786
Animal studies suggest there are carcinogenic changes with vape use.

400
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:42,593
We have all of these long, lung diseases that have happened recently spate of

401
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:48,785
people dying of acute lung disease from this particular ingredient.

402
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:54,425
So, I mean, I think if we're all smart, we know it's not gonna be great, right?

403
00:22:54,425 --> 00:23:00,107
I can probably guess that you're gonna have less lung cancer if you

404
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:05,598
don't inhale something into your lungs than if you do, right.

405
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:09,416
So, I don't know, do we need to wait 40 years of public health

406
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:12,341
professionals to tell people this is a bad idea.

407
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:16,451
>> I don't know. >> So we don't have epidemiological data,

408
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:19,630
We're not going to for a long time.

409
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,262
I suggest we don't need it.

410
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:26,300
Yeah. >> So kind of with the risk question it's

411
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,306
really interesting what's the most common one?

412
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:34,079
Like there's maybe like one country surrounded by a bunch of very common

413
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,027
liver cases.

414
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:38,644
That's not Hodgins, >> Non Hodgkin's lymphoma is an AIDS

415
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:39,952
associated cancer.

416
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,063
It's an AIDS defining illness.

417
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:44,977
>> I guess I was kind of curious how close most

418
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:45,992
countries, >> [CROSSTALK]

419
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,440
>> Probably pretty common.

420
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,895
But here's the other thing that you don't see is that the quality of data varies

421
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:54,502
widely in these countries.

422
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:57,517
Some of them have like one registry or one hospital that you're getting data from.

423
00:23:57,517 --> 00:24:00,278
It's not a population based registry.

424
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:03,959
So in the US and Europe you're getting excellent data.

425
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:08,262
There's another I believe from this exact publication.

426
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,482
Another map that shows you the variation of data quality.

427
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,289
Some of these African countries, they're using information from

428
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:16,255
a neighbouring country because they have zero information from them.

429
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:20,614
So they're kind of using all of the neighboring countries around them to

430
00:24:20,614 --> 00:24:21,260
use math.

431
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,262
And modeling to estimate the incidence rate of these cancers in those

432
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:26,442
countries, okay.

433
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:30,546
Very few countries in the world have high quality population based cancer registries

434
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:33,630
and that is a challenge for studying cancer in a global setting.

435
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,072
But it is set to become a major issue in the next few years.

436
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:41,887
And so we really need to that that's an important thing that

437
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,826
people are working on.

438
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:46,400
I just want you to note all of the yellow, that is lung cancer.

439
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:53,681
We have done a pretty good job with tobacco control.

440
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:56,585
Other countries have done a pretty good job with tobacco control.

441
00:24:56,585 --> 00:25:01,544
Some countries still have tobacco use increasing because I

442
00:25:01,544 --> 00:25:06,611
guarantee you Philip Morris and all the tobacco companies.

443
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:10,963
They're not sitting there going, I can't buy another boat now because they're

444
00:25:10,963 --> 00:25:13,115
not buying as many cigarettes in the US.

445
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:16,521
They're taking their product and selling it other places, right.

446
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:19,013
And so as these countries move through development and

447
00:25:19,013 --> 00:25:22,275
suddenly people have more income to use to buy things like cigarettes.

448
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:24,160
They're moving in and selling them to them.

449
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,261
And those countries may not have strong tobacco control policies.

450
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,759
Cuz they have other issues that they've been dealing with and

451
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:33,028
this has not been an issue in their country up until now.

452
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:36,498
So in some developing settings, you're seeing smoking increase a lot and

453
00:25:36,498 --> 00:25:37,936
that's gonna be a huge issue.

454
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:48,494
Okay, so now we're gonna get the cancer genetics part a bit late,

455
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:50,091
we'll do our best.

456
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:55,301
So, this is a review from Nature Medicine.

457
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:59,316
Bert Vogelstein, the first author on this, has anybody heard of P- 53,

458
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:03,608
if not you will, by the end of this, it is one of the most important cancer genes.

459
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:04,897
His lab discovered it.

460
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,160
So he's just sort of waiting for his Nobel prize.

461
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,536
>> [LAUGH] >> He's very important.

462
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:14,962
So this is something that he authored and right up front, he says,

463
00:26:14,962 --> 00:26:17,662
cancer is in essence a genetic disease.

464
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:21,473
The revolution in cancer research can be summed up in a single sentence,

465
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:23,606
cancer is in essence a genetic disease.

466
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:26,276
So, in order to understand what goes wrong in cancer,

467
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:28,727
we need to talk a little bit about normal systems.

468
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:33,818
So, normal growth, you have to have cell division and growth, right.

469
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:37,281
So, normal growth refers to an increase in size.

470
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:41,731
It can be applicable to individual cells, groups of cells and tissues, whole organs,

471
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:43,786
parts of organisms, whole organisms.

472
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:46,686
It can occur by multiplication and increase in cell number.

473
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:51,249
This is mostly what we're gonna be talking about in relation to cancer, but

474
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:53,692
it can also occur by these other things.

475
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:56,427
So, in normal growth and development, there are these three requirements.

476
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:59,285
You have carefully regulated increase in cell number,

477
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:03,437
differentiation of appropriate cell types, right to make a tissue or an organ.

478
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:07,795
You have to have lots of cell types and careful spatial arrangement of the correct

479
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:12,172
number of the correct cell types and these are the things that go wrong in cancer.

480
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,781
So, we have all heard about the cell cycle.

481
00:27:14,781 --> 00:27:18,427
These are the critical steps in cell division that ensure accurate doubling of

482
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:19,983
a cell's genetic information.

483
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:24,503
I'm not gonna go through this in detail, but you've probably all

484
00:27:24,503 --> 00:27:29,362
learned about it or many of you have learned about it in a Biology class.

485
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:30,708
This is the picture of it.

486
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:33,665
So essentially you have the beginning of the cell cycle.

487
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:35,511
They enlarge and make new proteins.

488
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:36,839
This is the restriction point.

489
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,699
Whether cell can either committed itself to complete the cell cycle or not.

490
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,846
It will then replicate its DNA.

491
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:47,687
And divide into two daughter cells.

492
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:52,374
So at that restriction point the cell can be like guess we're moving forward or

493
00:27:52,374 --> 00:27:56,080
it can be like something's wrong and it can abort basically.

494
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,113
So apoptosis is the prop is the is the process by which it decides the cells not

495
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:06,084
right, something's wrong, right and just kind of gets rid of that cell.

496
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,480
It's a normal process, it's a good thing.

497
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,288
It's a physiologic process that results in the deletion of individual

498
00:28:12,288 --> 00:28:13,692
cells in growth control.

499
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,319
>> Reduced apoptosis contributes to cell accumulation and maybe cancer.

500
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,919
Okay, so loss of apoptosis is one of the things that can happen in cancer.

501
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,722
It's one of the ways that cancer can grow out of control is that they're

502
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,776
not getting rid of cells that they should be.

503
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:34,864
So there's lots of control systems that regulate this process, right.

504
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:41,330
Both by positive factors that stimulated and negative factors that inhibit it.

505
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,138
So biochemical pathways are the control system.

506
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,738
They are the regulators, they act as the accelerator or

507
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:48,797
the brake to ensure the correct functions.

508
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:51,433
And those pathways are themselves controlled by positive and

509
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:52,299
negative factors.

510
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,963
All of the components of these pathways are the protein products of genes.

511
00:28:55,963 --> 00:29:00,296
Okay, and the genes are also controlled by positive factors.

512
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:01,766
So this sounds really complicated.

513
00:29:01,766 --> 00:29:05,913
But if you can imagine there's some sort of growth factor that has to

514
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:08,690
bind to a receptor on the surface of the cell.

515
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,593
Then signaling enzymes are produced in some sort of cascade that then

516
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:17,746
tells transcription factors to go ahead and copy the DNA.

517
00:29:17,746 --> 00:29:21,137
This growth factor is a protein that is the product of a gene.

518
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:23,645
This receptor is a protein that is the product of a gene.

519
00:29:23,645 --> 00:29:26,414
The signaling enzymes are products of genes, right.

520
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:31,397
So if any of these genes is altered, you could have some alteration in how strongly

521
00:29:31,397 --> 00:29:35,312
how much growth is happening or how little growth is happening.

522
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:36,209
Does that make sense?

523
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:39,393
You can have a version of this growth factor that really pushes growth forward.

524
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:41,532
You could have, you know, too little of the receptor.

525
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,515
So less growth happens, too much of the receptor.

526
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:47,466
So there's more opportunity for growth to happen.

527
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:53,154
So this these are examples of how genetic changes can influence cancer risk.

528
00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:56,456
Now these kinds of genetic changes that we're talking about are not those

529
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:59,180
hereditary syndromes that we're gonna talk about next time.

530
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,171
Those hereditary syndromes are when you have a genetic mutation in a really

531
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:05,030
critical cancer-causing gene.

532
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,329
But all of these little things can add up.

533
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:09,857
Okay, so

534
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:15,702
now we're gonna talk about sort of the steps along the process to getting cancer.

535
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:20,309
And all of these would be detected through microscopic examination of a biopsy

536
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:21,720
specimen, all right?

537
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,600
So kind of the first step is hyperplasia of normal and then hyperplasia.

538
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,420
So this is tissue growth based on an excessive rate of cell division leading to

539
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,970
an increased number of cells.

540
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,754
But the cell structure, the arrangement of cells within the tissue remain normal, and

541
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:38,710
hyperplasia is potentially reversible.

542
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,271
It can be a normal tissue response to any of these things, right?

543
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:48,230
Neoplasia on the other hand, is way further down the process.

544
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,993
It's a growth disorder characterized by genetic alterations that lead to loss of

545
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:55,538
the normal control mechanisms that regulate cell growth, morphogenesis,

546
00:30:55,538 --> 00:30:56,650
and differentiation.

547
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,377
It's a multistep process involving the accumulation of genetic events in

548
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:03,700
critical genes including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.

549
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,762
So neoplasia is cancer.

550
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:11,442
So there's this sort of seminal paper that came out in 2000 by Hannah Weinberg

551
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:16,611
that talked about the hallmarks of cancer and they listed these hallmarks of cancer.

552
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:18,551
So self-sufficiency and growth signals.

553
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:22,280
They don't need growth signals to come from the outside they kind of make their

554
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,530
own until itself to grow.

555
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,890
Insensitivity to anti-growth signals and the evasion of apoptosis.

556
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:33,154
So they're driving forward while removing the restrictions, right?

557
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:36,561
Unrestricted replications sustained angiogenesis,

558
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,103
does anybody know what angiogenesis is?

559
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:42,021
Formation of blood vessels.

560
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:44,689
If you got a big tumor it needs a blood supply,

561
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:47,437
it has to make its own blood vessels to feed it.

562
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:49,922
And tissue invasion and metastasis.

563
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:51,516
Okay, so these are the hallmarks of cancer.

564
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:53,746
This was their pretty picture that they made.

565
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,560
They've since come out with another version which is like it includes these

566
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,742
but also the new hallmarks of cancer which talks about immune modulation and

567
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:08,171
inflammation and things like that as well.

568
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,280
So carcinogenesis is the process by which a normal cell is converted into

569
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,370
a neoplastic cell.

570
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,993
So a carcinogen is an agent that can cause neoplasia.

571
00:32:18,993 --> 00:32:21,803
Carcinogens can be genotoxic or non-genotoxic.

572
00:32:21,803 --> 00:32:27,206
So genotoxic carcinogens directly affect the DNA, okay?

573
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:31,211
Whereas non-genotoxic sort of promote the spread of existing mutations.

574
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,150
And most carcinogens are probably non-genotoxic that we think of.

575
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,048
Right, so these are things like those growth factors that might push the cell to

576
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:40,940
replicate more.

577
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,194
If there's a DNA change that's related to cancer in that cell,

578
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:47,327
it will then be proliferated and there will be more chances for

579
00:32:47,327 --> 00:32:50,661
it to accumulate additional mutations when it divides, right?

580
00:32:52,981 --> 00:32:56,393
Most neoplasms occur as a consequence of environmental exposures,

581
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:57,636
we think 50% or more.

582
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,932
So remember I showed you this pathway, I said again this growth factor would be

583
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:07,193
an example of a non-genotoxic carcinogen perhaps, right?

584
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:11,265
Cuz it's pushing growth if you have a little bit too much of this if you have

585
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:15,272
a genetic change that increases the activity of this growth factor or for

586
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:18,051
whatever reason, your body is making more of it.

587
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:19,970
Estrogen is a growth factor so

588
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,271
all of those reproductive pathways we talked about reproductive risk factors for

589
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:30,590
breast cancer are kind of related to estrogen production and estrogen exposure.

590
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,790
So having more estrogen around increases your cell proliferation.

591
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,781
Okay, so estrogen is normal, we want it, right?

592
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:43,770
It's just that changes in how much you have can increase cell proliferation and

593
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,832
therefore propagate perhaps other mutations.

594
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:50,147
For some examples, okay?

595
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:57,261
Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, these would be genotoxic, Right?

596
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,712
Some chemicals arsenic, for example, viruses.

597
00:34:03,712 --> 00:34:04,920
>> [COUGH] >> So

598
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,081
mutations and genes that control normal self proliferation can lead to cancer.

599
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,215
Some mutations are caused by DNA damaging carcinogens but

600
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:17,420
others are spontaneous errors in normal DNA molecules when cells duplicate.

601
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:22,803
So some cancer-causing mutations are just random, right?

602
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,521
Some mutations contributing to cancer in general affect three classes of genes.

603
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:34,751
You have oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes.

604
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:37,020
And we're gonna go through these.

605
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,117
There they are really big with bullets.

606
00:34:41,117 --> 00:34:43,651
>> [LAUGH] >> So

607
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,471
you can think about tumor suppressor genes.

608
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:47,483
We're gonna have a car metaphor now.

609
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,560
This is Bert Vogelstein's car metaphor.

610
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,831
He taught the class.

611
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:53,976
So he's at Johns Hopkins, he doesn't really travel very much so if you happen

612
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,690
to be if there's a meeting or something in DC area he might go to it and

613
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,820
give a talk but otherwise you're not gonna hear Bert Vogelstein give a talk.

614
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,757
But he did teach the cancer biology portion of my cancer epic class

615
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,471
when I was at Hopkins.

616
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,722
So I'm sorry you're getting the watered-down version but

617
00:35:08,722 --> 00:35:09,701
I stole his car metaphor.

618
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,610
All right, so you can think of tumor suppressor genes as the brakes.

619
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:19,000
Okay, a family of normal genes that instruct cells to produce proteins that

620
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,150
restrain cell division and growth.

621
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,437
The loss of these proteins allows the cells to divide in an uncontrolled

622
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:24,940
fashion.

623
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,566
[COUGH] You have to lose both copies of a tumor suppressor gene in order to lose

624
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:29,840
function.

625
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,510
Okay, you can imagine it's like you have a break in an emergency brake, right?

626
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:40,199
They both make the stopping protein both copies so you have to lose both.

627
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:43,436
If you lose tumor suppressor gene functions is like having a break puddle

628
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:47,273
that doesn't function properly allowing the cells to grow and divide continually.

629
00:35:47,273 --> 00:35:50,580
Oncogenes on the other hand are the accelerator, okay?

630
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,005
These are genes whose presence in certain forms or

631
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:56,080
their over activity can stimulate the development of cancer.

632
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,240
When oncogenes arise in normal cells, they can cause the cells to become malignant.

633
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,276
Okay, they instruct cells to make proteins that stimulate excessive cell growth and

634
00:36:04,276 --> 00:36:04,845
division.

635
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:09,553
Every time you divide and replicate the DNA, there's a chance for a mistake,

636
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:10,100
right?

637
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,415
So if you're doing it more than you should, there's lots of chances for

638
00:36:14,415 --> 00:36:15,140
mistakes.

639
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,689
And if you're doing it more quickly than you ought to in a hurry like [SOUND],

640
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:22,233
you're gonna make more errors, right?

641
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:27,883
[COUGH] Okay, so the other thing to note here is some nomenclature.

642
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:31,770
We need gene products of these, these genes exist in normal forms, right?

643
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,340
We need gene products that tell cells to grow divide, that's important.

644
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,828
When they are normal and not mutated, they're called proto-oncogenes, and

645
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:41,450
then when they become mutated they're called oncogenes.

646
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,281
Does that make sense?

647
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:48,671
Okay, DNA repair genes are the mechanics.

648
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:49,741
Are you loving this car thing?

649
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,117
It's really great, right?

650
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:55,539
Okay, so they code for proteins whose normal function is to correct errors that

651
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:59,050
arise when cells duplicate their DNA prior to cell divisions.

652
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,030
If you have mutations in DNA repair genes, you're gonna have a failure in DNA repair.

653
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:08,059
So you're gonna have mutations in a lot of genes, but if you happen to

654
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:13,716
get a mutation in an oncogene or a proto-oncogene or tumor suppressor gene.

655
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:16,835
If you have poor DNA repair, it won't be fixed and

656
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:20,570
it will be allowed to continue and therefore cause cancer.

657
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,104
So DNA repair genes don't direct, they're not like genes in those critical cell

658
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:28,194
functions that actually that deal with cell division or

659
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:30,320
restraint of cell division, right?

660
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,571
But if they don't work,

661
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:35,572
you're much more likely end up with a mutation in one of those important genes.

662
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:40,230
Yeah, [COUGH] all right.

663
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:46,590
So cancer involves multiple mutations or genetic or epigenetic events, okay?

664
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,582
It arises because of the accumulation of these mutations involving oncogenes,

665
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:51,930
tumor suppressor genes, >> [COUGH]

666
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,339
>> And DNA repair genes.

667
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,003
This is called multistage carcinogenesis.

668
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:58,718
The multistage model occurs in a genesis, okay?

669
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:00,488
It's estimated that 3 to 7 hits or

670
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,801
mutations in these critical genes are required for a malignancy.

671
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,670
So you have to have mutations in both tumor suppressor genes and

672
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,050
oncogenes in order to get cancer.

673
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,960
So the brakes have to be released and the accelerator has to be stuck down, okay?

674
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,418
The accumulated damage leads to a malignant tumor.

675
00:38:21,418 --> 00:38:25,270
So this is an ugly old picture but [COUGH] it's one that many people use.

676
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,971
So you have normal cells, they divide, and

677
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:32,960
this cell when it replicated its DNA had a mutation in a critical gene.

678
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,221
All of its daughter cells will have that mutation and any of them could then

679
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:42,229
acquire a second and a third and a fourth, and so on and then you have cancer.

680
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:46,967
The thing about this is that it's like a snowball rolling downhill.

681
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:51,482
As you add these mutations, the time to accumulate a second one is shorter because

682
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:54,640
it just starts to kinda spiral out of control.

683
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,601
Does that make sense?

684
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,070
We'll talk about how that works here.

685
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,025
So say you have a mutation that inactivates a tumor suppressor gene, which

686
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:07,330
means your cells are proliferating and you might have in this case hyperplasia.

687
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,995
Yeah, too many cells.

688
00:39:10,945 --> 00:39:13,934
Because they're proliferating more quickly than they should,

689
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,290
you have more chances for more mutations to occur.

690
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:20,010
And then you get a mutation that inactivates the DNA repair gene.

691
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:25,676
Now you're in trouble because you're continuing to proliferate too quickly and

692
00:39:25,676 --> 00:39:29,134
you're not checking the DNA as you do it, right?

693
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:32,015
Then you get a mutation and proto-oncogene that creates an oncogene,

694
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,416
everything's going faster now.

695
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:34,840
And then you have mutations and

696
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,420
it activates several more tumor suppressor genes and you end up with cancer.

697
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,442
But do you see how the addition of each little loss of control in one of these

698
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:46,960
important genes just speeds up the process.

699
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,774
People have done this kind of work showing that actually the progression in

700
00:39:50,774 --> 00:39:55,340
pre-cancerous solutions, for example, the progression from one stage to the other.

701
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,119
The time becomes shorter in yet each interval.

702
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,721
So the number one risk factor for cancer.

703
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:05,187
What's the number one risk factor for cancer?

704
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,620
Not smoking, I heard it.

705
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,810
Yeah, getting old, stop doing that.

706
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,210
It's really bad for you.

707
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,972
>> [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] Wait that's not a modifiable

708
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:17,302
risk factor, oops.

709
00:40:17,302 --> 00:40:22,184
So the reason age is a risk factor is cuz it just takes a lifetime to accumulate

710
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:24,413
those 3 to 7 mutations, right?

711
00:40:26,461 --> 00:40:29,965
It just takes a while that's why risk just increases with age.

712
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:38,094
All right I got one minute let's see where I'm at in this.

713
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,677
Okay, we're almost to my, if you guys can bear with me I'm gonna finish up

714
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,890
the didactic slide cuz there's only a few left and

715
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,650
then I'll leave my examples to later.

716
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:53,251
So these APC, this is an example of what we know about colon cancer.

717
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:57,497
The reason we know about this is because we can take out polyps and kinda see

718
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:02,171
the difference, we can get pre-cancerous lesions, we can get early cancers.

719
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,280
We can get late cancers and

720
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,680
you can look at the genetic changes in the tumor in all those different tissues.

721
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,331
So there's lots of changes.

722
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:12,476
I'm not trying to tell you that there's only these changes in any of these tissues

723
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:14,435
as you get further along, it just becomes a mess and

724
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:15,920
there's a million genetic changes.

725
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,144
But these seem to be the key ones that are shared by all of the tumors that kinda

726
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,130
move to that next step, all right?

727
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,784
So the first thing that tends to happen is you lose APC,

728
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:30,168
you get hyper proliferating epithelium and then you get polyps.

729
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:34,272
And then K-ras, K-ras is an oncogene or protooncogene the blue or

730
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:35,870
tumor suppressor genes.

731
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,860
This gets activated and then you kinda move to this intermediate adenoma.

732
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,480
You delete 18q, you get late adenoma.

733
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,464
And then when you lose TP53, all bets are off and you have cancer.

734
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,770
Okay, so this is from a paper by Eric Feoron,

735
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:54,440
he's currently our cancer center director at the Robo Cancer center.

736
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,431
He was a postdoc in Dr. Vogelstein's lab.

737
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,240
It all comes full circle.

738
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,110
So it's rare for a carcinogen to act by itself like smoking or

739
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,881
something like that to be both necessary and sufficient.

740
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:10,040
So genetic variability in the population and other host factors contribute.

741
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,983
So you can imagine that if this is the general population,

742
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:15,995
some people have genes that make them resistant to cancer.

743
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:18,963
That's people who are like my grandmother smoked a pack of lucky strikes every day

744
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:21,210
and drank a fifth of whiskey and she was fine when she was 95.

745
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:27,023
And we're like that's great for grandma, but she's probably not the norm, right?

746
00:42:27,023 --> 00:42:31,363
And then you have people who are more susceptible and these might be people with

747
00:42:31,363 --> 00:42:35,190
a family history or who have a little bit of genetic predisposition.

748
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,769
But these are those hereditary cancers that we're gonna talk about next time and

749
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:42,538
those are kind of a different sort of situation.

750
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:46,797
All right, so I'll stop there and

751
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,968
we can go over some of this next time from my examples.

752
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,030
Thanks guys.
