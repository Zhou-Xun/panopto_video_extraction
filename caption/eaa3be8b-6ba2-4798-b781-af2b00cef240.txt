1
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,690
So food marketing good be.

2
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,250
So today I have a link for this lecture.

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:57,790
A few things. So Exam one is to kind of finish the grading, but hopefully likes to revise the grade sometime end of this week.

4
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,570
Okay. And then we're not meeting Thursday.

5
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,990
You do have said no in-person class, but you do have a lecture to watch.

6
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,270
So it's the two weeks. So run the episode.

7
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,890
One of the ethical or legal issues topics on eugenics.

8
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:29,530
We do have a video recording to watch and there's the excuse me, a quiz.

9
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,550
Quiz five is related to the lecture on eugenics.

10
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,159
I changed the quiz time so that it's due at 10 p.m. instead of 830.

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:45,490
So you could use the class time to watch the lecture and do the quiz for Thursday.

12
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,070
And I believe there's the reading. We can talk about it the next time we meet.

13
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:58,270
Okay. And then we have full break. So we're not meeting Tuesday.

14
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,030
And then once we meet again on Thursday, we will finish the screening part.

15
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:12,040
You have a short lecture to watch for next Thursday and of course, then all the adult screenings.

16
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,079
So that would include like the cystic fibrosis, the Tay-Sachs.

17
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,400
And like all the oldest of those screening, there's no reading because it's just one meeting for both.

18
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,940
Is that clear? Any questions on that? Okay.

19
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,809
And then I did post the study guide for exam to see you could find it here and that

20
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:44,200
could help you kind of know what to focus on as we go through the these topics.

21
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:55,150
Remember that it's time. So make sure to kind of know the answers to the to the points and things in the study guide.

22
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:08,530
And then the last thing. So Exam two will cover like topics we covered after exam once a week, six to week 11 except the genetic association studies.

23
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,890
Okay. So this topic here would be will be on exam three.

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,059
Okay. So I'll remind you, it's in the study guide,

25
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:30,180
but we had to move it this way so that we accommodate the guest speakers and tools because 1011 will be all guest speakers.

26
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,879
Okay. Any questions on that?

27
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:42,630
And we have a problem set for genetic studies, but it won't be too like we can start working on it in class, but it won't be due until after exam two.

28
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:58,400
Okay. We can kind of maybe touch on that later if you if it's been if you need to refresh your memory on any questions.

29
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:16,600
Okay. So. So today you lose a lecture on cystic fibrosis that you had to watch.

30
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:28,500
It's a prerecorded lecture. And we will talk about Tay-Sachs today and we'll talk about the carrier testing meeting, which we're also facing.

31
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,580
So let's kind of talk briefly about cystic fibrosis.

32
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:52,240
Were there any questions or comments that you had, as you know, that you had as you kind of listened to the lecture?

33
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:18,630
Oh, no. So let's quickly go over the slides, you see.

34
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,910
So, I don't know.

35
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:31,889
Maybe. So which which ancestry has the most comment?

36
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,970
Like health has the highest prevalence of cystic fibrosis or most more likely to be carriers.

37
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:52,479
Europeans. Europeans, yeah. So this is kind of those conditions that show variation in kind of the frequency of the mutations and the highest.

38
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:05,260
And even individuals of European ancestry or Caucasian Americans in the slides and then on the carrier frequency is so much slower.

39
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:17,350
I guess I would have to keep you then for for a condition like cystic fibrosis, in addition to doing newborn screening,

40
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:23,649
which we talked about last week, it's recommended that we do hear your status.

41
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,350
And what why do you think that's necessary or what's the advantage of doing screening?

42
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,620
Yeah, they're looking for prevention sort of treatment. Yeah.

43
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:41,469
So we're trying to catch it even early on first and then kind of hit upon primary prevention.

44
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,540
So try to prevent those infants from being born.

45
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,770
But yeah, as you can imagine,

46
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:59,050
there's like a whole set of complications and issues related to when Dad went to test for that and how to test for carrier screening.

47
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:18,560
So. So in terms of affected affected pathways, gee, what do you do?

48
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,020
Can you tell me, was it more than one gene affected or was it.

49
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:31,870
If you remember, you talked about genetic heterogeneity so you could have a locus page maybe where you can

50
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,809
have more than one gene affected or allele cannot genetic where you can have the same gene,

51
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:46,120
but multiple levels leading to the condition. So how would you classify cystic fibrosis?

52
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:57,620
Yeah. Oh, I remember there was like a variety of, like, outcomes.

53
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:09,660
Like, you could have it completely, like the. Chloride channel completely fine or like different problems in that a big five.

54
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,980
Yeah. So you you kind of talking about heterogeneity and like in terms of yeah.

55
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:26,910
In terms of how the treat kind of shows up or the manifestation and that is due to different mutations.

56
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,639
So the mutations could be missense deletion nonsense.

57
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,890
So all the different mutations we kind of talk about like only the fox.

58
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:57,700
But I guess if if you try to think whether it's more than one G being affected or if it's more of thing, if it's more than one gene being affected.

59
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,139
Yeah. Oh. Is it weird to think of it as one gene?

60
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:09,220
But like I remember it saying that there were multiple episodes and so mutations and those different types of the different outcomes.

61
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,879
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So it is one gene.

62
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,720
So it's the gene that codes for the channel so that this channel.

63
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,220
So the gene coding for this channel. So that one gene.

64
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:35,800
But then you could have, I don't know where it shows it on the slide but it like thinks like 1700 different mutations that could happen in this gene.

65
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:48,910
Yeah. So there's. So we're talking kind of a li like heterogeneity for cystic fibrosis.

66
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,389
So let's see.

67
00:09:52,390 --> 00:10:03,930
And then so, so we have this channel or channel that kind of regulates chloride like with it, like moving it in and out of the cell.

68
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:14,860
And so like this malfunctioning kind of, of this poor results and excess.

69
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:22,389
Kind of sold like the example and recorded where kids have kind of salt and it's like

70
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:30,730
in their sweat that's higher than normal and can affect the water ness of the mucus.

71
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:43,900
So it being so kind of makes it hard for hormones or enzymes to move ducks and and that's how it kind of affects those different organ systems.

72
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,170
Okay. And then kind of important to know, I know it does affect different systems,

73
00:10:50,170 --> 00:11:02,380
but if we think of the most likely to be affected organ systems, we're really talking about the pancreas and in the lungs.

74
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,400
Okay. Any questions so far?

75
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:21,100
So I'm. And then even it's kind of similar to what we talked about in PKU.

76
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:28,540
I believe that different factors can kind of come come together and affect how

77
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,060
the entry looks or how cystic fibrosis will look for different individuals.

78
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,169
It could be related to the CFC levels themselves.

79
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,930
Change from fetal development to adulthood could have hormones or cytokines.

80
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:53,210
These are kind of. Kind of inflammatory markers that can affect.

81
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:09,350
Kind of how cystic fibrosis looks. And then other factors that we kind of think about is cell types and across different tissues and systems.

82
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:20,660
Hi, I'm and then the female females are have tend to kind of have worse outcomes in terms of cystic fibrosis.

83
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,430
You would think that's related to sex hormones, specifically estrogen.

84
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,930
And then intonation is okay.

85
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:38,969
So this is kind of important to note.

86
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,270
Also, the most common mutation for cystic fibrosis is the Delta IV 508.

87
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,400
Can you tell me what, what, what does this mutation.

88
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,940
What is this mutation, I guess. And in this sense.

89
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:10,860
I think it's a deletion. Yeah. So it's a deletion of the final I mean at the 508 codon.

90
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:24,640
And then if you look at the distribution of this mutation like in in about 44,000 chromosomes, it counts for 66 times the mutation.

91
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,670
And then there are other mutations, but there are less, less prevalent.

92
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:42,790
It's sort of like the distribution varies across the world, across countries, but kind of still high.

93
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:50,920
And in Europeans and Asians, we see a similar pattern within the U.S.

94
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:06,040
So we talked about this and then this kind of shows the severity, if you want, of the mutations like the the in terms of molecular sequences.

95
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:16,030
Like you can have no synthesis whatsoever. So the gate or the poor here is totally missing and you could have a blocking processing.

96
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:27,370
So you kind of have some form of the protein, but it's not folded or it's not in the right shape to kind of be in the in the wall and function.

97
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:35,740
So the fibroid is this is this kind of mutation that results in this kind of this functioning.

98
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,630
You could have the gain or the poor, but it's not like it's.

99
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,820
Kind of blocked could have it functioning, but it's not functioning as well.

100
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,760
Or like it's similar form. It's kind of like reduced synthesis.

101
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,810
So, so much kind of different levels of severity.

102
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,750
And this is similar to what we talked about,

103
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,540
like different it's kind of hard to make a direct relationship between genotype and phenotype relationships,

104
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:20,810
but we know that at least pancreatic function seems to be most directly influenced by genotype.

105
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,969
So. So if you have affected siblings,

106
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:31,860
they they're likely to have similar genotype and also similar degrees of paying attention to other

107
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:38,430
systems that could be affected by cystic fibrosis like lung involvement and age and all that.

108
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:50,790
They're they're more likely to vary as a result of different things or different genotypes or different mechanisms that affect their functioning.

109
00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:04,610
See. And then no real treatment, just symptom management.

110
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:15,920
And we do have some class of medications that we also try to match depending on how much we think about this figure.

111
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:26,959
So depending on what mutation that individuals have, we kind of try to match the mutation, the the the pharmaceutical drugs to the mutations.

112
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:38,750
And like a class one, we want to kind of promote that the read through and then like promote the actual making of the protein or the gate.

113
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,770
And depending on what the mutation we like, if it's the gate is kind of closed,

114
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,629
we try to open it, the medications that work on that and that's kind of like the mean points.

115
00:16:53,630 --> 00:17:05,670
Any questions on cystic fibrosis? Okay.

116
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,990
So. And so now it's facing.

117
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:32,130
Just. So how many of you are familiar with Tay-Sachs?

118
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,930
Somebody. So.

119
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:52,730
So this one of those conditions that also has a higher prevalence in specific armed groups and we kind of want to target by carrier testing.

120
00:17:52,730 --> 00:18:02,180
So we want to kind of also prevent the the the birth of infants or babies with Tay-Sachs disease.

121
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:16,250
So this like this picture here. So Tay-Sachs is that type of is a type of disease that falls under ganglia of psychosis.

122
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:23,840
So disorders that affect how lipids or fatty acids are kind of broken down.

123
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,590
So this is kind of a picture of a gangrenous side.

124
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:40,010
So one of those lipids, lipids that we've talking about and Tay-Sachs is for a specific type of kind of size that we'll talk about.

125
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:50,960
And as the body kind of fails to process or kind of break down those lipids,

126
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,159
we have them accumulating in the in the brain and they result in the loss of vision,

127
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:10,130
deafness, dementia, seizures and other conditions related to neurons or a kind of brain function.

128
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:17,750
I feel like nationally it's not super common to see Tay-Sachs,

129
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:31,190
but in Ashkenazi Jewish population we see that there's about one in 25 individuals who are carriers for Tay-Sachs mutations.

130
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,190
So it's kind of like a founder mutation,

131
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:52,240
like where you have a certain population that for some reason is less likely to upgrade with other populations or kind of isolated in some way and.

132
00:19:54,790 --> 00:20:01,119
Just being a carrier. And then there's a high probability of having two carriers.

133
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,870
And if they meet, then you would you're more likely to see these kind of rare conditions.

134
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:18,010
So carrier screening really helped in decreasing the birth of infants with Tay-Sachs.

135
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,990
So before carrier screening, it was high. It was like one 3000.

136
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:31,300
You weren't affected. And now it's kind of reduced by like about 90%.

137
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:46,030
So so for that, like usually individuals like who know they have an affected member or if the doctor knows that,

138
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:54,639
like if they see someone with a certain ancestry, they're more likely to recommend carrier screening.

139
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,500
So even though the individual themselves might not show any symptoms,

140
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,790
but just knowing that they are looking to get pregnant, then carrier screening is is recommended.

141
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,010
Okay. And we'll talk more about carrier screening as we kind of go through this lecture.

142
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,870
Many questions. Okay.

143
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,280
So Tay-Sachs could kind of start at the really early stage.

144
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,060
So infantile stage, it really begins in utero.

145
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:36,249
So as the kind of fetus is developing and the symptoms would appear early in life for those babies,

146
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:43,899
like the baby born looking somewhat normal, but then they kind of start losing whatever skills they develop.

147
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:50,770
So certain locks and things like that, it could start later on in life.

148
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:57,099
So around four. But these individuals are also less likely to make it.

149
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:04,690
And the average age of death kind of is 50 hours survival in this up to age 15.

150
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:15,070
And then the adult form is less mild. And then and so since symptoms are similar, but it's kind of a less mild form of the disease.

151
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:28,449
Um, so as we said, ganglion cells are a type of lipids, they're usually made and then biodegrade it rapidly and lysosomes.

152
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:38,319
So those things, special structures in the cell where breakdown of of unneeded molecules kind of happens, you would of course need the enzyme.

153
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,150
So as you can imagine, this is kind of a disorder where you have the enzyme that would break this lipid not not functioning well.

154
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:53,590
This is just a kind of an interesting fact that they also have receptors for polio and toxins.

155
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:03,580
And Tay-Sachs specifically is related to this type of cancer inside being accumulated.

156
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,120
So the GM two ganglia sites. Okay.

157
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:18,790
And they are different category of GM to get these high doses so that accumulation of gene to their center of disease

158
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:27,850
and hex host how many days activator deficiency and we'll see we have a figure that kind of helps differentiate those.

159
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:40,990
Okay so as I said, this kind of disorder is the is related to the enzyme that we need to break down this this lipid not not working well.

160
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,650
This enzyme is the beta hex some in the days.

161
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:57,219
And this this kind of disease is really a good example of how different molecules from different genes kind of come together to build the enzyme.

162
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:05,110
And we can see how just having different parts of this kind of picture being

163
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,840
affected can lead to different outcomes or different forms of the disease.

164
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:21,490
So this is a really good figure that kind of summarizes like most of what you need to know about the pathways related to Tay-Sachs.

165
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:35,530
So, so this enzyme that we talked about that is needed to break down the negative side is this formed by two parts.

166
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,650
So we have the hex aging and the hex gene.

167
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:53,260
Okay, now the hex gene kind of encodes the alpha protein of the protein molecule of this, of this enzyme and then the expedient.

168
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,740
Encodes the beta protein and now the enzyme.

169
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:06,060
There are two forms of the enzyme. It could be a sorry API or it could be a B enzyme.

170
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,820
Okay. So remember how we had we talked about earlier like the PKU,

171
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:23,870
how we have a tetra like four parts that come together for the enzyme we have to, to put together the two forms of the enzymes.

172
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:35,870
So we have the enzyme and beta hex the enzyme, and now this enzyme here can hydrolyzed all types of ganglia sites.

173
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,850
So so it doesn't, it's not really sensitive to what lipid.

174
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:51,220
It's kind of it is able to break down that the beta B enzyme will hydrolyzed or what the G and to ganglia side.

175
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,260
So that's the one that we're talking about we're interested in for Tay-Sachs.

176
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:06,380
Okay. Now, if you have a mutation or receptive mutation affecting the heck's a gene, so you have,

177
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:17,000
you know, that you're not able to to produce this alpha protein, this enzyme here would be missing.

178
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,990
So that so that would be a variant B or the Tay-Sachs disease.

179
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:37,160
So you would have the beta enzyme seems like the shaded part, but this enzyme is able to hydrolyzed all except the gm2.

180
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,330
So you would still have accumulation of the g m to chemically aside in variant B or Tay-Sachs you can.

181
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:55,910
Any questions? So if you like that the alpha part is kind of not shaded, the beta part is shaded.

182
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:04,280
If you have an error or a mutation hex, a gene, this part is missing, this enzyme those available.

183
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:12,460
So in a variant B, you're able to hydrolyzed all but the GM to the car.

184
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:20,580
Now we have another variant of the disease, the center of disease, where you have a mutation in the XP gene.

185
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:37,200
Okay. So the hex and you're able to produce the hex F enzyme, but not the hex B enzyme.

186
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:47,060
And you can see here that the A by itself doesn't really do anything.

187
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,260
So you still need to be. So you don't have activity in either the hex or the hex.

188
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,370
So you've kind of like missing the the enzyme completely.

189
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:14,620
Okay. And then another type of mutation can happen in a totally different gene related to

190
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,820
it's like an activator gene that is needed for the variant A for the alpha protein.

191
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,980
So you can have both enzymes, but just because you're missing this,

192
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,850
this other activator molecule or you're having a mutation there, then those enzymes are.

193
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:42,280
Or the variant specifically affects the variant or the alpha are not working properly.

194
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,460
Okay. Any questions? Yeah.

195
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:59,700
So where what do you basically get an accumulation of non GM to ganglia sides because it's taking out the one I believe it would be.

196
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:04,720
Kind of affecting all sides.

197
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:12,130
So. So you have the the answer there, but it does not really function by itself.

198
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,299
You need the beta and then also the beta is not there.

199
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,660
So you're really missing that.

200
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,370
You're missing that all that kind of enzymes or all those forms of enzymes that are needed for getting the inside.

201
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,390
So you would have kind of GM to probably accumulation and and other ganglia sites.

202
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,200
So this is the next slides we'll kind of break down what we talked about.

203
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,630
So Variant AU, which is the centerpiece of this one in here.

204
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:56,379
This is when you have no activity for either A or B on variant B, which is the Tay-Sachs you have, you don't have the A, you have to be.

205
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,200
So you're breaking down other kinds of sides except the G,

206
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:10,920
m two variant babies when you have this other molecule that is needed for activation missing.

207
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:16,360
And so you do have the enzymes there, but they're just not working.

208
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,839
And it does the increased activity,

209
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:32,140
but it's kind of a result of the of the enzyme not working properly is that the body's trying to will try to express more and more of the enzyme.

210
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,670
So you would see kind of abundance, more than more of an activity.

211
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:45,580
So so think so this would be more of the increased abundance of the enzymes, but they're not working because you would expect them to.

212
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:53,919
And this kind of shows what I'm talking about. So this is like a result from high pressure liquid chromatography.

213
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,180
So we're trying to kind of see the levels of the enzymes.

214
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:11,380
So in the normal control, we have certain levels of the A and the B forms of the enzymes, a variant O.

215
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,969
So these individuals who are missing both enzymes.

216
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:22,780
So you can see that you cannot kind of observe the enzyme in variant B, which is Tay-Sachs.

217
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:30,760
You have a mistake, you do have the B and you can see the result of having the egg missing is that the body

218
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:39,150
kind of tries to make up for that missing enzyme by producing more of the B enzyme.

219
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:46,330
So you do have an increased in the B, but the B does not break down the G and to get new side.

220
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,780
So you still have the disease, but you do observe an abundance of the b form.

221
00:31:51,790 --> 00:32:01,720
Then sine okay then variant a b is that when you have something else missing or not not working in your the activator protein not working.

222
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:09,009
And so both enzymes are not really working and you do see an abundance of them just as the what is

223
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:16,800
trying to kind of make up a compensate for the missing for the enzyme is not working properly stepping.

224
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:27,280
Okay. So so for this enzyme, we're trying to detect it.

225
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:40,239
And in prescreening purposes, we can measure the the enzyme level kind of molecularly not using genetic testing.

226
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,540
And we can see that carriers kind of have effective function.

227
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,690
So it's kind of an indication for further testing or for the DNA testing.

228
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,730
So so this is kind of an example where we have to g like overall,

229
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:07,030
if you think of Gabriel's high doses, we could have two genes affected in different mutations.

230
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,500
But if we think of Tay-Sachs by itself,

231
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:19,599
like if I ask you if like what is the genetic heterogeneity affecting Tay-Sachs, it would be just related to this gene.

232
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,600
So it's it's not locus heterogeneity.

233
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:30,190
It's related mostly to allelic heterogeneity affecting the gene and leading to Tay-Sachs.

234
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:44,190
Is is that clear? So two genes, different mutations leading to different forms of the enzyme being produced or not produced.

235
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,490
This is just a breakdown of what we talked about in the figures throughout here,

236
00:33:52,500 --> 00:34:00,389
all the variants and how the body tries to kind of overproduce some of those enzymes

237
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:08,260
because they are ineffective in the very ap form of the gist of English sciences.

238
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:17,040
This this figure here just shows this activator protein that is missing in invariant AB.

239
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:33,209
So this protein kind of helps kind of attach attaches to the G and to or the ganglia side and brings it for for four to be broken down,

240
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:43,790
like brings it inside the cell or kind of sits either.

241
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:52,080
Yeah, it's either like flagging it for to be digested or kind of brings the inside inside from breaking down.

242
00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:02,770
But I mean, overall, its function is kind of to make it easier for the body to break this GM to ganglia side.

243
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:12,260
Allow it to be broken down by enzymes. I mean, this is kind of the just to show the finger.

244
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:23,870
And so as you have built up with GM to this is more likely to happen in the gray matter of the brain.

245
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:39,260
So the processing part of the brain. So 80% as opposed to 1.7 is like accumulation of the ganglia side and it leads to neural swelling,

246
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:44,870
demyelination, and it does affect the cerebral cortex.

247
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:56,140
So treatment is not a good treatment for these kind of conditions.

248
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:03,969
There's well, let's get to a synthesis.

249
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:10,790
So we like one way to kind of control that condition is to lock the pancreas type production.

250
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,350
And then, as you can imagine, these are kind of needed for the body.

251
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:25,569
And it's kind of hard to regulate how much you want to break down of those GM to how much you want to prevent them from being used.

252
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:29,110
So you kind of have to regulate that constantly.

253
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:35,410
And this kind of intervention would need to be done in in in fetuses or in babies.

254
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,840
So it's there's also a risk in that.

255
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:50,620
Now, another kind of way or thought that we could probably achieve this is through giving the enzyme, but this enzyme is needed in the brain.

256
00:36:50,620 --> 00:37:01,120
And for it to really reach that, like the place where it's needed, you kind of have to make it cross the blood brain barrier.

257
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,350
And if we think of ways like that, we could maybe open that barrier.

258
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:22,300
It's as you probably imagine, it's kind of a kind of a dangerous intervention where you don't know really what's going to be also crossing the brain,

259
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:28,390
the blood brain barrier while you're trying to deliver the enzymes to the to the brain.

260
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,520
Maybe gene therapy in the future would be would be the solution.

261
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,330
So. So only methods through prevention.

262
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:46,750
That's why it's important to think about cancer screenings for adults of reproductive age.

263
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:57,970
It is. So you kind of have to catch those individuals before they present.

264
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,170
That's kind of a complication. It is also a complication of genetic heterogeneity.

265
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,510
Like being able to if you identify a mutation, you kind of have to have a good.

266
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,540
So most of these carrier screening, we have a panel where we're just testing for specific mutations,

267
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,650
like there could be other very mutations that we don't know about or we don't know that they would cause the condition.

268
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:31,270
So it's kind of hard unless, you know, when you're testing for it, it's kind of hard to detect it.

269
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,580
And like screening could be more targeted to.

270
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:46,150
So some genetic ancestries versus others. Kind of what we talked about before pregnancy happens.

271
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:57,490
Typically the one one partnership of two partners like this think when Wendy comes, she's the genetic counselor.

272
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,440
She can give us a better kind of better view of how those testing happened because there was yeah,

273
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,459
there's genetic testing happens like in the clinic, but typically it's upfront for one partner.

274
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,540
And if they are a carrier, then it is offered for the second partner.

275
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:25,659
And then as you're doing carrier testing or you know that someone is a carrier, you know, if you have care,

276
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:40,840
you're kind of encouraged to inform relatives and so that they know that they could have a risk of being carriers and can maybe themselves get tested.

277
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:49,810
When, when like when they reach their reproductive age or when they are thinking of getting pregnant.

278
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:02,420
And so so for now, we don't have a long list of diseases that are recommended for care.

279
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:12,040
You prepare your testing. This is the list that is now recommended by the American Academy of Obstetric and Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

280
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:24,590
So you see cystic fibrosis over there, Tay-Sachs is on there, but mostly directed to ancestries that we know are higher,

281
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,930
are more likely to be carriers or have a higher prevalence of carriers.

282
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:38,300
And as I said, these are like a panel that would test the mutations that we know of.

283
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,440
So it's not like you're going to be able to detect all the mutations.

284
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:48,770
So we're we just have information, what we test for.

285
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,479
There's some situations where you could have sequencing of the gene.

286
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,260
So like you would see FDR, like the whole gene could be sequenced.

287
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:07,220
Like you can read every single mutation, know exactly where the variation is, but it's not really recommended in all situations.

288
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:21,160
Any questions? Comments. Okay.

289
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,390
So let's talk about the.

290
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,060
You know, lithium. It's like, fine.

291
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:43,510
It's a short piece. It's kind of a visionary paper about your speed.

292
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:54,110
When you take a moment to kind of skim through it and we'll try to answer some of the questions.

293
00:41:54,330 --> 00:42:59,870
This is not. The you.

294
00:43:56,830 --> 00:46:53,590
She? He.

295
00:47:39,600 --> 00:51:28,270
So. It's.

296
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:13,260
Part time evenings one time where we. So.

297
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:26,020
This is kind of a vision for the future paper that is kind of hoping to really expand our

298
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:35,500
understanding of carrier testing and the application of it on kind of more global scale.

299
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:45,370
So so they talk about what do they call it, long tail of Mendelian diseases.

300
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:58,510
So think about diseases that most of these diseases are caused by kind of the small number of variants that we know of.

301
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:08,050
So think about maybe 20% of the genetic mutations leading to, I don't know, 80% of those Mendelian conditions.

302
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:14,210
But then you have a kind of a long tail of mutations,

303
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:25,150
like 80% things like whatever's left or that are not so super common that cause that cause a small portion of those diseases.

304
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:40,330
But they're rare. They're kind of they vary a lot and they're kind of kind of hard to index or kind of categorize in terms of how pathogenic they are.

305
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:53,979
What do they lead to? So so this kind of a paper is talking about creating like a kind of log or an index of all mutations in all

306
00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:05,680
populations so that they're all available in that can and help us they can help us in understanding carrier test,

307
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,900
carrier screening or carriers of disease and how to kind of prevent them.

308
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:18,480
I need comments on the paper sorts. Okay.

309
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:27,300
So, so let's go through some of the questions I have and in the uploaded on canvas for for this paper.

310
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:34,080
So what, what do the authors mean by when they talk about universal carrier testing.

311
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:50,150
I think it's testing the entire population, but it's becoming more like testing for all diseases.

312
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:54,440
And instead of meaning like that's what it means by universal.

313
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:10,160
Yeah. So, so they kind of want to expand it from maybe what we have now where we have some populations that we know are more likely to be carriers to,

314
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:17,270
to applying it to move it to more of an entire populations regarding of ethnicity or family history.

315
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,670
So, so really testing everybody.

316
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:30,650
And then when they talk about triple global database, so what what do they have in mind like with what would this kind of database have?

317
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,549
Yeah. We kind of have every mutation, but just the most common ones.

318
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:44,709
And it would be. Organize based on population.

319
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:48,220
So what's really common in this country might have been really common.

320
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,120
I think they set in China mattresses their example. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

321
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,799
So we're not going to pay attention to how common they are and populations.

322
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,550
We're not going to think about just the main ones.

323
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:05,230
We're going to try to exclude all the mutations. I think that might kind of list them here.

324
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:17,110
So global in terms of all human population, the entire genome, so all genes, all a full read of the genetic information that we could have.

325
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:27,370
And then to kind of help us really now just know what the mutations are,

326
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:35,110
but kind of have that information of what kind of disease it leads to or like how pathogenic it is or how likely it is to cause disease.

327
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:43,060
So, so kind of like a full understanding of all the mutations and how they are related to diseases in all populations.

328
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:50,150
And so they talk about, yeah,

329
00:56:50,290 --> 00:57:01,660
we so we talked about how we kind of can categorize those genetic variants and they talk about phenotypic variation and pathogen pathogenicity.

330
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,890
So what, what would you guys think? What, what, what do they mean by phenotypic variation?

331
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:22,090
So this is kind of like what we talked about about different mutations kind of leading to different forms of the disease,

332
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:28,360
like the genotype two phenotype relationship and then the pathogenicity.

333
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:41,650
What do you think they mean by that? And have you ever done like those 23 in B testing or something you like?

334
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:47,020
And then there was a four or five years ago,

335
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:55,569
or maybe a little less than good genes for a good project like in the vice that department where they kind of a Facebook platform,

336
00:57:55,570 --> 00:58:04,300
you kind of donate your body but give saliva samples and you would get your genetic information for free.

337
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:18,760
So like if you kind of read those mutations or whatever variants that you have, you have like kind of a pathogenicity information.

338
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,290
So it's kind of a it could be associated with a disease,

339
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:31,780
but also there's a part of how likely it is to kind of cause the disease like not like the likely strong evidence.

340
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:40,060
So it's like an added piece of information that can help us understand how genetic variants kind of treat diseases.

341
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:56,130
So. So we typically kind of talked about defining carriers as individuals who carry heterozygous recessive mutation,

342
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,220
and they also talk about other ways by which we tend to find carriers just because

343
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:08,910
of the heterogeneity of conditions and how mutations that you could have.

344
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:17,160
So if someone is a carrier for a mutation, X-linked gene, they could potentially be called carriers,

345
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:23,759
carriers of copy number variants for BRCA one and BRCA two.

346
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,230
They're kind of a dominant mutation. So you don't really need two copies.

347
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:35,010
But if you have just a single copy, you're more likely to you can have an associated risk.

348
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,120
So so those can be called also carriers.

349
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:44,910
So it's it's kind of an expansion of the term that we typically apply for carriers.

350
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:52,320
Then maybe we can just so we talk about carrier screening,

351
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:02,910
but what do you think could be like some of the barriers and challenges to this vision or this kind of approach of.

352
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:14,040
We're even applying carrier testing. What do you think some of the carriers and challenges are associated with this?

353
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:39,059
Yeah. Yeah. Cos so cost for testing like if how to sequence that like a full well human genome kind of $1,000 so it's not really cheap.

354
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:48,690
So the cost for that there's a cost for storing the data probably that you.

355
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:53,640
You would have no privacy or misuse concerns.

356
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,840
Yeah. So yeah, privacy.

357
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:05,500
You're kind of looking into someone's genome, reading everything, kind of getting information maybe that you do not want to know and not why not.

358
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:17,950
You don't need the at the time it can be could open up to discrimination by insurance companies, things like that.

359
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:28,139
What else? Some observed mutations may not have, like, a phenotype.

360
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,370
Like, you might freak out for no reason. Exactly.

361
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:36,480
So even though we know, like, some mutations, what do they do?

362
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,100
There's like there's numerous mutations that we have no idea what their effect is.

363
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,149
They could be neutral.

364
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:51,959
They could just you could have a different kind of a variation from what we typically see, but it doesn't really have any effect on anything.

365
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,290
So so we're not really able do this.

366
01:01:55,290 --> 01:02:04,470
Information that we have is not complete. And just knowing it and having to disclose it could kind of create problems.

367
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:21,140
What else? Like education that goes with genetic testing because some of these mutations are like just because you have it,

368
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:25,090
you don't necessarily you're just like kind of in this, like, gray area.

369
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,850
So getting the general public to understand the testing.

370
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:35,510
Yeah, exactly. So yeah. Yeah. Understanding information on the patient level.

371
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,620
The doctor level. So, so, yeah.

372
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:45,140
And another thing like when you think about cancer screenings.

373
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:52,380
So this is like we were trying to prevent the police incident.

374
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:59,800
So it's kind of really hard to reach those people before they try to get pregnant.

375
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:09,510
You kind of have to be in the system maybe either like you kind of have reproductive issues or you had to see a doctor for some reason,

376
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:15,120
and then you get the counseling for care or testing or, you know, that your I don't know,

377
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,360
your ancestry kind of makes you more susceptible to some conditions.

378
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:24,479
But for that kind of average person to be to go and get tested,

379
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:32,500
if they're not within the within like health care system or not being seen or followed by a doctor before they get pregnant,

380
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:42,240
that it's kind of hard to kind of capture those those conditions or or test for carriers at that level.

381
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:49,440
Yeah. Any other questions?

382
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:56,170
Okay. So I think that should be all for today.

383
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:01,180
I want to see you next Thursday. Appreciate those of you for coming to class.

384
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:07,300
We'll wrap up adult screening, maybe talk about issues from the eugenics lecture.

385
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:20,200
Hopefully I'll have the exam ready. Also, we will go through some of the questions that I give them.

386
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,360
Yeah, you.
