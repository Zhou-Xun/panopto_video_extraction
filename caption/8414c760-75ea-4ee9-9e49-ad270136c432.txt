00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:10,030
Hi, I'm Dr. Mishelle, and I am really excited to get to talk to you guys about mental health, what it is,

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:17,690
what it isn't, and as we move through these modules to develop a lot of skills for increasing your well-being.

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:24,170
One thing we just keep in mind as we're talking about this, is that our personal and emotional

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,210
well-being and our ability to perform academically and professionally go hand-in-hand.

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:37,020
So as we're talking about this, this is really about how do you take care of yourself in a way that allows you to feel full and whole, and

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,790
at the same time show up in your academic and professional work in a way that leads towards success.

7
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,150
So let's get into it. What are we talking about when we talk about mental health?

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,690
For a lot of people, if you're looking at media and listening to everyday conversation, it seems like there are two groups of people.

9
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,910
There are people who are more normal than there are people who are crazy.

10
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:08,740
And this is a huge misconception we have, and when we think about that group, kind of the group that we would label as crazy,

11
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,550
a lot of times we don't understand what's happening with people that we see in that category,

12
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:18,630
and we think of really extreme cases. And so it feels scary. It feels unknown.

13
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:26,260
And we kind of have a big gap in knowledge about how does anyone, even end up in scenarios like that.

14
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:35,220
So let's get more clarity. We also have a big divide in how we think about physical health and mental health. So physical health,

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,730
we know what it is, we know how to deal with it, we know that it is real and valid when people talk about it most of the time.

16
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:48,430
There are some exceptions to this, especially when we talk about illnesses that we can't see and understand as well.

17
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,730
We also know that it's important to take care of our physical health, and we have an understanding of preventative and consistent care.

18
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:00,220
So I'll use an example of dental health.

19
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,240
We all know that we have it, with mental health sometimes we think only certain people have it.

20
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,710
And that's actually when we're talking about mental illness.

21
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,120
We all know that we have mental health and we all know that we should floss and that we should brush it.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,470
Those are things that kind of maintain it and help out our dental health and hygiene

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:25,460
go well. And we also know that we should get our routine cleanings and we know that when we start to have pain somewhere,

24
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,440
that's a signal that we probably need to go in and get some additional care.

25
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,820
So our mental health is actually very similar to that, but we don't often understand it that way. When it comes to mental health,

26
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,560
we often say things like it's just in your head. And that doesn't make a lot of sense.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:50,390
If your leg was hurting and it was just in your leg, we would still know that was real and valid and something that we needed to look into.

28
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:57,400
People say don't talk about mental health as if we don't talk about it, it will just go away, and we know that that's also not true.

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,940
When people do talk about their mental health, a lot of times people will say you're just being dramatic and often it's because people

30
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,790
are uncomfortable talking about it, when in actuality the person's not in dramatic,

31
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:14,580
they're telling you what they're experiencing and sometimes what they're experiencing is really intense.

32
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,570
We'll often tell people who are having difficulty with their mental health,

33
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:28,730
just be positive. And the reality is that people who are really positive have difficulties with their mental health sometimes too.

34
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,490
Sometimes if we're experiencing beginning signs of mental health issues, we'll be like, you know, I don't have time for this.

35
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:41,090
And the reality is, that we don't have time to not leave time. That a lot of these things, when they are not addressed,

36
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,200
continue to get worse and get in our way more, and we lose a lot of the time and productivity that we want to have.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:56,900
It's important for us is able to have regular practices, just like with the flossing and the brushing and making time for those things.

38
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,200
Other things that often come up is that you're not trying hard enough sometimes in religious groups, you don't have enough faith.

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,070
And these are just all misconceptions. When we think about mental health,

40
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,960
mental health operates in our physical systems the same way that physical health does.

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,720
So there's our brain, which is made up of tissues, neurotransmitters,

42
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,340
all types of things that are affecting our mental health day-to-day, that are just as real and related to our physical health.

43
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:32,320
They're really actually very intertwined and not separate. So think back to that first slide with the two circles.

44
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,140
There's really no such thing as normal and crazy. We're really all on this continuum of where we're at in our mental health.

45
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,180
And as I talk about this continuum, I want you to think about where you are today.

46
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,610
I want you to think about what you look like when you're in this thriving area, that we'll talk about, the getting

47
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,120
by, and the struggling. What are the first signs you're kind of moving into

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,610
just getting by or struggling? And sometimes it helps too, to have different people to think about.

49
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,720
So think about the books that you read, maybe the drama series or the movie that you watch,

50
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,500
and who some of the main characters are. And what do they look like when they're thriving, when they're just getting by, or when they're struggling?

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,870
Some of my favorites are like Olivia Pope from Scandal or Randolph

52
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:24,090
from This is Us. But you can even think about, superhero movies like Tony Stark's, Iron Man.

53
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:32,660
You know, you can see how they're doing as they move through. And often it's important for us to have images

54
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,680
that we can relate to.

55
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,750
And it's also important for us to know what it looks like specifically in ourselves, because it can look different for different people.

56
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:47,170
So a lot of us know what thriving is, this is where our sweet spot, this is where we're comfortable.

57
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,420
This is where we may have day-to-day challenges, but we feel equipped to face them.

58
00:05:52,420 --> 00:06:00,520
And often this is sometimes when we're not doing a lot to take care of our mental health and where if we develop good routines,

59
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,290
taking care of our mental health during this stage,

60
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:16,090
it can really help us to have some more resources and reserves and good practices if things were to get more difficult.

61
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,500
When we start to move into the area of getting by now,

62
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:26,250
one thing to notice is that I keep up the same picture, because a lot of us look the same on the outside, regardless of where we're at.

63
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,960
And so it's not true that people just kind of look out of sorts, sometimes that is true, but often we look the same.

64
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,610
But internally, we're starting to experience brief or mild changes in mood.

65
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:43,470
So often in this area, we're starting to deal with everyday stressors that are starting to take their toll.

66
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:50,130
So sometimes the further we get into a semester, the more finals are building up, and little things are happening in

67
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:57,830
our personal lives, it can get difficult for a time and we might see changes in our mood, how we're feeling about ourselves, and

68
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:06,210
our life, changes in sleeping and eating, changes in how we're showing up in our academic spaces and in our relationships.

69
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,910
Usually here we have the sense of like, okay, this is temporary, it's difficult,

70
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,820
I don't like how I'm feeling day-to-day, but usually we have a sense that we can kind of get through it.

71
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:27,480
We're having a hard time believing it. Now, this is a time where adding some extra self care and interventions can be useful.

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,610
So getting out in sunlight, getting out in nature, exercising more,

73
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,300
connecting with people that made us laugh and make us feel heard and seen,

74
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,130
getting extra rest, engaging in mindfulness meditation,

75
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,720
and as we move into modules, you get lots of different options to try for that.

76
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,480
These behaviors are really helpful when we're thriving, but we may need to pay more attention to them,

77
00:07:50,480 --> 00:08:02,890
add or try some different things when we're in this range of getting by to help support us through that time.

78
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:12,760
As we move into struggling, this is where we start to see our internal world so much more intense, much less in our control.

79
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,720
And sometimes it feels like we've been here for longer. So if you're seeing changes in yourself that are lasting more than two weeks,

80
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,440
it's a good time to really start to reflect or even a shorter than two weeks,

81
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,760
but it's very intense, it's very severe, it's really impeding your ability to show up day-to-day, to get out of bed,

82
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,620
things like that. Those would be signs that you might be in that kind of struggling range.

83
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,720
And so you're going to see more severe changes typically, and things like your mood, sleeping,

84
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:49,310
eating and the way that you're functioning and showing up day-to-day in your relationships and in your academic work.

85
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:57,080
This is also a place where people will commonly start to experience thoughts of self-harm or thoughts of suicide, thoughts of death.

86
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,460
And it's important to know that most people at some time in their life, experience these thoughts,

87
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,690
the thoughts themselves aren't necessarily indication that you're going to act on them,

88
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,570
sometimes they are. I think the most important thing to know is that they're a sign that you're

89
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,580
experiencing a lot of emotional distress and that you need added support to get through them.

90
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,070
Often that's a time where we're feeling like there's not a lot of options, we don't know how to work through this.

91
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:28,830
And so the solutions that our brain is coming up with when it's in pain, can be more extreme.

92
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,770
And so we don't want to panic about having them, we just want to know that they're a sign that we need to get more help.

93
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:41,860
So this is often a time where people are adding more support and interventions like therapy and medication.

94
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:49,060
But I want you to know, as we're talking about this, that therapy is something that people can use while they're thriving, getting by, and struggling.

95
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:57,520
I work with a lot of people who are thriving and want to develop more self awareness, want to develop more skills, want to work on growth strategies.

96
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:09,850
So therapy can really be helpful at any stage, but it becomes especially important when we're in this struggling range.

97
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:15,280
So it's good to be familiar with what other college students are dealing with so that if you are dealing with these things,

98
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,250
you know that you're not alone in them. So across the country, they regularly take surveys of what

99
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,130
college students are dealing with, and these are some of the primary concerns that come up very regularly.

100
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:34,620
Anxiety, depression, difficulty with emotional regulation, and basically that means that people are stressed,

101
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,530
people are experiencing intense and overwhelming emotions and the ability to

102
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,970
calm them down and move through their life day-to-day, is getting difficult.

103
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:56,400
Academic stress, relationship concerns, and this can be family, this can be instructors and mentors, this can be romantic relationships and friends.

104
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:04,400
But often, when there's changes happening in those and you might be having difficulty communicating or connecting.

105
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,890
And then self-esteem being the last one.

106
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:15,340
And here, I think a lot of what's happening is we're moving through our academic work and our professional lives,

107
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,980
our relationships are changing with our parents and our peers, and we're wanting to know,

108
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,890
do I matter? Do I belong? Am I doing enough? And that question,

109
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:31,800
am I enough, comes up a lot. And so how we talk to ourself through this is really important,

110
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:40,120
and we'll talk more that in future modules. The last thing we want to talk about here is often we're thinking about mental health,

111
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:48,130
we're looking just at the individual. And so we have these perceptions that people with good mental health are strong, they're resilient,

112
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:57,760
and that somehow people who aren't doing well in their mental health, who are having difficulty are weaker, or less worthy, or have done something wrong.

113
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,890
And in reality, we know that this kind of more orange picture is is more true, that all of us are affected by our

114
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:12,300
environments. There can be so many different things happening in our environment, that either help or take away

115
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:22,140
from our mental health, and so we want to know what those things are. A lot of times our academic environments can be really stressful, and we've seen racism and

116
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,280
homophobia and all kinds of just violence taking place towards people, and discrimination, and

117
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,300
oppression.

118
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:39,900
Sometimes if we are a first generation college student and we haven't had as much experience in different academic and professional environments,

119
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:49,350
we can start to feel inadequate, especially if those academic environments aren't meeting us where we're at, and really utilizing our unique strength.

120
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:55,020
So it's important to know, when we're having a hard time to not just look at ourselves and say what's wrong,

121
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,890
but to look at the environment around us too and say, okay, what here might need to change?

122
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:03,870
What here might be negatively affecting how I'm feeling about myself in the world.

123
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,540
What here, do I need to spend less time around this group or more time around this group?

124
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,590
Do I need to get people around me who are more affirming of who I am, and what my strengths are?

125
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,820
So consider these things when you're thinking about your own mental health.

126
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,590
Consider these things when you're thinking about your peers, because we can all really be a part of supporting our own mental health in better ways,

127
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:36,940
but having an awareness of mental health that makes us better able to be great friends and community members who support each other's mental health.

128
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,560
So in the future modules, we're going to talk more about what to do about mental health,

129
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,000
now that we have a little bit of a better understanding of what it is.
