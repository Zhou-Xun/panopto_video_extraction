1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:17,330
All right, good morning, everyone. Once again, we're really, really fortunate to have a tropical expert to join us today for a lecture.

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,890
Professor, jollier has is he's going to talk about during the course of the material here,

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:27,980
some really innovative approaches to quantifying and characterizing exposures.

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:39,950
He's going to be talking about the expose, about our exposures to many chemicals that are currently unregulated, are not well regulated.

5
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:48,470
He's going to talk about his work on intake action. And I hope I think some more recent really cool stuff around food intake specifically.

6
00:00:48,470 --> 00:01:01,940
And before I hand the podium over to Professor Julia, a couple logistics professor is being really, really kind to us today.

7
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,360
His class is actually right now. And I'm going to go Proctor at least get his exam going for his students.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,720
And I'll be back to join you in a few minutes with this.

9
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,760
Thank you so much, Professor Jellinek. So if you can say the whole time there.

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,190
Yeah, that's great. Thank you. OK, so welcome.

11
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:31,360
Nice to meet you. It would be nice to see each other, but not fully see each other.

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,150
But it's a treat to be to be together.

13
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:47,420
Um, so today let's look at unregulated exposure or exposure through basically the product we are we are living with on a daily basis.

14
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:55,990
OK, and, uh, I would like to understand the potential threat of this exposure to the risk of chemical,

15
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,820
understand the difference between a producer and a receptor producer,

16
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,020
inm and receptor perspective and come back on that and that, you know,

17
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,110
the basis to assess exposure to chemicals in consumer product, know some definition of the explosion.

18
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,330
And if we have time, we look at databases. But that that might be a lot.

19
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:24,340
We see I mean, in case you need some data, you can look at the last slide to look at, OK,

20
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:39,520
how many chemicals are we currently in contact in our natural environment and how many are using in product industry automation?

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:47,140
Yes, we know 85000 are used various maybe ten thousand or that.

22
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,960
Yeah, I think it's more like 30000 are really in Apple's environment, 8000 community using industry.

23
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,890
The latest data suggest that in fact we now rather 300000 we consider other region

24
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,810
of the world like India and China are also using a different kind of chemical.

25
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:20,360
And we are using. So it's a lot. Well, which chemicals do we have relatively good data on on tuks?

26
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,410
OK, good, good idea of exposure and toxicity, electronic data.

27
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes. Under three thousand.

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,120
Yeah, something like that. I mean. In fact, the leaders of the Navy start expanding that to like 5000 chemical.

29
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:54,810
We have some data. And how many do we have? Human data and our human data are used for regulation by EPA or by the.

30
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,430
Hundreds of thousands of deaths. I mean, it's more like you have on your hands.

31
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,580
OK, so, uh, our knowledge is limited.

32
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:19,740
And how did we choose the three thousand of it necessarily the worst chemical?

33
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,710
Yeah, they are among the most common in lose. Probably the most toxic also.

34
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,600
OK, uh, and and offering this choice has been made on toxicity.

35
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:44,100
Not so much looking at the exposure side. OK, so we have we have to to think not only of the talks but uh, on the exposure.

36
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:52,560
OK. And guess registry, they are like millions of new potential molecules which are introduced every year.

37
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,120
So we so we have this discrepancy about how much we are in contact and what we know.

38
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,050
And we need we need to bridge that and find method to be able at least to do what we call high throughput screening,

39
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,450
a rapid estimate to identify where we should we should.

40
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,110
We cannot measure all of them. We cannot measure exposure to all of them.

41
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,930
It's just too expensive. It would be more than GDP of the US to to do that.

42
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,040
So we need we need to find a smart solution to do that.

43
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,250
We see these chemicals are present in our environment that we face in our water in the Jordan River.

44
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:40,020
In fact, we had quite level of pass in the past and they are trying to limit that here.

45
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,770
We don't only find it in the environment, but we find it in our blood.

46
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:55,710
OK, and and that led, for example, to recent, uh, safety rule on antibacterial soap, uh, like triclosan.

47
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:02,760
Now, how much chemical in product regulated?

48
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:16,100
Which chemicals are relatively highly regulated? What kind of of of chemicals are highly regulated?

49
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:25,050
There is a whole homologation process to go before and could be accepted on which kind of chemical drugs.

50
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,900
Correct. And you have all these things up on Capitol Hill which are spreading the environment,

51
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:39,180
which one are really regulated by the pesticide, are really that of drug.

52
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:51,300
So we really I mean, they give us the weeds or they are killing insects or bacteria.

53
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,380
So we we want them to be effective.

54
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:03,940
And so that I think the EPA has done a really good job there in the obligation of according to the FDA.

55
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:12,670
Now, what about chemical and cosmetics? How many of them are regulated?

56
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:23,980
Very I mean, triclosan is one to for certain things with Synthroid and in some parts of the Iraq, which is I find amazing.

57
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,310
I mean, we have we have replacement for that. Uh, so very, very little.

58
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:40,060
And what we see is, in fact, that in general, I mean, PMG is not trying to kill their customers.

59
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:52,930
So they it's not like like a pesticide. But on the other hand, we are in very close contact with the pesticide.

60
00:07:52,930 --> 00:08:03,070
What is the to do when we apply pesticides? We have maximum impact rather than one per million, which is getting in our blood.

61
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:11,530
But in fact, on some of the chemicals, we are close contact, we have higher doses and that's where it's crucial to take these exposures.

62
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:21,700
So let's go and see how we could quantify. And you see a two phthalates in your in the left to the left.

63
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:34,180
One is these two ethyl phthalates, um, which is used in plasticizers, in toys,

64
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:43,210
or I think this one has been banned in toys that are using it in different type of plastic flooring materials like that.

65
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:53,810
And on the right of right you have also phthalates. But the shorter one of the epi, which is used in cosmetic and you have here the distribution,

66
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,780
it's Vilain here in distribution across different age group.

67
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:07,540
So what do you see here and what do you observe?

68
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,180
Let's keep the measurements age. OK, first measurements.

69
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,210
Why do they always start at age five? This is insane.

70
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:25,400
This is an Haynes's measuring about 8000 people every other year with 300 chemicals, which is really cool to have.

71
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:34,980
Yes. Yes. So the positive, the size, which is mostly five employees, is most commonly decided to increase the age or Kosmidis increase in age.

72
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,160
And most of them are made by rainwaters.

73
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,840
Yeah, this is very interesting. I come back to you, you point of the age.

74
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:53,110
But so the exposure doesn't depend only on the chemical, it really depends on the product.

75
00:09:53,110 --> 00:10:00,040
And you find that it also be packetized. But it's also a kid is is closer to the floor.

76
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,950
I mean, he is in contact with the floor, with the dust, just more dust.

77
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:12,310
So that could be passed away, which explained that we are at a higher level.

78
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,660
Well, why don't you do?

79
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:22,000
But we have data on the one and two years old because in terms of toys and they have us that way, that could be a body that couldn't be higher.

80
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:33,070
Why don't we give them any. And yes, how is this measure?

81
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,650
Is it invasive, maybe parents are not confined to a certain amount of blood?

82
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:44,650
OK, so here here they are measuring individual.

83
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:56,470
So you need to actually. That's a lot. And you need in fact, you really need to prove that these kids get an advantage at that age from doing that,

84
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,550
which is which is not obvious in that case because the general population.

85
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:08,620
So, yeah, there's also the question of what's the name of the child.

86
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,770
This is also possible. I don't think at five years old you would see that.

87
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:21,520
In fact, in fact, I'm working with a colleague in Queensland, in Brisbane, Australia,

88
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:31,150
who have they they do put samples, so they take effect, the apology sample from hospital based.

89
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,820
And they pulled together hundreds kids of that age, male and female separately.

90
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,120
And then we get the new age, which is in that case, even higher.

91
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,850
OK, and then you have it's four things which are very, very closely like.

92
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,530
Like I said, they don't see the smoke in the shop, remember?

93
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,610
And you see the man, the mother who have kids.

94
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:02,320
The more kids they have and the more they have breastfed, the lower the dioxin because they give that out into the field.

95
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:12,070
For the kid, it's better to get the breast milk plus the dioxin, then get the milk that that's like you have to way the whole thing.

96
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:20,320
It's very hard for them to wrap like some kind of increase around the age of 69, 85.

97
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,720
Do you think that's more of a susceptibility, by the way, or is it because they're playing right?

98
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,260
There are two things we will be focusing on the Half-Light in people.

99
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:40,900
So when you get older, you you you are you remove is lower inflation rate gets to people who may have reason to be lower.

100
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,930
And if if it's that I don't think it has a long Half-Life in the 40s,

101
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,990
which opposition and you find the old people are high for the reason they were exposed at higher level.

102
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,660
OK, on this study, I'm not quite sure that they were ready for that.

103
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,320
Do you find out if you have not been exposed?

104
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,790
But I have been. Well, OK, OK, so I get I get a higher half like you go by how far is higher.

105
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,450
And I was exposed and still PCB will stay about 30 years as a whole of 20 years.

106
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,710
OK, so these are the data now how how we handle that.

107
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:32,740
The first idea with it, let's ban the bad thing. OK, and that was the we had the Silent Spring who comes and in the 60s,

108
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:39,550
70s we should identify what is for example, carcinogen and just prohibit the carcinogen.

109
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:49,730
Now, I've been working with a lady who spent her life to collect data from worldwide and carcinogen and or she's crazy.

110
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,610
They found 600 carcinogens,

111
00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:02,530
which which percentage of the sixteen hundred substances which were tested for carcinogenic gave a positive response in rats or mice.

112
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,190
And only two percent.

113
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:13,110
10 percent. 50 percent. 60 percent. 80 percent.

114
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:26,610
Over 60. And that's about that. That's about 60 employees, no, I was was telling me if we could effect those,

115
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:32,160
the animal at higher doses as we kind of people, they die from lung cancer.

116
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:40,980
OK, so you have you have maximum tolerable, though, if she's still alive, defined by the lung cancer toxicity, about 90 percent.

117
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,610
So that those days, the poison is in the process of a long time.

118
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,830
So the idea is somebody should die 90 percent of the stuff that we are using.

119
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,530
So it's not very practical. OK, and the next step was to say, OK,

120
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:07,440
how can we identify which chemical product combination are problematic and then how to reduce or replace them with better alternative.

121
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,930
And that's the rule from from the exposure. And crucial here is that we have orders of magnitude on the.

122
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,590
We also have orders of magnitude of exposure on the on the exposure.

123
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,510
So we need to find those.

124
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:28,800
I mean, the worst would be those who have high exposure, little toxins, not always the one which are the most toxic, but the most toxic.

125
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:38,610
We are careful when we use that or we avoiding to use them in product in many cases.

126
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:47,610
So now you could have two different perspective. Traditionally in this building school of public health, we have a human oriented perspective.

127
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:54,600
So this is more that we set up a risk assessment where you have one person and you look at

128
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,740
the exposure pathway where you get exposure to take effects from from from which media,

129
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:09,630
from which the impact pathway, exposure pathway that we get exposure to water, drinking water,

130
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,670
one of the rare chemicals that we still have and very high environmental exposure.

131
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,780
Why why do we get that high enough through the environment?

132
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:27,570
They have seen that we believe that we will get rid of them, but we still have that.

133
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:38,430
It doesn't degrade. It really doesn't degrade. It can say that it's OK and and they degrade, but a degrade.

134
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:48,060
In fact, in the before before we just had a call with my cousin, who is one of the world specialists, not that I'm teaching do.

135
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:57,150
So I kind of agree that, uh, on on Monday you find these US and discussing exactly the Half-Life that they have.

136
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:05,710
But they they stay long. That's the reason why what else we find contact with us and we could have exposure.

137
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:10,650
More contact like Cortez. Yeah, some some of the textile.

138
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:24,600
So far I haven't seen that it was too high. Interesting the in that what else would be part of the use of this cancer had colon.

139
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:33,150
Yeah. And they could experimentally people have shown that they had sort of paper from colleagues recently in Denmark who were,

140
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:51,210
who were showing that the people who are using, uh, patterns get hired because all you could say the, uh, the goalpost of all this, uh, place,

141
00:17:51,210 --> 00:18:02,490
uh, until recently, this had to be fast because otherwise it's it's also it was a way to to protect was not very smart in a of things to put

142
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:10,140
things we didn't degrade at all in that whole you look at the different exposure and you look at the personality receptor.

143
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,200
Now, if you look from an industry perspective or a product perspective,

144
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:23,430
and that's why I've been working with lifecycle assessment of product and that's that's my origin for modeling,

145
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,870
uh, things or from, uh, alternative chemical.

146
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,920
You have an application and you look you follow your product.

147
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,990
So you take your shampoo and you look where who is affected by my shampoo.

148
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:46,680
So you really have, of course, the person who put it on the test and they can, uh, either inhale it or absorb it thermally,

149
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:55,180
but then it's runoff and you will have an environmental exposure and people drink this this water in that case.

150
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:04,080
OK, so, uh, and so we can have this the same meter or producer or the receptor and both are complementary.

151
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:12,960
So in this one on the left, we will see we use an intake fraction which are kilo in per kilo in product of km2.

152
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,810
On the right one, you have this perspective.

153
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:23,010
What does the milligram per kilowatt per day, which is arriving to the person, then we look at these different.

154
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,950
So how can we get these two metrics here?

155
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:38,160
And we have defined it's nice to define metric, which are relatively simple to use.

156
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,280
And one metric is called the intake fraction. This is in fact simple.

157
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:53,340
You say I have a mass admitted. I look at the mass taken in by the population and I use the ratio.

158
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,840
And this is my mass taken in by dividing by my sanity with it's interesting.

159
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:14,190
In 97 I was for a total of five months the ability and one of my colleagues, our colleague told me I was getting closer this year.

160
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,110
And he's going to be joining us, scientists from Harvard.

161
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:24,540
So we took the appointment. We have now maximalism risk assessment.

162
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,460
I was working on a lifecycle assessment and after three days, we're sticking together.

163
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:39,090
He was calling the the depression, the exposure, our efficiency, and we decided to concerned at side.

164
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:47,850
OK, we're really trying to find somewhere in the world which have been calculating in a new metric completely independently.

165
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:57,600
And then we finally put it together with three other colleagues and call it the question, because efficiency's is a positive thing.

166
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:08,130
Do you want to see? So we rather decided to to call it the intake fraction.

167
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,540
So the fraction of the emission which is taken in and you account for the emission can be in error,

168
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,590
but it can deposit to water or soil and then you will drink the water.

169
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,260
So you need some multimedia model to look at that and to determine that.

170
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:33,780
So we baptized it in 2002, like like 20 years ago in that is the beauty of the intake function,

171
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:49,020
is that if you give me a concentration in the environment, the is 10 minus three micrograms per cubic meter.

172
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,740
Honestly, I don't know if it's true or not.

173
00:21:52,740 --> 00:22:03,020
I got of the other night because, you know, the source, the amount that the diffusion is really constant.

174
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:11,490
The interaction has the advantage and it's I you know, it's perforated so you can get water.

175
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:20,310
So if you look here, we do three the compounds which we're using in or emitted in the environment.

176
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:28,680
And you see that typically inhalation is in the range of ten minus six, minus five a bit.

177
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:40,700
So that just have 10 parts per million. So if I make one kilogram, how many milligrams are ingested?

178
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,990
Why you like it, it's OK, take half a.

179
00:22:44,990 --> 00:23:09,640
That would be how many MG? The that's also one so that's one thing that is so American is how much better than per soul successfully defended, right?

180
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:18,610
So typically you have a one kilometer go and have 10 mg taken in and it's a population metric.

181
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:31,240
So it could be by different people. In that case, if it's an open air pollution, it will be a of people who share like this 10 mg among each other.

182
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,030
OK, now you see the ingestion, you go up to 10 minus three.

183
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:43,420
These are the highs and the dioxin, which are very persistent in the environment.

184
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,300
OK, then you need two things. In fact, to be pragmatic.

185
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,590
You need them to be persistent in the environment, but also persistent in us, OK?

186
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,270
And we need to bioaccumulate and usually they back in fish.

187
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:05,050
They also bioaccumulate in our environment.

188
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:11,050
So you see that we we get up to 10 minus three times minus two.

189
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:23,890
So one kilo emitted, one gram ingested into that can hopefully dioxin is power to picogram is toxic.

190
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:34,150
So. All right. A grain of salt without eating too many kilograms or anything like four kilograms behind us.

191
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:47,790
OK, so it was due is a lot. But still when we go to 10 minus three, that's problematic and we really need to act on these persistent chemicals.

192
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:54,820
OK, so now this was this was valid for outdoor.

193
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:07,630
OK, so now let's think of indoor exposure and we know if computers could be risky with bacteria, but with chemical, we also have indoor exposure.

194
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:15,520
So let's calculate together the indoor intake fraction again.

195
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,890
And as I would like to quantify things, I would make you work on a small example.

196
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:39,070
So we have you here a room, 200 cubic meter, OK, it's it's more probably a room of that that size here, or it's a household, in a sense, a flat.

197
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:48,700
And in case we have two people and these people are breathing half a cubic meter per person per hour.

198
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:55,810
OK, the air in the in the room is renewed.

199
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,970
Half of the air is renewed. Every year is sent to the outside.

200
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:07,210
And we are bringing fresh and pure air without these emission here.

201
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:14,650
So what I would like you to do, so you you go by group of two or three, so go the two together.

202
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:22,000
The three together here. Here you go. Put together or the two behind and the three of you.

203
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,930
And you combine the three things they combine the indoor air volume taken in per hour by the people you calculate the

204
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:42,220
indoor air volume remove from the room and the intake fraction is in fact the ratio of the three divided by the sum of.

205
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,380
OK, let's see. And then we can compare to what we have seen on the previous graph.

206
00:26:47,380 --> 00:27:00,220
OK, yes. Look. You can keep your distance them, but I don't want to.

207
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:08,280
Prior to that, for example, the.

208
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:18,030
But you're going to have to people what I.

209
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:36,750
Yeah, that's right. So people. And. It's hard to work to get out of it that way.

210
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:42,680
So I've already had it on.

211
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:50,920
The movement has come together, he tells.

212
00:27:50,920 --> 00:28:08,000
And everything they entail is personal, and this one is better than just the.

213
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:40,040
George and. Two hundred thousand dollars in debt is.

214
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:48,430
And village. OK, let's try to do it together.

215
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:57,160
You guide me. OK, so first the volume of indoor air taken in per hour.

216
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:18,430
How much do we have in cubic meter per hour? Once you get it, you have to spend some time, zero point five cubic meter per person and per hour.

217
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:24,040
We check the unit. This is one and this is cubic meter per hour.

218
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:34,060
In that case, is it OK? How much is is lost to the outside?

219
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:40,180
And so point five, what does a unit of point five?

220
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:48,460
So this is point five and this is in one per hour, OK?

221
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:57,540
And so the volume you want to obtain cubic meter per hour.

222
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:10,590
Three times 200. I mean, you multiply your so this is what we call the everyone here is the real the concern will say what fraction of the mass,

223
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,840
which will be the air, what fraction of the air is removed. And we are outside.

224
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,190
OK, these are very useful metric because I'm in fact originally a building physicist.

225
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:32,670
And we know that typically every funeral for a close house in 03 would be a very tight house becomes

226
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:40,970
problematic with the addition because of the of the indoor and an average of like zero point eight.

227
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,430
So that would be a really low attrition rate.

228
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:52,140
You open a window, you are like 40 something that we don't see that we have so much ventilation and closed room.

229
00:30:52,140 --> 00:31:00,300
But I mean, we have titrations for the four point five time.

230
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:09,480
Two hundred. This is equal to 200 cubic meter per hour.

231
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:22,290
OK, so now we have the two people there breathing one cubic meter and the investigation is taking off with this taking in like 100 years old.

232
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:29,070
It's a competition between the two to the fraction we will get if I lead there and we have one comes here,

233
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:44,730
hundreds comes out to the ratio would be equal to one divided by in fact, a hundred plus one, two hundred plus one.

234
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:55,230
This is a bit less than 0.01 and a bit less than one percent.

235
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,540
Equal one percent as a proxy.

236
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:07,980
We we can really neglect what is what is taken in by the people in that case.

237
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:14,610
OK, is it is it a lot or is it is it not much?

238
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,500
What the topic is? Depends what the or the correct.

239
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,620
But to alteration. Where where are we.

240
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:33,780
Why did I it one percent will be more than one gram.

241
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:45,590
One gram would be how many. What a wild ride would be won by a thousand.

242
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:53,240
OK, so that would be point one percent with one percent, you will have ten grand taking it.

243
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,000
OK, now the reignition we are saying bioregion, 10 mg.

244
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,970
So we have we have effect a thousand between an indoor emission and outdoor emission.

245
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,320
So small counted quantity, though, can be helpful if you like.

246
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:18,590
And that's really nice. I mean we can take it. You say one percent is low, but compared to what we have we will be.

247
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:24,530
So this is equal to minus two then minus two.

248
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:34,810
Deepti here. OK, I'll use the symbol then power minus two.

249
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:40,130
So this is compared to what we had here, this is in fact high.

250
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:46,330
This is in the highest range of it's worse than that in terms of infection.

251
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:54,430
And it doesn't need to be persistent because it is just adding to the radiation.

252
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,670
So what is interesting is, if anything,

253
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:03,750
the opposite reaction is going to be accurate because independent verification and obviously a number of people who are here,

254
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:11,180
how much everything and how much is the only way that this is something which is relatively well known in that case.

255
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:20,440
So very, very easy. And so for most in innovation of most indoor products, we will have this one, in fact,

256
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,100
is probably on average zero point five percent, something that we get in the building.

257
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:35,050
In that case. OK. OK, so now does it matter?

258
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:41,140
I mean, does pollution matter? I like to look at the global burden of disease, which is a large study.

259
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:45,340
If you if you go on this website I put here, it's really cool.

260
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:52,150
You have all type of risk factor in injury accidents.

261
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:58,240
Neither gives you high blood pressure that that is that down on this website.

262
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,050
And here I've extracted the, um, the the environmental risk.

263
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,430
So again, let's interpret this graph.

264
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:17,450
What what do you see here? What does it matter here?

265
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:28,410
What is big and how big it is worldwide?

266
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:32,510
They just an indoor outdoor air pollution.

267
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:43,820
Yeah, and from what in fact, this is the fine particulates under the surface, less than 2.5 micrometer.

268
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:52,570
I mean, do you in the. Advances these extreme extremely studying that for years,

269
00:35:52,570 --> 00:36:04,800
it's really it really matters then how do people get the indoor air pollution, which is mostly in that case, I don't know.

270
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,480
How do they get that money for. Yeah, that's OK.

271
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:19,420
With with world or coal like that. What else do you go to Montana, which is actually some fresh accents coming from.

272
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:33,730
So you enter Shalab in Switzerland and if you have a fireplace and there is no smoking device and authorities say, oh,

273
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:44,260
that's a nice five days and you just know that this is crazy, that you are in danger on on the first day and people live there a long time.

274
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,750
So really, what we just finally did, my grandfather said it.

275
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,940
And so we we have really thought about it. We will do things the first year.

276
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:04,840
We have completely closed environment with ventilation, which comes from outside or from the basement to avoid that.

277
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,150
The second we will put the particle filter on the top.

278
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,650
That's not so much for us. That's our neighbor, which is next door.

279
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:23,650
And the particle, the man who comes, you know, the black guy who comes to this river.

280
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:31,510
Yeah, OK. I went to see these people come to our house, the film itself,

281
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:43,270
because there are only two articles in the whole idea and a half years in place of work because you have to be careful.

282
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:49,000
And it is just a why we have no reason to hide them.

283
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:03,970
So if we put them up against the wall and so with that is really good and bad that we have, you don't want to smell that.

284
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,080
OK, that's that's pretty bad.

285
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:15,310
When when we have that now where we look the last way.

286
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:26,170
It's interesting, we don't have so many data. We have data and let some some data on the water, which is really bacterial, uh, here.

287
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:37,180
So most of all and rather um but we we don't see here at all the the um, the consumer, the Canadian consumer product, for example.

288
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:43,780
And that's key because this really works radiological data and we don't have any data,

289
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:51,130
OK, because it's hard to to know what people are using and what they are exposed to.

290
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:58,000
So we don't really know. And we need to rely on others to know what what about the magnitude of the damage?

291
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,750
If you look at the bottom scale, does it matter?

292
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:15,350
So this is a world at world level. So how did people die?

293
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:20,510
OK, so this is millions, two point five million people every year,

294
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:29,420
but about three million by abject terror and another one point five with the also the pollution.

295
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:38,210
So you get about five billion people. This is about every year, every year.

296
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,560
OK, that's this kind of question you that in Washington.

297
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,420
That seems really very high for meat.

298
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:59,720
Like they can't wash their hands. Yeah, I think I think that's that's related to sanitation and sanitation so that you

299
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:08,720
get your hand washing you washing your hands with that particular bacteria.

300
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:20,070
And this would be very small in a country that's where it never becomes.

301
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:27,420
But is interesting also when you look at the ambient particulate matter, what the disease,

302
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:38,850
the cause is on the right, you see that lung cancer, which is the plasma.

303
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:45,450
And look, we have, you know, blasphemies.

304
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,890
The light is here. So you see lung cancer is here. And what is this?

305
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:54,960
This is cardiovascular disease. And that is a problem that we don't associate easily.

306
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,660
I mean, when you're doing a project, is that even associated with that?

307
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:12,780
Intuitively, people don't think you can attack or stroke that is linked to pollution and that it is a high risk factor associated with this.

308
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:21,660
OK, so now when we look what chemical we find, we we use the same data as the violin, OK?

309
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:30,300
And look at 300 substances and look which one or what are the factors which make you cry in people.

310
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:40,830
And it's on a large scale. So one one here means ten times higher than than, uh, other substances.

311
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:50,040
And you see that here we have the industrial results, industrial, chemical without consumer use, which are about ten times lower than average.

312
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:57,630
And the one we have, both industrial and consumer use, are ten times higher than average.

313
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,210
That's interesting. Pesticide.

314
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:11,340
Look, the pesticide active ingredient, we are low and that means we've got a good job because we have only a residues of pesticide at this level.

315
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:18,120
But you see that, for example, it's interesting to see the known active ingredient and of that control there they are a bit higher,

316
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,380
but of course, they are less harmful than than these guys.

317
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:32,220
But we find at high level that the the chemical, which are the consumer product probably are not that bad,

318
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,070
but they are 100 times higher than the pesticides.

319
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:47,760
So if we get even I mean those which are a hundred times higher than the residues we have, we might be in trouble in that case.

320
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,870
And this is where triclosan finally FDA has regulated that.

321
00:42:54,870 --> 00:43:00,480
But FDA, for example, doesn't regulate them at all.

322
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:09,060
At one point on their website two years ago, they were saying that about 200 times the doors,

323
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:15,840
which is forbidden in Europe, is safe, that you want that with the electronic disrupter?

324
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,740
They are. They are they are quite special on that.

325
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,000
So there is like very little scrutiny that's worrying in the sense.

326
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,910
And the regulation from Toschi is moving in the right direction in that in that case, that is relatively hard to implement.

327
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:45,840
What is interesting is until 2000, US was driving the risk assessment, since 2000 in Europe, who has been driving, in fact, the industry regulation.

328
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:53,880
I think it might be also linked to the different administration we had in the Bush administration has to regulate or oppose.

329
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:03,630
But FDA really, in the sense it's worrying, has no um, you have to people like for FDA,

330
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:16,470
you have to prove it's bad that you can regulate it in and that in a sense, it's it's up to the government to prove there is a problem in Europe.

331
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:26,550
The idea is that if you want to use something, you have to put evidence that it's OK for them to really do that.

332
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:39,660
But we are really not protected presently, I find. So how do we we handle now the chemical exposure that we have in the environment?

333
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:45,620
Let's use a five minute break, OK, for that. And I reject my question.

334
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,190
That is just relax a bit and then we'll go in the product side of things.

335
00:44:50,190 --> 00:45:04,200
OK, see you in a minute. You don't get a break usually with demand.

336
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,550
No. No, I like to do that because I'm pretty quick.

337
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:23,070
So relax. I agree with.

338
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:31,120
A number of people not be excited, for example, during some.

339
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:39,290
Uh, for political leaders to.

340
00:45:39,290 --> 00:46:14,980
I that's I like psychosis. Yeah.

341
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:43,020
One source I. And then went down there and back, there's the.

342
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,230
And I would like to speak honestly,

343
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:59,900
I regret to say it was unnecessary for me and I felt because of the writing on the short answer is probably just right.

344
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:24,330
But the other thing that I think to some of the polling places that I'm going to refer to, but.

345
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:41,390
That's racking my brain and I keep saying, I think I thought I was like I saw it right after I waited for it to happen.

346
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:51,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That shows you something about like how you can change the way you want to play.

347
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,930
I think it's like the initial ones that I remember.

348
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:59,160
Your four year old son was one on one, wasn't it.

349
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:10,190
Yeah, it wasn't on his life usually he said yeah.

350
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,650
I don't get the pretty much anything, so.

351
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:36,930
Year they did it open, no way, because he was on.

352
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:47,930
I want to work for a long time, and I would just.

353
00:48:47,930 --> 00:50:43,160
Yeah, yeah. I about.

354
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:56,560
And every time something superspeed and everybody to see everybody, you know, at least six times to, but I think that was so good.

355
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:12,750
So like, I was like, oh, you might just but I don't really like black people.

356
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:42,460
Julie. And.

357
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:51,580
OK, by the way, we do the online class, you know, they say the concentration span is seven minutes.

358
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:57,470
We should do a great update for at least one in up.

359
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:05,140
I assume if we interact, it's a bit longer than that. But that's still so here we will.

360
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:11,810
I mean, we think of our environment. How many products have you been in contact with this morning?

361
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:19,450
And probably about four hours of playing at Carnegie Hall for every dollar.

362
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:28,930
That's how many products we have here. OK, we have seen we have to come back to sitting in contact with who would you want to see?

363
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:34,810
You have a cup of coffee or whatever it is. Uh, we have a textile.

364
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:40,750
Uh, we got like. Yeah, sort of paint on the walls. And we just think of that now being perhaps in adverse.

365
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:50,350
You, uh, you go ahead. And so we will touch like three hundred thousand for this morning.

366
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:59,040
OK, and we see that the product is multiplying exposures on the question of chemical intensive.

367
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:07,420
It's complex and it's all in fact that's the meta perspective is a bit more interesting because you you

368
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:13,610
said you one product at the time and you look at the chemical in that product and you know the uses.

369
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:21,080
So we we it's easier to do that to say all the product after this morning.

370
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:34,750
So the decision with that. So here we will rather take the the, uh, emitter perspective and follow the product.

371
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:44,710
So we wanted to know and consistent model the farfield and the indoor air and what's happening in the near field exposure.

372
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:49,600
And we do find the same idea of the interaction.

373
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:58,910
But if you put the cosmetics on your skin, do you have emission?

374
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:03,030
How would you define the mission? It's complicated.

375
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:11,090
All you have, you have a big sci fi fired.

376
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:18,020
OK, we can make it an outfit and they don't have faith.

377
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:29,000
What do you think they're going to say? OK, you didn't really agree with some of these people I had today, because I have no doubt about that.

378
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:40,580
So the mission is actually the good metrics on the good metric. You define that 15 years later in 2015 and the expression because it can be a

379
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:47,780
product they crashed into a product is akin into what fraction of the chemical,

380
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,130
which is at the start in my product, is taken in.

381
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:57,380
So I will look, how much chemical do I have in my product? So how do I get that?

382
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:07,250
I do. I look at the product usage. For example, I'm using 10 gram for shampoo and it has zero point one percent of formaldehyde.

383
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:12,470
It seems that formaldehyde is sometimes still used in shampoo, which is worrying.

384
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:18,080
And you multiply that and you get so many mg that that is OK.

385
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:26,390
And you look what is taken in via all the different these fine indoor and outdoor environments.

386
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:36,440
And we define the product intake the as the mass in divided by the mass in product which is brought in product at the start.

387
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:47,330
So let's take example a hand soap or sanitizer and the flooring material, I mean plasticizer in flooring that we could have.

388
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:55,550
So we start from the product, the amount of product use, the chemical content in the product, we get the killer in product.

389
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:04,460
And I would like to have the kilo intake from the consumer and from the rest of the population, basically.

390
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:14,540
And to do that, the key is that we want, as we did with the competition inside the house, in that case,

391
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:23,750
we want to follow the path and we we want to say that we join the suite for the last time.

392
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:33,260
I will give it here because I will be moving to Denmark next year, retire from here and get the new position in Denmark.

393
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:38,660
So next week, this winter is the last time we can have a if interested in things.

394
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,730
We really sit on the committee and follow.

395
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:54,730
If I ask you, a fraction of a fraction goes into Japanese computing right away and we do we do a massive balance of these things.

396
00:56:54,730 --> 00:57:04,250
OK, so and for that, we need to rely on whether we validate the model with a few chemicals to check they are OK.

397
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:11,720
But to to cover this whole range of exposure, we need, uh, modeling to do that.

398
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:18,920
So either we have a killer killer in product today, which is applied in the case of cosmetic,

399
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,590
and we can then drive two mg intake per kilo per day in a receptor perspective,

400
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:32,480
or we we have kilo per head well shampooed, which should be the lifecycle assessment approach.

401
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:44,730
I say one Hegewisch shampoo and I look how many Keyline take off per head well shampooed, which is called the functional unit of of my product.

402
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:57,480
In that case, for example, shampoo, you see the average use you can have about five grams here of a surfactant in five gram of shampoo.

403
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:05,900
This would be the average use body lotion. It's eight grams at the high end, use up with thirty gram of the ocean in your skin.

404
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,130
And surfactant is high here. It's 20 percent.

405
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:22,490
If you take a derivative which which is used to perfume and, uh, also for for cleaning purposes, uh, you see you get only zero point five percent.

406
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:26,210
So you have huge differences in the concentration here.

407
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:39,590
OK, and, uh, if you take plasticizer here, uh, in the either in the pacifier for a kid, you have a pacifier is only one point five grams.

408
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:45,470
But the the the phthalate here is 40 percent in that case.

409
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:54,440
And you are flooring, you have seven point five, uh, kilo of kilo fluorine per square meter.

410
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,050
So we are bringing in the oil we are bringing you to.

411
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:10,720
I mean, think what you can establish, OK, and not a very large one is really heavy and about 20 percent of the time.

412
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,470
So you could really use your house in that case.

413
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:27,100
OK, well, some some pheno, which would be a solvent, will be at low level here in in my, uh, vinyl flooring or something like that.

414
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:35,230
OK, so let's play a bit then you say OK, to to to try to quantify that.

415
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:47,440
How do we proceed. So I say, okay, uh, I have here a channel number five and I would like first to know where where does it enter my environment.

416
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:57,060
OK, where does it first enter my environment when I have a son, as long as the bottle is not in the environment.

417
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:05,470
OK, so, uh, you use it somewhere where you see some compartment.

418
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:14,410
Is it entering an object in terror? What would be an example of Object A.

419
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:23,380
So chemical like formaldehyde in this table, that would that that would enter a mind environment where it might be stable.

420
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:29,380
It will come here and then the formaldehyde will dissolve objectively diffuse inside that subject entirely.

421
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:34,300
OK, um, is it food and beverage contact.

422
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:39,000
That would be food contact material. That's obviously not that object surface.

423
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:48,010
This is for if you are, uh, cleaning products, OK, you put it on the surface of an object in that case.

424
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:53,320
And we are contact directly with the air, but it doesn't need to diffuse through the air.

425
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:58,450
The paint is we have now abatement model. It does that do it for us.

426
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:04,180
It's liquid. So it's an object surface and then it becomes solid and becomes very thin.

427
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:13,060
In fact, optically when when it's solid and it changes a bit, uh, the the property here that we have here,

428
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:22,940
skin surface, OK, and that's that's where in fact my chemical is entry.

429
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:31,510
OK, so I put it on, on my skin so that, uh, here what does it do from the skin surface.

430
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:34,050
Where does it go. So first things we know.

431
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:47,170
OK, I have so much I perhaps a gram of uh of perfume put on the neck or skin surface and where does it go from here.

432
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:53,350
So we really we follow really the chemical on the ladies side.

433
01:01:53,350 --> 01:02:02,650
Uh, I think it's perhaps sexist to think that in five, but it's more used by that.

434
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:12,710
So we're making it go. Anyway, I'm really sorry if it's in the blood.

435
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:18,260
Yeah, but to arrive to the blood, where do you need to go?

436
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:23,280
OK, so it's on the skin. How does it enter?

437
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:34,110
A person can be absorbed through the skin and then it gets taken up into the blood from the skin and then it can be transported anywhere in the body.

438
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:39,320
Exactly. So that would be the transfer to the epidermis. That is dermal intake.

439
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:55,460
OK, what are the other roots? Where else this mass I'm bringing on, the product I'm trying to think of mass balance is going to be inhaled.

440
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:01,590
What does it mean? It needs first. Yes, it needs a volatilized.

441
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:10,350
OK. And you could say that it's really part of the function that it fertilize a bit because you want the people to smell it.

442
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:17,950
In that case, so we have a transfer here to the air and.

443
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:22,860
OK, what is the, uh, the last time?

444
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:32,970
So this is this is a direct transfer. Inhalation is a secondary transfer from the air we are breathing and how much we're breathing

445
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:41,870
to the respiratory track order of magnitude in the extraction we just calculated to need.

446
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:52,710
The goal was one percent.

447
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:57,990
OK, now what do we put on the skin?

448
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:05,640
OK, we have to look at the practical level of protection from here and then from the fraction of vitalized,

449
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:10,590
one percent will go in in that last last transfer.

450
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:24,090
Where does it go? In addition to that, what's happening either the next morning or later in the day?

451
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:28,380
You can wash it. OK, runoff. I mean, we shampoo.

452
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,320
It's after four minutes with the notion of perfume.

453
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:39,600
It's probably rather after eight hours and a certain fraction will go to the wastewater treatment plant and then reach the environment.

454
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:46,140
OK, what fraction of that are saline or that is so low?

455
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:57,030
Know that it will depend on the on the kind. If you have anything else to Tel Aviv, then the dust concentration becomes important.

456
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:05,700
OK, for example, perfume is likely to become the same.

457
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:10,050
You know, whether in fact we don't have we really in fact introduce a separate.

458
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:15,840
That's the when we look at the translation of that and then you think of that as we are,

459
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:24,480
we are eating dust several round effects of MG per day just without touching purpose.

460
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:33,960
And then we don't realize that we do have more than we we think that's food then which is taken in in that case.

461
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,770
So if we if we look, that's what we are doing.

462
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:43,950
We we say what is the product is applied at the surface of our skin.

463
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:52,560
And I look at the competition between rates which go product to skin and the rate which is product to air.

464
01:05:52,560 --> 01:06:02,520
And basically then this is this is a small differential equation and which this is is a variation of mass,

465
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:13,620
which time is a rate per hour times the mass in product, plus the rate of taking a rate for vulcanization times the mass in product.

466
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:16,890
I don't I mean, you don't need to to do that.

467
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:21,870
But which function as is derivative,

468
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:30,840
proportional to the function itself that this is what this equation is saying over there of the mass is proportional to the mass,

469
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:44,940
because the higher the concentration in my product, the more I guess, OK, that's what the equation which this is and this was a long time ago.

470
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,840
This is an exponential function, the derivative of an exponential.

471
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:56,010
And basically, you see, this is the quantity in the product will go, in fact, will decrease.

472
01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:02,550
It is minus capex. Peacekeeper's is an exponential decrease gate.

473
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:07,470
It's meaning either to my state or to me in that case.

474
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:12,450
And here we can calculate these sort of things. So just just to give you an idea.

475
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:19,170
So the quantity which will be left on the skin and rinse off when I to my shampoo

476
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:23,910
will be proportional to this rate constant with an exponential decrease.

477
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:31,020
What's happening in the interior is the same. The concentration will go exponentially down if I emit something like that.

478
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:40,560
So what's happening? You have here the product intake fraction for the normal parts I have here, limonene Azalea's.

479
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,410
These are these are products that you find in some.

480
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:57,760
And you can see after four minutes here, 0.01 are OK here after four minutes, how much do I get in my blood through dermal uptake?

481
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:05,690
So you see the surfactants here, it's only zero point zero zero point one percent.

482
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:12,580
OK, but you see the double here. It goes like to 10 percent.

483
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:17,430
This is really high. This is not even one percent. We were flying high.

484
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:23,620
We went the house. We we are taking it at pretty high rates of return.

485
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:35,800
Just 10 percent means that we we my rule is I put on my skin only things that I drink.

486
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:44,770
OK, if I the more morphine like if I'm painting nowadays I'm using gloves since I've done this research

487
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:56,330
because I kind of paid a long I my my hands full of paint and uh would I drink these bags now.

488
01:08:56,330 --> 01:09:04,920
I'm not going to drink but if there is benzene and your hands are smelling benzene or I working with my oil on my bike,

489
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:13,780
if I could survive on my head, I'm thinking that maybe you and I have exposure.

490
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:21,820
We don't really think so when we really use that, but especially maintenance product in the house.

491
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:27,680
Cleaning products are not too bad, but why not put gloves and reduce our exposure?

492
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:39,760
OK, the other thing is like for body lotion, um, this is the very notion I was using the term of the I mean,

493
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:49,280
the dermatologists are saying that they are two really a cosmetic that you really need for health reasons.

494
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:57,310
This is a moisturizer, your entire specially for Michigan and any sunscreen, eventually equal protection for cancer.

495
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:05,360
And there are some debates here. So nice alternative to the body lotion I had here.

496
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,180
So, you see, I had some methyl parabens properly.

497
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:20,290
Carbon monoxide is not too bad. But why why do you need all that in in the sense in the in the ocean?

498
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:27,370
OK, and if you buy if you go to Kroger, you can buy these coconut oil here.

499
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,470
I love the ingredients, ingredients,

500
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:39,670
organic coconut oil contains coconut and you have here perfect for frying and sauteing a great butter substitute, an excellent skin moisturizer.

501
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:43,930
And I would say that would go to the cosmetic because they would add stuff in it.

502
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:52,960
Just go to the foods. Oh, I mean, I have to try it.

503
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:03,310
And so it in in the summer it could become liquid, uh, if it passes seventy five or something like that for a night.

504
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:08,290
And, but uh I personally I find it works fine.

505
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:14,830
And why, why would we bring that when we know that about 60 percent of that will go in our blood.

506
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:18,490
In that case, I'll finish with another example.

507
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:28,150
That chemical in toys. We were speaking of the kids and we have a project with the UN environment and colleague in Denmark, um,

508
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:36,160
which is which is looking with also in China and with we will give shortly across to Chinese

509
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:46,330
producers of toys on looking at how much chemical do the kids get through toys and what are the one.

510
01:11:46,330 --> 01:12:00,680
Um, we, we, we should correct. OK, so one single toy I mean take a doll is five 400 primum in a pound typically for a four adult now.

511
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:09,520
Now how many kilo plastic is a child receiving in his house every year or in his room.

512
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:19,850
OK. So we look at statistics and then we will do exposure on rebounding and risk, so say a statistic,

513
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:31,700
a child receive about 400 dollar of of toys here and we have about 14 dollars per kilo toy.

514
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:42,470
So, in fact, the total amount of toy boys, 33 kilo for a child, and we evaluated the fraction of plastic at 55 percent.

515
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:51,350
So it means every year you're bringing 18 kilo plastic inside the room of a child.

516
01:12:51,350 --> 01:13:04,130
That's that's average. OK, if the child is keeping his toys, they say three years and I still have kids or five of them.

517
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:10,130
In fact, I still probably exposed the Lego in that case.

518
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:15,830
But here it's, I think, a low estimate to say so you have like 50 kilo plastic.

519
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:20,360
So it's thought to be competing with the Florey in a sense.

520
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,690
And we have we have close contact in that case.

521
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:33,890
So the second is that what the amount of plastic that I have in my room and now I look at what is the content.

522
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:39,170
And you see here, content vary by eight orders of magnitude.

523
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:43,760
These are residues, for example, for recycling plastic.

524
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,530
But they are small. They are 10, minus 10. Minus six is one to a million.

525
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:53,210
OK, so they are they are really small quantity.

526
01:13:53,210 --> 01:14:02,330
In that case. But here, when you go here, you start having plasticizer around the range to be deemed to be active.

527
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:08,660
By the way, why do we need to have plasticizer toys all in carpet?

528
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:17,940
Any idea why do we have this pallet or or is it a hardware or.

529
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:24,210
Yes, the that in the right direction, but the opposite.

530
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:28,140
OK, so they make it would break otherwise.

531
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:38,670
And you have that if you if you have some time old ski shoes or something, that plastic after 20 years, then they can start breaking.

532
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:43,830
That made plasticizer is gone and they break sometimes.

533
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:54,450
I remember I had the shoes to go in the water and they really became completely rigid and then they break, which is very interesting.

534
01:14:54,450 --> 01:15:02,880
So they have functionalism. But to be functional, they need at least five percent and rather 20 toys.

535
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:11,880
It goes up to 60 percent for something. So big quantities that we can have here.

536
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:27,150
And so now if I have the same game, if we play and I have my toy, it enter this time in the object in Tahrir, OK, and from there, where can it go?

537
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:33,150
Let's quickly. You have little time. Yes.

538
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:42,360
This can you can you tell me where we go from there from the time to reach the people.

539
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:50,420
The skin touching it, what else?

540
01:15:50,420 --> 01:16:01,310
Gastrointestinal tract. Yeah, so hands in the mouth is probably that would you go we are just OK.

541
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:08,510
I would say here, but if they put water in the mouth, the thigh directly.

542
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:17,180
So here you will have a direct gastrointestinal tract down to here.

543
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:25,850
OK. And now indirect transfer. What what's happening with what is in the thigh?

544
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:36,090
It will also volatilized. OK, and then it can reach the I mean, we will breathe the quantity here.

545
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:40,340
Now another transfer you have if you do the whole Mastodon's,

546
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:47,510
you at the end of the life that is likely to go to a landfill or an incinerator or something that after after a certain time.

547
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:53,390
OK, so if we if we do that, it was interesting.

548
01:16:53,390 --> 01:17:05,390
This is phenol. You see that within 15 years you have like 60 percent, which will be released here for one point five centimeter toys.

549
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:12,680
In that case, if you look at the plasticizer, like the iron pea, you see here we are 10 minus six.

550
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:18,480
So we have three per million, which will be a re release over the 15 years.

551
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:27,570
So very different behavior between a volatile compound and a semi volatile which go very slowly release.

552
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:34,250
OK, and we look at the first order transfer of radiation that's ingestion, dermal contact and then fail.

553
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:38,330
And then we can put percentage. And that is what our model are doing.

554
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:46,400
If you take six, seven for you will be able to play with that and determine this quantity which are taken.

555
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:52,220
So you see a product in the fraction you basically have here, the indoor air.

556
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:58,220
You see you are at five, then minus three, something like that, which is relatively constant.

557
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:02,870
And then we can get the exposure in milligrams per kilo per day.

558
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:10,790
And finally you get here either the index, which say above one, the kids are at risk in that case.

559
01:18:10,790 --> 01:18:19,460
And what are the chemical here? Mostly. In fact, when we look at that, they are the blue chemical here.

560
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:29,060
We have here the exposure of those wehi of the what is a safe dose and the ratio of the to the further here the the worse.

561
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:37,190
And you see, these are all the plasticizer which are in blue, which are coming here soft or hard plastic.

562
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:52,070
But they are the main here. And we can then look at what are the chemical of concern which have the highest here hazard index in that case.

563
01:18:52,070 --> 01:19:01,730
Or you see here there are like 300 to high this phthalate, but the phthalate substitute, like three in phosphate, also relatively bad.

564
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:11,010
So and quite a few of these places either have never been here, looked at or regulated according to our to our work.

565
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:21,430
So this is where you can get the one point three billion hits target and get like 150 from the newspaper and worldwide reporting.

566
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:32,510
Get there. Now, this is not I mean, the toys, in fact, when we look into the maintenance products are really high.

567
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:38,180
If you use a paint or viewer, I mean, they can mask data protection equipment.

568
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:45,560
That's really useful. OK, I think we'll stay here, give you an idea of how to get this integration.

569
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,360
And if you want to go more community, just six, seven for this winter, you're most welcome.

570
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:59,930
Thank you. Thank you so much, Professor Julia.
