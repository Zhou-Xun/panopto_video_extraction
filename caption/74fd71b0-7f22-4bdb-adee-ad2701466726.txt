00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:04,896
Okay so, in this module, we're going to do what I call snow angel breathing,

2
00:00:04,896 --> 00:00:12,386
and a few little variations on it, this is really good for slowing yourself down and also for feeling grounded,

3
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:19,036
like sometimes we feel grounded in our feet, or grounded in our chair. But this one helps us feel,

4
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:24,796
we're gonna be laying down on the ground, so you'll feel lots of points of contact and support

5
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:31,356
in your body. So what I want you to do first is, first of all, just the visual.

6
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:34,956
Most of us kind of, if you haven't had a chance to actually make snow angels in the snow,

7
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:42,516
we know what it looks like. You're going to lay on the ground, hopefully, where you have space to kind of spread your legs out

8
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:51,356
and spread your arms out. And once you're there, you're going to just start moving your arms up and down,

9
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:56,566
your arms are gonna be straight, and your legs are going to be straight, you're going to kind of just move them slowly,

10
00:00:56,566 --> 00:01:05,046
and breathe. And you're really focusing on slowing down your breath,

11
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:11,986
slowing down your body. And you're letting your mind just really focus on what feels like.

12
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:20,866
What does it feel like to be supported by the ground? What does it feel like to breathe slow and move slow?

13
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:26,566
You're kind of inviting your brain and your body to settle

14
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:32,386
and slow down. You're noticing with each breath,

15
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:37,756
the slowing, and then being calmed,

16
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:46,176
and supported. So you can just do that exercise and stay there as long as you want.

17
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:52,506
Another variation of this, you can stay lying down, just how you are.

18
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:57,096
If it's helpful, you might want to, for this one, either bend at the knees,

19
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:02,106
so it's kind of like when you're in P.E. and  push-ups and your knees are bent or you can put a pillow under there,

20
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:05,966
you just might want to have a little bit more support there.

21
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:13,166
Another option is to kind of put your legs up the wall so you're laying down, your legs are up the wall. Play with this.

22
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:18,896
You might want to just try legs bent, and then from there, figure out what works best.

23
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:25,476
But in this one, what you're gonna do is you're gonna put your arms out completely straight to your sides.

24
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:34,056
And then you're going to slowly bring them up and together above you, inhaling.

25
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:41,616
And you're going to slowly let them fall, and exhale.

26
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:46,806
And this can be good when we're having a hard time slowing down our breathing, this can be good when we're, again,

27
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:52,686
really tight, having a hard time letting go. We're just going to, for as long as you need,

28
00:02:52,686 --> 00:03:01,306
you can set with either of these exercises some music or a timer, or just listen to how long your body wants to go.

29
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:07,936
But you're just inhaling. And exhaling.

30
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:17,246
And you're letting yourself slow it down and slow it down and slow down the pace of your arms, your arms are kind of setting the pace for your breath.

31
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:24,366
So when we have a hard time focusing just on our breath, we can come to this to slow down.

32
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:30,526
You're inhaling. Holding it there.

33
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:37,116
Exhaling, and letting go. And you can do this for as long as you need.

34
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:44,496
Sometimes when everything is really overwhelming, doing something simple and repetitive like this

35
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:49,526
can be really calming. Again, while we're doing it, we're not thinking about any other things.

36
00:03:49,526 --> 00:04:00,406
If we get distracted, we come back just to our arms and to our breath.

37
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,206
And that's it, and you can do it for as long as you want.
