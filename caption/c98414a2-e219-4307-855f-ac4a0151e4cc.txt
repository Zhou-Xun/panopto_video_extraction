1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today's session will begin with an introduction of our guest, Professor Mersa Eisenberg.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
She and I will then have a discussion and question and answer session about today's topic.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The Cauvin 19 pandemic. During our discussion, I would strongly encourage you to submit questions for Dr. Eisenberg via the Zoome.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Q and A function, not the chat function.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Dr. Yuet and the G.S. sighs We'll be monitoring the Q&A function and we'll pass along questions to be addressed live during this session.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So with that, I'd like to introduce our guest,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Professor Eisenberg is currently an associate professor in our Department of Epidemiology here in the School of Public Health.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
She is also an associate professor of mathematics and of complex systems in Ellison.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A Dr. Eisenberg completed her academic training at UCLA.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In particular, she completed her P.H. D in biomedical engineering in 2009 and then spent three years as a postdoctoral

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
fellow in mathematical biology at the Mathematical Bio Sciences Institute at Ohio State University.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's OK. Before joining our funk, our faculty, Dr. Eisenberg's research is in mathematical biology, which I will briefly mentioned,

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and then she can explain further, including modeling of infectious diseases such as cholera and other waterborne diseases.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases is a valuable tool to help understand the spread and possible

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
mitigation of pandemics under different assumptions since early in the covered nineteen pandemic.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She has been a key member of the University of Michigan. AP Math Koven, 19 Modeling Group,

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
which has been focused on modeling the dynamics of the covered 19 pandemic and advising the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And also Governor Wittmer, for example, to work on the EPI math group,

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
has included forecasting the number of laboratory confirmed cases of covered 19 fatalities,

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
hospitalized patients and hospital capacity issues,

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and also examining how various factors such as social distancing and mask wearing, might impact the spread of the epidemic.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Dr. Eisenberg. Marissa, it is my privilege to welcome you to Public Health 200.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you so much for having me. It's great to have you here. As was already mentioned.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We've compiled a number of questions to start us off. And so let me just dove right in.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I suspect that everybody in this webinar is familiar with the Corona virus and its impact on our lives.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Can you tell us a little more about Koven 19, perhaps comparing it to other infectious diseases we might be familiar with, like flu, Zika or Ebola?

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, so, I mean, at this point,

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
probably everyone is is fairly familiar with Colgate and sort of the basics of how code works and how it's spread and all of those kinds of things,

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sure we'll talk about it more. But, you know, so covert is is a respiratory illness.

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's spread primarily by close contact, by droplets and perhaps some by aerosols as well as things like that.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You know, it's in terms of comparing it with other infectious diseases.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So of the ones you list, it's a floozie cable. It's probably closest to flu and that it's also respiratory illness.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a you know, it's a it's also a virus like all the ones that you listed there.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's it's most similar to flu in part because the way that it.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Of its transmission. Right. So, you know, contact droplets spread, airborne, spread, all of that is very similar to flu.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Some amount of perhaps fomites, which is surfaces transmission.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, that's all kind of the kind of thing that you would expect to see with something like flu.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The transmission routes for Zika and Ebola are, you know, sort of different in that way.

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So Zika being a mosquito borne illness and Ebola being transmitted through bodily fluids that,

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you know, including, you know, vomit and other kinds of things, blood, feces, all that kind of stuff.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So there's there's differences in terms of transmission.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's also differences in terms of the course of infection and what happened.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, you know, Ebola is obviously much more deadly than, you know, then.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And it has a very different sort, of course, of infection in terms of the way that symptoms progressed and things like that.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know, Zika is a much it is mostly for most people, Zika is asymptomatic.

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You know, for some people you get a fever and the rash and joint pain.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And, you know, most of the things that we've kind of usually think about for Zika,

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you know, are related to sort of the pregnancy effects of microcephaly. I mean, so that's sent into the course of infection.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Again, it's probably most like flu, although it is more, you know, the the death, the, you know,

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the death rate and the like, you know, sort of impact of of covered seems to be worse than flu in that sense.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But, yeah. And then, of course, the last thing I'll decide, I'm going on. But the spatial extent extent is different, too.

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So like, you know, Zika has, you know, all three of the ones that you this as comparisons are have had international spread.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I mean, flu goes around the world every year. So it certainly has a similar spatial extent covered with Zika, Ebola.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They both have seen international spread, but it's not to the same degree.

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I mean, so like Zika is a pandemic, but because it's a mosquito ward, there are limits in terms of where that vector where the mosquito can live.

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And so it doesn't get, you know, out of certain you know, once you're up in Canada, for instance,

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
where it gets really super cold, you know, you're not at all of Canada's cold, whatever.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But, you know, once you're up north or in the mountains or, you know,

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
whatever places where the mosquito looks like we live, then it's harder for it to be around anyway.

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes. So that's that's my. Right. Right. Yeah.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Know his knowledge of past similar infectious diseases aided the battle against Kofod.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And what makes Kovar a more difficult patient to tackle compared to other infectious diseases?

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, it's a good question. So so definitely knowledge of similar infectious diseases has played a big role in tackling Koven.

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, you know, because it's similar to a lot of other respiratory illnesses like flu and things like that,

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
a lot of the same like data systems, the sort of like ways that we do disease surveillance and things like that, you know,

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
have been used for are being used for Cobbett and a lot of interventions like social distancing and Mathew's and things like that,

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you know, that that people have thought about for other respiratory illnesses are things that, you know, are getting used for COBA, too.

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So, you know, there is a lot of stuff that's getting ported over from from us,

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
from experience with other diseases and even experience with other things that kind of,

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
you know, emerging infectious diseases that people have dealt with and things like that that are that are getting used to that.

71
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The thing that is, I think,

72
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
tricky in terms of making Koban more difficult to tackle compared to other infectious diseases is it's called it is in kind of this like.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Terrible, sweet spot in that it spreads easily. It has asymptomatic or priess symptomatic, you know, infections that can transmit,

74
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
but it has potentially serious effects like pneumonia and, you know, higher mortality and things like this.

75
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So it's got this kind of spread of illness combined with being worse than flu in a way that makes it kind of been like this.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like, I want to I want to say sweet spot, because it's not sweet, like sour spot, I guess, you know, where where it can.

77
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It spreads but has these really intense impacts. So, yeah, I think it's kind of what makes it especially difficult to tackle.

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Thank you. You mentioned the word fomites a few minutes ago.

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How likely is it to contract Cauvin 19 through touching surfaces?

80
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Good question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So got to find the word is one should define the word Formato.

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes. Yeah, yeah. Good, good, good. Yes. So a full night is a surface that can act as a sort of like.

82
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So essentially they can act as a vector or a method for transmitting disease.

83
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So you one person comes along, they leave, you know, infectious agents on the surface by touching it.

84
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then someone else comes along and they touch that surface, they pick up that infectious agent and then, you know, become infected themselves.

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And so so a full miters is a surface that can actually in this way and form a transmission for covered is possible.

86
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Now, how common is it is a different question.

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So, you know, the most common transmission route for for Cobh, it is really close contact and and and airborne transmission.

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Right. So this kind of droplets, aerosols, that kind of thing.

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The the. But people have found that cold can persist on surfaces for anything from like hours to a couple of days,

90
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
depending on temperature, humidity type of surface. All those kinds of things.

91
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I have myself in the literature yet seen any real demonstration of transmission that explicitly happened via fomites.

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But the fact that it can persist on surfaces, you know, means that it is a possibility.

93
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And so it underscores like the importance of cleaning and, you know, all that kind of good surface cleaning and hand hygiene and all of that.

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The next question kind of ties into that or follows. You mentioned asymptomatic or pre symptomatic people.

95
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How likely is it if a patient is asymptomatic or are they able to spread coded?

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Good question. Good question. And I think so. So it does appear that people who don't have symptoms can infect others.

97
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now, the one thing that's important is to distinguish between asymptomatic people and pre symptomatic people.

98
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So pre symptomatic people are people who are eventually going to develop symptoms.

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But at the moment, they're currently they currently don't have symptoms.

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Asymptomatic people is usually used to refer to people who are not there.

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They're just going to be asymptomatic the whole time. They're never going to develop symptoms.

102
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They're just sort of they have it, but they they don't show symptoms at all.

103
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The extent of a real asymptomatic infection is pretty unknown.

104
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I've seen estimates ranging all the way from like six percent to 40 something percent of asymptomatic infections.

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And it's really tough because a lot of these studies, you know, they don't always follow up to find out whether the person develops symptoms later.

106
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So it's hard to know whether they're really measuring pre symptomatic individuals or asymptomatic individuals.

107
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But and also people can have mild symptoms. And so, you know, maybe it's that also kind of gets included defense.

108
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But there have been multiple studies that have shown that pre symptomatic and therefore probably also asymptomatic people can infect others.

109
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And so I think that, you know, they're they're less infectious than symptomatic individuals.

110
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But it is it does appear that, yes, you can transmit before symptoms.

111
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is right. To what extent is age related to the likelihood of being asymptomatic?

112
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's a great question. So I think the data is not all there yet,

113
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but it does seem like older individuals are more likely to develop severe disease and they

114
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
are probably also more likely to be symptomatic rather than asymptomatic or present somatic.

115
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And like little kids tend to be more often asymptomatic.

116
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And so it seems like, you know, there is an age effect where older individuals tend to both show symptoms that have more severe disease.

117
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But the data's still not all there.

118
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
A lot of this has been like small reports from like daycares or little things where, you know, you you can kind of track these things down.

119
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But, yeah, it does seem like that is the case. Great.

120
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you. As I mentioned in your introduction,

121
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you've been involved with advising the State of Michigan Department of Health and Human Services about the pandemic.

122
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Can you tell us a bit more about what this has involved?

123
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What type of contributions have you as an infectious disease specialist made to help shape the state's response to the pandemic?

124
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah, so so I can maybe I'll give a little a quick sort of timeline of how this happened.

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So I started off doing I was initially like back when cozied, really, baby baby got started and it wasn't in the U.S. yet.

126
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was like, I'm not going to model covered. I've done all these, like emerging infectious disease.

127
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm just I've done I've got too much on my plate. And then.

128
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And I was like, I'm going to do a stick of myself and get my work done and whatever.

129
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And then. And then. So a colleague of mine did in medical school, who knows?

130
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Emily Martin is another faculty member in epidemiology. And I contacted me and was like, hey, you know, we're thinking about how we should, you know,

131
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
should we how should we respond to things that the Michigan medicine and the hospital?

132
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You know, I think we can use a model. Would you be willing to do it? And I was like, wow. Right.

133
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I get it fine. Like, you know, kind of reluctantly because I thought, well, I hate Michigan.

134
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There's not you know, there's not going to be that many people who are doing monolingual Michigan.

135
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So sure, I'll do it. And so I started doing these models. And then as a kid in Michigan, you know, it sort of started to spiral out.

136
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I had previously done some work along with a couple of other colleagues with and DHHS looking at some other different infectious diseases.

137
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And so we we ended up getting in contact with the state epidemiologists airline.

138
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And it kind of took off from there, but we ended up doing it.

139
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We've been doing models for MBA teachers. And then eventually working for, you know, interacting with the governor and her team.

140
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And so we sort of took off and we were starting to build a lot of different forecasting models and things like that.

141
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And then eventually, we also got. I also sort of got moved into doing a lot of the like metrics work.

142
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So trying to figure out what indicators do we need to be.

143
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So in addition to building models and trying to say what might happen if we did this, if we did that,

144
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
if if we you know, how might cases look in the next few weeks, those kinds of things.

145
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Then we also started looking at what kinds of indicators do we need to be tracking to understand risk across the state.

146
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So I don't know if you all have ever been to my start mapped out info, which is one is like one of those sort of state dashboards.

147
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You know, we've been working a lot on what indicators should we be tracking to understand risk

148
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
was kind of built like different metrics for use on the dashboards and then also.

149
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So now it's ended up that I I'm now part of a group that briefed the governor once a week.

150
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And so we we talk about different metrics and different ways of assessing risk and ways of assessing the impact of covered.

151
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And we build models and try and explore what might happen under different types of policy options and things like that.

152
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And so it's kind of expanded the time. And so at this point, really,

153
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
we sort of do modeling and then also sort of science advising to try and understand

154
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
the data and explore what if scenarios and think about things along those lines.

155
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And so that's kind of where it is now. But it's it's it's like it's a little bit of a flying thing because it's sort of like it's expanded rapidly.

156
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And then at some point I was like, oh, I guess I'm also a professor. I don't know what I do in that part of my job.

157
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But, OK, we're doing this all the time, like, you know. Yeah. So it's it's kind of each thing.

158
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But yeah. So you've described quite a variety of activities and contributions.

159
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What's been the biggest challenge you faced while eating the state and the governor and responding to the crisis here in Michigan?

160
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, so this is I mean, there are a lot of challenges. So some of the challenges are around data and around, you know, meeting information.

161
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's hard to figure out right where we're working with a new it's a new disease.

162
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's there's a lot of unknowns.

163
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And, you know, we have everybody not just, you know, like everybody has questions from policymakers to me to every random person.

164
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We all have questions about this. And not all of that information is there yet. Right.

165
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And so trying to figure out what the best you can do with limited information where we don't yet have like a big literature like we do with flu,

166
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
where we know a lot of the details on how things work and what's going on, you know, and so that is certainly a challenge.

167
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
And then there's also like a challenge of sort of communicating uncertainty and nuance data.

168
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You know, I think trying to make clear when you're talking with, you know, policymakers who they really want to know, OK, like, what's the number?

169
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What do we do? You know, either win win. Can I should I shut this thing down?

170
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Should I not? You know, I'm trying to communicate. Uncertainty and nuance is tough, you know?

171
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And, you know, is it is a challenge.

172
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I mean, we're really lucky to be working with, you know, the governor and her team and DHHS all really are very they want to follow the science.

173
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They're really interested in understanding the details. And so, like, it's it's it's a lot easier than I think it definitely could be.

174
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But it's it's a hard thing. I think it's also been interesting just to see, you know, when you're doing this stuff, you know,

175
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm just helping to advise on the science that's watching and seeing how what options are available depends not just on sort of what the science says,

176
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
but also on a lot of things that you have to balance in terms of what are people willing to do.

177
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know, if you can only kind of enforce things to a degree and you can only kind of sort of you know, there's only so much you can do.

178
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You have to kind of balance your like what you want to recommend versus what's actually possible to do,

179
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
which is interesting and has been kind of a challenge, I think. Yes.

180
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes. Here's here's one that's a little bit that's related to a little bit different.

181
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How are covered related policies on the state level reflective of federal mandates?

182
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Where does the state of Michigan have more or less free reign to do what it wants to do?

183
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's a great question. So I feel like I have to give a small disclaimer here, which is that I'm not a legal expert.

184
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And, you know, I don't I would not you know, I advise on the science,

185
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but it's really the governor's office and MPAC just who does all the policy decision making and all of that.

186
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And so, you know, all that. So with that said,

187
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I think part of the thing that's tricky with this one is that the current federal

188
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
level government hasn't had as much of a role as you sort of might expect.

189
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There haven't been like national mandates around, like social distancing or mask sharing or anything like that.

190
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Right. And so that has meant that, you know, there kind of is more free reign to do different things.

191
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I mean, states and Michigan included do have to comply with federal requirements.

192
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And we are obviously tracking CDC guidance very closely. So that's certainly, you know,

193
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:47,000
those kinds of things do mean you have to do certain things and that you want to follow the best practices and all of that, you know.

194
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But but there it is. It has been fairly free reign.

195
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I would say, you know, overall, in part, just because there hasn't been as much pushed by the federal level to say you must do this.

196
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You know, there have been some things, you know, like, for instance, with testing requirements or the coverage of testing costs and things like that.

197
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And some data, things that have played all kinds of mix ups of the switchover from hospitals reported to CDC,

198
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
then briefly to the White House and then back to CDC again, you know, has made all kinds of like mix ups with our data analysis and all that.

199
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But, you know, but, yeah, it's it's been more free than it might have otherwise been, perhaps.

200
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah. And then continuing sort of in their theme, as of now,

201
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
there's been over seven million confirmed cases in the United States and over 200000 deaths due to the virus.

202
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yeah. By my count, looking at the data,

203
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
we have one of the highest death rates in the world and possibly the highest among the advanced industrialized countries.

204
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why do we look so bad?

205
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What could have been done differently to avoided such a bad outcome, and what might we do going forward to improve our circumstances?

206
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, no, I mean, I think we we more than look bad.

207
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We know that. Yeah, I don't. I think it's I think it's it's a lot of things.

208
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I mean, there hasn't been. I mean, some of it relates to what we're just talking about, there has not been sort of coordinated response.

209
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Right. And and so that is probably some of it. I mean, two to two feet, something like this.

210
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You need a couple of things, right? You need initial early, decisive action that squashes initial spread and starts to flatten the curve.

211
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Right, so that we don't overwhelm capacity. And so we buy time to bring up testing.

212
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We want to bring up testing really fast. Right. Get that so that you can get a handle on this.

213
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Understand how much spread there is and start to box it in. And you know, all of those things.

214
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You know, testing was very limited for a long time that and, you know,

215
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I think it was it was a lot of that stuff has moved slower maybe than it really needed to.

216
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The other thing that that happens, too, is that, you know, you need to squash the spread as quickly as possible.

217
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But then you also because we were it's going to be a while.

218
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
There has to be a sort of willingness and ability to stick it out when it comes to social distancing interventions.

219
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And, you know, things like, you know, you know, all the stuff that you have to be doing,

220
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
case investigation, contact tracing, testing, social distancing, all of that stuff.

221
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You know, it's going to be a long haul. And so that means that you you both need to be doing it and keeping on it.

222
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But then also you have to have the support systems in place to make it possible for people to keep sticking with that.

223
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Right. Which means, you know. So I think there's a lot of things that.

224
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
To be coordinated and needed to happen in a fast and effective way.

225
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And we just haven't totally done that.

226
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I mean, I think. Some of it is.

227
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And I don't want to get political, but whatever some of it is a leadership thing.

228
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Some of it is also like probably to some degree, sort of like American individuality and cultural norms, meaning that we are like,

229
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
screw you, I'm going to do what I want, like, you know, which in this case is probably not the right, you know, reaction in some ways.

230
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And so some of it is that kind of thing, I think. But I think it's a combination of those which has ended up meaning that we just haven't, you know,

231
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
kind of squashed this and kept things flat the way that we have needed to to to going forward.

232
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think, you know, there's still there's still we're we're still have a lot of.

233
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And this is not good. We sell a lot of room to grow when it comes to cases and deaths.

234
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And so to avoid that happening, like, you know, we need to we do need to stick with it.

235
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
We have to stick with the social distancing. We have to until we have treatment or about, end about and or a vaccine.

236
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You know, you've got to stick with that stuff. And for people to be able to do that, that means the support systems need to be in place.

237
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So, like one, there needs to be leadership to make sure that those kind of interventions are actually happening.

238
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And then, too, there have to be support systems by which I mean like economic support.

239
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You know, all kinds of different things that make it possible for people who are suffering from job loss or,

240
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you know, having to wrangle childcare and all of these kinds of things.

241
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because if you're a social distancing, that makes them a wreck out of all kinds of other aspects of your life, then, you know,

242
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
there has to be support systems in place to make sure that people can actually do these these best

243
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
practices and and still be able to get on with their lives and make rent and do all that kind of stuff.

244
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So I think that's yes, it's complex.

245
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I would say, yeah, it is. Oh, there's a lot at this point along this as Emily.

246
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I don't know if we have any questions from the from the audience that you want to share with us.

247
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah. Thank you to the students who have submitted questions so far. We have a lot of great ones.

248
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Marissa, I will mention that a lot of students are really curious about your opinion on the University of Michigan's reopening plan.

249
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
How I'm not going to ask you any of those questions now.

250
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Perhaps a lot of time at the end, but that is an issue of great interest to students.

251
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But but thinking about questions that have been posted, worked like that, although it's good to ask that question important.

252
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I, I was trying to be. I'm just being silly. Oh, no.

253
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I am so thinking about some of the topics that you covered in this segment, questions that students had included.

254
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Is there any information about whether or not the virus stays in your body after you've been infected?

255
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Kind of past that. They suggest 10-Day period. If so, how long does the virus stay in your body?

256
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Great question. OK. So, yes, there is some information about that.

257
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You can be PCR positive for a few weeks after after infection and it depends how severe your illness was.

258
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So it seems like for asymptomatic individuals, it's like one to two weeks.

259
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
As for more, the more severe you get, the longer the virus persists in your body.

260
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But it's not that doesn't necessarily mean that you can transmit.

261
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Just because it's detectable doesn't mean that you actually have viral levels high enough that you're transmitting to people.

262
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But it there is some evidence that it can stick around for a little while, you know.

263
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But I don't know. I think so. The 14 day period is really designed around when can you transmit,

264
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
which is like a different question than like how long can you detect the virus in a person?

265
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah. Great. The next question that I wanted to ask you is, are that a student posed?

266
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Can people with mild or no symptoms still have long term health effects?

267
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
They're really very, very good question. I don't think it's fully known yet.

268
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But I've I've heard I would need to do like a brief witch hunt to see if there's new information on this.

269
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I have heard anecdotally that it is possible that you can have like heart damage and things like that, even if you had mild symptoms and didn't like,

270
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
for instance, weren't hospitalized or anything like that or, you know, had even sort of very mild symptoms.

271
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So I do think it's possible I would expect that it's more likely the more severe your illness is.

272
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But I don't I'd have to go looking around to see if that's what I just jump in on that.

273
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:00,000
There are a couple of studies that have looked at C.T. scans, chest C.T. scans of patients with few or no symptoms,

274
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
and they found a substantial percentage with clear evidence of certain types of lung damage,

275
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
despite the fact that they have not been symptomatic or significantly symptomatic.

276
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So the short answer is yes, there is some evidence of that.

277
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The real question, as you suggest, is we don't know the full extent. All right.

278
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And then if I may, I will ask one more, which has come from a couple of students.

279
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What's the most updated and trustworthy information on immunity obtained by actually getting the disease and related?

280
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Once you get it yet, how can you get it again or how long till you can get it again?

281
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That is a great, great question. OK. So there's the picture on immunity is is changing all the time.

282
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
There's a bunch of different things that are still sort of like I think we still don't know a lot.

283
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So I will say this. It's it's clear that antibody levels like, wow, I say it's clear.

284
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
It seems from like all of the state is early. Right. But it seems that antibody levels do drop off.

285
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So there was a recent study and I think Jamma that showed that after two months, people like 42 percent of people went from zero positive,

286
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
meaning that they showed an antibody response to two zero negative, meaning that they didn't.

287
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
And so an antibody levels, response levels dropped for everyone in that study.

288
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So it does seem like antibody level.

289
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
But it's not totally clear what that actually means in terms of immunity, because there's t you know, parts of it.

290
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
There's like other features of the immune system that are also playing a role in immunity.

291
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And so it's not totally clear. You know, exactly what.

292
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, essentially, we don't have a perfect measure of immunity yet.

293
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And so it's hard to know exactly how immunity is changing even if antibody levels are dropping.

294
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It does appear that there is some protection afterwards. How long it lasts is harder to say.

295
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And I think we're still sorting that out. Lots of other great student questions coming in.

296
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Several of them was related to health disparities across the U.S., in Michigan specifically.

297
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So I'll let students keep entraining questions and turn it back to Dr. Franzblau to to keep asking from our from our earlier list.

298
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yes. OK. Thank you, Emily. And by the way,

299
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:41,000
the topic of health inequities is is gonna come up and we'll have plenty of time to be talking about that because it is an important topic.

300
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Can you tell us about the impact of wearing face coverings or masks on the pandemic in general or in Michigan in particular,

301
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and how this is reflected in mathematical models of the pandemic? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

302
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
OK. So so facemasks are definitely important.

303
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I think, you know, we've done so I've seen some modeling looking at the impact of a facemask.

304
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And it's you know, people have shown her in a few different settings looking at how facemask use has has improved,

305
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
you know, has had an impact on transmission. We did some modeling for Michigan where we looked at not facemasks by themselves.

306
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
We are actually doing that like right now. We've been working on the looking at the impact of the mascot Michigan order.

307
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And so but that's not it's not done yet. So we're still in the works there.

308
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But but we did look at the combination of facemasks and social distancing and found that those together,

309
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you know, at least in our models and, you know, that's that's just preliminary.

310
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You know, that's not a it's just a model.

311
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But it does suggest that the combination of facemasks and socialista things in Michigan probably did prevent a large number

312
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
of our estimates from the model or something like twenty five thousand cases and something like three thousand deaths.

313
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So it was you know, it was a pretty substantial impact of of of the combination of social distancing and last use in Michigan.

314
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So. And we also and that's actually probably kind of an underestimate on the deaths,

315
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
because we also the model would have suggested that social distancing and mask use.

316
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Without it, we would have had a peak, which would have been two to three times as high as what we saw currently,

317
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
which would have we didn't model how that would have affected capacity for hospitals, you know.

318
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But that having peak levels that would have been so much higher probably would have really hit hospitals and public health capacity much,

319
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:56,000
much worse than than it did. And so that would have even made death, you know, even worse.

320
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So it does seem like social distancing. And Matthews in Michigan has made a difference, which is great.

321
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And there's really, you know, important we were hit early and hard at the initial part of things and we've really brought it down,

322
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
which is a wonderful thing to see. I think that's, you know, keep gone, you know.

323
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah. So, know, here's a little bit more nuanced question marks.

324
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You can wear a mask and cover your nose in your mouth or you might just cover your mouth.

325
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Is there a. Has that been examined quantitatively in terms of the differential impact?

326
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That is a good question. Yeah, and I didn't actually answer, I guess you're so masc use like masks in general, like how effective they are.

327
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
They are definitely effective. How effective they are depends on what kind of basker wearing.

328
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Right. And how and like, is it a cloth mask? Is it a medical, you know, sort of a more surgical type of mask?

329
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You know, does it have it? How is it fitted all those different kinds of things, but masks in general?

330
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Definitely health when it comes to having it below your nose or having those vents.

331
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Both of those are really problematic because you the point is to stop, you know, droplets.

332
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And, you know, exhalations, aerosols, all of that from exiting from your mouth and your nose.

333
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And so if you're only blocking your mouth, then you are still, you know, both inhaling and exhaling via your nose,

334
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
which means it really reduces the protection for you and also your protecting other people.

335
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I, I haven't seen a quantitative study of, you know,

336
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:49,000
what fraction of droplets are come to your nose versus the your mouth, which would really help to, you know, get at that.

337
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I haven't seen what I would be super curious to. I mean, that's I'm sure someone is doing this.

338
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Is it. You know, but I. But I'm not sure. It's probably not.

339
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's probably not totally up because it is at least blocking your route, but it's certainly defeating the purpose to some degree.

340
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So definitely people saw their masks over their noses. Yes.

341
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And you hit it in a couple of important subtleties, I think.

342
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,000
First of all, there are different types of masks. But putting that aside for the moment.

343
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The fundamental purpose of most masks wearing outside the medical setting.

344
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Is is to protect whom? Yes, it's really it's really about like protecting.

345
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I mean, you could protect you to some degree, but it's also about protecting other people from you.

346
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
If you are even if you think you're fine, if you're asymptomatic, you know, you can spread things out.

347
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And I think one thing that's important to bring up here is that the there's a there's a we talk about herd immunity,

348
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but there's a population benefit of mask use, too, in the sense that if everyone is wearing a mask, it reduces everyone's risk.

349
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And it's and there's a population, even if masks aren't perfectly effective at stopping droplets or stopping transmission.

350
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
You know, if everyone is wearing them. The population effect is is significant because it means that, you know,

351
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
there's sort of this, like benefit to all from having this sort of widespread reduction.

352
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And so, A, that's an important piece of masking, too.

353
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Thank you. I have a question.

354
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You just mentioned herd immunity, so I'm going to jump ahead to that. Oh, yes.

355
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What does that mean exactly? And how how does that become applicable here?

356
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And what's the theoretical threshold for this disease?

357
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes. Great question. OK. So so here actually, I am going to share my screen because I just made a slide on herd immunity,

358
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:09,000
or if you get to see one of the governors, five big ones over here, he just seems.

359
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You know this really quick. Do not disturb.

360
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I've had too many times with classes where randomly, you know,

361
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
my mom and my sister starts texting me and then the whole class is watching, like, did you hear what?

362
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
OK. So here you go. So so. Right. So herd immunity. OK.

363
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So. So herd immunity. This is my little herd immunity fight.

364
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So this is the resistance of a group of people to attack by a disease when you have a large proportion of the group that's immune.

365
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Right. So if we look at this top part of the slide here, you know, when the.

366
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So the immune people are in blue, they're susceptible. People are in gray.

367
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And we have this one infectious person in red here. Right.

368
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And so when population immunity is low, then the infection can just spread through the whole population.

369
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And, you know, it sort of takes off. Right. But when enough people are immune.

370
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So here you can see that more people are blue. Right.

371
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then the infection spread is contained. And even people who aren't actually immune get protected because there are enough

372
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
immune people in the population that it blocks transmission from hitting.

373
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So, like, this person can't actually transmit to this person over here because there's there's all of their contacts are are immune already.

374
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So that transmission doesn't go anywhere. And so that's the idea behind herd immunity.

375
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:49,000
And one of the like sort of big contributions of that mathematical modeling has helped with is that it lets you calculate a threshold or what

376
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,000
fraction of the population needs to be immune to mean that you're in this sort of a situation where the number of new infections will decline.

377
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
And you eventually start to see extinction of the epidemic. That threshold depends on a lot of different things.

378
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The contact network, the degree of protection from transmission. All kinds of different stuff.

379
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But the estimates for recovered are are something around you.

380
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I've seen estimates that are pretty wide ranging. So it's kind of all over the place.

381
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But anywhere from like 50 to 75 percent is sort of the rough range that I've seen for four Cobbett.

382
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yes. And so it's there are there are a couple of people who think it might even be lower.

383
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But but but not low enough that we're anywhere close to the highest prevalence that I've seen in Michigan has something around nine percent.

384
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So we are far from herd immunity at this point. Yeah.

385
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And so and just to say a little more about herd immunity, I mean, if you think about,

386
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
you know, Michigan has seen, what, like 130, 140000 cases, something like that, 7000 ish.

387
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:08,000
That's I think. And so if you think about where we are and how far we would have to go to get to herd immunity,

388
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
that's not really a viable just letting it loose and letting us get the herd immunity is not really a viable strategy right now.

389
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We've got 10 million people in Michigan, and even if our testing is only identified, 20 percent of the people have been infected.

390
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I agree. We've got a long way to go. And just as another comment, the herd immunity varies with different diseases.

391
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So measles is one of the most super transmissible.

392
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, man. And they're like unity. Seven percent.

393
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Exactly. You have to be over 95 percent to have herd immunity because it's so unbelievably transmissible.

394
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And so the biology is really important. And I think you've been emphasizing that, which is really good.

395
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Yeah. Well, let me ask you something. We've touched on the idea of a vaccine.

396
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,000
What are your thoughts about when we might have a safe and effective vaccine? And let me differentiate two particular milestones.

397
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The FDA might announce a vaccine at a particular date. Now and then there's actually when might I actually get a vaccine?

398
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is I thought you were gonna do the like like Russia and China have.

399
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh, no, I got there. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

400
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Right. So. So there. Yeah. OK. So in terms of when we might get a safe and effective vaccine.

401
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So the estimates that I've seen are like summer of 20, 21, maybe fall 20, 21.

402
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So sometime midway through next year and at the earliest that I've seen for it to be available.

403
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Now, there are a number of I don't know if you all have seen your time, has a great vaccine tracker.

404
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
If you've seen that little tracker thing, it's it's great.

405
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It it keeps track of how many vaccines are different. So it's so different every now.

406
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Something like that. Yeah, that's right. There's there's a bunch and they think so.

407
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Something like eleven or something of them have hit phase three trial. This is where they're testing their efficacy in large scale trials.

408
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So these are basically vaccines that have largely they're not totally sure proven to be fake.

409
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But they're they've they passed through the initial checks for safety and now they're ready to be tested on a larger scale.

410
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And so that's happening now, including I think a couple of them are doing trials in Michigan so that there is some amount of that happening.

411
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But the I think it's I think it's you know, it's going to be awhile.

412
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And there will be an interesting question when it comes to rollout, because, you know, a lot of I mean,

413
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
a lot of companies have been getting ready to do large scale production, but still going to take quite a bit of time.

414
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And so there will be some issues around like how do we prioritize when the vaccine is not yet fully available?

415
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You know, who are the highest risk people who really need to be protected?

416
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You know, how do we how do we roll out a vaccine in an equitable way?

417
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You know, I think is something that is still not totally figured out. But yeah, so that's an interesting question.

418
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And in terms of production, it's it's my understanding that something like 90 percent of the vaccines produced in the world today come from India.

419
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yes. Yes. Which is super interesting, isn't it? Yeah. Right. Yeah.

420
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Which don't forget housing challenge. I'm going to reach out to you.

421
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I see that there. There's a lot of activity on the Q&A.

422
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And I thought that this theme of prevention we've been discussing might have generated some pertinent questions, if you think there are any.

423
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah, there are just lots of questions that really want to know a little bit more about MASC use and of the surgical vs. 95 versus cloth's.

424
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So some some questions about that. And then I've gotten a couple of questions that around mutations of the disease.

425
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And are we sure we're testing these things?

426
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So so maybe you could stop to talk a little bit more about what you know about the differences and the benefits of masks from different materials.

427
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And then I can ask a more specific question on disease mutations or viruses.

428
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So so there was a reason. I was just trying to see if I could find that there was a recent study that came out.

429
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I think MMW are looking at different mask.

430
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I have the mike digging through my tabs on the fly. But I'll have to I'll have to find it and I can e-mail it out.

431
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But so it does seem like so Quantcast are less effective than sort of the, like, medical mask.

432
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So that but they are still they are still they do still accomplish something.

433
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So, you know, I think I think there is like medical masks,

434
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
like a ninety five and surgical masks, things like that seem to be more effective than Glockner.

435
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But it is still the case that a clock mask is is good.

436
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And you should know where that if you can. I think let's see.

437
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't remember what the difference in effectiveness was. I, I don't know off the top of my head.

438
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But yeah, the issue, of course, with some of these things is making sure that they're fit correctly and all of that kind of stuff.

439
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah. I don't know if there's how you do a lot of environmental things.

440
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We may actually get a little closer.

441
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:48,000
There's right in occupational health especially, there's a whole field of masks and different types of masks and fitting for masks and so forth.

442
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And you're right. And this bleeds over into the hospital domain where there are standard surgical masks, which are fine,

443
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,000
but then they're in 95 masks and then they're air purifying respirators, which are at even higher level of safety.

444
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Nobody's talking about that in the general population. Yeah, I did.

445
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
No, no, no. That's just simply Haspel.

446
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But even in ninety fives in the general population, are art really possible that that would be just we just don't have enough and it's not.

447
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah. But just regular surgical masks or cloth masks.

448
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
As you said, they're not perfect, but they do a lot. Yeah.

449
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So maybe I could pose a question, a student question about mutation's.

450
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So what do we know about whether the virus is mutating and what effects that might have on transmission and mortality rates?

451
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Right. Yeah. Yeah, so. OK, so I don't know all of the story so cold, it is certainly mutating.

452
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I mean, just like all viruses do all the time. You know, that's the stuff.

453
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It does not mutate as fast as my impression as lot of other diseases.

454
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So it's not a fast shifting disease in that way where you really need to worry about.

455
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
There's going to be. Oh, you want my video?

456
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think you can still hear me. I think. I hope.

457
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Yes, we can still hear you. Good. OK, great. Yeah.

458
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's not a fast changing disease.

459
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So it's it's it's it's a relatively slow moving mutation process for covered the.

460
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I think there are distinct strains like, you know, people have found small, small differences and things like that in the genetic sequence.

461
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,000
But it does not appear like it's changing in a way that is making it, you know, like it's not evolving into a supercomputer or something like that.

462
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
You know, it's small mutations do happen, but it's a pretty slow moving bug and it hasn't as far as mutation goes,

463
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,000
it hasn't really been changing that much. Oftentimes what people like sometimes with emerging viruses.

464
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,000
A lot of the times people expect that if they do you take they'll actually become less virulent,

465
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
meaning less deadly or less sort of like bad in terms of the facts as that's like sort

466
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
of a common thing that people will see is that as they as they get into a new house,

467
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
like humans, they evolve and become less deadly actually, for humans.

468
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,000
There's what people often talk about is this thing called the virulence transmission tradeoff where, you know,

469
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:43,000
you want to you have to be like if you you like, the virus has to balance how much it wants to transmit versus how deadly it is.

470
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
You know, if it's too deadly, it'll kill a toast before they could get more virus spread out and about.

471
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So it's balancing kind of deadliness, which really equates to like growth within the host versus transmissibility, which gets it to its next host.

472
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And so a lot of times the sort of common wisdom is that they as they mutate, they'll actually mutate to be less deadly as it goes.

473
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
But I mean, in the case of kov, it it's really not changing that much.

474
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
So I think, you know, it's I don't think we have to worry about mutations so much.

475
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's been changing and sort of small ways, but not not a ton. Really interesting.

476
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Thank you.

477
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
We're getting a lot more really interesting scene questions, but I know that some of them are going to be asked by Dr. Francisco in our next segment.

478
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So I will go ahead and turn it back to Dr. Franzblau. Thank you.

479
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Thank you, Emily. So now I want to move into this theme about health inequities.

480
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
We've heard a lot about the differential impact of the infection in different groups in the United States and around the world.

481
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So, for example, older people,

482
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,000
people with compromised immune systems and people with multiple chronic illnesses appear to be at much greater risk of bad outcomes.

483
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,000
However, there have also been reports of higher rates of infection in higher death rates in racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States.

484
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And can you speak to these apparent health disparities and offer some explanation for why they have occurred?

485
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yes. This is definitely a major issue. I mean, so there have been big health disparities by both, you know, sort of age and co morbidities,

486
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
like you mentioned, but also by race and ethnicity, both across the U.S. and within Michigan,

487
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
where, you know, at the U.S. level, you've seen higher infection rates, higher hospitalization rates,

488
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,000
higher death rates for, you know, like black and Latin X Latino individuals.

489
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You know, a lot of different racial and ethnic disparities in Michigan, particularly in the first wave.

490
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
There was a higher risk of infection and of death.

491
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:03,000
If you are black compared to if you are white and there was I seen the recent analysis of Michigan's data that estimated incidents.

492
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:13,000
So case incidence and mortality rates were five point six and six point nine times higher for black and white individuals in Michigan.

493
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So it's definitely been a problem. Yeah. And so, you know, I think it's interesting, though, that same analysis showed that at least for Michigan,

494
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I think in general there's a lot of different things to some of this.

495
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
People have talked a lot about comorbidities and things like that and differences there.

496
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But I think maybe an access to care as well, perhaps.

497
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But I think in Michigan, this one analysis that looked at Michigan data showed that it was actually more about differences

498
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
in exposure and that that was or at least a lot of it was about differences in exposure.

499
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So, you know, a lot of these disparities were coming from.

500
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So some of the things that come to mind when it comes to exposure, differences,

501
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:03,000
differences and job differences and who makes up the essential workers who then are are at higher exposure levels.

502
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
All of those kinds of things. Some of it is also, you know, where like the first wave hit denser cities earlier.

503
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Right. And so it hit Detroit. And then the, you know, the sort of make up demographically of Detroit versus of other parts of Michigan.

504
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But there there has been some interesting analysis looking at like who makes up essential workers, you know, who has been exposed to Cobh.

505
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It. And there are big differences. So for Michigan, I think that has played a pretty big role, you know.

506
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And so it's interesting now it has been shifting to some degree.

507
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So the the like sort of if you look at.

508
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Like the cases cumulatively versus in like the past two weeks.

509
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So if you look at cases cumulatively, I went and dug up what we had from the most recent, you know, sort of numbers.

510
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The so, so black and African-American individuals made up twenty eight point four percent of cumulative cases,

511
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
but only 15 percent of the population in Michigan. Right.

512
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Which means that they're getting hit this proportionately, disproportionately as a percent of the population that they make up.

513
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Right. In the past two weeks, that has shifted. And now it's eight point two percent of cases.

514
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And, you know, with the same fifteen percent of the population.

515
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So it's much closer to the percentage. You know, there's a lot of wabble, though, like a two week window is more noisy.

516
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And so, you know, the numbers will wiggle around as you go from week to week.

517
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But that's suggesting that it's closer to sort of level, meaning that it's more proportional now than than it was at the beginning.

518
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But, you know, it's it's the I think now, in addition to thinking about sort of the despair for Michigan's prison picture,

519
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I think, in addition, think about sort of the disparities in cases and in mortality.

520
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I think, you know, it's also important to talk about disparities in the economic fallout,

521
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
which still have not you know, so the case numbers have kind of become more similar. The economic fallout has not resolved itself yet.

522
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So, you know, in Michigan, like and this is true across the country, too, there are big disparities in in the economic side as well.

523
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So higher unemployment levels and things like that that have persisted.

524
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So for Michigan, there is still higher unemployment for black Michiganders than for white Michiganders.

525
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And that has persisted and hasn't recovered to the degree for black Michiganders than it has for white Michiganders.

526
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So I think those disparities are important and things that we need to watch.

527
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
The other thing, when it comes to disparities on the economic side,

528
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I think there's an interesting like child care related disparity in that economic fallout is hitting women in a lot of cases,

529
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,000
you know, and particularly women of color. You know, they get the brunt of it from both, like, you know.

530
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So I think there's a lot of interesting things there, you know,

531
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that like a lot of the employment like impact is hitting women who end up staying home to take her kids because the kids can't go to school right now.

532
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Everybody has to socialism, etc.

533
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So, you know, I think there's a lot of pieces to the impact of covered and the disparities there that are going to be with us for a while.

534
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And really important to to to work on.

535
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
One thing that I heard about in this regard and wondered if you've heard about this is differences in multigenerational households.

536
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And I haven't. That's interesting. Yeah. And and also transnationally.

537
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So Sweden, for example, has a much higher fraction of single person households compared to other advanced industrial countries.

538
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And that obviously would have an impact on transmission because living with somebody is a lot of intimate contact.

539
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah. And I suspect that there are differences by ethnic ethnicity and race in the United States in terms of multigenerational household.

540
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Totally, yes. Yeah, and that that analysis in Michigan that was looking at exposure.

541
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You know, it wasn't. They they they also were like it. It's a combination of household exposure, work, you know, community exposure.

542
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
All of those things, you know, are it seems like we're contributing in some way.

543
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:27,000
That's interesting. So building on this theme earlier in the semester,

544
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:35,000
part of what students learned about was the social determinants of health or how where you live, work, grow and play impacts your health.

545
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And can you give some examples of how such social determinants of health shape?

546
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Cauvin, 19. Infection outcomes and risk of infection.

547
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We have done this already. But, yeah. Yeah.

548
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So, I mean, some of this we sort of talked about, I mean, so social determinants affect all the pieces of coded.

549
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Of the coded process. Right. So, you know, social determinants of health will affect your exposure.

550
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
So, you know, are you an essential worker? Do you live in a dense city?

551
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:14,000
All of those kinds of things. Right. That's that's going to be affected by social determined social determinants will also affect your comorbidities.

552
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Right. So, you know, the social determinants of health that you've been embedded in for your entire life.

553
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Right. That people have been embedded in for their entire lives will affect whether they have diabetes, heart conditions,

554
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:35,000
asthma, COPD, obesity, all of those things which we know are bound up with, you know, worse outcomes.

555
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
If someone does get covered. Right.

556
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And so so that's certainly part of it, that social determinants of health will also impact health care coverage and your access to care.

557
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Right. So that's also a big piece. And social determinants will affect your housing situation.

558
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Right. So homelessness can be, you know, a factor or, you know, different kinds of housing situation can impact your risk of covered as well.

559
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And so. Yes. And the economic piece, of course, to social affirmance will certainly impact all of that as well.

560
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So in terms of what is available job wise and all of that kind of thing.

561
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:21,000
So I think social determinants of health are like very tightly bound with all of the different pieces of what happens when someone gets covered.

562
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And so. Yes. And the risk of getting covered in the first place. I want to pause here to see if we have more questions from the audience.

563
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
We do have some more really good questions, but I think so kind of fit in in, though, what's next?

564
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:48,000
How do we know kind of that final segment? So I know that we'll have time in the last 30 minutes to to answer some of those.

565
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So I will keep it with you for now. OK. All right.

566
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Great. So thinking about the future, what should we be doing to be better prepared to deal with new infectious agents and diseases in the future?

567
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
A great, great question. So we are learning a ton from Kovik, right.

568
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And we need to not waste that lesson right. We we we need to turn that into an infrastructure that lets us plan for the future.

569
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
There will be more things like this. You know, humans are a lot more interconnected now than they were even in 1918.

570
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:32,000
If we're thinking about that as like, you know, it's a similar kind of big respiratory pandemic, you know,

571
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
and we can translate the lessons that we learned here so that the next time this happens, we do better.

572
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Right. And so I think part of that and making sure that we actually do translate the lessons that we learned here

573
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:55,000
into something actionable next time is thinking that humans are not great at thinking about low probability,

574
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
but high impact, that we just aren't that great at it.

575
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Right. Like, we we often tend to be like, oh, that earthquake was terrible, but it didn't five years.

576
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I'm probably fine. I'm just going to build this very rickety chimney on my house, like, you know what I mean?

577
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Like, that's kind of our nature. Right. And so and so, like, we aren't so good at remembering that.

578
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Like, even if it won't be for a while or even if it's low probability,

579
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:32,000
you still have to pay attention and you still have to put some thought and some money into, you know, prepping for these kinds of things.

580
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And so I think that is something that we'll have to remember.

581
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I mean, right now, covered is everything on our brains all the time, you know, and it's very present.

582
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But we have to after this is all done and over with, which, you know, hopefully will be a thing and hopefully will be a thing soon,

583
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
you know, then we have to turn this experience into kind of a playbook or a plan for handling the next time this happens.

584
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So I think that's like my biggest my. Also, boxer.

585
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
No, no, that's. This is what we're looking for. Thank you. Yes.

586
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And do you think or when do you think life will eventually go back to normal or do you think it'll go back to normal?

587
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Or are we going to be wearing masks for a long time?

588
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Retro? I think I think it will eventually.

589
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
But I think there are some changes that might stick. I mean, so one, I guess I think there's a lot we don't know.

590
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We don't. We were just talking about immunity. We don't understand the full picture of immunity.

591
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It might be that Kobe becomes the Demick or something.

592
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:48,000
You know, if we have lots of immunity and we can't, you know, get a vaccine, that sort of gets us to, you know,

593
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
the other way to get the herd immunity and the way that you that the threshold was intended for is for vaccination.

594
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Right. So you can get to herd immunity by vaccinating enough people.

595
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And then and that's that's the the better way to get to herd immunity.

596
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Right. And so if we can do that. But, you know, if if we can't, then, you know, it's possible this might be with us for a while.

597
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I do think eventually we'll get back to normal. But I also do think that there probably will be some changes.

598
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I mean, you know, I think the culture in the U.S. around Manwaring has shifted a lot.

599
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Right. Like, you know, that is not a weird thing. It also is now.

600
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And so, like, I I'm curious to see if in flu seasons going forward, you know, if if wearing masks becomes,

601
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
you know, more of a regular thing that people do when, you know, I don't know.

602
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I mean, it'll be really interesting to see how some of that changes. I think there are a lot of changes.

603
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
We've like had to kind of we've been necessity is the mother of invention.

604
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
We've been forced to innovate for certain things and to figure out how to do stuff on the fly,

605
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,000
whether that's around remote teaching or whether that's around, I don't know, like food delivery.

606
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I mean, like a lot of random things that have had this change. And I'm some of that stuff might stick.

607
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I don't know. It'll be interesting to see what what stays and what doesn't. So, yeah, I think some I think we will see you change it.

608
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
But I do think eventually we will get back to normal for the most part.

609
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I appreciate your optimism. I hope so.

610
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I'm just thinking about the Corona virus and thinking about the flu virus.

611
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So every year we. We have to guess which flu strain is going to be dominant and then make a vaccine,

612
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
which takes many months and then get him ready to get take the vaccine.

613
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Hoping we've picked the right strains going forward because the flu viruses mutate at a certain rate.

614
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Corona is not flu. It's a different family. But some members of that family are more encouraging than others in this sense.

615
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
So SA's Zehnder Acute Respiratory Syndrome and MIRVs Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

616
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000
They're relatively stable. And in fact, there were vaccines that were developed but never distributed because those illnesses kind of petered out.

617
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But the other corona viruses are common colds.

618
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And there's now been a vaccine for the common cold because now, in fact, we've all gotten the same cold 15 times in our life because we lose immunity.

619
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And so one of the basic and frightening questions is what's going to happen with this corona virus?

620
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Yeah, it's a very, very good question. I mean, I don't know what will what will happen to this corona virus.

621
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
You know, I it doesn't like based on the.

622
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
This is I'm not an expert when it comes to virus evolution.

623
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So, you know, but based on the flow rate that it's mutating, I'm hopeful that we will be able to have a vaccine.

624
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:59,000
You know, that it's more in the stars and murres category where there's a vaccine that we can use to really kind of, you know, squash it down.

625
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Now, it's possible, though, that, you know, that because immunity may wane,

626
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
which does seem probably the case that there will be some waning of immunity.

627
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You know, that's common for a lot of things that it might be that, you know, like the flu vaccine, you know, it mutates.

628
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So we have to get new vaccines each year.

629
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:25,000
But it's also the case that we don't say, you know, our immunity doesn't necessarily stay at the same level that it was right after we had the flu.

630
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
You know, that also drops off to some degree.

631
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And so, you know, it's possible that there will be a Kobie vaccine that you have to get and have a booster every now and again.

632
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I mean, you know, it might be something like that where it's just that's just it is what it is.

633
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And, you know. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it'll be interesting to see, I think I don't know where how the vaccines are doing.

634
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But I think that's going to be something that everyone is going to be tracking pretty closely once a vaccine breakthrough and is effective.

635
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:03,000
You know, I think the other thing we're going to be tricky is like, how do we do? Like if the vaccine is not fully effective but is partly effective.

636
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You know, like, a lot of flu vaccines are not perfect. They don't completely protect you from, you know, getting the flu.

637
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
But they might shorten your duration of illness or they might reduce the severity of symptoms.

638
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You know, things like that. So there's a lot of middleground when it comes to the vaccine and to how that affects the transmission of covered that.

639
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Like, I think we're still all kind of like watching and waiting to see what happens.

640
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And we'll have to adapt to it as it as it develops. So right now, that's that's a really good point.

641
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:42,000
What do we mean by an effective vaccine? So one thing that a lot of people don't appreciate, for example, is with the pneumococcal vaccine,

642
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
it certainly prevents pneumococcal Lavonia in a substantial fraction of people who get the vaccine.

643
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But more importantly, it's very good at preventing sepsis, which is what kills you when you get pneumonia.

644
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So a substantial fraction of people will still get pneumonia, but a lot fewer are going to die.

645
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And so that's still a positive outcome. Yes.

646
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And I think polio back to the polio vaccines are actually like a great example of this,

647
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
though, like, you know, there's there's two kinds of polio vaccine.

648
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
There's an oral vaccine and there's IPV enacted inactivated polio vaccine that you get as a shot.

649
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And they they are they're different.

650
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:28,000
So the oral polio vaccine is a live vaccine, meaning it has like a like mellowed out version, but it's still transmissible.

651
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And oral polio vaccine prevents.

652
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:40,000
If you're immune, after all, polio vaccine, you're it stops both you you can't transmit it to other people that you can't

653
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
have an infection of the virus going in you and transmit to other people.

654
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But you also and you also won't get paralysis, which is the bad outcome, you know, polio, but inactivated polio vaccine, IPV,

655
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:00,000
it stops you from getting paralysis, but it doesn't actually fully stop you from transmitting polio if you were to get it later.

656
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
And so you can have silent epidemics of polio where they're silent because no one gets paralysis,

657
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
because there's enough people vaccinated, that you just don't happen to observe any paralysis.

658
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
But it actually does transmit through populations.

659
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And so that's something that, you know, there's a lot of subtleties of this that are kind of tricky.

660
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Do we have any more questions from the audience at this point?

661
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:35,000
We have almost 30 questions, so we won't get to them all because we only have 10 more minutes.

662
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I want to make sure to respect your time, but so me, I can shoot him at you rather quickly.

663
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Lightning round of questions. Yeah. Okay.

664
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So looking at the immediate future, kind of thinking about the next few months,

665
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,000
what do we think about the cold weather and how that will influence transmission?

666
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That's a great question. So cold weather will drive people indoors.

667
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You know, we may have more indoor gatherings which could, you know, mean more transmission.

668
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Right. So that's like sort of often the big concern. I do think everyone is also watching really closely to see what happens when you layer flu.

669
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:21,000
You know, because flu season tends to be wintertime. It's more of a you know, that's when flu season tends to hit.

670
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
And so, you know, are we going to have flu layered on top of it?

671
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And how is that going to affect things that are social distancing might actually mean that flu is less of a thing than normally.

672
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Like that seems to have been the case in like the Southern Hemisphere.

673
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
It's been so, you know, it might be that we have a milder flu season, but that's something that I think everyone is watching closely.

674
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So I think cold weather is going to be something that will be tricky because it's going to both mean that if people get together,

675
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
they're probably getting together indoors. So they might be at higher risk of transmitting then.

676
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And it also brings with it preseason, which is also going to do something a little tricky to watch.

677
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Next question.

678
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Some students have noted that there has been some kind of shifting guidelines or recommendations from the CDC and as well as other sources.

679
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:21,000
So we wanted to ask, what sources do you find trustworthy when you're looking for information or news about covered?

680
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And also, what do you think are kind of our biggest outstanding questions around covered right now?

681
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Whew. Biggest outstanding question is a tough one. There are a lot of.

682
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:40,000
OK, but first question. So in terms of so I do keep track of CDC, I mean, they have had some yes, some changes.

683
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
They have to balance a lot of factors when they are putting out guidance. But they still are.

684
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
They do. They're they're a great source to go to in terms of trying to understand what's going on.

685
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
WHL, also the World Health Organization, is another place to keep track of things.

686
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
They also have some have like some nice overviews of transmission and the like links to studies and things like that.

687
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I also track the literature. So, you know, the MMW are jamma like all the sort of, you know, new papers and things like that that are coming out.

688
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
You know, you you read those and keep up to date as much as you can.

689
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I mean, there's a ton if the tidal wave of kovács studies. But you keep track of it as much as you can.

690
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So I think, you know, all of those have been good. I was really impressed with like I mean, I don't know.

691
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Like New York Times and some of the other big newspapers have been like building trackers, you know.

692
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Oh, and Johns Hopkins tracker, of course, everybody. I'm sure it's clear with that one.

693
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It's a nice dashboard for just kind of keeping track of how many cases and what's going on, you know,

694
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
but those have been those have been those have been they have like nice kind of data, pictures and things like that.

695
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Some of The New York Times kind of data visualization stuff has been nice.

696
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Another place that there's a there's a group called Resolve to Save Lives,

697
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,000
which was put together by Tom Frieden, who's the former director of the CDC.

698
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And they have some nice like just like sort of best practices and policy documents and different kinds of things,

699
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
guidelines, commentary, stuff like that.

700
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It's less like sort of like news about covered, but it's good for kind of getting they have a lot of interesting stuff there.

701
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So that's another place to maybe look. Still a lot of questions about the vaccine.

702
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Yes. From your understanding, what who's kind of going to be the first round of people to get the vaccine?

703
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Would you recommend that people get it as soon as it is available to them?

704
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Thoughts on that? Yes. So so I don't know in terms of who's going to be.

705
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:55,000
There's been a lot of discussion about who should be prioritized keeping for four early vaccine.

706
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,000
You know, when the vaccine first becomes available, you know who who needs to be vaccinated first?

707
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
A lot of that discussion has been around, you know, health care workers,

708
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
essential workers, people who are kind of on the front line when it comes to exposure.

709
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Also people, you know, older individuals, people who have a higher risk of,

710
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
you know, of having worse outcomes when it comes to Cobbett and that kind of thing.

711
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
So so those have all been things that I've seen.

712
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I've also seen some discussion of health disparities and whether that should play a role in how a vaccine rollout happens and stuff like that.

713
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But I don't think there's a there's a sort of settled plan as far as what the rollout should be in terms of whether one

714
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,000
should get the vaccine if as long as the vaccine has gone through the full standard sort of safety checks process,

715
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:54,000
the clinical trials and all of that. You know, if it if it has been like approved by the FDA and has gone through the whole process and,

716
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
you know, I mean, I would I'm really looking forward to when we actually have a safe and effective vaccine.

717
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
You can count me in for getting that as soon as it's available. I mean, I think I think it's definitely a good thing.

718
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And then even if it's not a perfect vaccine, if it is, it's not fully effective.

719
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I think anything we can do to build up immunity in the population without hurting people, you know, is is a good thing to do.

720
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I know there have been concerns raised that because of the and this is an odd thing to say.

721
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
This whole process has been a strange world.

722
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:40,000
But because of the political situation that a vaccine might get rushed through and people have have worried about that.

723
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I don't know if that, you know, is it. I don't know how. How really probable that is to happen.

724
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:55,000
But is one is that the vaccine has passed through the sort of standard safety process and is is has been shown to be safe then.

725
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
And it's effective even if it's not perfectly effective. I think it's a good thing.

726
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I'll be a thought other I like our Emily, I don't know you guys. I agree.

727
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I think, yes, there's. Look, the politics are challenging today, and I'm right.

728
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And certainly, you know, the FDA has not been immune from that, to use her cute phrase.

729
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:35,000
And the CIA has had that. But I agree with you, if the process goes forward, as it has been designed to do, I'll have a lot of confidence in a.

730
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:43,000
So, Marissa, I won't try to paraphrase or ask you directly about the universities reopening plans or your thoughts on that,

731
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,000
but I would kind of give you the last the last stage two.

732
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
There's two hundred and, you know, seven students that are still on the line.

733
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,000
What would you say directly to these two hundred seven students about them staying safe?

734
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Them keeping their classmates status? What would you recommend to them as we continue to wait for the vaccine?

735
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I think the biggest thing is that, you know, I think I think it's hard to.

736
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I mean, like, the thing that's tough with this is that dealing with Koban requires a sort of staying power when it comes to social distancing.

737
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:29,000
That is incredibly tough. And you know that it's important to want to acknowledge how difficult that is, particularly.

738
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Like, I don't know, I think about my experience as an undergrad and how formative that was for me.

739
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And I think that it's a very hard time to have the social distance.

740
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:49,000
But it is really important to both to your friends and yourself and also the broader community.

741
01:16:49,000 --> 01:17:00,000
You know, I do think that our modeling, if anything, has shown how critical social distancing is and and how much it has made an impact so far.

742
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
And so as much as possible, you know,

743
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I think I think that's that's something that like I know there's been a lot of

744
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,000
discussion about you and reopening and the sort of pros and cons of doing that.

745
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And. And I don't know how much we want to dig into all that right now.

746
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Probably that's not. But, you know, I do think there is a risk.

747
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Right. With reopening, I mean, if it brings a large number of people into one place and we're relying on ourselves and

748
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
our community to make sure that we collectively do the best that we can to reduce spread.

749
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And we're also relying on our systems, our infrastructure for contact tracing in case investigation and all of those things.

750
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Right. And I guess I just my method would be dead, like I think just to keep it up as much as you can.

751
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I know it's really, really hard. Yeah. And it's exhausting.

752
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Thank you so much, Dr. Eisenberg. I'll let Elstein us off.

753
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:11,000
But before I lose the stage, I will just remind students that we have an exam one week from today and an exam review on Tuesday.

754
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You'll get more information about both in an email within the next couple hours.

755
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Thank you, Doctor, you it. And the rest of the teaching team and Dr. Eisenberg, thank you so much for a really fascinating hour and a half.

756
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:36,000
This has been a wonderful discussion. I really appreciate it. Our students can't wave at you right now, but they appreciate it, too.

757
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:51,760
So take care. Thank you so much.
