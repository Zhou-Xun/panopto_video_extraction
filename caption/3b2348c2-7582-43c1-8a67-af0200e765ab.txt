1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,750
All right. Welcome, everybody. And Happy Tuesday.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,540
Happy Election Day. Hope you guys are getting out there and exercising your right to vote.

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,630
So today we have a session on governmental public health.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:29,870
For those of you who are here today and hopefully watching later, we have Rachel here who's from Kent County and we have Joe who's from HHS.

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,000
They're going to tell us a little bit about what they do. And then we'll have some time for some questions.

6
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:44,560
So other people, they'll be watching it later. So as recorded you'll see that I'll it can see your face.

7
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,220
I get started. Oh, hello.

8
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,760
My name's Joe Coyle. I work for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,650
I'm the director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease Prevention.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,360
So I have the immunization division and our communicable diseases division that report to me.

11
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:16,570
So pretty much every infectious disease that the state is working on is under my area, except for HIV and STD.

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,559
And I think Katie McCumber was here last week. So her area does the sexually transmitted infections.

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,740
But other than that. If it's infectious, it's usually in my shop.

14
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:39,480
So my journey to sort of get to where I am is I don't know if everyone always knows what they wanted to do, but I think maybe I was more in that camp.

15
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:51,659
I was a I was always interested in math and in science, and I liked puzzles and games and things as a kid.

16
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,360
And so I actually was just interested in those topics.

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:08,700
Mostly in high school, I ended up getting a I tore my ACL when I was playing soccer and had reconstructive surgery, which was really not a big deal.

18
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:18,659
But I got an infection after that surgery and was in the hospital for a while, had antibiotics intravenously for many months.

19
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,200
And so I was pretty healthy at the time.

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:32,999
So it was one of those things that kind of changed my life, kind of directed my career path, I guess, and made me think about preventing infections.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,940
And I thought that was lousy and something that shouldn't happen to people.

22
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:47,730
So that's kind of what I got into and pursued a career here at U of M in a bachelor's degree in microbiology, kind of on the nose.

23
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:57,659
And then, like many, I think was interested in, you know, potentially medical going in the medical field or something like that.

24
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,569
But my interests kind of general were more towards sort of the public health, population health aspects.

25
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,880
So did a stint here at U of M and got my master's degree in hospital and molecular AP.

26
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,410
And my first job out of school was working at U of M infection prevention,

27
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,819
doing surgical site infection surveillance, an antibiotic resistant organism type of surveillance and control.

28
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:29,580
So from there, I actually took a position at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in Lansing being the

29
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:38,760
infection control consultant for the state and had a have taken other managerial positions since then.

30
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,410
So one of the more exciting things that I'll talk about a little bit is my experience managing our hepatitis C program.

31
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,590
It was my my leap from sort of a first line staff person, a frontline staff person to a manager,

32
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,059
which was kind of nerve wracking for me at the beginning.

33
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,850
Never imagined managing people necessarily, but it was really rewarding.

34
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:10,139
The state didn't have any. They got a new grant for hepatitis, surveillance and prevention, and so it didn't come with a lot of precedent.

35
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,360
It didn't come with, yeah, and I thought that was exciting.

36
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:24,840
That could really build something. And so that program's really grown and I've managed different, different programs since then.

37
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,760
TB Health Care Associate Infection Program. I've managed in addition to hepatitis.

38
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,290
And about a year ago, I took this job as the director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease Prevention, which, if you remember,

39
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:47,159
just a little over a year ago was right when we were heading into the delta wave of COVID, and I'm a crime wave of COVID.

40
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:57,100
So it's been quite the journey, I guess, here over the last year, trying to get pretty much Rachel and I were talking before, you know,

41
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,850
pretty much any anything you're hearing in the news infectious,

42
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:10,140
whether it's it's COVID or RSV or flu or Ebola, monkeypox, etc., is kind of all falling in my area.

43
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,459
And it's something that keeps us on our toes and. You never know what the next day is going to bring with infectious diseases.

44
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,750
So that's one of the things that attracts me to the topic and keeps me going.

45
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:36,620
So I wanted to give a little bit of a a story about hepatitis C because I think what the story is sort of what I'd like to just impress upon students,

46
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,130
because when I was like basically what I would want to hear if I were in your shoes and you know,

47
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,889
when I, when I was going through my classes, epidemiology classes,

48
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,410
I was very focused on being a subject matter expert and being one to sort of crunch the data.

49
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,460
And I really liked playing around with data, but I think what this story illustrates is that like,

50
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,210
that's good, but you get to like, what are the data mean? What do you do with it?

51
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:10,510
And what sort of impact can you make using that information, really turning the data into information.

52
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:18,299
So one of the things that we saw very early on with when I was when we started our hepatitis program at the state looking at hepatitis

53
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:28,410
C is we continue to see a almost year over year increase in the number of new hepatitis C diagnoses amongst persons that were younger,

54
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,659
less than 40 years old, for example. And hepatitis C is a chronic infection, right.

55
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:42,350
So not necessarily that all these people were infected in these years, but this is when they were initially diagnosed.

56
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,870
And this is you're only counted for chronic hepatitis C once, right?

57
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,160
So this is not prevalence. This is the number of new diagnoses.

58
00:06:52,430 --> 00:07:00,230
And so you can see, you know, we were in 2000, you know, probably 100 to 200 new hep C infections in that age group.

59
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:08,120
And by the time we got into 2016, 2017, seeing close to 3500 new diagnoses per year.

60
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:20,659
And so some of the different analyzes that we could do with our data and we have over close to 100 reportable conditions in Michigan.

61
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,480
Hepatitis C is one of them is look at the demographic breakdown by age, for example.

62
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:35,510
And so you can see here just the number of new diagnoses in 2009 versus 2018 and sort of this age distribution from youngest to oldest.

63
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,690
And you can see like a clear bimodal distribution in 2018.

64
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:51,080
That's not quite evident there in 2009. So you can see that clearly there's this increase in the younger population that has been occurring.

65
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,740
And we can do lots of things with our data. This is basically folks that were newly diagnosed with Hep C.

66
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,810
For a handful of years and sort of the geography of where they live.

67
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:13,110
Chronic and acute infections. And it's not I mean, if you've familiar with any of the COVID data, like when you start plotting where COVID cases live,

68
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,820
it ends up looking like a population density map, which is not terribly interesting.

69
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:24,450
And that's a little bit what you see here with hepatitis C, but we can look at the data in a number of different ways, of course,

70
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:29,219
not just looking at where the number count of cases and geography,

71
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,520
but the rate giving us a sense of which populations might be disproportionately impacted by the infection.

72
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,229
And one of the things that stood out to us as we were, you know, whenever we have these infectious diseases that are reportable,

73
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,610
we try to do a case investigation and figure out what's the origin of that infection.

74
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,600
Can we learn anything about trends or patterns?

75
00:08:52,380 --> 00:09:01,470
And one of the questions for hepatitis C is when we are able to complete an interview with one of these individuals, is, have you ever injected drugs?

76
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:11,520
And so this is self-reported information. And it was close to 85% of those that we interviewed said that they had a history of injecting substances.

77
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,700
Gave us a good sense of why we were seeing this increase in hepatitis C infections in that younger population.

78
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,480
And of course,

79
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:29,810
we know what's going on with the opioid epidemic and how there's been increases in the use of substances and street drugs in particular,

80
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:37,580
that if that's not being done in, especially if you're injecting substances and not doing it in a sterile fashion,

81
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:44,030
may introduce bacterial or viral infections, especially if there's sharing of of equipment.

82
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:55,280
And we talk a lot about fatal drug poisonings and how we talk a lot about fatal drug poisonings, but.

83
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,030
Or overdoses, if you if you prefer. But.

84
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,239
It's really the tip of the iceberg of who's using substances and the population.

85
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,559
That's at risk of things that are not just the outcome of the fatality,

86
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,810
but if people continue to live making sure that they can stay, stay safe as possible.

87
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:25,430
So one of the things that that really got our movement going in Michigan was

88
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,399
an outbreak of HIV that occurred in southern Indiana a number of years ago.

89
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:40,310
I don't know how familiar people are with this, but this was sort of their epi curve where they looked at the number of new HIV diagnoses by week.

90
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,490
And this is not a was not a very populous area of Indiana.

91
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:55,910
It was very low in their county rankings, almost majority, almost completely made up of the white population.

92
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,180
And they typically saw less than five HIV cases per year.

93
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,610
And so I think ultimately they saw over 200 cases in just a handful of months.

94
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,360
And through their different analyzes,

95
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,170
they were able to they were able to do was identify this some this HIV transmission that was occurring in this very small

96
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:25,399
geography was the result of substance use and sharing of of of equipment to inject substances which were not readily,

97
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,049
you know, sterile syringes and things were not readily available in this community at the time.

98
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,910
And hepatitis C infection preceded HIV infection in this population.

99
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,110
So hepatitis C was transmitting for some time in this population before there was HIV introduced.

100
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,370
And so this really got a lot of conversations going locally.

101
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,309
And I think at the national level about what should we be doing about this more comprehensively?

102
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:58,100
So we don't have situations like what what happened in Scott County and Austin, Indiana.

103
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:10,350
And so CDC did a vulnerability study where they looked at what counties in the United States are similar to Scott County and CDC analysis is there.

104
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:17,909
On the left, they flagged a handful. They find counties across the country, but some really specifically in Michigan like, hey,

105
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:25,860
we think these counties are really at risk of an HIV outbreak, similar to what we're seeing in Indiana.

106
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:36,300
And CDC's analysis was okay, but they only had national data that was available nationally in all counties.

107
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,430
And so we had more granular data and thought we should really do our own analysis, which we did,

108
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,900
which is they're on the the right hand side in the sort of darker jurisdictions or ones that would be considered more vulnerable.

109
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,270
And so we're we're thinking about how we package all of this information into eventually,

110
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,580
like, what we're going to do about it, not just like measuring that there's a problem.

111
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:58,950
Right.

112
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:10,350
And so one of the things that was happening at the same time is doing a an analysis of where needle exchange programs are nationally and in the state,

113
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,110
where syringe service programs are ssps.

114
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:21,210
And you could see that these the jurisdictions that CDC flagged in their analysis of those being most vulnerable are highlighted there in the orange.

115
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,520
And then the blue jurisdictions. Counties are the ones that have a syringe service program.

116
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,329
Could see that frequently these things do not overlap.

117
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:36,550
So where we have risk, we don't have programs. And so that was a problem and we didn't really.

118
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:44,490
So we do have needle exchange programs in Michigan, but they were pretty limited limited number and and were serving.

119
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,330
There were originally HIV service organizations that were developed in response

120
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,910
to the HIV HIV epidemic when that was when that was occurring a few decades ago.

121
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,790
So the state law does define syringes as drug paraphernalia.

122
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,040
Michigan, however, there is a exemption.

123
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:16,210
In the way that our laws are written such that if this if the syringe is provided by an

124
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:22,450
authorized agency by the state or local government for the transmission of infectious diseases,

125
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,450
it's exempt from being considered drug paraphernalia.

126
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,130
Not an ideal way to write the law.

127
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:37,790
And one thing that we are continuing to work on make making revisions to these are the types of structural barriers that exist right.

128
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:43,240
In terms of us being able to to roll out the programs that that that we'd like to see.

129
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:52,629
And so this gets at some of the the language, the design here is getting a little bit mixed up.

130
00:14:52,630 --> 00:15:01,270
But what we wanted to show in this slide is that we're trying frequently to help our local partners establish syringe service programs.

131
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,900
And what we'd like to do is be data informed and being able to do that.

132
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:12,850
So we're looking at on the right hand side here, we're looking at kind of a heat map of hepatitis C cases in McComb County.

133
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,290
And on the left hand side, where the local law,

134
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:24,850
whether it's at the township level or the city level or whatever it is, considers syringes to be drug paraphernalia,

135
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,270
where you have these local laws that might conflict with the state law,

136
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:36,790
that might make it sort of nebulous in terms of which law to follow or which laws are being policed in a particular geography.

137
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,849
And you can see that where we'd like to operate a syringe service program is where we

138
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:50,230
have the greatest number of infections and where SSP Needle Exchange is permitted.

139
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:58,959
And so those weren't really exactly lining up very well in the county, which speaks to the need to sort of clarify the drug paraphernalia law,

140
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:06,220
not only to give our partners confidence that when they're distributing syringes that this is not drug paraphernalia.

141
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:15,190
And so they're not going to be arrested as providers of of needles or syringes, but also for the clients, of course,

142
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:22,480
to know that the objects that they're possessing, they're not going to be arrested for or prosecuted for,

143
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:30,729
I should say, in that, you know, if you get an object in Sterling Heights and you go to war and that thing isn't permissible,

144
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,480
and then all of a sudden becomes illegal when you cross some nebulous.

145
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:43,459
Jurisdictional line. The other problem we had with this is that these programs are like free.

146
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,610
People aren't going to start them without support in some way.

147
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:53,780
And we didn't have funding. There is no there's still remains really no funding for syringe service programs from the national level.

148
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,810
And we're frequently funded by dollars from the federal government.

149
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:04,790
One of the things we were able to do was make use our data to make a request to the CDC to say that we'd like to

150
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:12,620
at least redirect funds from another grant to be used to support needle exchange implementation in Michigan.

151
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:22,630
We were successful in doing that, and it allowed us to use like state opioid dollars to to eventually provide some support to SSP.

152
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,370
And so that's some of the work that our group's been doing.

153
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:34,340
Governor Snyder actually had a drug and opioid abuse commission, which we were able to get a letter of support from that commission,

154
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,530
which I think was a little bit of a of a feather in our cap to get that sort of because this

155
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:46,159
can be at sometimes a political sort of subject to go to the very that commission and say,

156
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,959
hey, do you support what we're trying to do with establishing syringe service programs?

157
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,670
And they did. And so under, you know, like a Republican governor and leadership to have that I think was was really important for us.

158
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:07,250
The data. I like to say like the data are global, but like the implementation of interventions is very local.

159
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,640
And so and of course going from one local community to another is very, very different.

160
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,640
And so having some of these things in our back pocket to utilize them,

161
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,310
depending on how conversations were going in those sort of local communities, I think proved proved useful.

162
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,240
And so this just gives us gives you a sense of sort of where we are.

163
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,239
As of round about a year ago.

164
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:44,430
So I know I need to refresh these slides a little bit, but we have, I think, close to 90 locations where folks can get clean needles now in Michigan.

165
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:51,690
Again, we were only starting from really 44 counties that had syringe service programs.

166
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,080
So we're really excited about the growth of the programs.

167
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:02,090
You know, and this was like a data informed approach. I mean, we'd like to we'd like to have programs everywhere in the state,

168
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,160
but in instances where we didn't have the funding to do that or there wasn't a political will to do that,

169
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,049
you know, we had to sort of prioritize where we would which communities we would engage first.

170
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,480
And so we certainly looked at communities that had the highest infection counts,

171
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:25,370
but also the highest infection rates informed by, you know, our local analysis and CDC analysis and vulnerability.

172
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:32,600
And I mean, every year we're trying to obtain more money so we can start more programs.

173
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,069
And these aren't run by us.

174
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,979
I mean, they're run by the local communities, either a community based organization or a local health department or something like that.

175
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:51,540
And. They're just wonderful programs that are very person centric and really help I think, to break down barriers between.

176
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,230
You know, we're very focused with opioids on prevention and treatment and not so much this harm reduction element.

177
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,700
And I'm glad to be able to fill that space a little bit in some of these some of these communities,

178
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,780
because it's a pathway, I think, for many to recovery and excited that people do take advantage of it.

179
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,130
So just a couple data lines to sort of wrap up.

180
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,109
One of the things that we we knew we were going to have to do with this program is is make

181
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,730
sure that we're evaluating it to make it like demonstrating the return on investment.

182
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,830
Because I think naturally we knew people might be skeptical of the work that we were doing.

183
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,220
So in the blue bars are just the number of syringes distributed.

184
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,030
And we're measuring this by a quarter from our programs that are funded through us.

185
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:46,510
And that's the scale on the right hand side. I think as of the more recent quarters where we have data,

186
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:54,700
I think we're close to a million syringes distributed per quarter now up up a lot from where we where we started in 2018.

187
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:02,050
And then the number of client encounters, even during the pandemic have been very sustainable, if not if not growing.

188
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,220
And we're also looking at I mean, there's many different services that could be offered at a syringe service program,

189
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:14,400
Naloxone, to reverse reverse drug poisonings and overdoses is a big one.

190
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:23,850
So you can see that the number of naloxone kits distributed and naloxone kits used or overdoses reversed, potentially lives saved, potentially.

191
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,070
We're measuring from programs to in addition to a number of different data elements,

192
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:36,690
but these are sort of the high level ones that that we use to just make points to administrators or legislators or senior leaders.

193
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:48,740
And then we helped participate in media campaigns related to this, which was really exciting to be like.

194
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,240
I think sometimes we didn't know how public we should be with the work that we were doing.

195
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,490
But to get the support to be like, no, you need to talk more about like harm reduction.

196
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,420
And we're still talking about prevention and treatment for sure. But I just really like some of the message here,

197
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:13,340
messages here that we were able to help sort of contribute to to hopefully break down some of the stigma related to substance use.

198
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,990
And these were actually our harm reduction agencies that participated in the making of the,

199
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,280
the, the content here for the, uh, the creative here for the media.

200
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,170
So, um, but there's lots of work that we also do with Hep C,

201
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:39,410
we've done these couple of slides like the prevention of infections is important, but treating infections is also important.

202
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:43,819
This is a curable infection. There's no reason people need to be living with Hep C.

203
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,580
They can take some pills once a day for eight weeks to 12 weeks and not have hepatitis C anymore.

204
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:57,110
So it's really important to diagnose people, to test people for hep C, to link them to care to a provider that can treat them.

205
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,690
But we ran into a lot of barriers because these medications have been very expensive in Medicaid,

206
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,970
had policies in place that wouldn't cover the medication for everybody.

207
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:16,879
Even so, they would sometimes wait for someone's liver to be sufficiently damaged to prescribe hepatitis C medications,

208
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,690
or they would not treat individuals who were actively using substances, for example, required sobriety.

209
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,879
These are the people that also might be transmitting hepatitis C if they continue to use substances.

210
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,450
It's actually extremely important to treat people who are using substances so you don't see continued transmission of the virus.

211
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:43,579
So we worked for many, many, many years with Medicaid to change their policy on how they covered hepatitis

212
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:50,629
C medications and were able to do that in actually the last couple of years.

213
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:57,830
And Michigan was one of the few states to develop a hepatitis C elimination plan to one day,

214
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:03,260
hopefully not have hepatitis C in our state anymore, which would be amazing.

215
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,290
The National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable did a nice write up on sort of our

216
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:14,810
policy change that that we did with with respect to covering hepatitis C meds.

217
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:23,450
And we were in terms of policy, if you're named in the same sentence with like California and New York and Washington, you're doing okay.

218
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:35,930
So that was nice to see. And we got an A-plus from the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable in terms of our report card for Medicaid policy coverage,

219
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,089
which, you know, we were instrumental in being able to inform that decision.

220
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,159
And my mom is pretty excited that I got finally got an A-plus and something.

221
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,930
And I hope you all have a pluses and your report cards as well.

222
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,040
So. I think that's the last slide I have.

223
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,720
Thank you for that, Joe. We're going to have Rachel.

224
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,530
I'll make sure these slides are posted on our campus page as well as you guys can.

225
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,290
Take a look at those later. We're just going to tell us a little bit about what she does.

226
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:17,040
You know, I really like being paired with Joe because I feel like what we do is really complementary.

227
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:25,950
Joe at the state level and me at the local level. So I'm an opioid epidemiologist in Kent County, which is in West Michigan, in Grand Rapids.

228
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:33,030
And I feel like I'm really glad that you went first, Joe, because I like sparked a lot of ideas for what you talk about.

229
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,990
I have these slides, but I'll just tell you about kind of my career journey.

230
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,930
I was I think the last class I took in this room was like bio stats or something.

231
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,689
So it's like kind of really cool to be kind of full circle back here and standing and

232
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,969
talking with you all because there's just so much potential in those seats right now,

233
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:01,770
and I hope that you feel that. So I started at Hope College in terms of my education, and I was going to be pre-med.

234
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,959
Both of my parents are in health care in some fashion. My dad's a veterinarian and my mom was a pharmacist.

235
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,380
So it was just kind of natural for me to go into that world.

236
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:20,790
And I really like science and math as well. So I was a pre-med track at Hope College and I did Biology and Spanish.

237
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:32,669
And it actually wasn't until University of Michigan Epidemiology Program visited our pre-med club and talked about epidemiology that I was like,

238
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,560
Oh my gosh, I didn't even know that this existed. That's what I'm going to do.

239
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:43,620
And so totally went in that direction and haven't looked back, haven't regretted it at all.

240
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,799
I actually the SSP that exists in Kent County and has existed for a long time,

241
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,930
I volunteered at while I was in undergrad at Hope College, the Grand Rapids Road Project.

242
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:04,980
And so I would hand out condoms on street corners and package safer, use supplies like needles and cookers and things.

243
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,800
And so that kind of got me really interested in the opioid epidemic.

244
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:23,610
So after Hope, I did an internship actually between Hope College and University of Michigan MPH program at Kent County Health Department,

245
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,889
interning for my current boss, actually, which is so funny. I was like, This is awesome.

246
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,630
I really like this internship, but I do not want to work in Kent County because it's like where I'm from.

247
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:43,080
I want to move away. Maybe I'll work for CDC. And so I'm back at Kent County with the same boss, but it's actually like amazing.

248
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:52,740
So I did not focus at all on the opioid epidemic while I was here at Michigan, which I think was honestly probably the best thing I did.

249
00:27:53,190 --> 00:28:02,370
Chronic disease research went to Bolivia over the summer for some survey and did like diabetes and hypertension stuff.

250
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:13,990
Which is great because one of my goals was not to pigeonhole myself into opioids because I knew it was something that I was super interested in,

251
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,710
but I wanted to make sure that I was aware of everything else that was out there.

252
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,819
So then I actually did a fellowship after my MPH with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists,

253
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,050
the Applied Epidemiology Fellowship Program. It's a two year fellowship program.

254
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:42,660
They pair you with a site. And I ended up in Oklahoma City because they were doing a prescription drug overdose fellowship.

255
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:48,000
It was a pilot at the time, and that was 2014.

256
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,540
So if you're thinking about those waves,

257
00:28:51,570 --> 00:29:00,780
it was that Joe showed it was the wave where synthetic opioids are starting to take off as the third wave of the opioid epidemic.

258
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:08,850
I really didn't think I would ever end up in Oklahoma City, but I really loved it and I loved the fellowship program.

259
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,900
So I had for sure. Take a look at CSC.

260
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:21,300
I think it's easy to eat out or if you haven't already and they have a great annual conference every year, next year's going to be in Salt Lake City.

261
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:32,030
If you're interested in going, I'll be there for sure. So that program was really great because we had a list of competencies that we had to fulfill.

262
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,890
It was kind of an extension of the MPH program, I felt, and there were about 30 of us in the cohort.

263
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:46,920
And so it's been really nice, honestly. Like I still connect with folks from that cohort because we're all across the country in different

264
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,829
types of roles from like working at a local health department up to state health department.

265
00:29:52,830 --> 00:30:01,950
Some folks are at CDC. So being able to just email one of them and ask if I have questions about any types of programs or funding or anything.

266
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:10,380
So it's been really great for networking. After the fellowship was up, moved back to West Michigan,

267
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:20,550
took a job at the Kent County Health Department doing the community health needs assessment, and that I stayed in that role for about two years.

268
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,740
But then during that time, the Board of Commissioners was kind of alerted to, oh,

269
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,140
the opioid epidemic is a thing in Kent County, even though we all know it had been happening for a long time.

270
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:43,410
So it was 2018 that the Board of Commissioners dedicated funding to creating an opioid epidemiologist position at the Kent County Health Department,

271
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:51,260
which. Is honestly a way that a lot of work in public health,

272
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,689
government and public health gets done is you have to get the ear of your commissioners

273
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,570
or whoever is kind of tugging at the purse strings of ways to get things done.

274
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:12,440
And so I learned a lot actually through that, that once they were alerted to that this was an issue in Kent County, then there was a position created.

275
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,490
So I was delighted and hopped right over into that position.

276
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,269
And it's been really great because the folks that I was working with at Red Project when I was in undergrad,

277
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:32,659
I work with every day now in my job and I feel like I have a lot more to offer having an MPH degree

278
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:40,130
and some more experiences and skills to be able to kind of further their work in the county.

279
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:46,490
So I'm also the co-chair of the Kent County Opioid Task Force.

280
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:55,310
So we work on prevention intervention, which is more harm reduction, focus and treatment and recovery.

281
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:03,760
So I always felt like. When I was in my MPH degree, I was like in the basement, like working on source code, you know?

282
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:11,530
I loved it and I thought I was going to be doing SAS code and logistic regression and all this analysis.

283
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:19,480
And honestly, I'm probably way more of a project manager now than I am a technical epidemiologist,

284
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:29,109
and I think that's probably true for a lot of people in public health practice, is that it becomes like Joe is saying, how do we get the data?

285
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,430
But then how do we use the data that we have and how do we use it?

286
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:41,710
How do we find the data equitably and how do we make sure that we're addressing what needs to be done locally?

287
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:46,470
So. Michigan's kind of unique.

288
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:57,900
In that. Well, I guess separate from Oklahoma. Oklahoma has a centralized health department, so they have two of their own.

289
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:06,690
Oklahoma City and Tulsa have their own health departments, but otherwise, every clinic site is an extension of the state health department.

290
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:14,489
In Michigan, where decentralized. So what they're doing and DHHS impacts the local health departments.

291
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,090
But we have our own decision making power. We collect our own data.

292
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,560
We obviously use their surveillance systems and they have funding available, but we are making our own decisions.

293
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:34,409
And so that's worked out well for us in terms of just being able to move

294
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:40,440
certain things forward that maybe other areas of the state aren't ready to do,

295
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,260
whether that's politically or funding wise.

296
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:52,379
So for example, like we have had a longstanding SSP in Kent County which has allowed us to move certain things forward,

297
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:02,460
like having an opioid task force or talking about like we're going to have a naloxone vending machine right at the health department.

298
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,030
So having some more of those conversations. Yeah.

299
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,850
I'm trying to think of like, oh, so how many people have heard of Public Health 3.0.

300
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:25,080
So on your off time, when you're super bored, maybe you'll Google Public Health 3.0.

301
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:33,599
So it's something that we're really focused on within the Kent County Health Department right now in terms of ways that we want to make decisions,

302
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,930
ways that we want to move forward with our programs and initiatives.

303
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:47,190
So Public Health 1.0 was like end of the 19th century into the 20th century, kind of creating a governmental public health system in general,

304
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:55,320
making sure that we have sanitation, safe water, seafood, immunizations, things like that.

305
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:08,550
Then around I think it was 1988, there was a document that was written around the HIV AIDS epidemic, and that's Public Health 2.0,

306
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:16,410
where they were talking about how do we make sure that health departments have all of these certain competencies

307
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,059
that they are fulfilling versus just being like a regulatory agency focused on sanitation and things?

308
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,470
How do we make sure that we're moving into creating a standardization of public health?

309
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,030
And then recently, I think it was in the last five years has been a wave of public health 3.0,

310
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:42,029
and that's been focused on more equitable practices within public health,

311
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,360
making sure that we're looking at the social determinants of health,

312
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,200
looking at public health agencies as like a chief strategist of health within their communities.

313
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,000
So we are basically trying to.

314
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,409
Be at the Kent County Health Department, the chief strategist for the community,

315
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,670
in terms of how are we bringing together all of our local partnerships?

316
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:20,879
But not that we are making the decisions, that we're recognizing the power and experience of the community organizations within our own county and

317
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,160
lifting up their work and just using the networks that we have to make sure that that work gets done.

318
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,559
So basically like spreading the wealth of public health because organizations within

319
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,000
the county and we're talking hyperlocal now because Joe is talking about how,

320
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:41,400
you know, they have the data at the city, but it's up to the local entities to make the decisions.

321
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,319
And so this is what that kind of means, making our local decision.

322
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:55,260
So if a grant comes through, we could be like, oh, the health department isn't necessarily the best fiduciary for this grant,

323
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:03,300
but we know that we have this partnership with this organization that could do it and we can just provide technical expertise.

324
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:10,860
So there was a grant that recently came through Michigan State Police that reached out to the Kent

325
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:18,900
County Health Department about the opioid epidemic in some drug checking like spectrometry software.

326
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,530
Like, oh, would you be interested in doing this? Well, we don't have the capacity to do that.

327
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:29,399
We should work with our local SSP, have them be the ones to fulfill the grant needs for that,

328
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,920
because that's something that they're already interested in doing.

329
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:40,950
So that's kind of like my role within opioid epidemiology locally is definitely like a lot of the same

330
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:47,940
charts that you saw Joe show I put into a monthly surveillance report that I give to our partners,

331
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,370
convened the Opioid Task Force.

332
00:37:51,870 --> 00:38:01,170
But just making sure that we're moving all of our efforts along, making sure that the data that we get are found equitably.

333
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:11,270
So, for example, we know that with opioid overdose, black residents are like three and a half times the rate of white residents for overdose death.

334
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,040
And so what does that mean in terms of the initiatives that we're doing?

335
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:20,870
What are we doing around? Are we going into communities and doing education?

336
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:26,440
Are we giving money to those organizations that are working with those residents and.

337
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:38,280
So it's like maybe 30% data and 70% like talking with our local community, which I honestly love.

338
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,670
I thought I was going to hate not doing data all the time,

339
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:51,600
but it's kind of just like the application of data and making sure that if we are getting data that we're being good stewards of the data,

340
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:59,010
that we're understanding where the data are coming from and making sure that we're doing something with it.

341
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:06,549
So a cool thing that I got to do that was talking to Joe about was we just got a good settlement.

342
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:13,020
You've probably seen some of this in the news. Kent County got $9.3 million over eight years.

343
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:23,089
And so I got an email from our local like corporate council that was like, could you put together an allocation plan for the $9.3 million?

344
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,850
And it's like, that's not my degree, but I'm going to take a stab at it.

345
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:34,750
So, like, hopped on a phone call with somebody from Johns Hopkins that is helping communities allocate their funding.

346
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:40,450
So that's something that I never thought that I would be a part of, like that allocation of funding.

347
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,190
And so being part of the Kent County Opioid Task Force and doing the surveillance,

348
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:52,509
I feel like Joe was saying, like being a subject matter expert, it's kind of scary to own that title.

349
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:59,320
But when you're working in governmental public health, it's something that you have to own and respect.

350
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:07,969
And like being a spokesperson on the news is something that I've had to do and hate it every time.

351
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:13,230
But it happens actually for my graduation from the MPH program.

352
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:20,420
I think it was Dr. Besser from ABC News and he said that public health is really bad at telling its own story.

353
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,660
And I don't know what it was, but it like.

354
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:31,090
I guess it was just the critique that stuck with me and it's like, okay, I need to be better at telling our story.

355
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:40,250
So that's something that any student of an MPH program that I talk to, I tell them like, public health is really bad at telling our own story.

356
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,810
So just make sure. I guess like when you get into other whatever public health degree you have that like

357
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:54,140
you are speaking to the work that you're doing and telling your public health story.

358
00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:00,600
So. I guess you. I don't get time for questions.

359
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:19,930
The. Hello.

360
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,569
Thank you. That was great hearing from both of you. This is sort of a two part question.

361
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:33,610
I guess I'm wondering what sort of opportunities there are for like horizontal moves into different subject areas.

362
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,209
And then in terms of like vertical moves,

363
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:45,220
how much opportunity is there like moving into a manager position versus like a more specialized or senior AP?

364
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,130
Yeah. So, I mean, those are good questions. Horizontal moves, probably more frequently than vertical looks, I'd say.

365
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:04,360
Um. So I. My area has almost doubled in the last couple of years because of COVID.

366
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:12,610
And we're getting to the point where we can see the the the end of the funding.

367
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:22,450
It's Friday. And so we've had we have had a number of staff moved from one area to another to something that's more stable funding or moved into.

368
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,630
From infectious disease to environmental health or something like that.

369
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,729
And I yeah, I mean, I think I would I really encourage horizontal lines or vertical moves.

370
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:40,150
I don't expect any of our staff to stay in their position for their entire career if we have people that do that.

371
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:46,990
And I think that's also awesome. But I like to see staff that grow and develop and want to do doing different things.

372
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:51,100
And sometimes that's a managerial position. It's not for everybody.

373
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:57,520
I've had some staff that there have been vacancies and an opportunity to sort of move into that next seat.

374
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,040
They don't want to do that, even though I think they'd be good at it. They just don't see themselves in that role.

375
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,610
And they really want to be that that scientist expert and not be worried about

376
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,710
managing contracts and doing performance reviews and those sorts of things.

377
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,639
But you just gotta respect that.

378
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:22,800
And yeah, everyone wants to be utilized in a very particular way and I think as managers we just try to do that and mentors.

379
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:28,870
Just as possible. Keep people happy. Yeah, I've been thinking about that a lot.

380
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,410
At the local level, it's a little bit different. There's not a lot more.

381
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,050
Not a lot of movement as much as at the state level, I think.

382
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:45,060
So for my particular role, I'm kind of on an island and in the work that I do.

383
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,520
There's not like a distinct next step.

384
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:57,870
So I actually this year did CSG had another fellowship program called LEAD, which is leading epidemiologists, advancing data.

385
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:05,790
And it was another cohort of like 30 people across the country that are mid-level level epidemiologists that are looking to think about,

386
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:11,960
you know, 5 to 10 years from now. Like, what are you trying to gain in your career?

387
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:20,190
What are you looking for? And so that was actually really helpful. And I think that that's something that I would emphasize, too,

388
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:27,900
is that continuing professional development, once you are in the role, has been super important for me.

389
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,569
I feel like I want to stay within public health practice,

390
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,640
which probably at the local level means moving away from epidemiology and more into administration.

391
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:47,050
That's really the only other role I can see to continue moving up because it's not like I want to.

392
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:55,640
I love my role now and it's perfect for where I am, but I don't want to stay in it forever until I'll probably end up moving up into administration.

393
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:03,250
That issue too is like, for example, the woman next to me is she's been at the Health Department for 36 years.

394
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:09,430
So people just stay in those roles for a very long time. In Kent County at least.

395
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:14,950
So it's like kind of playing the long game. But yeah.

396
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:20,570
Not really sure in terms of movement.

397
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,800
Yeah. Any more question.

398
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:34,840
There you go. All right. Thank you. Hi.

399
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,530
Thank you both. It was really amazing, I guess.

400
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,239
Did you guys ever consider pursuing Ph.Ds?

401
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:53,200
And I guess do you feel like, you know, what are your thoughts around that and like opportunities like being furthered or,

402
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,250
you know, maybe not too much like having it versus not.

403
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:06,080
I'm thinking about it right now. Also, I don't know, like I think one of the things that drew me to public health.

404
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:17,280
And maybe more away from the medical field was just like the duration of time you need to be in school and just all of the,

405
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:21,660
you know, all of the learning that needs to occur in that. And I wanted to get to work and.

406
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,770
And I'm still enjoying it.

407
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:33,150
I think I am interested in potentially pursuing more of a doctorate in public health versus a Ph.D. that might be more suited to.

408
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:38,980
They don't even let me run code and write code anymore, like I'm just too far removed from it.

409
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:47,740
But yeah, I've had a number of staff that are pursuing my doctorate degrees in public health, which I think is interesting.

410
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,739
And we've hired a few PhDs at the department recently, actually,

411
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:00,040
some folks that used to work in academia here at U of M and it's really rewarding

412
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,210
to is like bringing people from the academic world into public health versus,

413
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:10,470
you know, a different direction. And they bring a unique set of I don't know,

414
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:15,639
they just see things through a different lens and I think will give us an ability

415
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,600
to sort of strengthen the public health academic partnerships that we have,

416
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:24,820
because there's great work that goes on in academia that's sometimes siloed from what public health is doing.

417
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:31,750
So yeah, I mean, I think in they've been incredible partners for us during COVID.

418
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:39,040
I mean, you have in particular a lot of the professors here have helped us analyze data in ways in which

419
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:44,020
we really didn't have the time or the bandwidth for or the expertise for in some instances.

420
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:54,250
And so they're really unlocking. Interesting analysis that our driving our public health initiatives and priorities.

421
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,090
Yeah. I'm thinking about a DARPA as well. None of.

422
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:09,550
Not knowing a lot of the uppies that I know have an MPH and that is sufficient.

423
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:18,280
So the dry pitch, I feel, would be more for my own development and more.

424
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:26,710
I just really love school too. So I'm trying to balance like my extracurricular curriculars with.

425
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:36,370
Long term career goals but just seen Abby's around have an MPH and not necessarily having a

426
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:42,040
further degree kind of makes me feel like it's not necessarily the route that I need to take,

427
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:49,620
but every year around the time that people start applying for programs and like I also look at the program,

428
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,080
so I don't know, it's something that could happen in the future.

429
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,500
Mm. Well, thanks again. You both are coming.

430
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:04,049
I do have a few updates for you guys. I just want you guys to be sure to check the comments.

431
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,209
We are submitting assignments.

432
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:12,300
Sometimes we write comments or have questions about the assignments that you submitted and we kind of want you to respond to those.

433
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,880
So just make sure that you're checking those aspects, especially your APEX product proposals.

434
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:24,960
We kind of ask some questions and we're waiting for responses on those our next class.

435
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:30,899
Next week we're going to be talking about the competency mapping. So it's kind of like one of those workshop classes again.

436
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:41,340
So if you have your proposals or some potential products, you could bring those and we can kind of help you match your competencies to those.

437
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,160
Um, yeah. That's all I.

438
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,650
Thanks again for coming and getting back.
