1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:13,440
She understands what it's like because she's trying to get this guy who's asked to be in this sexual assault in her career.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,040
Again, it's all these. But I just think that you need to grow in front of them.

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:33,960
You had three guys? Yes. What is different about football than human nature?

4
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,420
So he was at Ole Miss. He hired escorts to pose as students for football.

5
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,890
Some of. Cheated on his wife at some point.

6
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,540
I know. Oh, yeah. I'm sure it's not that discrete.

7
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:03,829
It's funny, cause, like, for an interview, it's like.

8
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,920
It's like you can't even get it right.

9
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:18,940
And knowing what I was trying to work on, Sarkissian showed up to be disturbed.

10
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,440
And I think it's such a perfect example, to be honest.

11
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,920
That doesn't matter either. Or something just to make sure she didn't.

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,150
Yeah, that's where I was, actually.

13
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,700
I had hired this guy. He was like, Oh, I wonder.

14
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,880
I forget what he is, what he did, but he actually was fired.

15
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,280
So it wasn't that it was always there, really.

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,750
Not that it wasn't very easy to let him go much.

17
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:14,300
But urban culture here, where they do, you have no control.

18
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,300
It's so bad you actually get suspended. What is that? Okay. It's the one.

19
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,690
We went to Jacksonville. It was about two semester and there was a videocassette.

20
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,990
I don't even know what happened with 18 year old girl.

21
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:34,309
And he says married guy too, which is far from here he is.

22
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,740
And these people keep getting hired and it's like, I know.

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:58,700
It's just it's definitely not supported by like a morse code or what have you actually needs to be changed.

24
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:10,670
And you said about like, you know, she's at the same time like really scared because it's like you realize that just saying.

25
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,030
Thank you. I just like to tell you.

26
00:03:38,310 --> 00:04:33,280
I like hear scream. It's quiet this morning.

27
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:48,650
So I will on that between. Holiday travel and some work stuff.

28
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:53,980
My attempt to get the grading on this last assignment done before today has failed.

29
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm working on hoping I will have them in the next couple of days.

30
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,140
So it's coming and I don't have any particular insights into them.

31
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:16,120
I will again push back the question around talking about the last assignment in detail until we get into the readings about warnings.

32
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,360
That's really probably the day's work. That's the day where the skyline mostly with that.

33
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,520
Today. I want to talk about culture. You guys are reading about the cultural cognition hypothesis.

34
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:40,220
But I want to start by saying, can you give a little bit of framework?

35
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:51,380
I think that this line of work first, and this is mostly associated with this town hall, has some really important insights.

36
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,570
But I also have some concerns.

37
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,310
I think they are overly narrow in the way they think about world view.

38
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:10,340
I think I would like to talk broadly about sort of what the patterns that we see in terms of the way different health risks are discussed.

39
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:21,320
Certainly, there has been some evolution in sort of a media environment between when these articles were conceptualized then and now.

40
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,140
But I also and several of you have sort of come out of the, you know,

41
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,950
how much we think that this you know, some of the strategies that they are suggesting that still applies.

42
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,200
Um, we'll talk about that. I'm not sure they don't I'm not sure they do.

43
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,500
But let's let's be critical consumers of this kind of work.

44
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,210
But the main thing I want to start with is to think.

45
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:58,290
Part of my sort of training for today's discussion is I want us to not slip too deeply into the language of politics of the United States,

46
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:04,410
the red, blue economy, you know, other correlations to worldviews.

47
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,540
Yes, there are. And I don't want to minimize that. But I also think that there's nuance here that's important,

48
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:18,830
that part of what these articles are trying to get us to do is to think less in terms of necessarily political parties and more in terms of values.

49
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:30,010
What do you care about? And how does that interact with the way you look at a given risk and people are more nuanced than who they vote for,

50
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,560
and that's important for us to remember them as part of, however.

51
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,530
So I'm going to start by actually not going down something that's necessarily obviously about a particular worldview,

52
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:48,229
but is about credibility and who we listen to and who we don't.

53
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:55,890
And then we'll try and get there. A couple of go out.

54
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:06,420
Of people, you know, and how they either did or did not come to be comfortable with the idea of COVID vaccinations.

55
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,869
So let's start for you.

56
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,340
Will one of them are we talking about, I guess, a nurse friend?

57
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:31,360
I was talking about a friend who, despite a background in health and speech, all thought she would have gotten vaccinated.

58
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,940
Kind of work to convince yourself that it was unnecessary, which is.

59
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,830
Since she'd already gotten COVID, that was no personal benefit to getting vaccinated.

60
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:50,130
And she also has a big thing about it's inappropriate for the government to tell you you have to do something.

61
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,069
So she specifically found a job that didn't require you to be vaccinated, you know,

62
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:04,140
that required her to switch where she was working for and like change all of her plans, including where she was going to school.

63
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:13,110
So she was comfortable making a ton of changes for her own interests,

64
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:20,370
what she believed to be only her own interests versus making the action of being vaccinated,

65
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,540
which she thought was for others interests and was not for her personally.

66
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,350
So I held at least two things out of this story. One, notice the mental models issue here.

67
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,580
You're framing vaccination as something that has purely grounded in personal interest.

68
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,110
That. That's a mental models perspective.

69
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:52,070
But the more important one is she's perceiving herself to be at low risk because she has previously had COVID.

70
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:04,380
Whatever we may think about, the scientific truth of prior infection has confirmed future immunity.

71
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:14,160
That's a mental model's question. And as we get into things like, well, okay, we have new variants, we have evolving threats, etc., that we've.

72
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,580
Maybe be inaccurate in ways that we might try to correct.

73
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,250
Then the second piece, which I think the more important one here, you mentioned it in passing,

74
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:32,630
but it's sort of the anchor from a cultural worldview perspective. The this is a person who does not like it when the government tells you what to do.

75
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:40,790
So this is an individualist that it's interesting the way you framed this.

76
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:50,450
I remember reading your musing about how that is one of the sort of prototypes of this is somebody who is not resisting based upon really

77
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:56,120
based upon their beliefs about the benefits or risks of the thing they're resisting because they don't want to be told to do the thing.

78
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:09,610
Which means that the same information coming from a different source framed as not a government request but as an individual choice,

79
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,600
might be looked at very differently because from their worldview perspective.

80
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:27,480
The. Fact that the government is requesting it, is amplifying it, is arguing for it is itself a marker of risk.

81
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:43,169
And you had a similar conversation in your music environment about how the fact that it was the

82
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:50,090
government who was providing messages about Colvin changes the risk perceptions of these people,

83
00:11:50,100 --> 00:12:06,120
which is to say, well, wait a second, if the government is saying this that I don't trust or it is not in the serious perspective,

84
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:25,700
there was a heavy pushback and they are saying, well, why is this so much in and make it mandated in some areas like it?

85
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:33,990
And it's so interesting from being a test case for the testimony and for some.

86
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:43,950
For years. I was the first and only thought of how they could play it safe.

87
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:55,760
Like, okay, well, can you say nothing? Like they are saying, Oh yeah, that was my perception.

88
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:15,720
And you had a very similar story up through the opposite, though, in that when I was talking with my dad about getting the COVID vaccination,

89
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,200
he was like very skeptical and wasn't really planning on getting back to the fact that the vaccines were first coming out.

90
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:29,490
He's like a social worker, so you can have access to earlier but wasn't really feeling it.

91
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,010
And like I had some conversations then about it.

92
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:40,860
I wasn't able to really convince and try to like stay really neutral and avoid bringing up any political figures or anyone else's arguments.

93
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:49,440
What were you hearing back when you approached him? Just that it wasn't like I guess like there's a lot of parallels between like.

94
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,950
The flu shots and vaccinations and never got the flu shot.

95
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,440
And I'll be fine mostly.

96
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:11,629
So several months later, this is kind of going on. And I guess like my uncle got wind that like my dad's looking, I'm getting vaccinated,

97
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,130
ended up like messaging him about like saying really the same things I had said.

98
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:20,870
But then he changed his mind because the friends, I guess seeing the my uncle had a very similar like worldview.

99
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:29,930
Yeah. So you say amusing, like your uncle and your father share a lot of political views, a lot of world similar kind of perspectives.

100
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:38,540
So was it like did your father explicitly say, well, if he says it, then I guess it should be okay?

101
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:45,110
That kind of thing parallel to whatever was, I didn't explicitly say it just like, but just suddenly got vaccinated.

102
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,049
So this is a conversation.

103
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,580
I mean, I suspect many of us have our own variants of these stories where that sort of personal connection, that trusted person.

104
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,050
Now the question here becomes who is trusted? Why are they trusted?

105
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:11,900
Is it because they are seen as one of a particular family on a particular community?

106
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,680
And that is the anchor point of that trust. So I see myself like you.

107
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,670
And therefore, I trust the information I'm getting from you. Is that framed in terms of more sort of political orientation?

108
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,790
So Sidney's story here, like your family, the uncle is family.

109
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,190
Why did they their father listen to your uncle more influence there than they were by you?

110
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,620
So the family anchor point doesn't seem to be the thing,

111
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,600
but there was clearly some I'm going to listen to you and not to this other person from the dynamic.

112
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,040
And that's the question I think we really all need to wrestle with in these situations.

113
00:15:53,130 --> 00:16:04,140
It's not unusual. If somebody is not willing to listen to any point, the question is who are they willing what?

114
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:19,490
And you know this many good examples of this, but I'll throw one more in just because I think it's a nice parallel.

115
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,030
All right. You have a story about your brother?

116
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:30,600
Yeah. Which isn't a health risk, but it's such a nice parallel to what we're talking about here.

117
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,450
I wanted to bring up, too. Right. So it was literally I was I was doing these readings on Sunday.

118
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,970
My brother was he had a train to catch back to school.

119
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,780
And he is notoriously just terrible with time.

120
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,540
He was running late as always, and I heard my parents kind of grumbling, saying, oh, he's going to be late and kind of saying things to him.

121
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:59,129
And he was just blowing them off as he kind of always does. So that I knew kind of if I had asked him something in a kind of more subtle way,

122
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,900
that he would probably listen to me better than my parents, because, you know, he's 22 and that's kind of.

123
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,970
What he does. So then I just went up to him and said, Oh, what time is your train leaving?

124
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,360
And he said, A little after five. And I said, Oh yeah, you don't you still have laundry done in the basement, fold up and put in your bag.

125
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,990
You said, Oh yeah, it's 430. I probably gonna do that.

126
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,850
So that's kind of what prompted him to go get going and realizing he was about to miss his train,

127
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:30,080
which he did make by about one minute, apparently, partially because I had, you know, prompted him.

128
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,290
And then he started frantically packing his stuff and was able to make it out.

129
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:41,390
But he missed the train if it was just my parents, because he just kind of ignores everything in terms of time.

130
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,590
So there's multiple layers and I want to make sure to try him on.

131
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,049
Some of this is I'm not willing to listen to anything you say.

132
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,510
Kind of. It's like a source becomes a barrier. Oh.

133
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:08,520
Well rated, but different to that is I will listen to it, but I ascribe different motivations, different meaning behind the information.

134
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,760
And it's coming from one source versus another substance.

135
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,850
That might be one way to characterize what Amber was talking about. It's not that the message from the government isn't being heard.

136
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:25,620
It's that it's being looked at through a lens of history and perceptions and beliefs that can change how one feels about it.

137
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,220
And then there is the more to larger picture thing.

138
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,270
I want to take us back to the beginning of the classroom. Remember the factories?

139
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,630
Remember the idea that our perceptions of benefits and our perceptions of risks are intimately linked with each other.

140
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:59,920
So that when. Someone, let's say Mark's brother is engaging in the question of of, you know, is this a risk that is worth paying attention to?

141
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,040
There is a well, what is the.

142
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,089
Perception of my benefit of the current moment versus my perception of the risk of failing to engage in this task.

143
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:18,479
And if I'm not trying to overly analyze the situation,

144
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,010
but part of the benefit of that moment is I'm not going to listen to mom because there is benefit to me.

145
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:33,450
I'm not listening to mom. That minimizes the chance in their mind the consequences of the potential risk.

146
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,100
So as we engage in these questions of. Should I get vaccinated?

147
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,110
It's not just a question of perception of the risk of the disease.

148
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,760
It's also a question of what is the benefit I am giving up?

149
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,469
What are the what are the other things that are implied by this in terms of who I will be able to relate to,

150
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,100
whether they will see me as like them or not like them, etc.

151
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:04,850
Yeah. Sorry I didn't share this in amusing, but it just makes me think of my younger brothers who haven't gotten vaccinated.

152
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,809
And it's because of my parents, even though they have me in their lives.

153
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:17,209
Even though my brother is over the age of 18, the pressure my parents have on them, even though it's not like my parents, they're just narcissistic.

154
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:23,690
It's not that they totally don't believe in science. It's just that holistic medicine spiral that people fall into.

155
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:31,339
So that just I feel like it's another example of how maybe pressure can be invisible to outside forces,

156
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,919
you know, like, like I'm his sister, so I know that.

157
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,950
But, like, I don't think the University of Michigan would be approaching, you know, if you were to apply here to go to school.

158
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,340
And he has to explain why I'm not vaccinated for COVID. Right.

159
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,650
So this is a nice transition because one of the things I want to highlight here is.

160
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,550
When we think about. The social dynamics of risk.

161
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,620
There was the really explicit stuff of, you know, if you.

162
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:13,800
Engage in this behavior or don't engage in this behavior, then you will be seen as one of us or not.

163
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,790
And probably the cleanest example of this, the probably to my mind right now is.

164
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,319
The way is. It's not clean.

165
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,920
But I think about attitudes about mask wearing.

166
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,030
Mask wearing not as a.

167
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:43,540
A measure of protection against COVID, but as a projection of an attitude or a you know, I am a mask where I am not mask wearing.

168
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:51,340
And the ways in which I think universally to some degree,

169
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:59,140
there is assumptions made about the person based upon if you look at them and they are wearing a mask or not wearing a mask in a given situation,

170
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:11,500
and that that has become in much of the conversations around is a marker of a belief.

171
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:20,190
And it's not so much about risk, but about projecting something out.

172
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,600
So I'm going to shift topics a lot, just simply to get us out of it.

173
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:33,380
But there's another example of a. On a health risk that is seen very differently by different people.

174
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,780
I want to talk through the lens of this sort of cultural worldview perspective.

175
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:54,990
Think about the question of purpose. So in this country, most firsts occur at a hospital site.

176
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,829
And so there is a lot of. Both descriptive Norman injunctive.

177
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,900
No, I'm supporting. If you are pregnant and you are about your birth, you go to the hospital.

178
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,430
That's where a birth occur. There is a.

179
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,970
Non-trivial segment of the population that advocates for home birth.

180
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:30,120
There are clearly risks and many of the people who advocate for it will acknowledge there are risks that exist of having if you have birth at home.

181
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:38,370
So. Look at it through the cultural cognition lens.

182
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:48,930
What would you expect about who chooses to just be randomly sprinkled in the population?

183
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,559
Know. Many different things.

184
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,350
Change your experience in a hospital?

185
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:12,630
And that can, you know, make the decision for you in this circumstance, especially because also a lot of mortality associated with certain groups.

186
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,530
Okay. So you're thinking you're starting from the back of what some people have an aversion to.

187
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,040
The hospital said they come from they come from many different sources.

188
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,670
But you're looking at it through the lens, not of it in the birthing context, but in the just sort of like this is not a place I want to be.

189
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:35,480
Yes. And so homebirth here is an avoidance of the hospital rather than a preference for the home birth experience.

190
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,610
Not saying this is right or wrong, just say that's the framing you're bringing to this tradeoff or other.

191
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,670
Yes. On a personal level of education.

192
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:54,950
So I may not know the history behind working practices and the fact that it's only been in recent years that we have shifted away from for sure.

193
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:01,520
Some people might think that all having a baby at a hospital is really the only and absolutely safest option,

194
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,080
and it is by far the safer option if you have something happen.

195
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:14,000
However, if you set up the home correctly where you have a right to see your spouse, it's a big thing for most people.

196
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,510
So I'll just go to slide the watch the completely safe and it can be a very safe approach.

197
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,860
Notice the key piece here is that there are people whose medical condition is such that home

198
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,710
birth is safer and people for whom because of their medical condition of birth is less safe.

199
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:42,890
That's a mental model issue. Right. We may want to sort people to ensure that people know how they fall on that spectrum before they make that choice.

200
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,850
Another piece here is the. Potential misunderstandings.

201
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:58,320
I'm going to put both pieces here. One is the level of safety that can exist is homebirth for people for whom the other risks are not likely to occur.

202
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,380
The other is the. Perception.

203
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:09,000
Again, I'm not taking value judgments here. I'm just describing the beliefs, the perceptions of whether or not.

204
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,240
There are significant risk differences for different types of patients when they

205
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,550
give birth in a home versus in a birthing center versus in a hospital setting.

206
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,730
And we can look at this from an epidemiological perspective and say, okay, so what are the rates of outcomes?

207
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,020
But I looking at it from a belief standpoint, do you believe that these are equivalent locations?

208
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,620
Do you believe that one location is safer or not safer?

209
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:44,890
How does that indicate? But there's at least one other major factor that comes up into this this space.

210
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,270
I have a research colleague who studied this space. So this is where I'm getting a lot of my knowledge of.

211
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,830
Which is less about is the hospital that more about is the home birth good?

212
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:06,640
The framing of that Earth experience as having an experiential benefit of being.

213
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:15,350
And I don't want to put words in people's mouths of the world to have all, say, for better or for the other, better for the baby, etc.

214
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,370
Yeah, because look,

215
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:23,950
a major difference between home birth and hospital birth is the amount of control that the mother has over the US and my perspective.

216
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,630
But like you, I feel like when you're a patient in a hospital, that's just what you are.

217
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:35,270
If you're in a home birth with a Dula, then like you guys are kind of working together.

218
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,890
So yeah, I'm, I'm really trying to be hyper critical and breaking down all the pieces here just so we can lay them all out.

219
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,060
Control is a key dimension.

220
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:55,510
If you focus on the idea of control, if your worldview oriented towards do you want to have individual control or not as a critical dimension,

221
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:00,040
then absolutely the very whole birthing experience is going to be much more under your

222
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,300
control and that will be aligned with the way in which you look at what is important.

223
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,100
Of. Eight.

224
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:17,100
I'll be argumentative just for a moment. A reverse framing of the same thing is greater risk that the.

225
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:27,899
Issues, biological issues might be missed because of the mother's influence on the process or the treatment would be initiated too slowly,

226
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:35,670
or that they wouldn't go to get help quickly enough, etc. as getting a slip of the same point, the actual same thing.

227
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:44,980
The idea that the mother would have greater. Autonomy and control over the party process as a risk factor for negative outcomes.

228
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:54,010
And if you look at priorities and say what we care about most is minimizing those

229
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:59,440
kinds of negative actions and that very autonomy becomes a risk rather than a benefit.

230
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,720
Yeah. Sorry. This is going to be my last comment for the class.

231
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,930
I know. I've talked a lot. I was interesting topic.

232
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,770
Thank you. When I was in Malawi, I worked on perinatal mortality.

233
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,520
And there you can't give birth at home. It is illegal.

234
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:20,340
You have to go to the hospital or you will get fined and most families have to pay the fines.

235
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,760
So this is like a real conversation.

236
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,770
I mean, it's not just something I think like here in the United States, we have this element of choice.

237
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:37,200
But I think this is also a conversation that's influencing policy, and it influences policy in different parts of the world in different ways.

238
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,890
There are parts of the world in which the push is, let's get people out of the hospital.

239
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:46,620
You know, parts of the world in which the push is let's get people into the hospitals and grounded in that.

240
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,030
It's this is why I want to have a larger discussion about it.

241
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,870
And that is not just a question of what the objective.

242
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,100
Health outcomes are in each context. It's grounded in worldviews.

243
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,350
It's grounded in values guiding.

244
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,649
Which risks do we say, this is the thing that I'm going to focus on and which risks or benefits of the things that we saying?

245
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:24,350
Yeah, that's actually important to me. To find out where I want to move with this is if you look at home birth in the U.S. context, it's not random.

246
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,490
It's very much focused on communities, communities, visually.

247
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,970
It's like groups of people. I don't mean like Ann Arbor.

248
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,720
I mean like. These this friend group.

249
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:49,630
And within that social network space. There tends to be real homogeneity around these kinds of worldviews.

250
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,310
So. Want to talk about it. I am not.

251
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:59,780
I am not evaluating one or the other choice as being right in any way here.

252
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:08,510
But certainly the experience does exist in which you have groups of mothers to be who are discussing their birthing choices.

253
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,219
And when most of them are going to go to the hospital and one person says, not going to a home birth,

254
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:25,820
there is a social ostracism, ostracism, ostracization that can occur in that country and vice versa.

255
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:32,450
Like in the communities in which there are lots of people who are doing homebirth or delivery, is located for a sort of birthing center.

256
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,640
And this other person, in no way I go to the hospital. The same social dynamic can exist.

257
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:48,820
Why does that happen? Part of it is the cultural, cultural cognition hypothesis we're talking about here, because when doing that different thing,

258
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:57,220
when saying this risk is something I need to act on, and that will put you push you away from the social network that matters to you.

259
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,100
Your tribe, your community, you must reject.

260
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:09,170
There's a potential for that community rejecting because you are taking this risk seriously or not taking this risk serious.

261
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,490
Then what happens if you change your beliefs about those risks?

262
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,680
Yeah, that's not that big of a deal.

263
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,410
Think it's not that important for you to say, wow, this is really important because everybody else around me is saying this is really important.

264
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,900
And so we see these packets. From birth.

265
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,870
We see the same pockets when we look at vaccination hesitancy.

266
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,710
We see the same pockets when we look at total vaccination.

267
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,470
We think that social network dynamic exists across many different risks.

268
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,780
Now. Is this what God would say? No, he would say, no, no, no.

269
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:58,860
You're oversimplifying this. We got to get to these big worldviews like hierarchical or individualistic, communitarian, etc.

270
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:07,140
I think I personally think that we also have to look at these sort of just basic social networks.

271
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,680
The community can be such a powerful influence on our risks.

272
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,890
And to take a simple example of that, actually, Tony.

273
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,940
You're talking and you're musing about at some point about like I can't remember the specific example about.

274
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:31,790
How people perceive risks of industry. Like if you've been working in an industry, that's a good example of this kind of discussion.

275
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:35,510
I wanted to make sure to touch upon it today. Yeah, I think so.

276
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:43,040
I think it's just like different values. I mean, because I wrote about like how I think China views.

277
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,280
Very industry is like very powerful. So they see it as like something that they're proud of instead of.

278
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:57,809
Yeah. And you know, because of that, they almost ignore all the negative health and health effects and health outcomes.

279
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,290
But, you know, it's still in the background. Yeah.

280
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,110
Yeah. So to take a US example of what you're describing, think coal mining.

281
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:16,290
I guess, huge health risks to coal miners in the last four decades.

282
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:25,980
But if you engage someone who is deeply invested, either because of their actual work or because they live in a community that is driven by coal,

283
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,420
you see much of the same kind of thing that you're talking about,

284
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:38,550
sort of like, Well, I can't bring myself to see this as risky because I derive so much benefit directly or indirectly or through my community, etc.

285
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,710
We can look at this in the context of chemical risks.

286
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:52,770
You know, when I was doing that work on dioxins up in Midland where I was based, we had similar conversations about, you know,

287
00:34:52,810 --> 00:35:00,790
how much how well somebody sees the potential risk when their livelihood in their community is so wrapped up in this particular issue.

288
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:12,720
So that's another dimension here. Like when dude does paying attention to a risk seem to have a threat to our economy, to our business as another one?

289
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:20,190
There are absolutely parallels to what we're talking to that idea in the way people responded to lockdowns at the beginning, of course.

290
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,350
Like if you are a business owner. Well I mean I'll try your the idea here but like.

291
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:39,380
They try to making me close my bookstore. Let's just say because the lockdown destroys my family's economy.

292
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:47,280
And even if I'm hearing and even if I have all the scientific knowledge, that's still going to make me go.

293
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:56,950
Is it really necessary? How much benefit could it be? Etc. Like I have that push back from that, from the adventurist.

294
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,480
It's like it's going to have such a big cost on me that I go, Ouch.

295
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:09,840
Maybe there isn't actually that much benefit from this procedure. So those are the kinds of things that, you know, is that worldview?

296
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,409
Well, it's not worldview in the individualistic sense, but it's worldview with the daily life sentence.

297
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:28,370
Like, my life has been more or less disrupted by this action, by community, by social networks, etc., whereas they want to go, Oh yeah.

298
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:36,750
Let me to talk about that first of. I didn't have you read another article that I used to assign this task for this day.

299
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,240
The talks about trust. And I want to read you a quote from that article,

300
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,940
just simply because I think it's a good framing to think about this, especially when we get into policy questions.

301
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:59,850
The causes this. Risk assessment is inherently subjective.

302
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:10,780
Whoever controls the definition of risk controls the rational solution to the problem at hand.

303
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:18,490
Defining risk is thus an exercise in power.

304
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,300
This is from Paul Slovic. And here I think is really important.

305
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:43,030
When we talk about. Risks almost always come in packages or trade offs that reduce one thing you increase of cost in a different way.

306
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:48,280
That might be a financial cost, it might be a social cost, might be an economic cost, it might be a behavioral cost.

307
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:57,610
But there are essentially few things in which you're like, Well, this will make it more likely that I will be alive that have no other cost.

308
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,990
Even if that cost is I don't want to be stuck with a needle. It's still a cost.

309
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,110
But what Slovic is basically saying here is.

310
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:19,220
That definition of what it is that we focus on is power in the sense that when I when I focus only on one side,

311
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:28,189
that I can frame this as being an obvious choice. Well, of course, maternal choice is important.

312
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:33,139
And we need to make sure to support women in being able to have the birthing experience they want.

313
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:40,040
And therefore, of course, home birth is going to be the right choice because that maximizes their ability to have this value.

314
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:55,030
For. Of course. How was that from birth to having that birth in the hospital environment is going to be the rational choice because we know

315
00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:01,030
that under some circumstances there are types of complications that could only be resolved in a hospital session setting.

316
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,069
And since there's those births are preventable and the rational choice here is

317
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,120
to have birth in that hospital setting where those problems can be prevented.

318
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,950
It is an argument grounded in risk. Each is an argument about valuing a reasonable thing.

319
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:32,160
But because there is an opposition which one you orient to or which way we as communicators orient you to,

320
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,930
the trade off defines the way you're going to look at that trade off.

321
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,750
What is valuable, what is not? And.

322
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,430
A week from today, we're going to read some stuff about paternalism. Part of the message of that day is going to be.

323
00:39:53,100 --> 00:40:00,200
Let's check. Ourselves about what it is we say we are valuing and what it is that we say we are not.

324
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:09,100
When we're communicating about risk because we are exercising power in defining the way people will look at that risk.

325
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:22,270
So we better own what it is we're doing, what we do. There's one other big domain I want to make sure to touch upon today.

326
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,670
Let's start with you. Make your case. We're talking about some of the interactions that have when you ask about guns.

327
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,950
Yeah, I was talking about like in prior experiences in primary care,

328
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:45,700
when you're trying to ask your public health questions about do you have a gun in the home and so do you store it properly?

329
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,129
Sometimes you have patients who just like immediately shut down that line of questioning and there's

330
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:57,550
like this tangible shift in the room where because of you even is opening that line of questioning,

331
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:04,930
there is this presumption that you are, you know, maybe like on the liberal end of the political spectrum or so be it.

332
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,760
And then like that can lead to these like downstream consequences,

333
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:18,640
like in that visit where patients are now like not trusting you or like not wanting to have more conversations about other,

334
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,020
like preventative measures.

335
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:27,850
So I talk about like, for example, of vaccination sometimes it's like, yeah, just the kind of polarizing effect that they talked about in the article.

336
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,200
And again, these things are very interwoven with mental models.

337
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,319
Like why is that question being asked in the first place?

338
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:45,430
Because we as public health understand that the presence of a gun in a lock in a home is itself a risk factor for a variety of types of outcomes.

339
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:53,650
That framing, that mental models framing is a structural framing, it says.

340
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,549
The thing the fact that the thing is here creates a greater likelihood that a negative outcome is going to occur.

341
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,320
And so we will ask about it and we will probably the framing of.

342
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,830
London's ownership and access as an individual rights agreement,

343
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:23,320
as a protection framework is a mental models reframing of why that person wants to have a dog.

344
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,550
In the context of an individual benefit framing.

345
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,800
It may seem very strange. Why would the doctor be bringing this up?

346
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:40,520
That's an individual client. It feels like a step out of the space of what that conversation is about.

347
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,709
Even if from the public health perspective,

348
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:53,080
we might be thinking of it almost exactly like a question about do you have enough resources to pay for your

349
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:59,500
prescription medications as another structural factor that influences the health of the members of that household.

350
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,040
What you're getting is resistance to that shift.

351
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:12,140
Like you're asking him a question that doesn't fit into my worldview. One of the topics that we're.

352
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,599
The. A more silly variant of this.

353
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:25,030
But I remember actually having a personal reaction when a health care provider

354
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:32,709
asked me if I had a trampoline at my house and I was I had to make the mental say,

355
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,050
oh, right. Okay. So this is a space in which there would be risks, physical risks.

356
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,800
But there was also like I thought, how you ask people,

357
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:50,950
I think I could feel that in because it felt like a break of the dynamic of light of the conversation.

358
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,840
Certainly conversations around motorcycle helmets.

359
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:05,099
How many overlays of these same kinds of flights? Is this a public health thing?

360
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,140
Is this an individual choice thing? Is this a you're taking away the benefit of my.

361
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:16,660
Being able to enjoy something that I enjoy doing. Is this a I am.

362
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,170
Protecting your individual life. Is this on protecting society?

363
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,750
Those reframing of that choice. Shifts.

364
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,950
Get notice that none of this is about how many people are dying from this.

365
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:36,080
We're not at the probability level of quantification of the magnitude.

366
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,450
It's irrelevant from this conversation. This is about which rings risks am I going to pay attention to and which ones?

367
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:46,550
If I going to say, Well, I'm not going to think about that, I'm not going to engage with that, that's not important to me.

368
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:55,550
Yeah, it's kind of reminds me of like when I was 18 or 19, there was a new doctor in a primary care and she was Muslim.

369
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,679
I'm also Muslim for the first time.

370
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:05,780
I think I've been going there since I moved there and like when I was three or four and so a new doctor and she like actually asked me like,

371
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,859
you know, what's your religion? All that. And that's another sort of Muslim.

372
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,790
Like, I didn't get any questions about my sexual history during that appointment.

373
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,830
And I'm I'm 1918. Huh.

374
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:30,760
So that's a total tantrum. Obviously we could go down the pathway of acknowledging stereotyped stereotyping in the ways in which behaviors can be.

375
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:42,590
Both individual risk behaviors and then interactions can be biased by our perceptions and assumptions about what people will do or not.

376
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,140
We've already had, to some degree, the HPV conversation around.

377
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:54,020
You know, I'm going to assume that my child is not going to be sexually active or vice versa.

378
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:59,020
And the reframing of that conversation. But.

379
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:12,710
Which this I mean, actually, let's stay with HPV for a second because I think another piece I want to make sure I'm getting.

380
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,660
When HPV vaccination was first introduced, it was a form.

381
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:28,290
Who? Girls of what ages? Two young teens.

382
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:34,180
Right. What? Cervical cancer.

383
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,520
Okay. So that was the cancer most discussed at that point in time.

384
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,270
The idea was to vaccinate them before they started being sexually active to prevent.

385
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:55,720
And why is the vaccination here needed to be done before as opposed to during?

386
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,719
So there are certainly other vaccines that we get state influenza vaccines in which we

387
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:08,650
seem to get vaccinated in the time in which we are being exposed as a series series.

388
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,930
So there is a serious component to it, although that's that's it's not a series in the sense of years.

389
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:25,010
It's a series in the sense of a few months. But probably the mental model piece here, like how do we think about getting the vaccine right?

390
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:32,200
All right. So like a straight that so there's a mental model piece here that supports the idea being if you once you get exposed,

391
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:40,060
that vaccination doesn't give you a benefit. So you're not vaccinated before exposure in order to reap the benefits of the vaccination.

392
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:45,970
All right. What's wrong with the mental model?

393
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,700
We're just unpacking. Several things wrong, says one, because people associate getting vaccinated against them, you're gonna be exposed to it.

394
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:01,780
And people view that as when you're selling, my pre-teen daughter is going to be having sex at 11, which kind of freaked people out.

395
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:08,260
So there is that that keeps here is I'm grounding my feelings about the likelihood of exposure and now.

396
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:15,780
The argument being put forward is we know we're not there, that that's the point.

397
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,910
We can't wait until there's exposure. We've got to do it before they're exposed.

398
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,690
But our feelings about this are grounded in the now.

399
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:29,820
And it's let's say for the moment, I'm going to put aside the question of when people are going to become sexually active.

400
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,299
But let's assume for the moment. That's right. They're looking at that fact as well.

401
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,610
I don't need it because it's not current.

402
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,030
Whereas the scientific argument for vaccination at that point in time is precisely that they don't need it right now.

403
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,460
That's one mistake. What else?

404
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,980
Yeah. We should only be vaccinating girls. I'm sorry.

405
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,260
We should only be guys like that. And where is that coming from?

406
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,840
HPV is like invisible in many. Okay.

407
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,460
Yes. So keep going. I just going to say I actually got it when it first came out.

408
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:17,900
I was at that age. So I don't know that that's entirely true, that it was just targeted to girls.

409
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:22,559
Yeah. I'm not sure if that was a cultural thing or a medical advice in that case where I listening to this.

410
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:32,520
But I think it made the point that my virginity was that it was originally only approved for girls, but there was a pretty quick turnaround.

411
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:37,889
That was my understanding as well, that there was the very first marketing of it was for Girls Only,

412
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:47,690
that the shift to approving it for boys was not that, but it was a little bit of time after that, you know.

413
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,690
I mean, so cervical cancer, like HPV, is largely linked to cervical cancer.

414
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:56,430
That's like where we see the big link, but it's also linked to a lot of head and neck cancers and other cancers.

415
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,330
But those get discussed a lot less. Right.

416
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:08,910
So another key mental model piece here is if the anchor point of the benefit is that cancer that occurs in women only,

417
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:15,960
let's be specific if women people with services because we're talking about cervical cancer which.

418
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:24,120
Then you have a conceptual shift up. Those people are at risk and these people are not.

419
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,440
There's not a framing around the transmission, and it's certainly not a framing around health outcomes that we associate.

420
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,290
Across has been affecting everybody. Whereas when we get ahead of that cancer,

421
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:45,290
if that's a talking head that's been introduced from the very start as a vaccine against head of that cancer.

422
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:54,400
Would we be in the same place we are today? I don't think so. But the cultural piece.

423
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,360
One last thought here. The cultural piece is okay.

424
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:11,340
What happens when we take this seriously to our social dynamics is getting vaccinated would be seen as something that is going to make me.

425
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:24,680
Closer to somebody. Pushed away by some. And different families have navigated that moment very different ways.

426
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,580
Think it's kind of funny about that? Amusing to me.

427
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:37,669
So I've always seen it as like I had throat cancer and the kind of cervical cancer because my mom's an audiologist and she worked at the ear,

428
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:44,659
nose and throat clinic. And it's really kind of funny because I'm from Castor, Michigan, which is a pretty homogeneous white conservative background.

429
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:51,620
And I remember I was like middle school, junior high. Like, it was a very big debate in the school system and people were an outrage.

430
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:58,249
And so my family is very conservative, is my mom's an audiologist, and she works with this doctor who is a recent immigrant from Syria,

431
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:04,520
who said that I was like 50 at the time, but he'd immigrated from Syria and he's 30, so a doctor and he's also a very devout Muslim.

432
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:11,390
And so a lot of the conservative Christian population class were very, very opposed to the HPV vaccine.

433
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,959
And one day my mom just asked the doctor like, hey, I think about it.

434
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:23,000
And he was the biggest evangelist for the vaccine because she exclusively saw 20 year old patients with like breast cancer, both men and women.

435
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,350
And so that was just project. And so that was kind of how it was built to me.

436
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:34,100
And so I've always viewed it like that. And it's just really interesting how even among people with similar values were the doctor

437
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,820
who probably showed a lot of values in common with conservative Christians in my community.

438
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:43,580
He was very for the vaccine I think about is a doctor but it also had personal experience.

439
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,360
So the experience of learning how to use this is powerful here.

440
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:53,360
Like this is somebody who has personal, direct experience with a concrete representation of this risk.

441
00:52:54,140 --> 00:53:00,740
Young In this case, you have example young men and women with throat cancer need to be treated.

442
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,880
How can we prevent this so the benefit becomes grounded in that experience?

443
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,250
Absent that, that absent that sort of personal exposure to that, then.

444
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,700
A lot of that. Why are we doing this becomes much more abstract. And what are we left with?

445
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:22,160
We're left with that. Wait a second. What does this say about the beliefs that we hold about?

446
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,850
Is vaccination going to affect people behavior? Is this even necessary?

447
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:30,740
Because my child may not be in an age in which that's going to occur and.

448
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:41,360
It's important to ground this in the the idea if I look at that idea of sexual activity as an inherently abhorrent thing.

449
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:48,550
Then anything that's associated with that is going to get pushed out as well.

450
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:54,910
It can't be the benefit can't be that much because I actually I abhor going down that pathway at all in my mind.

451
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,460
And that I don't think that's conscious, but it's part of this.

452
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,469
When are we going to accept information and when are we gonna minimize that kind

453
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:10,640
of dynamic that I think we have to own as part of what it means to be human?

454
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,440
We can't actually process everything all at once and balance it.

455
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:23,670
I wrote him a musing about kind of like contrasting my mother's experience with getting recommended the HPV vaccine, which she did.

456
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,380
She was kind of caught off guard by. But then my doctor was like, Dad, just do it now.

457
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,680
She was like, okay, yeah.

458
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:37,320
Versus like a friend they recently met who is just getting her HPV series at 24 because she grew up in like an evangelical community.

459
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:46,319
And just like I originally kind of framed it in like religious or like more atheist perspective or political perspective.

460
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:53,850
But I think also like back to the networks or like communities like she exists in this small homeschooling environment.

461
00:54:53,850 --> 00:55:00,540
So probably like it would create like social isolation for the family and for the child and for the parent.

462
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:07,700
And it's I mean, that is a huge risk to actually to face that stuff.

463
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:15,710
Which reminds me of we didn't have too much of this in my recollection.

464
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:22,380
I do remember seeing some news reports right when the COVID 19 vaccines were coming out about people,

465
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:30,299
certain communities getting vaccinated outside of their community because they didn't want to be seen getting vaccinated.

466
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,550
They wanted the vaccine, but they didn't actually want to have the potential social risk of being seen to get the vaccine.

467
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:40,259
Vaccines are interesting, right? Once you're vaccinated, nobody can nobody will know.

468
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,889
Like there's no external component to it, which is what's different about, for example,

469
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:50,520
wearing masks or buckling your seatbelt or engaging in extremely observable behaviors.

470
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:59,810
And so we do see people for whom they're navigating this by.

471
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:02,629
They want to do the things they want to do to prevent the behavior,

472
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:08,990
but they want to avoid the potential social consequences of that by doing it so in a non observable way.

473
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:24,510
Must. That's supposed to it. So I guess let me pull this out.

474
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:30,060
Want to bring up something that I've been hearing in the class and it's our outlook on cognition.

475
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:40,860
Yeah. It sounds like a little bit that like, okay, these are all examples of culture when it's like not integrated into the communication plan.

476
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,139
So what does it look like for that?

477
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:50,549
Because it sounds like a lot of these are cultural as a barrier rather than what's what happens when it's not some random idea,

478
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:55,470
but survival of some cultures by specifically indigenous Americans.

479
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:03,150
So being able to handle that is like bringing traditional healing and like into space.

480
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:11,159
What does it look like when you integrate culture rather than just something? I guess that's that might be so great, actually a really good thought.

481
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,750
And it reminds me of one other connection I wanted to make, and I'm trying to remember who was who I wanted to talk about.

482
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,100
Sarah. Yeah.

483
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,300
You know, you were talking about perception of universal health care.

484
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:35,250
So there's a connection here. So like talk about what you were talking about in your music in terms of attitudes around universal health care.

485
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:43,710
So I studied abroad in Thailand and they universally.

486
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,100
Yeah. And they ran the system off the UK or something.

487
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:52,320
And then I was having a conversation with my brother here and he was like, Why can't we have universal healthcare?

488
00:57:52,860 --> 00:58:02,070
Because people don't want to pay extra tax money versus Thai people are more willing to pay extra so that everyone else can also have health care.

489
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:10,459
Yeah. So there's this sort of communal value being reflected there, not just in the context of health care,

490
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:20,060
but it manifests in the context of the way in which that choice to cost money benefit have the universal health care experience.

491
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,679
What I am not clear on, and maybe even though it may be in doubt,

492
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,650
is how much is that explicit in the messaging around the taxes or the universal health care?

493
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,970
Is it is it framed as we all value this?

494
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,110
This is a common expression of something that's important.

495
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:45,560
And hence that then amplifies the messaging to say, well, this is an issue of this value, so therefore we're going to do this.

496
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:52,690
I don't know. But messaging was out there for the Thai people.

497
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:59,770
I just knew that they had a very, very fortunate enough to have.

498
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:05,089
The UK as a model and they followed that and they were like, This is working out for us.

499
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:11,450
We're going to keep doing this versus like Myanmar is not in a political structure to have that.

500
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:20,360
All right. So I want to come back to what we're with, because there are some.

501
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:28,310
They're not easy to find, but there are some really good example situations in with risk messaging.

502
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:34,629
Explicitly brings in values held within particular communities and say, well,

503
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:41,200
if me if this is a common value that we hold, then look how this behavior is in alignment with that value.

504
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,730
I tried to think there were there were a few.

505
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:57,000
There were a few attempts to do that in the context of COVID 19 early on, and I'm struggling to come up with a good example off the top of my head.

506
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:11,629
The. The idea of sort of framing risks in a communal orientation as opposed to an

507
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:16,490
individualistic orientation is certainly one of the main dimensions here in the U.S.

508
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:22,770
A lot of the discussion around coping ended up being. Grounded and essentially expressions of individual rights.

509
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:28,880
I have the individual right to do what I want to be vaccinated or not vaccinated or to wear a mask or not, etc.

510
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:35,450
And it was arguing mostly about individual choice as distinct from.

511
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,730
What would be most beneficial for the community as a whole.

512
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:53,220
In fact, I saw a number of COVID 19 messages again in 2020 that were basically repackaging government recommendations as choices.

513
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,110
I mean, it was sort of dodgy,

514
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:07,490
but they were I could see them sort of backing off from the hierarchical do this because we tell you language to the this is an individual choice.

515
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,520
And so I'm going to choose to do this because X, Y and Z.

516
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:19,880
When we talk about. Communities that have in common identify.

517
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:26,560
The members look at themselves as sharing something common.

518
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,680
And this could be I don't want to be grounded in one particular,

519
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,899
whether we're talking about race or ethnicity or we're talking about geography or we're talking about sexual orientation, whatever it is.

520
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:42,800
But there's this sort of I see myself as a member of a particular community that holds a set of particular values.

521
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:53,750
Well, that's true. Well, this can be a very powerful thing to frame the risk through that lens.

522
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:03,270
The problem is usually either that the community we're trying to communicate to is not.

523
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,440
Doesn't have that common belief. So that that may work for some, but it won't work for others.

524
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:18,210
Or because it was probably more troubling. Those who are communicating don't really know how to make that connection.

525
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:27,560
That's where we need to have. Integration of the target audience in the design of our communications.

526
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:32,750
This is going to get somewhat off of the topic of risk communication. That's true for almost any health communication.

527
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:42,850
But it's especially true in this kind of context where if it's seen as coming from somebody who is not like me,

528
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:50,490
as Amber was talking about earlier, as we had some other examples then, it's not just that I may not agree with the message.

529
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,700
I may be resisting that message from the very start because it doesn't seem to be holding my values.

530
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:04,820
I will come back to that in the journalism day as well. So.

531
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:22,129
I want to go. Well, I do want to connect one thing back to what we were talking about last class, which I know was a long time ago.

532
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:26,310
So she's not going gonna go back a week.

533
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:29,450
Remember that whole discussion of what the heck is a just.

534
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:41,890
So now let's add culture. So what is the gist of?

535
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:50,390
HPV vaccination. And there are multiple possible answers here.

536
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,100
So let's have you sort of think about that a one sentence level. What is the gist of HPV vaccination?

537
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:02,750
By framing what I hear with you in public health.

538
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:07,310
I think about this from through that lens. HPV vaccination.

539
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:13,800
Forget cancer. That's the gist.

540
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,840
It's not that our got cancer. It's absolutely. It's cancer.

541
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:25,430
Period. And the sentence. That framing oriented around certain things and not others.

542
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:32,450
And so I have a doctor's appointment and as I'm sitting in the office,

543
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:39,920
it's funny that you mention that about looking at a disease that isn't just about this vaccine against cancer.

544
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:45,800
It's my technical model of actual will not actually extinguish the virus that causes it.

545
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,830
Yeah. And I was thinking it was so funny how they, I guess boil it down to that,

546
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:58,879
whereas it gets their to the overall point in that the technical right and this

547
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,540
goes back to what they were talking about in that article where verbatim thinking,

548
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:09,110
know detail thinking is actually pushing you away from engaging in that behavior.

549
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,949
Like if you're sitting there, I understand you make your already made your choices,

550
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:17,299
but someone who is still going, well, wait a second, it's not preventing every cancer.

551
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,320
It's not actually prevented.

552
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:25,010
The more detailed you get into that that scientific thought, the more you're actually coming up with counter-arguments to, well,

553
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:28,069
maybe I don't need to be vaccinated, maybe this isn't that big of a benefit,

554
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:35,360
etc. The simpler gist of Prevent Cancer is much harder to counter argument.

555
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,930
Who's not going to want to prevent cancer at that level?

556
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:44,030
And yet it's incomplete and yet it's inaccurate in some sense.

557
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:50,640
What the fuzzy trace theory approach says is yes.

558
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:56,140
And that's the way we make any of our decisions about risk as we boil it down to a gist.

559
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,570
Well, this prevents cancer. And once we do that, then the behavior is obvious.

560
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:11,680
Well, of course I'm going to do that. If we have you know, we boil this down to a different just another government mandate.

561
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,990
Another thing that the government's forcing me to do to my kid.

562
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:23,250
That has a very different feel to it.

563
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:32,770
But that's prioritizing the autonomy side of this risk as opposed to a cancer prevention risk or health benefit risk.

564
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,260
So in many ways, this conversation we're having today about sort of like what are the.

565
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,560
How do world views enter into the way the lens we use about risk to benefit is?

566
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:52,240
From my personal perspective, I've never seen an article saying this, but it's basically just finding.

567
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,370
We look through our worldview as to find the gist of a situation.

568
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:02,230
And once we do so, that becomes the anchor for the way in which we're going to see that trade tradeoff.

569
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:07,370
And our communications. Ah.

570
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:12,310
About setting that just. The shaping and framing of it.

571
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:17,010
Now a number of you. Express.

572
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:29,740
I want to put this. Varied between the skepticism of this approach in the current environment to despair and anguish.

573
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:38,230
There were definitely some musings that were more sort of like, Yeah, it's sort of like,

574
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:43,090
I hear what you're saying, but I don't believe this would actually work. Kind of a feeling to it.

575
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:48,110
I want to sort of end today's discussion with that in mind.

576
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:57,780
Obviously in many ways for a variety of risks, COVID and other things, climate change, etc. There's a lot of politicization,

577
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:03,450
a lot of polarization that exists in the language and the messages that exist in the environment today.

578
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:13,420
So they are talking about these articles actually creating.

579
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:21,460
It was the language of pluralistic environment, creating an environment in which there are multiple possible answers, not just one.

580
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:26,440
Is that still possible? Are you feeling discouraged?

581
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:30,400
Are you feeling like, well, maybe there's lessons that we can take from today that would be valuable?

582
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:40,000
I have my own perspective on it, but I want to I want to give some space to allow you guys to feel either optimistic or pessimistic,

583
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,250
depending upon how you're reading on. Yes.

584
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:51,310
So I was kind of pessimistic. I wrote my music at the end of this, but I was yeah, but I talked afterwards.

585
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:55,210
I was talking to one of my friends who is in medical school now and has an MBA.

586
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,380
And I was like, this is like so frustrating, like all of this.

587
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:05,950
And he told me a story of like he was talking to a doctor who kind of like the same mindset with like like the COVID vaccine.

588
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:10,839
And they were like, what do we do? Like, it's like people are just upset every time you talk to them,

589
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,709
but they like told the story of how like and they would like mention it to a

590
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:18,010
patient and ask if they were like willing to talk about so that if they said no,

591
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:21,400
they like dropped it, but they would ask them like every single time they saw them.

592
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:24,890
And like after a while they would get people be like, I'm really concerned.

593
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:29,950
This is like primary care, doctor. I got to visit. They'd be like, okay, I'm willing to talk about it now.

594
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:37,690
So I had to kind of like, okay, we can't fix everything with like more intervention, but maybe we can make behavior change if we like,

595
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:42,160
keep trying and like respect their autonomy, but keep mentioning that we can talk about it.

596
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:52,570
So maybe like not as pessimistic as somebody by one of my stories on this because I talked to you guys about the movie.

597
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,009
We hope to get the whole story.

598
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:01,400
I'm told this after the summer. All right.

599
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:07,550
So another one of my random stories about doing risk communication is the fact that I got

600
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:17,660
contacted in 2011 by an Australian film producer doing a movie on vaccine hesitancy.

601
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,409
And there's lots of stories I could tell about that one,

602
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:28,700
but the one that's probably to my mind right now is one of the other people who was interviewed as part of that movie

603
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:37,130
was a doctor who deals with a lot of teens and was trying to do HPV vaccination communications at that point in time.

604
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:44,190
So this was I'm not even sure at that point in time it was authorized for for it to be given to male teens.

605
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:48,290
It was certainly primarily focused on girls at that point in time.

606
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:58,190
And what I remember during what you're talking about is this doctor talking about her approach to those conversations.

607
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:04,430
Of it, which always involved I'm going to bring this up.

608
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:11,120
It always involved her framing the issue as preventing cancer.

609
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,900
And it was never she never talked about it as a cervical cancer vaccine.

610
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:19,010
She always talked about as a cancer prevention tactic. She always framed it in the.

611
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:26,049
My value as your doctor is to prevent future disease.

612
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:37,180
And this is the thing that will help to do that. And when she did get people push back and say, I'm not willing to have a conversation.

613
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:44,620
Her response was always, okay, I could see that this is not a conversation you want to have right now, and I want to respect your choice.

614
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:52,540
If you're willing, you're willing. I want you to know that because these are my values and my value as your physician is to

615
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,560
protect you against disease that I will continue to bring this up each time we talk.

616
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,549
So she fought. She didn't just have the conversation over and over.

617
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:03,580
She fought out of it. She said, this is my value.

618
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:11,140
This is what I want. This is what I care about. And therefore I will keep talking about this in a respectful way, etc.

619
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:19,690
So that too is part of this framing to be able to say when we are expressing concern about a particular

620
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:25,480
risk and motivate people to engage in a risk prevention behavior to essentially own our worldview.

621
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:34,330
This is why I am doing this. This is the evaluation that I am placing on this, and I can acknowledge the costs that may come from that.

622
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:41,680
But shifting it essentially from and there is this risk and of course, that makes it obvious that you're going to do this, too.

623
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,990
I understand that there is a tradeoff here.

624
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:49,830
My value by world view says this is important, and that's why I'm going to give you the communication that you.

625
01:12:52,600 --> 01:13:01,930
I thought that was a really interesting use of sort of professional authority, but not authority, but but all in one's personal worldview.

626
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:08,349
She was saying, well, I'm a doctor. This is who I am. My worldview is oriented towards this issue.

627
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:15,160
And that's why I'm going to highlight this behavior as being the right thing to do from my perspective.

628
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:21,900
Where I'm going with this is I want us to reflect upon how often do we do that?

629
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:30,030
Do we own our values? What we are saying is this is what is important to me.

630
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:33,270
To us in public health. To us in health care.

631
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,130
And acknowledge that. That's why we are prioritizing what we are prioritizing.

632
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:47,970
Because when we get into situations, let's say like you have to shut down your business for the next six weeks,

633
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:58,980
we are directly putting our value of reducing mortality against another value of people having it, including able to pay for things, etc.

634
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:04,240
And those things were in direct conflict. And.

635
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:08,149
The conversation is different.

636
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:15,240
If it looks like, well, you don't care about this versus not flashing back to the crisis communication, acknowledging dilemmas.

637
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:23,420
I acknowledge that there are other values and those other risks and other costs exist.

638
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:27,330
It's a different conversation than if it doesn't look like I don't even notice them.

639
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:34,110
So that's another manifestation of this. All right.

640
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:39,740
So let's take the last few minutes and the small groups to ask about this.

641
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:47,790
So we've talked about lots of different health risks. Clearly worldviews do influence our perceptions of self risks.

642
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:58,860
But I don't think that my my worldview is necessarily salient to me about every last risk out there.

643
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:07,740
So I do come up with examples where you think that worldviews really are powerful influences on perception, but don't omit this one.

644
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:14,370
Think about also ones like what are examples of risks where you're like, Yeah, I don't think this world doesn't really take much on this.

645
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:20,640
Let's just let that percolate in your mind. Where are these world is going to be most influential in the world or not.

646
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,630
Okay, so that's your that's your food for thought for today.

647
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:34,440
So you might be interested in the episode from this past week.

648
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:44,430
Basically talking about it. House is the same one that I learned.

649
01:15:49,920 --> 01:16:15,130
Fact I don't know if I go back and change everything.

650
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:21,149
You know, it's like we know.

651
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:28,290
It's like how many people are really affected.

652
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:32,440
So I feel like I'm related to Ireland.

653
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:47,670
I feel like they might be contributing to other people on a separate or not receiving the risks that people are struggling with.

654
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:55,200
For example, like, you know, you're still alone and there are other choices.

655
01:16:55,290 --> 01:17:00,840
So I guess that's true. That's true.

656
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:05,160
Yeah, it really wasn't that long ago.

657
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:24,120
Can you put yourself out there that maybe sometimes it seems like you just like I think was like,

658
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:32,520
what is our relationship part of being a professional?

659
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:57,380
I think, you know, it's very internal is there is literally like a map and they just let me see what I think she brought up to set up for me.

660
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:26,410
You get something like a little promotion and things like that and there's always like the first part of it.

661
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:36,870
Yeah. And that's why I think people would see that reflected.

662
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:41,810
What happens is that a guy like you want to do that.

663
01:18:42,510 --> 01:19:04,560
So it's like, you know how I never heard that fatal flaw with straight talk about people or something like that?

664
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:10,110
You ever heard somebody say that airplane pilot has to be certified?

665
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:18,080
Never. Have you ever heard somebody say, I can't believe that the government tells me what side of the world I know.

666
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:23,230
It's like, you know, there are so many of us. I sure never heard of that.

667
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:29,579
Yeah. I said specifically, like, you know, people say,

668
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:50,399
I can't believe that the government says that's true and subscribe to some government mandates like Will no matter their premise.

669
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:55,220
Don't subscribe to it, right?

670
01:19:55,230 --> 01:20:21,270
Yeah. It's going to be great because, you know, it's like a big one for the most part.

671
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:26,530
The. I guess I'll tell you why.

672
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:31,580
Over time, it would look like it's huge.

673
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:42,680
It's like. It's like what it's like to be horrible, right?

674
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:57,140
What do you think? I think someone told me, quote, The economy is like anything else is just like just like the sky.

675
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:04,310
Everything that we know about, like, absolutely nothing.

676
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:19,370
Like the things that, you know, just like I was like, you know,

677
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:28,170
it's interesting because I don't like I don't public health is like that, like interpretation.

678
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:44,180
Yeah. I was a little like during the study period of late 2019 learning as it relates to growing up.

679
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:51,330
Yeah, I think I see I'm right up here right now.

680
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:58,549
We have like open oil etc. which are not suburban areas, but I'm not the experts.

681
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:04,160
And then there's things like I want to be autonomous, like they actually like giving them worse outcomes.

682
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:11,990
So it's, it's literally illogical, which is why I say people or something like that.

683
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:27,480
It's kind of like, All right, I know we're past time, so I don't know about that is like,

684
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:33,740
but that's been labeled a class and that exists for quite a while because I,

685
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:40,760
that's one of the most it's all about who should be allowed to people that occur to me.

686
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:46,760
But I was like, really what kind of do you think you should think what they do?

687
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:56,630
Oh yeah. After another time, you just like what was going to this country.

688
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:04,740
It was like. But it's not it's like it's not like that guy who's driving a motorcycle without a helmet.

689
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:17,540
And if I die, it doesn't affect the clean up the air and what you think you'll get off of that or something.

690
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:21,290
It's all about experiential learning going on there.

691
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:27,410
I don't answer texts ever, so I really think you have to get to that.

692
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:34,660
I'm not I disagree that it's a values because I believe it to be values.

693
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:38,899
Not no, but it's like all I said, you cannot give me an example that I cannot.

694
01:23:38,900 --> 01:24:05,470
It's like when I think about this on a larger size, I don't get that you're a medicine, right.

695
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:09,990
You can do that particular from like you.

696
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:13,670
It's a person acknowledging it in the first place and saying they're doing it to them,

697
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:20,860
literally stating, I am wrong not saying that I know I am and I'm acknowledging that I'm wrong.

698
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:34,390
Choosing to be around capital while you're here. I'm samples where you do the first step where some good are not like actually

699
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:41,870
I agree with that I mean I want to have like agree with that but you know,

700
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:50,210
like it's like people aren't going to read texting while driving.

701
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,600
There's no like that's not it's it's wrong, but it's awesome.

702
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,200
Just.
