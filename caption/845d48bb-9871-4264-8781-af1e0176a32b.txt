00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,220
My daughter recently got a pogo stick as a new toy.

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,120
This is a toy where you're supposed to stand on two foot pads that have been

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,710
basically soldered onto a giant spring and you're supposed to jump up and down.

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,690
Now, while I certainly understand the concept of the pogo stick in abstract,

5
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,730
I will totally admit that I could not use the pogo stick very well in practice.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,470
Now it's a bit of a silly example, but I realize that the same often happens when you're learning new skills.

7
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:46,460
You might understand the concepts of different study designs, but have a hard time identifying them in real life.

8
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,430
Therefore, in this particular video,

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:56,810
I want to try and help you to synthesize all of the information that we've covered up until now on the different study designs

10
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:05,120
and provide you with some insights as to how to actually identify study designs in the literature using real world examples.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,229
We'll also take a look at the type of information that's often presented in these kinds of papers and

12
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:19,010
very briefly discuss what the statistical models are that are commonly used to interpret these results.

13
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:25,430
Now, I should note that it is not at all my goal for you guys to become experts in these statistical models,

14
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,540
as I hope that you're going to be getting that expertize in other courses.

15
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:39,049
But I just want to make sure that, you know, which models map to different kinds of studies so that you have that name recognition and

16
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,640
that you know how to interpret the measures of association that different models generate.

17
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,280
If you'd like any more information on the kinds of models that I talk about in this video,

18
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,330
the book has a very nice discussion of these types of approaches.

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:04,580
So let's get started with the first example. In this study, investigators wanted to see if locking cabinets improved the safe storage of firearms.

20
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,750
They recruited households without operational firearm safes from six Alaskan villages,

21
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,440
and then they randomized households to receiving firearm storage cabinets.

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:24,500
Did you hear the magic word? The description said randomized, so your mind should instantly be going to the randomized controlled trial.

23
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:34,070
Now, similar words that might also tip us off to this particular design are things like assigned or allocated or intervened.

24
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,600
Anything really that's going to indicate that it's an experimental design where people did not choose their own exposures?

25
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:42,649
Now,

26
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:51,740
the description continues to say that investigators surveyed participants firearms storage at 12 months after the first group received their safes,

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,240
but before the second group received theirs, and then again at 18 months after everyone received their safes.

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:07,610
Now, the first thing to note is that investigators are collecting information at two time periods after they first recruit their study participants.

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,700
This is consistent with what we know of longitudinal designs like the randomized controlled trial.

30
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,200
The second thing that's interesting to see is that the investigators assigned everyone to ultimately getting the interventions,

31
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:29,870
but they staggered its deployment. Now, this allows them to compare the behaviors of gun storage before and after the intervention.

32
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:37,340
But it also ensures that everyone would ultimately get this treatment that they believe has a positive public health benefit.

33
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,970
Now, a final note is that investigators here randomized households rather than individuals,

34
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,760
because that's the aggregation that really matters for this particular scientific question.

35
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:56,180
Now, some of you might be thinking that that leads us to conclude that this is an ecologic design.

36
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,180
I want to say that this is still considered to be individual level data.

37
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:11,600
However, since there's information on every single household, as a result, we don't expect the ecologic fallacy to occur.

38
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,589
Now, a truly ecologic parallel of this study that would be problematic would be if

39
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,880
they offered all households in several different communities to participate.

40
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,320
And then they were tracking how the communities did on average,

41
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:34,850
without knowing whether or not the behaviors within households changed based on whether or not they adopted the interventions.

42
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,930
Great. So now that we're pretty confident it's a randomized controlled trial, let's look at their data.

43
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:51,140
Here is a subset of their table two, where they're comparing the gun locking behavior, which is their outcome between their early adopting group,

44
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,300
which is really their treatment group, and the late adopting group which they're using as their controls.

45
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:03,200
At baseline, you can see that the early and the late intervention groups were similar to each other with respect to their

46
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:12,140
firearm locking behavior since 95 and 90% of the early and late groups had unlocked firearms in their homes.

47
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,920
This suggests that randomization worked pretty well.

48
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,320
Now, after 12 months, however, things start to get pretty interesting.

49
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,959
You can see that the presence of unlocked firearms in the household dropped

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,720
dramatically to 35% in the early intervention group who had received their saves,

51
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:39,290
but not in the late intervention who had not yet received their firearm safes.

52
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:50,450
However, by 18 months, when both groups received the intervention, investigators observed declines in unlocked firearms in both groups.

53
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:57,740
Collectively, this suggests that the intervention was highly effective in this population.

54
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,490
Now, you may have noticed that the investigators reported some p values in their table.

55
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,670
While it's not readily apparent from their data whether or not those P values focused on the risk

56
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:17,300
differences or risk ratios either would have been possible to generate for the risk difference.

57
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:25,940
The idea is that you might model the probability of the outcome p as a function of your treatment ex as well as other

58
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:34,010
predictors that you might worry could be important to adjust for like alternate explanation for your findings or confounders.

59
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,150
Now, because the probability is being modeled without being transformed, in other words,

60
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:47,930
it's on the natural scale and it's being predicted by the sum of the impacts of different risk factors.

61
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,500
We call this the additive scale. In fact, the interpretation of one.

62
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,830
Of these beta coefficients is the change in the probability of the outcome between groups, say a treated or untreated,

63
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:11,010
or if you had an exposure that was continuous, it would be the change in the probability of the outcome per unit change in your exposure.

64
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,709
Now you likely recognize this type of formula for other outcomes as well,

65
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:23,970
such as continuous measures of blood pressure that could be estimated using a linear regression here,

66
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:32,580
because we're looking at probabilities, the structure looks the same, but the underlying distribution assumed is actually the binomial distribution.

67
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,610
Now, just as a reminder for any associations that are modeled on the additive scale,

68
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,720
the null hypothesis or no association would manifest as a beta coefficient equal to zero.

69
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:55,830
So if an exposure is associated with less outcome or is generally protective, then we would expect to see a beta coefficient of less than zero.

70
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:05,490
In contrast, if an exposure is associated with more outcome whereas harmful, then the beta coefficient will appear to be greater than zero.

71
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,600
If the authors had wanted to report risk ratio instead of the risk difference,

72
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,800
they could have modeled the probability as a function of predictors that had been exponential shaded.

73
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:27,720
This is called the multiplicative scale because addition is acting like multiplication within the context of exponentials.

74
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:37,740
As a result, the exponential shaded beta coefficient will reflect the risk ratio of the outcome between groups of the exposure.

75
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:47,500
Multiplicative scales are commonly used in epidemiology to also model odds ratios such as what's done in the second line.

76
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,520
And this is done using logistic regressions.

77
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:00,120
We can also model incidence rate ratios such as what's on the third line and conducted often with a Poisson model and hazard ratios,

78
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,840
which is shown on the last line and generated using a Cox proportional hazard model.

79
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,610
While I'm not teaching you these different models in detail are requiring even that you know the equations.

80
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,500
What I want you to know is that all of them are on the multiplicative scale,

81
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:23,850
and I want you to understand how to interpret the beta coefficients when there is no association.

82
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,120
E to the beta will be one, meaning that there's no difference in the risk between the two groups.

83
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:40,980
If an exposure is associated with a lower probability of the outcome, then e to the beta will range between zero and less than one.

84
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:51,420
In contrast, if an exposure is associated with a higher probability of an outcome, then e to the beta will range between one and positive infinity.

85
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:58,620
We'll see another example of this in the next study. So in this second paper,

86
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,209
we have a study that's investigating whether or not dementia increases the risk of

87
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,910
hospitalizations for hypoglycemic events or having too low blood sugar among diabetics.

88
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,620
The description says that investigators followed people with diabetes and assess their cognitive function every two years,

89
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,170
and then they identified hospitalizations for glycemic events over time for medical records.

90
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,340
So what have I observed here to know the study design?

91
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,550
Well, first off, I saw that they were looking at individuals, so I know that it's not an ecologic design.

92
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:42,200
Second, I saw that they were collecting data over time for both cognition and hospitalizations, indicating that it's not a cross-sectional study.

93
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:50,400
I also see that they recruited a full population rather than selecting individuals with a disease and without a disease.

94
00:10:50,910 --> 00:11:01,560
So now I know that it's not a case control. This leaves us with the longitudinal design because there's no apparent randomization of exposure.

95
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,990
I can conclude that it's a cohort study. Now let's look at their data.

96
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:16,080
They're presenting kaplan-meier curves that show that people with dementia have lower cumulative survival than those without dementia.

97
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,770
In addition, they're reporting hazard ratios for multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards model,

98
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:32,730
showing that diabetics with dementia have three times higher rates of being hospitalized for a hypoglycemic event than diabetics without dementia.
