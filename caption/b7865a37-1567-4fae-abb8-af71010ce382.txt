1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:16,930
Let's go ahead and get started, everybody. So welcome to genetics, health, behavior and health education.

2
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,610
Welcome to the new semester.

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:25,900
If you're like me, you're not quite ready for it to start and still a little jetlagged, but we'll hopefully have a good semester.

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:36,970
So my name is Scott Roberts. I don't think I know any of you. Actually, I'm a professor in B.A., and I've been teaching this course since 2007.

5
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,540
And so just to give you a little bit of background on the course.

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,630
So this was a course that I created at that time.

7
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:51,399
I was recruited here because that was a point in our schools history where we were really ramping up with our public

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,219
health genetic certificate program that some of you how many we have any public health genetics certificate students?

9
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,290
We have a few of those.

10
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:07,440
And so at that time, we didn't have anybody in health, behavioral health, education who was doing anything related to genetics.

11
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:15,190
And so my work has been looking a lot at the psychological and behavioral impact of learning genetic information.

12
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,270
So a lot of my research has been focused on genetic risk assessment for Alzheimer's disease in particular,

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,060
although I've also done a lot of work in cancer genetics and direct to consumer genetic testing.

14
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,450
And I also I have a a current project looking at genetic testing as part of workplace wellness programs,

15
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,009
which are starting to integrate genetic testing as part of their offerings.

16
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:46,809
So that's kind of where I come from. I'm a clinical psychologist by training, so I'm very interested in the psychology of genetic testing.

17
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,260
But well, as we'll learn over the course of the semester,

18
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,209
there's really a lot of interesting facets of genetics that are related to public

19
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,820
health in general and to help behavior and health education in particular.

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,670
So that's just a little bit on me and the course.

21
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:13,150
I thought I would just start by just some basics. So we're all on the same page in terms of how things will operate this term.

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,540
We're going to be a little bit cozy, I think. I think we've got 22 folks enrolled.

23
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,389
So you might need to might need to reconfigure some some chairs or such.

24
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,110
Also, just so you know, we have classes right before and right after.

25
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,080
So we'll probably have to to be prompt and finishing right at 50 after the hour.

26
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,400
So this course is going to be in person.

27
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,550
And I've tinkered over the years with the hybrid approach, but it really has not worked well.

28
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,310
At one point I tried, you know, having people zoom in if they couldn't be here in person,

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,840
but it really kind of it was kind of the worst of both worlds, if you will.

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,430
So I understand that sometimes you may not be able to make it so there will be recordings of the sessions via Panopto.

31
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:09,219
So if you're not able to make it in person, you can hopefully at least view a recording of the session.

32
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,170
But the focus of the class is really going to be here in person.

33
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,740
We're going to have a fair amount of both whole group and small group discussion.

34
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,410
So really encourage you to make it here for these in-person sessions.

35
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,600
And you know, given what we're dealing with, certainly masks are optional,

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,530
but especially if you have you've got any things going on or had any exposures, we would encourage masks.

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,959
I'm going to be maskless to to lecture. I mentioned the recording of sessions and Panopto.

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,540
We'll see how this goes. It's my first time using that systems and they tell me it's automatically happening at 1:00.

39
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,790
So hopefully that's truly the case and I'll afterwards I'll post them online.

40
00:03:52,300 --> 00:04:00,670
So even if you are here, maybe it could still be useful if there's maybe certain topics where you you want to listen again to what we covered.

41
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,450
That said, of course, this is winter in Michigan.

42
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:14,410
So it's possible that we may have, you know, crazy weather or if I get ill myself, we do now have the capability, of course, of moving to Zoom.

43
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,970
So even though I won't be running hybrid classes, we do have that capability.

44
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,620
So I'll try to alert you ahead of time if we need to switch for Zoom for a given session

45
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,040
and then we can just go back to the the COVID era for for a given session or two.

46
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,930
So any questions on just some of these kind of logistical housekeeping issues on on courses?

47
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:48,680
All right. Well, just to give you a little bit of background, again, trying to provide the rationale for this class.

48
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,250
So I mentioned I started this around 2007.

49
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,219
So that was a time where we really started to see exponential growth in genetic

50
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,190
tests for different kinds of medical conditions or health related concerns.

51
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,840
And so you can see from this graph just the dramatic growth starting in the 1990s,

52
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,680
you had the Human Genome Project completed at the turn of the century.

53
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,400
And then over time and this growth has continued even well beyond the end of this this graph here.

54
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,099
So the idea is we're able to test for genes that may tell us about someone in

55
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,830
terms of their risk for a condition for maybe might help diagnose the condition.

56
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:38,690
So this is really something that may be familiar to a lot of you, but that's why we're I think it kind of moves more from,

57
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,700
you know, specialty medical clinics to thinking about genetics as a public health issue.

58
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:54,040
And at the same time, you started to see, again, this 2007 time a real dramatic plunge in the cost of genome sequencing.

59
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,280
So when we can test for, you know, scores of genes at once.

60
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,629
Interestingly, back in 2001, it cost about $100 million to sequence the human genome.

61
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:14,020
And it's, you know, under $1,000 today and becoming part of a routine medical practice in certain settings.

62
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,879
So you have this combination of we know a lot more about the links between genetics and health,

63
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,690
and we also can do this much more cheaply and efficiently.

64
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:30,469
And so these are kind of driving the push for for genetics to be integrated in public health and medicine.

65
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,780
And then we're starting to see a lot more federal investment.

66
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:43,340
So President Obama, towards the end of his reign, put a huge amount of money into this precision medicine initiative.

67
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:50,000
There is a huge cohort study called the All of US Study that many of you may have heard of that we'll talk about.

68
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:59,120
And so we're starting to see on the research side a lot of federal investment and really around the hopes that greater understanding

69
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:08,690
of genetic links to health conditions are going to really speed progress in a variety of realms of public health and medicine.

70
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,060
So I think that's and again, some of this is probably old news to many of you,

71
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:20,360
but I think kind of sets the stage for why should we care about this in all realms of our public health?

72
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,240
And then particularly when we're thinking about it from a health behavior health education lens,

73
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:36,110
it becomes important for us to think about these genetic links to common complex disease, because it's one thing if genomics is used to diagnose,

74
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,940
you know, like a rare pediatric condition that maybe affects, you know, a handful of people, the entire nation,

75
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:49,969
versus an Alzheimer's, a heart disease, cancer, diabetes, these very common conditions that affect big swaths of the population.

76
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,720
That's when I think it becomes much more of a population health concern.

77
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,849
And I think we need to think about, you know, how do we educate the public about these advances?

78
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:06,679
How do we let them know what's available, what genetics can do, and really importantly, what it can't do?

79
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,630
Because I think there are some important limitations that we'll talk about in this course of genetic testing.

80
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:21,919
And so our traditional modes of health education, we may need to think about how do we modify those in terms of reaching the audiences that we

81
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,799
want to reach and also doing so around a subject matter that is pretty complicated for many,

82
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,580
that that can be misunderstood in a lot of ways.

83
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,950
So health education is going to have to look different in the context of genetics and genetic testing.

84
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,099
How do we integrate genetic information into our traditional health promotion programs?

85
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:50,510
You know, we're often talking about how do we get people to exercise more, eat more healthily, or stop smoking.

86
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,830
Genetic information may have relevance to those kinds of behaviors.

87
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:02,120
And so or also we're also trying to get people to get screened for various conditions where we know we can make a difference.

88
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:07,610
So a lot of traditional cancer screening, maybe it looks different if you're at high genetic risk.

89
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:17,090
Maybe these usual rules of getting a colonoscopy at age 50 or mammography at age 40 or 45, maybe those should be tailored.

90
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,240
And so how do we integrate genetic information into some of our longstanding health promotion programs?

91
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:32,840
And really, overall, I think there's also this idea of how do we keep pace with these really rapid scientific and technological advances,

92
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,860
not just by educating the public, but helping think about, well, what are the policies we want to have in place to regulate?

93
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,130
Some of these new uses. What kind of ethical dilemmas might arise?

94
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,750
We'll talk a lot in this class about issues of genetic privacy and genetic discrimination.

95
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,790
And, you know, just because we can test for something, does that mean we should?

96
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,410
And so these challenging ethical questions, I think, are something that will also be a theme of the course.

97
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,370
So these are, you know, some of these big picture items that I just wanted to put on the table that will continue to expand.

98
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,269
But let me let me start there to see if people have any kind of questions or

99
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,850
comments at this point about any of these themes or anything else I've seen so far.

100
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,370
All right. Well, you're going to have to talk now because we're going to do introductions.

101
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,410
So I thought what we could do for this is just go around the room.

102
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:41,419
You can say your name, your academic program, and then maybe just a little bit about, you know, why this course, this is an elective course.

103
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,470
So presumably there must be something about it that pique your interest.

104
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,390
And so we'd like to hear a little bit more from you on on what interests do you

105
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,770
have and maybe what experiences you might have that are related to the course.

106
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,020
So we'll kind of start here and maybe do a sneak through and then kind of come around to the side of the room.

107
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,610
So I'll start with with you. Hi. I am. And remember that project.

108
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,840
So it's kind of a weird room. It's Pillars and the old Boston Garden, you know, sitting there blockaded by the pillar.

109
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,410
We go ahead. Hi, I'm Hayley. I'm a second year student in hospital and molecular epidemiology.

110
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,860
I'm doing the genetic certificate, so that's okay.

111
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,590
I'm interested in this class. Great. So in epidemiology, what kind of stuff?

112
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:33,380
If you're interested related to genetics? Um, I'm kind of interested in cancer epidemiology.

113
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,690
Okay, well, welcome. Good to have you. I think you're not alone of epidemiology students.

114
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,969
Perhaps one might be sitting right next to you, so we'll keep going here pretty much all the same.

115
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,060
Except I have a different name. Okay. My name is Zeta.

116
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,370
Nice to meet you all. Um, second, your HIV student.

117
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,760
Um, I'm also interested in cancer epidemiology.

118
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:03,050
Um, I'm inspiring physicians, so hopefully I'm looking for, like, a niche topic.

119
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,830
Okay. Really passionate about. Yeah. Exploring my interests.

120
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,009
Right. We are certainly cancer genetics. We'll talk about a fair bit in this course.

121
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:19,460
In fact, early on, we'll have a film called In the Family that documents one woman's experience with bracket

122
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,829
testing to kind of illustrate the lived experience of undergoing that that type of testing.

123
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,920
But that's become an issue, as I'm sure you're aware, much more commonplace.

124
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,500
So interesting that you're taken from it and the potential medicine angle.

125
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,400
Well, welcome and keep going here. Hi. My name is Andrew.

126
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:49,849
I'm a first year student. Um, I'm a generalist in the most honest way, and I just want to learn about everything, particularly in this course.

127
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,070
I'm really interested in the ethical questions.

128
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,330
Um, I have very different views than most people on ethical questions, so I'm always interested to hear why people argue the opposite side.

129
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,580
And then certainly I've been heavily involved with athletics,

130
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,220
so I'm really interested in the nurture versus nature debate, particularly like the sports gene.

131
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,540
She's written by David Epstein. Great book, really got me interested in this.

132
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:22,340
So yeah, that sounds great. Well, yeah, I think you'll have no shortage of ethical dilemmas to, uh, to sink your teeth into this term.

133
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,140
And, yeah, I don't know if you may find this interesting. One of the group presentations.

134
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,429
I mean, I know it's something you underwent yourself if you were a college athlete, is it?

135
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,809
The NCAA now has mandated screening for sickle cell disease.

136
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,379
And so some have questioned, do we do we need a mandate for that?

137
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,230
Could it be optional? And so that that's one of our group presentations that might be might be of interest.

138
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,929
Yeah, maybe. Think of, you know, this really tragic heart attack.

139
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:56,749
You saw the Monday night football player. Maybe think about how some athletes have had, you know,

140
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:04,489
have these genetic links to their cardiac disease where they dropped dead in the middle of playing a sport.

141
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,850
I don't know if that may not have happened in this particular case.

142
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,989
But again, another link between genetics and sports, you know for sure.

143
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,780
And who should we be screening for these kinds of things automatically upfront to avoid some of these tragic outcomes?

144
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,700
Well, welcome. We'll keep going to the back here. So I'm fine.

145
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,420
I'm pretty good. I'm a first year medical student.

146
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:34,129
That's going to be our room, the GC row over there. Okay, so as a genetic health and student,

147
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:42,020
we certainly are very involved in working the patients directly and talking to them about genetics for their conditions.

148
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:50,030
And also just a lot of misconceptions that come up based on what could happen in public, on social media, about certain deficiencies.

149
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:57,980
I think that's what I'm really interested in, is having those discussions and how we navigate having those conversations with what goes on in clinic.

150
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:09,440
I think also I also have interest in the legal and social issues in genetics, and something I've been really thinking a lot about is how do we think,

151
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,430
for instance, how that how we discuss genetic conditions in the prenatal setting, for instance.

152
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,020
So that's part of this little bit of research in this course.

153
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:27,160
Right. Well, I'm glad you. You mentioned what we call the LC acronym Ethical, Legal and Social Issues.

154
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:34,909
There's actually an entire part of the National Human Genome Research called the LC Program that funds a lot of our our work.

155
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:41,090
And so that that theme will certainly be very relevant. Suffering will go down around here.

156
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,139
Hi, my name is Jennifer, but you can call me Jenny also.

157
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:53,959
First, you're in the genetic counseling program. And I think in our program we really look at a lot of more than clinical and kind

158
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,030
of scientific aspects to genetics and genetic conditions and genetic testing.

159
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,700
So I'm kind of interested in looking at it in a more public health lens and kind of looking on more patient

160
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,090
behavior and how receiving genetic information and learning about that or going through genetic testing,

161
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,209
what kind of more psychosocial impact that can have on a patient so that I can be more competent?

162
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:24,890
All of that is great. Well, yeah, we'll certainly talk about your field a lot in this class.

163
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,720
We have a guest lecturer you'll know well when the Ullman representing genetic counselor.

164
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:36,469
But I think we'll talk about this this tension potentially between, you know, what genetic counselors do.

165
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,299
We'd love to be able to scale up, but the workforce is relatively small.

166
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:48,200
So how do we these issues of kind of educating the public and promoting informed decision making,

167
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:57,260
how do we do that on a big scale if we don't have a genetic counselor, you know, on every corner, if you will, we'll keep going.

168
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,820
Hey, my name is Morgan. I'm also a person. You're not a counselor student.

169
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,870
I just applying for the opportunity to a degree.

170
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:17,419
So fingers crossed I'm interested in this course because I also similarly am interested in ethical issues,

171
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:25,729
especially with regard to access and equity and the ways that we present information and

172
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:34,010
how that allows for or disallows for patients to engage in autonomous decision making.

173
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:43,220
And I'm also interested in the charity like Family Immigration Adoption in Indonesia as well.

174
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:52,700
Thanks. Fingers crossed for you. I think you're probably going to be okay on the expansion mission's front, but I can't guarantee you everyone.

175
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,980
My name is a thorough so everyone that I'm also genetic counseling first year student.

176
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,640
My specific interest is in cancer education.

177
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,810
So I'm looking I'm trying to learn more about alternative therapies that we're models because as you said,

178
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,879
there are like a short amount of genetic counselors available and there are other

179
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,590
ways that we can use to increase accessible genetic services and education.

180
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:23,569
So I'm trying to learn about different educational tools and more models that I can use to increase access to genetic counseling services,

181
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:29,120
not only for general population, but also for minority populations who doesn't speak English at home,

182
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,320
who can't connect to the resources because they have to those patient populations.

183
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:41,450
Very well things. I'm glad you brought up this theme of kind of health disparities and access, because that's been a perennial challenge in genetics,

184
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:51,319
where you often we're often talking about specialty services, where access is inherently an issue overall, but especially for underserved populations.

185
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,219
And then this we'll talk a lot about this issue of, as you well know, for a lot of genetic test results,

186
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:05,750
you're more likely to have an uninformative variant of uncertain significance if you're from racial ethnic minority background,

187
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,140
because the research has just not been done in those population.

188
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:16,370
We'll keep going in the back. Hi, I'm Bella. I'm a first year undergrad and a speech program.

189
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,800
I really like it so far. And I'm thinking about going to public health grad school,

190
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,149
and obviously I'm going to work in public health, and I just have absolutely no clue what I want to do.

191
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,660
Some kind of taking a variety of classes to help me figure it out.

192
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,570
And something very interesting. Thanks, Ben, and good to have you here.

193
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:39,180
We'll keep trying, I guess, to the back row. I don't know, maybe start on this side.

194
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,230
I really I'm doing a multifaceted undergrad program and would be a help.

195
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,200
And yeah,

196
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:58,340
just like I'm really interested in genetics and how that relates to global health because we have had undergrads here who've done pretty well before.

197
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,900
So good. Good to have you on.

198
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,930
And I think hopefully you're saying, yeah, we'll have we have an interesting range of backgrounds of our students in this class.

199
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:15,050
So so thanks for joining. Hi everyone. I'm are doing doing of Public Health Germany track.

200
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:23,390
So I remember I watched a lot of news about the CRISPR genome insurance and related ethical issues.

201
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,680
That's my first impression of your impression of this topic.

202
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,420
And my my interest would be cancer epidemiology.

203
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:41,570
Well, I think this project countermeasure so particularly in this class would be like to look at more about things like the gender test,

204
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,410
about the measure. Yeah, that's right in my wheelhouse.

205
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,920
We'll have a whole session on genetic testing for for Alzheimer's.

206
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,700
But as we talked about before, the cancer will certainly be a theme.

207
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,809
So it sounds like you're one of several epidemiology students here.

208
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,459
So good to have you. Hi, my name is Bridget.

209
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,200
I am a second year M.D., GI and master's of Health Informatics student.

210
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:16,209
And I'm interested in this class mostly to learn more about like epidemiology and genetics,

211
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:22,660
sort of like play into that and link up mostly about how to sort of integrate

212
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,209
genetic screenings into population health surveillance sort of mechanisms,

213
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,990
how those are collected, all that data is generated.

214
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:41,740
And, you know, yes, I certainly will talk about I mean, the oldest genetic screening program, newborn screening, we'll talk about a fair bit.

215
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,300
And I think epidemiology will also be relevant because oftentimes genetic epidemiology helps us to generate,

216
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,129
you know, the risk estimates that we think about providing in our health, education programing.

217
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,000
And but taking a critical look at, well, what are the limits of that?

218
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,830
I don't know if any of you have taken any risk communication courses with my colleague Brian Zygmunt Fisher.

219
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:12,400
But these challenges of what can we say with what precision about genetic risk is often kind of a link between epidemiology and health education.

220
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:20,320
My name is Alexandra. I'm a first year. I'm meeting my master in Health Services Administration and the Health Management and Policy Department.

221
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,930
I'm also doing a certificate in public health genetics.

222
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:30,520
Before I came back to school for health management, I was more in the research track in medical research.

223
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,760
So my primary interests are in academic medical research.

224
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:40,599
So it's good to have an MP representative here because we will talk about a lot of policy issues.

225
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,690
So we'll talk about the one we're going to talk about most is Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act or Gina.

226
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:51,759
But we'll talk a lot about policy issues around regulation of genetic research.

227
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,790
And I think we'll talk a lot about, you know, some of the concerns about the potential harms from from genetic research studies.

228
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:06,530
Marcelo, right. I'm an undergraduate, sophomore, swing, industrial and operations engineering.

229
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:17,850
I'm also a law student. I was intending to be and I'm kind of interested in the overlap between engineering, public health and law and policy.

230
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,489
So I think my main interest in taking the space was kind of looking at that, like you said,

231
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:30,590
the overlap of actually like genetics and policy and regulation and the ethical questions walking around.

232
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,489
Great. Good to have you. Hi.

233
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:44,770
My name is Amanda. I'm first year general. A good student by reason for taking this class is aside from the genetic certificate is health.

234
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,409
Education is important to me and my family, especially when it comes to diabetes.

235
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:53,479
So hopefully you can talk about that. Yeah, for sure.

236
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,840
Well, we'll talk we'll talk about diabetes.

237
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,879
Sadly, in one context, I don't know if you know about the Havasupai Tribe case.

238
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:11,060
This is kind of this cautionary tale of genetic research where that tribe thought investigators were looking for genetic causes of diabetes,

239
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,500
but they ended up second using research data for other purposes.

240
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:23,450
That was really upsetting to that population. So that cautionary tale will be part of what we recover.

241
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:31,060
Yes. Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm a first year beauty student.

242
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,889
The reason I took this course is because I followed a pre-med track in undergrad,

243
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,770
and I do hope to eventually go to medical school and become a physician.

244
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:45,190
And so I'm pretty much interested in anything that involves like the intersection between like clinical medicine and public health.

245
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,229
And I feel like genetics is a really big part of that,

246
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,190
especially when you start talking about like access to care and disparities in health inequities.

247
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:00,640
So yeah, right. We have we'll have a whole session just on genetic education for health professionals and a lot of the focus will be on,

248
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,020
you know, what should non-specialists know there's been this big push or should we?

249
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,320
We should be educating primary care docs more.

250
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,649
But then some have pushed back on that by saying, well, some of these approaches are not yet ready for prime time.

251
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,950
So and given that primary care physicians are so overloaded with demands, you know,

252
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,459
what's an appropriate goal for what should the average primary care physician know about?

253
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,300
Genetics will be something we'll talk about. Yeah, I'm kind of one.

254
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:34,690
I'm Carly. I'm a first year HBCU student also. I'm also a certificate program for public health genetics.

255
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,330
I wanted to take this course because I've always been really interested in genetics ever since high school.

256
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,540
And then I was a bioethics minor in undergrad, so this was like the perfect intersection between the two.

257
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:55,130
I'm also pre-med, looking to go to medical school, so I want to kind of stay in the know the genetics with how quickly the field is changing.

258
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:02,950
We want to see how it will one day, regardless of the specialty that I enter, will most likely impact how I practice medicine and treat my patients,

259
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,320
and also how they are able to get care and what care they are able to provide for them.

260
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,050
Yeah, so it's kind of it's all my interest in one. So I'm going to be here, right?

261
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,350
That's where it was this issue bioethics by any chance.

262
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,100
Okay, yeah. They've got a great program. It's great. Leonard Fleck is there.

263
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,559
He's done a lot of interesting work on these issues of resource allocation, ethics and like,

264
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:33,880
how much should we really be spending in terms of either care or research around precision medicine?

265
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,510
You know, is it worth the investment given how much money is being poured in, given the the bang for the buck, if you will?

266
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,360
Don't you keep going here? I am Sara. I'm a second year general epidemiology student.

267
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:55,400
I'm specifically interested in cancer epidemiology, but I also find that chronic diseases and precision medicine interesting.

268
00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:01,490
And I just haven't really taken a course that's more focused on educating the public and kind of ethics of that.

269
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,300
So I'm excited to learn more about that. Welcome. My name's Katie.

270
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,110
I'm also a second year epidemiology student, and kind of like Sarah said,

271
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:19,069
we don't really get a lot of exposure to like the ethics and behavior side of it when you're kind of in epidemiology.

272
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:27,590
So I'm excited to learn more about that. I'm also in the genetic certificate program, so that's also part of the reason I'm here.

273
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,080
But then another thing I'm hoping we can learn about in this class is the, um,

274
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,880
like the genetics of psychological disorders as opposed to maybe physical ones

275
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,530
and how those are different and how there's maybe a stigma between the two.

276
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,620
Yeah, that's a great, great topic. We'll probably hear that from a couple of different realms.

277
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:58,730
We'll have a session on behavioral genetics, which obviously can implicate itself in everything from addiction to a lot of psychiatric conditions.

278
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,880
To be diagnosed, you have to have certain behaviors present.

279
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:10,110
And we'll also talk about in Pharmaco Genomics, one realm where that's been a lot of activity around is psychiatric conditions.

280
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:18,990
So there's a lot of pharmaco genomic testing potentially to inform prescription medications for depression, for example, or other psychiatric issues.

281
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:28,130
And I'm just like Sarah, and I'm also a second year in general, and I'm interested in cancer epidemiology,

282
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,380
but I'm also this is like my undergrad was in biology, like micro in genetics.

283
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:41,620
So I'm really interested in infectious disease as well and how those play a role like how genetics plays a role in both things.

284
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:48,829
Yeah, traditionally we haven't talked a lot about infectious disease much in this class, but obviously with COVID, that's changing some.

285
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:53,299
And so there'll be a group presentation on how genetic testing could be used.

286
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,600
It's already being used, obviously, to track COVID,

287
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:03,739
but there are some interesting potential future applications that we think about genetic susceptibility testing,

288
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,180
for example, so that that's one way in which infectious disease might be a problem.

289
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,920
All right. So I think we get everybody. I think everybody.

290
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,950
So as you can tell from these introductions, I always enjoy having a diverse set of students in the class.

291
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,229
So I think this is not atypical from prior years where you have some students,

292
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,309
some epidemiology students, genetic counseling, we have a few undergrads.

293
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,620
I think we have H and P health informatics.

294
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:37,220
Not to mention that, you know, the broader diversity that hopefully you all bring in terms of your life experiences and work experience.

295
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,140
So I think that will hopefully create some some rich discussion.

296
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:49,730
And I tried to frame the course so that depending on your background, it's not like, you know, it will all be focused in one area or another.

297
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,960
It's a very multidisciplinary approach to to the course.

298
00:29:54,530 --> 00:30:00,440
The challenge there is that, you know, sometimes maybe there'll be certain topics that you we wish we would dig deeper on.

299
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,719
And that's where hopefully some of the assignments can.

300
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:11,570
If you have like a particular interest that maybe is not meant as much that you can choose in those assignments to to dig deeper,

301
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,830
whether it's your group presentation or your final project.

302
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:22,819
So yeah, just to say also by way of introduction, just to say a little bit more about myself,

303
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:29,270
if you had told me I would be in anything related to genetics, even well into my Ph.D., I would have thought you were crazy.

304
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,610
This is not something I, I planned on.

305
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:41,689
I was an English major for the love of God, but I ended up getting into it because when I was an undergraduate at Duke University,

306
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:48,320
which that's also going to be relevant because it's basketball season. So you may hear me promoting My Blue Devils from time to time,

307
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:56,029
but this was at Duke in the 1990s was where they discovered this link between the F0 gene and risk of Alzheimer's.

308
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:01,189
And so it kind of raised some interesting questions. There was a lot of debate at the time and some of it still continues today.

309
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:09,979
Well, we know this gene is is linked to really serious disease, but we really don't have a lot to offer in terms of prevention or treatment options.

310
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,290
So should we even let people learn their genetic risk for Alzheimer's?

311
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,270
And so that's a lot for a long story, story that's kind of got me into it because for me,

312
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:25,129
for my dissertation, I became interested in talking to family members of people with Alzheimer's.

313
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:28,550
And what do you think about this new development? Would you be interested?

314
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:31,670
Do you think you should have the right to learn this information or not?

315
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:40,130
What do you see as the pros and cons? So that's kind of how I got into this towards the end of my PhD training and then.

316
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:48,070
I ended up going to Boston University School of Medicine after that to work with a prominent physician named Robert GREENE,

317
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:57,120
who was actually doing research on using clinical trials to understand how do people respond to learning genetic information.

318
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,310
So my dissertation was more just surveys and interviews.

319
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,230
He was using like a randomized trial design. Like this group gets the body information.

320
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,150
This person, this group does not.

321
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:13,540
And let's try to systematically understand what's the what are the benefits and risks of delivering this kind of information.

322
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:19,900
And so, you know, my background has bounced around from English major to clinical psychology to then being on the faculty,

323
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,350
the medical school, and be you and now here in public health.

324
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:28,420
So I try to bring that that mindset of borrowing from different disciplines.

325
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,470
And so I hope that spirit will also be part of this classroom.

326
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:41,350
And to kind of further illustrate that theme. I like this quote from this book called Mapping Fate.

327
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,360
So Alice Wexler is kind of an interesting figure.

328
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:53,010
Her sister, Nancy, actually the U of M alum and was instrumental in identifying the gene that causes Huntington's disease.

329
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,610
You have this fatal neurogenic neuro genetic condition. But she's a historian.

330
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:03,930
And so this quote to me kind of captures nicely some of the topics of this course.

331
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:12,360
So even though we think about human genetics in the kind of scientific or biomedical space, obviously it has implications well beyond.

332
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:21,400
So we'll be talking about this volatile space at this intersection of all of these topics, I think, throughout the course.

333
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:28,150
And so some of the fields that will be drawing upon in the assigned materials are listed here.

334
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,379
And so in that respect, it may be very for some of the epidemiology students,

335
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,350
it may be very different kind of reading list than you're used to, but hopefully an enriching one.

336
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:46,510
And then I also not just like to draw upon the traditional academic literature, but we'll have a lot of it.

337
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:55,350
We'll have some news media coverage, will have some memoir types of approaches and a fair bit of documentary film as well,

338
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,830
because I feel like those are useful in thinking about these issues.

339
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:07,780
So speaking of documentary films, I hope you had a chance to view this brief three part documentary,

340
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,220
that stat and the retro report put out called The Code.

341
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,700
And I thought this was a not even though it's a few years old now.

342
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:22,510
I thought it was a nice way to highlight some prominent course themes that we'll be talking about.

343
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,340
So what I thought we would do and again, this is something. Oh, yes, go ahead. Sorry, I didn't get a student.

344
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:33,170
Oh, okay. Sure. Anybody else need one? Thank you.

345
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:43,309
So this this three part documentary, you know, again, the first part was like finding the code.

346
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,540
It was talking about, you know, this race to sequence the human genome, you know,

347
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:54,590
the competition that emerged between Francis Collins NIH team and Craig Venter's private industry team.

348
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,139
But then you had this fixing the code words,

349
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:05,060
talking about the promise of CRISPR based therapies and more traditional gene therapies to to cure disease.

350
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:13,219
And then then finally, there was this feud between selling the code, this idea of genetic testing being commercialized in various ways,

351
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:20,480
some of them controversial, given that some would argue the science does not merit yet a commercial testing application.

352
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,799
So I think hopefully this gave you a little bit of of background and pique your interest.

353
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,370
But I thought it would be helpful for you all to talk in smaller groups.

354
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,730
I think it's easier sometimes to do that.

355
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,200
So what I thought I would do, and this is something we'll do a fair bit in this class is just break up into small groups.

356
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,250
I don't know exactly the best way to divide them, so I kind of leave it up to you to figure out maybe in groups of like three or four people,

357
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:48,260
turn shift to your pivot to your neighbors, sort yourselves in those smaller groups.

358
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,700
And I'm interested in hearing more from your groups.

359
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,240
What aspects of the documentary did you find most interesting and why?

360
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:03,560
And so I've just listed some of these these themes that I think were prominent in the three clips.

361
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:13,100
That may be a starting point for you to discuss, but certainly feel free to talk about whatever you learned about that you thought was interesting.

362
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:22,399
So I'll leave it up to you to break off into your smaller groups to discuss, give you maybe like, you know, eight or 10 minutes or so to discuss.

363
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,990
And then we'll hear from you what you found compelling.

364
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,470
All right. When we come back together as a whole group, so have at it.

365
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:42,910
I know. I feel free to shift gears.

366
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,800
Shift gears, not move around. I don't know. I mean, I don't know.

367
00:36:47,940 --> 00:37:10,190
I guess I can see why I kind of reason I think it was, you know, I was like, I didn't know, you know, I know, I didn't hear.

368
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:23,220
I went out there and I knew I knew that I didn't really like any reason.

369
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:34,400
And I just think that expensive was actually I mean, I thought that was interesting because I thought it was really I don't know,

370
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:44,920
I started at one of those little things like that, you know, I don't really like I know.

371
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:55,570
I think I just sat there and I said, I don't think about that.

372
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:12,620
But yeah, you know, like I said, I didn't really know anything about it, but several times over and I just see what it's like.

373
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:20,330
Yeah, I guess it's like you said that you think you might expect it to be.

374
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:34,580
I think it's like, yeah. And then you feel like you have to hear a lot better than your average American and know that we're doing more than others.

375
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:40,070
So it's like, I'm just curious as to, wait a minute, I'm just not.

376
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:55,880
I have like, oh, good and everything like 23 other areas that we have in our house and they're like, I don't know,

377
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:12,360
maybe we get a different and I think it's like, oh my God mean, it's actually interesting cause you're right.

378
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:18,340
I was thinking that I was like, Why did you buy a car?

379
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:26,760
Just because you're now, you know, I just feel like we're so like I think that's the other way story.

380
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:32,180
A lot of things that people are terrible.

381
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:38,250
Yeah. I mean. And now you're like, Oh, my God.

382
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:51,290
You're like. Oh, no, no, no, no.

383
00:39:54,370 --> 00:40:08,609
Yeah. I was like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:24,010
I don't know where he is today. I think you're like, yeah, you have, you have, you know, a lot of knowledge and experience.

385
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:30,600
And so you have like an hour and a half an hour with the other one.

386
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:37,470
Just go back to find out more about not money.

387
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,350
I didn't know they got married.

388
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:52,620
Interesting. They don't get the right ones that we had over there.

389
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,450
I don't know anything about validating. Like, I feel like I need everyone I know.

390
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:13,970
I'm like, I'm gonna help you with your dog.

391
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,530
And then I said, You're right. I think. What is that?

392
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:34,040
I don't remember that. Like I said, I was like, Oh, I don't know.

393
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:48,960
I don't know what is going on here. I think finally I can relate to that.

394
00:41:49,140 --> 00:42:01,760
We just have to provide for it. And then that's like, I don't know how.

395
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,170
Yeah, that's what I said.

396
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,950
We got a text.

397
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:19,320
I don't have a date with her family because I was saying like this, but it's not like they have in their own section or equal to my cousins.

398
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:32,590
But I, I don't just because of the discovery about the sequencing, the genetics, that they are not insane.

399
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:45,590
Oh, my God. I just have to say that she when we talk about that and I'm just why they don't I don't that I sometimes wonder,

400
00:42:46,260 --> 00:43:04,320
you know, I really don't understand why that I was like, oh, did you really like that?

401
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:18,360
Right. Right. So it is unclear how much I know.

402
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,110
Like if something goes wrong, I know you're.

403
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:29,870
Now get something out of your.

404
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,480
And I didn't know anyone who.

405
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,320
You'll have that I want to ask.

406
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,610
You know, you've really got nothing.

407
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:54,050
I have been.

408
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:01,049
I'm like, Oh, yeah. Or whatever.

409
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:06,709
You know, I got the aggravated battery.

410
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:24,880
Is are you willing to about even buying something like that?

411
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:35,890
I guess I would never want to do that. I mean, there's a lot of stuff like that.

412
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:47,990
Yeah. I mean, I think the undergrads, cause I have something I really, really should read.

413
00:44:47,990 --> 00:45:02,420
This post is going to be out in a year. I think I really like the idea and that scares me.

414
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:09,340
But I'm old enough and I feel like you're.

415
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:24,080
I'm the guy who's got it in the back. Oh, glad you didn't feel like you have so many activities going on.

416
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,210
It feels a different. All right. Let's come back together as a whole group.

417
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:44,059
So, yeah, I'm interested in hearing what is to be struck out in your your discussions of these this question and these themes.

418
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,710
So maybe you've got it from this side of the room. Want to start us off?

419
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:49,879
Yeah. Yeah.

420
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:58,850
So we talked a lot about, like the implications of CRISPR and how it's kind of like seen as this awesome new technology that can save lives.

421
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,620
But like, there are the downsides that we didn't know about.

422
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:08,760
Like, I did not know that it wasn't a cure and that the effects of it I would, like, dwindle over time.

423
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:17,239
So there's that. And there's like the fact that it can cause other mutations that can be seen later in offspring and stuff like that.

424
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,940
So yeah, it just seems like the, the negative parts of it aren't really advertised.

425
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,879
It's nice. Yes. It sounds like you're thinking about this theme of potential unintended consequences and

426
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:36,290
how do we frame the benefits and risks to the public in these kinds of discussions?

427
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,670
Yeah. There.

428
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:46,070
I thought I overheard some of this group maybe talking about those issues in a different way or like issues of informed consent and risks.

429
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,430
Is that right? Yeah. I mean, we talked about an eavesdropper.

430
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,190
We talked a lot about risk communication, which is a really difficult subject, as you talked about.

431
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:02,780
Like you can give someone a number, you have a 4% chance of something happening and that can be really high.

432
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,709
That can be really low. But it also it's entirely probabilistic.

433
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:13,190
Like it doesn't mean even if you have a 99% chance of something happening, there's a 1% chance that it won't happen.

434
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,850
And so taking proactive action on that is.

435
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:23,209
You may have been right, but you also may have caused additional suffering that you may not have experienced.

436
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:30,470
And so getting into the whole idea of autonomous decision making and are people qualified to make those decisions,

437
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,470
are people qualified to advise them on those decisions?

438
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:42,200
And where what role is played by government and organizations and kind of sharing and discussing what that information actually means?

439
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:48,169
MM Yeah. I think we saw that in the context of some of these early gene therapy trials.

440
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,909
And we'll talk more about the Jesse Gelsinger case in particular that I think was alluded to in the film.

441
00:47:52,910 --> 00:48:01,160
But I think that was an interesting example where it seemed like there were a lot of things working against truly informed consent in that study.

442
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,610
A There was. Just because it's so early on in the science,

443
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:11,420
there may be risks that we don't even know about or how do we even quantify given that we've had such limited experience.

444
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:16,790
But then there was also, I think, the issue of kind of financial conflicts of interest in that case,

445
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:23,540
where the people at Penn running this study were also spinning off a company that they hoped would be very profitable.

446
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:30,770
So you could imagine that they might have biases in what they disclose as a risk, because maybe they're afraid that people,

447
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:36,649
you know, the regulators wouldn't approve this study in the first place or that people would never want to sign up for something.

448
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:41,389
So, yeah, I think this issue of framing risks in both in research,

449
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:50,270
in clinical practice and in the broader population as we talk about these things are going to be really important themes not just in the film,

450
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:57,290
but I think for our discussion moving forward. What else did die from moving further back on this side of the room?

451
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:00,080
Any other themes you guys were talking about? Yeah, it's Carly, right? Yes.

452
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,590
Oh, so we haven't touched on every single broke windows up there so that each of us had something different that was the most interesting.

453
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,890
But what stuck out to me in particular was that the quote that they said,

454
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:14,500
I think was on a newscast in the clip that this technology is like a heat seeking missile.

455
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,809
But is it really if there could be those off target effects that the first group talked about?

456
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:26,960
And if I think another quote said that it was adding in how many years,

457
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:36,050
10 to 11 years of life expectancy were added, but not a single year was attributed to genius advances in technology.

458
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:43,639
So are we just at a point right now where it's trial and error and we're building ourselves up to that huge breakthrough,

459
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:51,830
or it is going to be beneficial for a large population so it can be that heat seeking missile or is it just being overhyped

460
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:58,190
for the sake of profit and making it appear as though it's more beneficial than it is to get people to buy into it?

461
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:06,800
Yeah. Any reactions to Carly's bring up this idea of maybe the the overpromising around benefits.

462
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:14,570
Yeah. In the back. Yeah. I think you're like the quote. I was in one of the videos about how, like, they think the, you know,

463
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:21,559
the benefits from genetic research are kind of like overhyped in the short term, but like underestimated the long term.

464
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,870
Like they said that that usually happens with any new technology that like it takes a long time to

465
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:32,089
get to where you have enough knowledge and enough information to have those really big benefits.

466
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:35,389
But so in the short term is always underestimate, it's always overestimated.

467
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,250
And then in the long term, it's underestimated.

468
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:42,950
And I think that that that really resonated with me is like with these early gene therapy trials, they were like,

469
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,599
we can do so much with this, and they kind of overestimated what they could do in the short term.

470
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,950
But I think in the long term,

471
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:57,050
there's a lot of promise and potential that people see and using genetics to help both personal health and population health.

472
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:02,659
Yeah, particularly because I think some of the applications were kind of severe incurable

473
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,520
conditions where other approaches don't seem to really have have borne much fruit.

474
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,530
But I think the I think you're you're talking about Francis Collins, the former NIH director,

475
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,610
I think was the one who mentioned had the quote that you you mentioned.

476
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:22,910
And he's as we'll talk about next time, you've been kind of the public face of genomic research in a lot of ways for decades.

477
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,670
And you know but I think even he fell prey, I think, to this overhyping.

478
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:34,550
There is a famous piece he put out or I think right around when the Human Genome Project was being completed,

479
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:41,780
where he was saying, you know, every primary care doc in 2010 is going to like this is going to be routine part of our practice.

480
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,759
And we haven't we're not even seeing that in 2022, by 2010.

481
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:53,350
And so and Nigel Paneth, who's at MSU, I think he was the one who had the code that Carly was talking about,

482
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:58,970
will read one of his critiques where I think he's arguing again, maybe it is just short term,

483
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:07,940
but he's saying he he wants to see more of this, quote unquote, return on investment from a public health standpoint and more than just,

484
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:15,260
you know, you saw that these kind of inspirational individual patient stories like the kidney cancer patient.

485
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:22,750
But I think he wants to see this kind of multiplied and at a much bigger level to justify, you know,

486
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:28,219
the hundreds of millions of dollars that that NIH might be, you know, pouring into to this I think this tension.

487
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,500
I think there's an easy answer. I don't think we'll totally resolve it.

488
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,270
But I'm glad you guys are picking up on this theme of what's an appropriate amount of

489
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:41,840
of investment in this aspect of research versus other types of public health research.

490
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:46,900
I'm on this side of the room. I know Andrew spoke up a little bit earlier, but about the group in the back.

491
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:48,850
What were you all talking about?

492
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:56,500
We kind of talked about a lot with the Human Genome Project, kind of how they thought, oh, once we see the human genome,

493
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:03,040
all kind of solve so many problems and so much about disease and kind of the contradiction of that,

494
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:12,129
of how we're just essentially looking at the data, they learn more about the soil conditions and that it's not that simple in terms

495
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:17,950
of genetics and the traditional dealing in monogenic conditions and so on.

496
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:28,989
That's right. And so kind of the differences of how expectations kind of exceed reality in terms of that and how to this day,

497
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:36,790
we're still trying to figure out for so many different conditions of how the genetics might have actually worked.

498
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:43,330
Mm hmm. Yes. There's a need for kind of humility, given the complexity of what we're we're talk to about.

499
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:54,820
Are there other themes from any book that you think worth sharing with the whole class that you found interesting in their small group discussion?

500
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, I think, you know, again, these are certainly it's not going be the last time we talk about these.

501
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,620
And hopefully you found this.

502
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:14,280
What I liked about this set of clips was it really did illustrate it talked about some of the main players were were there,

503
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,639
whether it's Francis Collins or or Jesse Gelsinger or others that we'll be talking about it.

504
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:29,330
But then also, I thought to my mind did a pretty balanced portrayal of some of the issues.

505
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,050
What did you guys think?

506
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,790
We'll talk a lot about kind of news media coverage of genetics and how, for better or for worse, is the way most people learn.

507
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,540
What did you all think of it as a way to educate the public?

508
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:49,920
Did you see any concerns with how it was framing the issues or omissions or biases, or did you think it did a pretty good job of laying things out?

509
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,000
That's kind of an educational tool overall.

510
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:03,910
Contribute to the formation of a lot of misconceptions, especially around CRISPR and technology.

511
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:09,700
I know, especially following the scandal in China, when these were announced,

512
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,980
there was a hole like designer babies in the form of this whole genetic editing.

513
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:21,669
You're going to have the power to design our baby, and that's not what the technology is being used for.

514
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:31,540
And so that kind of the spread of this mass hysteria surrounding gene therapy and gene editing, I gave it like a bad rap in terms of what happens.

515
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:40,750
So you're concerned that as these clips kind of fed into that overhyping of CRISPR as potential?

516
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,750
Okay. Yeah. We'll talk we'll talk about.

517
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,450
John Couey is back in the news. Well, the whole thing in a minute.

518
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:58,389
But yeah, I think even though it was kind of parroting some of the the these news clips, but I think we'll talk about in the news media coverage,

519
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:07,360
the fear is that it is part of it's not just the scientists who are hyping, but the the news media can maybe sometimes fanned the flames.

520
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:13,030
Well, I actually read some interesting studies that have like systematically coded news media stories.

521
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:20,680
And they'll find that the risks you're talking about are the limitations are often not mentioned as prominently as some of the benefits.

522
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:28,490
Anything else on the code? All right.

523
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:34,879
Well, let's let's get a little bit more mundane, but I think hopefully this will be useful information just for the course.

524
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,860
I want to make sure you're aware of of your relevant details.

525
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:44,659
So. In terms of prerequisites for this course.

526
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:54,930
I tried to to kind of take all comers and hope that what we're doing is not so far beyond people without a genetics background that's being said.

527
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,689
Obviously, if you do have a genetics background,

528
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:02,630
that's probably going to be helpful for you in various ways if you don't have a lot of genetics background.

529
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:08,720
I do have some resources on the course website, you know, like like some glossaries of terms or some,

530
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,350
some kind of websites that are can can get you up to speed.

531
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:20,450
But I've tried to be mindful in assigning the readings and my slides and trying to frame things so that they're not,

532
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,710
you know, too far over people's head here. That's where maybe being an English major helps.

533
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:29,090
I don't you know, I have to frame it so my English major self would understand.

534
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:35,180
But that being said, if we do, you know, mention it's a very jargony feel, very a lot of acronyms being thrown out.

535
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:42,799
So certainly if feel free to either, you know, stop us and, you know, ask for clarification or come to me afterwards,

536
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,330
if there are certain concepts that that we're kind of presuming knowledge that that's not there.

537
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,790
But in general, I don't have kind of a lot of formal prerequisites for this course.

538
00:57:53,480 --> 00:58:04,879
I don't have specific office hours, but I am very accessible and we can set up meetings upon request, often like right before or right after class.

539
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,260
And fortunately, in years past I've been able to reserve this classroom itself.

540
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:13,250
But I think this year it's going to be classes in and out right before and right after.

541
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:19,940
But we can certainly set up time. I will be asking to meet with all of your groups for the group presentations.

542
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,810
That will be a required meeting, but otherwise I kind of follow your lead.

543
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:30,170
But certainly whether it's to, you know, talk about ideas for your final project,

544
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:35,540
talk about, you know, internship options in the field or whatever it may be.

545
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:42,079
Certainly don't be shy about reaching out. I'm I'm, to my wife's chagrin, an obsessive email checker.

546
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:49,310
So I do tend to be pretty responsive to the email requests so we can set up office hours if needed.

547
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,690
And then, as you may be gathering from today, I tend to try to combine lecture and discussion.

548
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:03,739
So I have some lecture bursts, but then try to have whole group and small group discussion so that that is fairly typical for for our courses.

549
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:11,060
That'll be that kind of combination. And I do post the lecture slides online for you to follow along if you'd like.

550
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:18,200
Any questions on any of these? Housekeeping, of course, rules issues.

551
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:25,010
To give you a sense of the syllabus, I organized it in these four units.

552
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:30,080
And so the first unit we're going to be talking about kind of more background overarching issues.

553
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:36,080
Then in our second unit, we're going to be talking about specific applications of genetic testing.

554
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,659
It won't be an exhaustive list, but I've got some examples here, like prenatal newborn screening,

555
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:48,170
cancer or degenerative conditions so that they kind of illustrate some of the important course themes.

556
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:55,460
Then in the third unit, we're really going to talk about genetics, education, different approaches that have been tried.

557
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,450
And we'll be taking a look and critically analyzing whether it's for health professionals,

558
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,740
for the public, because the media and pop culture play such a big role.

559
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:09,260
We'll be looking at genetics as they're portrayed there, but we've already kind of talked about media a little bit.

560
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:14,719
And then the last unit of the course is meant to describe kind of emerging issues.

561
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,410
And these these are areas where it's not a totally new.

562
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:23,630
But in terms of public health applications, they're still relatively early on.

563
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:30,650
And so we'll be talking about disciplines like Nutri Genomics, infectious disease control, pharmacogenomics.

564
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,949
So those will be kind of some of the closing unit.

565
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:39,439
And this will be pretty heavy on group presentations because I'm learning myself about these things.

566
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,239
So I, I turn it over to the groups for several of the final session.

567
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,560
So that's how the course is organized in terms of the topics and units.

568
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:52,580
These are the how your grades will be determined.

569
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,990
So I march through these in just a little bit.

570
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:03,680
I do count class participation and so I'm old fashioned and I do note who's here and who's not here.

571
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,250
Certainly I tend to be pretty reasonable. I like to think in terms of what counts as an excused absence.

572
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,559
I just ask that you are communicative with me about that.

573
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:20,719
So as long as you're emailing me ideally ahead of time, sometimes that can't be in advance notice if if it's an emergent issue.

574
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:26,810
But, but just keep the lines of communication open if for some reason you can't be here.

575
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:31,700
But I do take attendance. I think I do keep in mind citizenship.

576
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:39,829
It's usually not a not a problem. But, you know, it issues around, you know, kind of how people are in terms of their interaction with others.

577
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:48,129
We will get into some hot button issues. We'll talk about ethical issues, talking about, you know, abortion, race, that these things can be divisive.

578
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:51,320
So I hope we can keep things simple and respectful.

579
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:57,909
So that would be another factor. And then there's just good old fashioned taking part in the class discussion.

580
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,660
So like I said, there will be a whole group, small group.

581
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,690
And then also I know some people are tend to be more introverted,

582
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:14,620
so I do have kind of the possibility for online contributions primarily through this feature that I'll create called Genetics in the News.

583
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:19,389
And again, it kind of fits with this idea of how is genetics being talked about in mass media.

584
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:24,640
And so there inevitably are stories out there that have coarse themes.

585
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,390
And so one way, let's say you're on the Shi'a side and not talking a lot in class,

586
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:33,340
but you would still want to contribute as you could post a news story with a brief commentary.

587
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,460
So things like this I know people saw this over the break.

588
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:44,559
My kids tell me this is like the Marvel Thor guy from all those Marvel movies.

589
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:52,870
But Chris Hemsworth is a famous actor. I guess he was doing some kind of health show about like positive aging or something.

590
01:02:52,870 --> 01:03:00,669
And so low and behold, he gets tested for Avery and finds out he's an E4 E4 from a zygote.

591
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:07,629
So he's at high risk for Alzheimer's. So it kind of promoted all this discussion of, well, should you get Alzheimer's tested or not?

592
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:14,230
And Chris Hemsworth is kind of divulging his experience with what it was like for him to kind of get blindsided by this this information.

593
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:17,740
And he does have a family history of the condition.

594
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:24,819
So that's one example of, you know, last month we saw this who John Couey was was mentioned earlier.

595
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:31,450
So this he anyway, you want to somebody want to tell us why this guy was jailed three years ago?

596
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:36,970
Anybody remember? What didn't he like? Look into, like during HIV.

597
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:46,549
There was none. Yeah. So he tried to use CRISPR to confer protection against HIV.

598
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:52,380
In what context? Yeah.

599
01:03:52,840 --> 01:04:03,729
Yeah. So it was to create twins using CRISPR as part of IVF and and implantation of embryos that would have this particular,

600
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:13,750
I think a C, C five was the gene. So if you have a certain type of CCR five gene, it's potentially protective against HIV infection.

601
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:20,170
So even though we have other much easier ways of preventing HIV out there, he was like, Well,

602
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:26,910
this might be a way to like build in innate protection against HIV for these two babies.

603
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:34,870
And so he kind of engineered this with this couple and announced it very proudly at a scientific meeting a few years ago,

604
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:40,209
thinking, Oh, the world would be all excited. Well, here's a kind of a new avenue of HIV prevention.

605
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:45,670
And does anybody know what happened when he presented at this meeting?

606
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:52,840
Wasn't a really long time. Yeah, because I think in one case he was successful.

607
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,760
One of the friends, not successful for the other.

608
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,940
So it was a different results for each of the times.

609
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:08,340
And so a lot of people were commenting on that situation and how there's no real way to regulate one.

610
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,190
There might be a lot of. Yeah.

611
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:22,260
And then also at that point, the technology was still so and there was no even sufficient enough like in all of these groups.

612
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,820
And so to move it to a certain space.

613
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:33,030
That's the thing about all the things I said. Yeah, there's a lot of concerns and a lot of that.

614
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:42,650
Yeah. So the fear was that he was kind of proceeding too far, too fast, given what we knew about the risks of this.

615
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:49,620
And in fact, there is some concern. I think somebody mentioned earlier these kind of off target effects where that maybe

616
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:54,059
you're not as precise as you really want to be in creating this this gene change.

617
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:58,950
And you introduce other changes that you don't know what the complications could be.

618
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:07,680
Also, there had been, you know, a lot of kind of formal groups that studied this issue of should we be doing this at all?

619
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,100
And it really concluded that we probably should not be.

620
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,600
Or if we do go down this route,

621
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:22,350
it should be in very controlled settings for very particular purposes where you do have like a strong body of the animal research backing you.

622
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,290
And he was kind of leapfrogging way ahead of that.

623
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:33,420
So when he announced this the birth of these twins at the scientific meeting, people were aghast and there was an international outcry.

624
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:40,890
And he ended up in China being imprisoned for for these offenses.

625
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,610
But he's now, I guess, out of jail. And so last month it's in the news.

626
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:48,780
He kind of wants to get back in the field and and resume some of his work.

627
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:54,959
And he says he's, you know, learned his lessons. But I'm not sure what the very latest is.

628
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,380
But you can read his genetics in the news and and find out.

629
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,690
And then finally, this story I found interesting. So in the UK.

630
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:12,500
They are moving towards this major project to try to sequence newborns for disease genes at birth.

631
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:20,770
And so, you know, we'll talk about newborn screening, which in the state of Michigan, I think it's like 56 particular conditions.

632
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:26,140
And it's not using whole genome sequencing, but some have said, well, since it's very easy to do,

633
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:31,690
you can see even from just a blood test, you could do an entire, whole genome sequencing of a newborn.

634
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:37,420
And maybe there's new ways to find conditions that would not be detected by newborn screening,

635
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:45,430
that would still be of concern that could be intervened upon. And so this is still this open question of how far should we expand newborn screening.

636
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,990
And so in the U.K.,

637
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:55,870
they're trying to do this on a pretty large scale basis with 200,000 newborns to see to get a clear sense of the risks and benefits.

638
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,270
So those are anyway, it doesn't take much.

639
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:03,070
I did this in probably like 30 or 45 minutes, just looking through genetics news in a couple of keywords that you can.

640
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,720
There's a lot out there. They're kind of hot stories in the news.

641
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:11,680
And so I think one way to contribute to the course would be to kind of,

642
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:18,100
as you encounter these yourselves posted or create a forum online where you can post a link to the story,

643
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:23,019
maybe just a brief blurb about it would be another way to kind of show what we're studying.

644
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:29,410
Has this kind of current events significance? Are there other topics you guys are coming across?

645
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:39,430
Recently that you remember having seen anything that had to be like last week or two, but that's year.

646
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:45,130
So any, any ways in which genetics in the news if you've encountered it.

647
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:56,239
Yeah. I can't remember how recently it was that I did see a paper turned out that you were apt to

648
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:05,330
Jean showing that it might have conferred immunity to the bubonic plague and that it's possibly

649
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:10,879
that having that to that gene makes you more predisposed to different autoimmune conditions

650
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,959
because your immune system was just better at attacking the plague and it helped you survive,

651
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,550
but it could possibly be related to other autoimmune diseases now, like Crohn's disease.

652
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:25,940
Interesting. Yeah, I never heard about that. But yeah, I'm thinking about I think we'll talk about that idea of, you know,

653
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:32,090
certain genes that people at risk for certain conditions may actually be protective against others.

654
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:35,540
And so evolutionarily, depending on where people migrated from it,

655
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:43,160
maybe it makes sense that they have kind of a lot of that particular LEO Compared to other populations.

656
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,610
Well, it's something to kind of keep an eye out for it if you'd like.

657
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:54,780
And we'll see. Like I said, we'll have a couple of sessions that specifically talk about media coverage of genetics.

658
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:02,730
So that's class participation. Another big part of the course is what we call outcomes read and response.

659
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:11,730
So you'll have, I think, nine opportunities over the course of the semester too, and you have to complete six of these.

660
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:16,830
So the idea is you get some choice, maybe pick the six that you find most interesting.

661
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:21,480
I do ask that you submit it the day before, like the evening before class.

662
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:26,970
So I'd like to take a peek and see what you've written in case so we can integrate it into the class discussion.

663
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,310
So there's a little bit more detail on these,

664
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:36,870
but the idea is the whole class will be reading the assigned materials, but you'll maybe take it a step deeper.

665
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:42,299
And in responding to the discussion questions that I have, you can do more than six.

666
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:47,700
Like let's say you get a four out of five and you're annoyed by that and want your seventh to replace that.

667
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,790
I'm I'm totally fine with that. If if you want to do more than six, great.

668
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,210
But six is the is the bare minimum.

669
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:58,610
And yeah, I tried to have kind of an interesting range. Sometimes it'll be reacting to, you know,

670
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:06,960
a documentary film or sometimes I do have a couple like examples of educational materials like this, your genome website.

671
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:11,100
This one is kind of an online CME program for physicians.

672
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:15,600
It's like a case based. So I think you can still register for as a non-physician.

673
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,980
So some of those you may be like test out those materials and critique them.

674
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:27,330
Anyway, I won't go into all of these details, but again, these will be topics we'll be discussing in class anyway.

675
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:33,600
But the the idea would be you would respond online.

676
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:37,470
I think it's like a 4 to 500 word minimum is the idea.

677
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:42,600
So any any questions on this part of the class assignments?

678
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:51,240
Again, hopefully, it's I tried to set up the canvas site, so it's pretty self-explanatory, a group presentation.

679
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:57,840
So I think with the size of class, we'll probably have maybe like seven or eight group presentations over the course of the term.

680
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:02,249
And on those days, the group will pretty much do most of the class.

681
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:10,469
I'll give you the last hour of class. And so the idea is you research that particular topic, you provide some education to the class,

682
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:13,890
but you're also asked to generate some discussion as well.

683
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:24,299
And so I think this is a good way for you to learn more about a given topic and then to give you some experience in genetics education by yourself.

684
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:34,170
And so you'll also have some choice here. So what I'll ask you to do after next session is to rank order your your favorite topics.

685
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:38,520
But these are the examples here. So again, it kind of runs the gamut.

686
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,879
I do have a document describing these in greater detail.

687
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,530
So if some of these are like, what the heck is cascade screening, you can investigate a little bit more.

688
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:54,720
But what I have you do is after I'll have a form that you'll complete where you can like rank, order your, your choices.

689
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:59,610
And then hopefully most students have gotten like a top two or three choice.

690
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:05,910
I can't guarantee that. But you can also in this, you can make sure I don't let's say, you know, I'm at a conference, I'm going to be out of town.

691
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:10,260
We can make sure we don't assign you for a group on that day.

692
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:17,190
Any questions on the group together and where is the form that you can fill in for that?

693
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,060
It'll be I've got to create it so I'll it'll it'll be coming.

694
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,520
I had one on there but I think was from last year. So I'm going to tweak it a little bit.

695
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:32,580
And I tried to break up. Like I turned out to have three genetic counselors and one.

696
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:37,350
You guys probably get sick of each other after 20 classes together.

697
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:45,180
But I do it by genetic counseling. I try to not have three epidemia. I try to have some diversity within groups.

698
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:54,750
And then finally, because this is a health education class, your final project is to develop a health educational tool on a course related topic.

699
01:13:55,080 --> 01:14:02,129
And so you can be as creative as you want. And I recognize you don't have a huge budget behind you to create something,

700
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:08,310
but the idea is that you're creating some kind of tool that you that through the course you're maybe identifying.

701
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,420
There's a need for this. The current materials maybe have some gaps.

702
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,100
And I'm happy again, like I said, to to meet with you to help develop this.

703
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:24,870
So that's kind of the culminating project. So if there's a and I think it's great particularly for something again, like I said,

704
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:27,690
maybe if there's if we don't get into genetic testing for diabetes enough,

705
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:38,490
you can go deeper on this or if there's another topic that that you want to use this as a jumping off point, you can so there's a lot of resources.

706
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:40,890
I also encourage you to check out on the canvas site.

707
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:51,299
I tried to compile a lot of sites for you that again, might be of interest, whether it's to research a project just more generally.

708
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,520
I know some of you are really interested in this field.

709
01:14:53,520 --> 01:15:01,650
So whether you're thinking about other programs out there, other projects, internships, some of this might also be relevant for that.

710
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:07,450
So anything. On any of these kind of course requirements.

711
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,659
And again, we'll go into greater detail as the assignments come up.

712
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:14,530
But at least wanted to give you that big picture view of what will be asked.

713
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:20,620
Yes. More than 500 words minimum.

714
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:24,910
I think I thought 4 to 5 on your words, I think. Yeah.

715
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,479
I'm not going to like count them all.

716
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:35,260
But, you know, it's pleased to give you something like if you could put in 150 words, it's short and you can go beyond it.

717
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:40,900
But just not don't try not to go like, you know, 3000 words, so at least give you some sense of that.

718
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:47,260
But I'm a huge stickler for counting every word. Okay.

719
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:53,769
Well, so next time we'll be talking about traditional public health genetic services.

720
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,280
We'll talk a little bit about this field, this emerging field of precision health.

721
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:03,129
What I try to do for most sessions is I do kind of post like discussion questions, like,

722
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:08,530
I think I sent that for this just to give you a feel for this is what I'm throw out to you, so you're not taken aback.

723
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:14,650
So that might also be helpful just to review. So you have a sense of what will I pose for whole and small group discussions?

724
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:23,530
And then yeah, if you want to poke around that group presentation topics, that might be useful because then I'll be asking you to list your choices.

725
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:32,530
All right. Well, I think that that does it for today. Why don't we if as you go out, if you can hand in your information sheets, that would be great.

726
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:45,370
And we'll plan to see you next time. Right from the start.

727
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:55,750
How would you like to go home? Including my wife.

728
01:16:56,410 --> 01:17:01,209
And I want you to get there and enjoy.

729
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:07,190
I got to meet that fortune after the meeting on Thursday before he gets his second book.

730
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:22,200
Dreams is like my Bible. I really like to give you an idea that really like more diverse experiences to be able to apply some of this work.

731
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:27,230
So I highly recommend the same thing. Yeah, I think the one.

732
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:34,050
After those days, like Federer's example, I even specialize in tennis without a doubt, he adds.

733
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,770
I mean, there's just so much to run through the athletes.

734
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:44,790
They're people. They look at you, you know, assistant coach.

735
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:49,079
And so there are people who are built genetically to be swimmers but didn't have a work ethic.

736
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:53,520
And there are kids who didn't have a job like that who are pretty darn good working really hard.

737
01:17:54,210 --> 01:18:03,360
So it's just a very interesting event. So I really feel like maybe it was inspired to return to the same capacity to benefit from the World Cup.

738
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:12,059
And that's very important. Not so much about the $10,000, 10,000 our world that they kind of lost,

739
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:19,410
that it's actually really important to say what type of practice you're doing and whether you're actually focusing on the right things at all.

740
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:24,660
So, yeah, well, cool. That's that is I like how I mean, I can.

741
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:30,960
Can you speak to L.A. audience? Um, I also just wanted to talk to you for one second.

742
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,770
Yeah, I think there's a question to answer. Maybe you can just poke around the corner.

743
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:49,920
I'm going to here, and I kind of think this is only going to be something that would apply back towards after like the end of January.

744
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:55,230
Okay. So you're making a resource seminar that no one.

745
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:58,980
So yeah, I'm probably a bit early on that August for many.

746
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,090
Yeah. So yeah, just maybe like that. And you know, it's been a year of just for me.

747
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,980
Yeah, I think that. Yeah, I think you.

748
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,500
Yeah. All right.

749
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:20,540
Thank you. And then sort of again.

750
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:37,160
You know when you that.

751
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,410
I didn't have a problem.

752
01:19:56,730 --> 01:20:00,270
And I agree.

753
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:12,000
Yeah, I understand that you are, you know, the crux of the problem right here that I have, that I'm right here.

754
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:17,940
Fine. A lot of my kids are not trying to be hurt.

755
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:32,760
I hope they're fighting. I think this is a matter of public health and welfare and health and human rights in society and in this country.

756
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,760
But I really am hopeful that I could work it out.

757
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:54,770
But I won't be, you know, at that time.

758
01:20:54,850 --> 01:21:01,670
But I think that the complexities surrounding it is after that.

759
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:10,020
Yeah, right. Right.

760
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:14,549
Yeah. You know, I just.

761
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:40,710
I haven't been there. Obviously I worked hard to make sure that during the day you're not okay.

762
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:44,300
I appreciate you. I want you to see that you're not.

763
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:49,720
You know? Yeah.

764
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:53,400
Yeah. You know what I mean?
