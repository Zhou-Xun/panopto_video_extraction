00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,150
>>Hello? >>Good afternoon, this is April from the pharmacy, could I speak to Faith, please,

2
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,400
>>This is Faith.  >>Faith, I see you haven't picked up your prescription this month, are you having some problems with it?

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,160
>> Are you talking about my Avonex? >> Yes. >> Well, I haven't taken it the last couple of weeks.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,600
To be honest, I took it for a year because my neurologist told me I should.

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,990
But lately, I haven't really seen any reason to continue doing that because I don't feel better and I don't really even think I'm doing that badly.

6
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:48,040
>> Who's your doctor? >> Dr. Livingstone, he's my Neurologist. I think I remember him saying something about it slowing the progression.

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,980
But frankly, April, I don't know what that means.

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,580
He doesn't explain things very well, and if I ask him, he doesn't take the time to answer my questions.

9
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:03,800
>> Have you had any symptoms lately? >> No, not really. >> Do you have any problems taking the drug?

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,920
>> I'm not crazy about taking the shots, but that's not the issue. >> Are you having problems paying for it?

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,970
Because we can help you with that? >> No, my HMO covers it.

12
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,580
>> I'm not sure I understand what the problem is. >> Well, like said, I don't see the point of taking this drug.

13
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,630
What's it doing for me? >> As it says in the patient education you received, it reduces the risk of a second attack by over 40 percent.

14
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,510
The clinical data is very strong. >> Well, now you're sounding just like my neurologist, I still don't understand what that means.

15
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,440
>> Well, Avonex provides a 37 percent reduction in risk of progression to sustained disability at two years

16
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,270
and a 44 percent reduction in risk of developing a second relapse in up to three years.

17
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,210
>> OK. >> Are you interested in reordering your prescription? >> No, not really.

18
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,290
I think I want to think about this for a while. >> It's important that you stay on it.

19
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,360
There aren't really many other options for MS. >> Well, maybe I'll have to wait till something better comes along.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,310
>> My expert opinion is that you stay on the medication until it does. Until newer drugs are developed

21
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,460
this is the best we have. >> Well, that's depressing. >> Well, only if you think about it that way.

22
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,890
>> Yeah. OK. So are we done? >> Unless there's anything else I can do to help.

23
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:22,132
>> No thanks. Bye. >> OK, bye bye.
