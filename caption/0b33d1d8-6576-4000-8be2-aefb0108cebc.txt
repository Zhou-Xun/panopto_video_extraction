1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,610
In October 1783.

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,760
Wasn't that October surprise.

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:36,510
Yeah. I think he's like in relative about like Indianapolis but like really how they talked about that in the beginning and I was like,

4
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,760
what the [INAUDIBLE] don't make sense us. I was just wondering sort of like, seems like how we should go about approaching that.

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,980
Yeah, I guess. Oh yeah. He just so that's not, that's a critical part of this course.

6
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,860
But I think as you're evaluating the benefits of interventions,

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,660
it is important to understand that because you'll be reading about it, I mean, absolute and relative risk reduction.

8
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,120
So there's question about absolute relative risk reductions.

9
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:17,600
And it's not directly important for this class, except it is indirectly important in that you might be reading some literature because you know,

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,780
sometimes you have to be, um, this drug has some sort of absolute risk reduction.

11
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,640
So coronavirus vaccines might have an absolute risk reduction of current symptomatic for, let's say,

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,780
let's say the coronavirus vaccine has an ICU estimate typically might be presented actually in relative risk reduction.

13
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,530
So let's say the coronavirus vaccine has a relative risk reduction of like 80% in hospitalization.

14
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,139
That means whatever your risk is of hospitalization without the vaccine, that'll be reduced by 80%.

15
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,240
So you have 20% remaining risk of hospitalization if you get the coronavirus vaccine 1/2.

16
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,370
So it's important to understand it. But then the question is, what's your absolute risk reduction?

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,940
Well, that depends on what your initial risk of hospitalization is.

18
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:16,889
Now, if you are if this is if this were, you know, a year and a half ago and you are 95 year old person, you know,

19
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,250
maybe your risk of getting coronavirus and being that and being hospitalized is, I don't know, 10%, let's say.

20
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,210
So then then the absolute risk reduction would be going from 10% down to 2%.

21
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,120
So that absolute risk reduction would be an 80% risk group.

22
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,970
Absolute risk reduction, but it's an 80% relative risk reduction.

23
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,750
So it's important to understand these things. And by the way, so these can be risk increases too.

24
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,340
So for, let's say, males in their twenties, maybe you have a.

25
00:02:51,730 --> 00:03:00,400
Two times increase of myocarditis risk if you get the vaccine coronavirus vaccine and that might be a 100% relative risk increase,

26
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,830
relative risk is 100%. But then you have to ask, well, what's my baseline risk of myocarditis?

27
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:12,850
And I'm doubling that. And if it's if it's a very small number than doubling it, maybe it's a big absolute risk increased.

28
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:26,290
So it's one to clarify that typically in the in the in the decision or the the final decision, you're interested in those absolute risk increases.

29
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,600
But sometimes you'll read about things in terms of relative risk increases and say or decreases or reductions.

30
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:38,080
So you want to make sure you understand that. So when you read something that says relative risk reduction or risk increase,

31
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,610
you know how to put that in context and you need to know kind of the baseline in order to understand this.

32
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:56,270
Because things and this goes back also to one of the examples earlier with the some horrible disease and get rid of it.

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,980
And and there was a 200% relative risk increase of heart attacks and strokes and things like that.

34
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,540
So that's that sounds like a big number. And it actually is. But if the baseline risk is low, the absolute increase might not be so great.

35
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,980
Other questions, general, before you get kicked off course, courser.

36
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,600
Yes. It's a little bit off topic regarding the like the fourth COVID booster.

37
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:33,250
What is like what is your understanding of with the cost effect of analysis for us younger folk taking it?

38
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,790
Jennifer Well, so actually part of it depends on how many previous doses you've had.

39
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,090
If you're students here, you probably had to plus a booster.

40
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,960
Although students I think can get waivers might not be everyone.

41
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:58,959
And so you if you think about, well, what's my risk before already having, let's say, three doses and and when say, what's your risk?

42
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,930
There are several things that you might be concerned about. You might be concerned about just getting infected and having symptoms.

43
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:14,470
You might be concerned about adverse, you know, major adverse events like being hospitalized or in the ICU or dying.

44
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,340
And then also, there's a concern about long COVID. So those are all things that you would think about and you think about all the time.

45
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,530
Baseline risk of getting infected.

46
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,370
Given that I already have three vaccines, three doses of a vaccine, let's say, and then if I do get infected, what's the chance?

47
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,820
I'll be symptomatic. And if I do have symptomatic infection, what's the chance I would be hospitalized or in the ICU or die?

48
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,479
And what's the chance I might get COVID? And how do I feel about long COVID versus, you know,

49
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,900
perfect health or death and things like we'll talk next week about quality of life and how you think about those relative health status.

50
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:58,750
And yeah, so you think about, you know, what, what what might happen if I don't get that fourth booster dose,

51
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,020
the new booster dose, and then if I do get the booster dose, what is my risk reduction there?

52
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,500
Now, I should say for everything here we're talking about, there's a lot of uncertainty.

53
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,910
There's a lot of uncertainty even in the base case with just three doses that you have.

54
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,480
What is your risk of all those things? Things like long COVID are kind of new and oftentimes poorly defined.

55
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,200
So it's unclear precisely what that is, what the rates of that then are and so forth.

56
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:31,240
For people in this room, your risk of hospitalization, ICU, death, those kind of things are very, very low for most of you.

57
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,560
I know some of you might have some very specific medical conditions that put you at higher risk, too.

58
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,990
So there are a lot of things going on there.

59
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:46,600
I will say also with the new the fourth booster dose hasn't really been tested in large scale human clinical trials.

60
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,320
And so we really don't know what that risk reduction is.

61
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,840
I mean, you can say, okay, it increases antibody titers by X, but, you know,

62
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:06,070
it's unclear that that that increase how to translate that increase into actual real world risk reductions in terms of getting infected,

63
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,800
having symptoms, being hospitalized, all those kinds of things.

64
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,900
So there are a lot of things that we're uncertain about with that with that for questions.

65
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,800
So you that sort of the framework for how I would think would lead to cost effective analysis.

66
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,120
And there are a lot of things to consider later on in a few weeks when we talk about sensitivity analysis,

67
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,480
that would be a really important part of this because there are so many things that are uncertain.

68
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,630
How does that answer your question?

69
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,049
It sets the framework for how I can think about it.

70
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, that's that's those are kinds of the things that I would I would think about if I were doing that process.

71
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,750
Was there other question, okay, what's going to costing today?

72
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,970
That's a very important part. Of course, this is going to cost is where I am, right?

73
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,130
So today we really focus on cost here.

74
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,760
So there are several things to think about.

75
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,260
You know, in the minutes you watch, you learn about Michael costing and macro costing.

76
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,160
I guess the one thing I'll say about that is it's kind of a continuum.

77
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:17,210
Um, I think in the, in the microwave versus macro costing example, I had an example about, you know, some sort of hospitalization.

78
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:27,180
I call that a macro cost. So if you look at a database and say, okay, what's the cost of this type of hospitalization?

79
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:34,649
And then I said, well, you to also do micro costing. And then you could add up the nurse's time and doctor's time in the ICU time and

80
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,890
the number of Q-tips you used and bandages and stents and all that kind of stuff.

81
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:47,520
So, you know, a nurse time, someone say this is a stroke, hospitalization and, you know, physician.

82
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:59,940
See your time and general word time adding up all those different things so you can add all those things up to get the macro cost,

83
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,349
or you could just grab the macro cost from such a database. But this is really kind of on a continuum.

84
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,909
All of these things are relatively together. So if you are looking at, you know, what's the total spending in the US on health care, a stroke,

85
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,660
hospitalization would be a micro cost that might be added up to the total costs

86
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,900
of U.S. health care and also the micro costing if you know you have a Q-Tip.

87
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,870
Well, you can further wipe across that and say, well, a Q-Tip isn't, you know, 10th of a cent, actually.

88
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,080
There's the cost of the cotton and this and the paper or this.

89
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:40,710
So you could micro cost that if you really need to. And so it's just a question of, you know, where on that continuum do you want to go?

90
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:49,860
Oftentimes, I would suggest, you know, you grab macro costs that are really appropriate unless there's something wrong with that macro cost.

91
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,499
And you need to adjust it because you're talking about a stroke,

92
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,990
hospitalization or a new type of stroke hospitalization where you stay in the hospital for ten months instead of one month and we,

93
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,470
you know, give you a bionic arm or something, you know, so you're changing the characteristics of what that is.

94
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,540
Then maybe you need a microcosm to add the cost of a bionic arm in terms of hospital workers.

95
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,450
Anyway, but so you get some sort of costs. And then we oftentimes have to adjust that.

96
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:27,399
And some of the trickiest parts of costing are in or some of it can be a complex cut, some complex concepts.

97
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,870
Here are the three concepts on a review are the cost to charge ratio, inflation and discounting.

98
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:43,240
So for you guys, I want to ask you, how much is this baby worth or really what is the cost to deliver this baby?

99
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,750
It's got a baby here. This is 2010 in Redwood City.

100
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,979
City, California. No surgeries.

101
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,700
And there was no vaginal delivery.

102
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:07,179
No. Or there were some pain medications, but otherwise uncomplicated delivery.

103
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:16,690
So what's the cost to deliver this baby? If you're like 20, 20,000, something like around $20,000.

104
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:26,070
Any other thoughts? Insurance. I think the average U.S. birth is like $14,000, 1000, 14,000.

105
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,410
The other things is, how would you have to figure out this cost, too?

106
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,769
Well, it's hard to tell. I mean, you could do some kind of micro costing.

107
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:44,790
You can grab some sort of national average. So in this case, the hospital charges was $43,000, but the actual amount paid by insurance was $17,000.

108
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,800
Now, I guess I would argue what the insurance company paid is probably actually closer to the real cost of of delivery.

109
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:03,540
And presumably when the hospital and insurance company negotiate this, the hospital doesn't accept a price that's lower than their cost.

110
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:10,649
Right. So presumably, you know, what they accept from the insurance company is closer to their cost and the charges,

111
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:16,560
you know, the dollar amounts that come on the chargemaster. You know, in my opinion, are really almost kind of a total fiction.

112
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,440
You know, be very careful any time you see the actual charges for for anything,

113
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,430
that's that's something that hospitals kind of make up and in my opinion,

114
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,950
something they they put a big sticker price on something so that when they negotiate with the insurance companies,

115
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,469
the insurance companies think they're getting a good deal when they negotiate, you know,

116
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,410
half off or in this case, more than half of our question, what's like the average?

117
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:51,640
Or would you say what you know is like the the profit margin that hospitals try to charge for like surgeries, procedures and the what were they?

118
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,530
They try to they try to get as much as they can. Yeah. So that's something.

119
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:00,740
But what, what is the average I mean so that you could you could look and they the interesting.

120
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,649
So let me say this so the profit the profit margin per procedure, some procedures might are going to be higher than others.

121
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,240
So, you know, anecdotally,

122
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,230
you'll hear that maybe orthopedic surgery might have higher profit margins than some other more routine surgical procedures.

123
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:25,260
And keep in mind, too, that the profit per per procedure might be high,

124
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,690
but that doesn't necessarily mean the hospital is really profitable because there's a lot of other overhead that they're kind of covering for that.

125
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:39,900
And so yeah, but I don't know if there's a necessarily rule of thumb, uh, profit margin per purposes here.

126
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:50,070
Like cataract surgery is like $1,000 per I usually something around there, you know, with like the O.R. and the anesthesia and everything.

127
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,220
Maybe they spend around like 800, so you make like $200 profit.

128
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,219
So that might be one way of thinking about it. And, and so the interesting thing is, but a lot of these things, too, the question is,

129
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,900
what is our kind of overhead cost in the O.R. and what do we pay the nurses and the doctors?

130
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:15,630
And then how quickly and effectively do these procedures? So, you know, for cataract surgery, there is a hospital called the Urban Institute in India.

131
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:21,900
So they're India and they're able to do these cataract surgeries for like less than $50 a surgery.

132
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,920
Now, of course, labor costs are lower and so forth in India,

133
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,459
but they they're actually they're their outcomes are actually better than they are really in the U.S. And you can support fewer complication rates,

134
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,060
all that up. But they do things very, very differently.

135
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,680
It's very much kind of an assembly line.

136
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,530
I mean, they have you know, they've got this surgeon doing cataract surgery on one patient and then the surgeon finishes,

137
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,650
you switch over to patient two and you're multiple patients in the same room.

138
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,610
They don't switch costs between patients. Now you worry about that.

139
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,920
But actually, their their complication, infection rates are lower than that you see here in the US and UK and stuff like that.

140
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:07,050
But they're, they're, they're machines really in, in, in doing this surgery very quickly, very efficiently and very cheaply.

141
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,440
India's a place that has high prevalence of cataracts, and a lot of people are going blind from cataracts.

142
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,310
So it's really important to deliver cataract surgery. So, you know, millions and millions of people just to avert blindness.

143
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,180
Anyway, this of an eye hospital, if you kind of look them up, they're very well known for providing very high quality and very low cost cameras.

144
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,569
So, you know, the interesting thing is there are ways to to do these things more efficiently.

145
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:40,290
Sometimes, of course, they you know, they'd be breaking a whole bunch of JCAHO rules and regulations if they tried to do that here in the U.S.

146
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,120
I know there are people talking about, you know,

147
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,220
how do we improve the process in the U.S. while still remaining in legal compliance with all the rules?

148
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:57,120
But anyway, just because there's some sort of cost structure today doesn't mean that it couldn't be better anyway.

149
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:04,440
So I'd argue here, you know, $70,000, you know, probably a little bit higher than the cost, but closer to the cost certainly than the $43,000.

150
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,050
But then, of course, that's expensive, California. So let's move here to Ann Arbor.

151
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,780
How about the. This baby here. Born in 2012. And is my hospital over here.

152
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,080
Similar delivery? No, no. No surgeries or anything like that.

153
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:27,620
So how about this one? What do you think that the cost is to deliver the baby here and.

154
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,920
What year did you say this is? 2012 at the University of Michigan.

155
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,250
Yes. Yes. My high school. Right it. 60,000.

156
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,740
Or is a vegetable? Or is it? Yeah. Yeah. No C-section, maybe like 30,000, 35.

157
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,610
So here we have the actual hospital charter still here.

158
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,299
So here we have it in mind. There, they're kind of two sides here.

159
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,910
There's this is the charges here on the on the left hand side. And then this is what is actually paid.

160
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:14,780
They break it up into two sections here. So here we have the hospital and here we have professional sergeant charges for the the physician.

161
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,190
So we'll kind of zoom in here. Let me clear that.

162
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:34,030
So we got about $9,000 almost in in from charges, about $3,000 almost in the physician charges here.

163
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:41,290
And then here we have well, actually, why don't you guys having one of the insurance companies pay that in total for this?

164
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,900
You need to decipher this bill so it's not.

165
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,389
About 7000. Yeah. So it's this insurance payment up here and plus this insurance payment down here.

166
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,290
So a little under $7,000 was the total payment.

167
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,700
Now, actually, this is a little weird.

168
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm in I'm employed by the University of Michigan, has a University of Michigan is paying for my health insurance in Michigan hospital.

169
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,469
It's kind of, you know, you know, the payments going from one pocket to the other.

170
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,620
It's the same conversation kind of anyway. But yeah.

171
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,820
So this is the this is the the, you know,

172
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,250
payment and don't know Fraser says contractual write off because that's the this is

173
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,829
what they the list price wise and then the insurance negotiate lower rate anyway so

174
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:35,330
about $8,000 here but you know so so but also again less than the the charges so be

175
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:43,430
really wary of hospitals so here the kids today doing just fine so why do we use this?

176
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:50,900
Um, actually, so the key thing I want to highlight, though, is just be really wary of hospital charges or any kind of charges.

177
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:01,040
Hardly anyone actually pays the charges. Again, in my view, charges are designed as a starting point for negotiation with the insurance companies.

178
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:08,420
And so if they start really high, then and maybe they think they'll get a better final price they get reimbursed with.

179
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,920
Now, with that said, of course, these really high charges are terrible for someone who's uninsured and doesn't

180
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,340
have the insurance companies kind of negotiating these prices down for them. So that's that's you know,

181
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,550
one of the bigger problems with not having insurance is then you get the bill and you just see this side of the bill here, which are the charges.

182
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,889
And a lot of people who aren't who who are uninsured don't realize actually,

183
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:41,080
if they they want to they can actually try to negotiate these these numbers down as well, Amy.

184
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,879
So that's you know, one of the problems is be really wary.

185
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,430
If you see something about charges, typically that's a number that's kind of disconnected from reality.

186
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:56,600
And so be really wary about seeing charge information and avoid using charge information.

187
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:03,590
If you have if you can, you must use charge. If you don't have anything else, then I would use the cost of charge ratio to adjust.

188
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:13,070
Other questions are it cost charter ratios and some. But the thing that can be sometimes confusing is inflation and discounting.

189
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,050
The way I think about is inflation is used to bring cost for the past up to today,

190
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,240
and discounting is to think about the future costs and turn them into today's present values.

191
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:29,750
And I think most of you have taken it out of a finance class and you learned about net present value and discounting.

192
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,850
Right. Was not about discounting in the past. We just no one had learned about this kind of before this class.

193
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,349
So again, if adjusting for inflation converts nominal dollars from the past into real

194
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,270
dollars today and it takes into account inflation now a couple of years ago,

195
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:58,640
people maybe didn't even know what inflation was because historically in the last 25 years, inflation has been pretty low, hasn't been a huge deal.

196
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,890
But of course, in the last year, we've been hearing a lot about inflation. So maybe you're a little more aware of what inflation really is.

197
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,940
And so, you know, something that costs, you know, $100 a year ago now costs $100.

198
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,010
Things are more expensive.

199
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:20,210
Another way to think, what is the dollar to become less valuable in the last year and what the inflation adjusting is adjust for that.

200
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:28,879
So again, if someone says this procedure cost $100 last year and you wanted to think about what the current cost is of that,

201
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,260
you'd have to translate it into today's dollars and say, okay, that would probably cost $108 today.

202
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:40,340
Now, discounting is a separate step. It's used to think about future costs and how do we think about them today,

203
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:46,370
even just totally disregarding inflation, even assuming inflation did not happen at all.

204
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:54,020
So who would prefer to have? So let's say let's assume that I'm totally trustworthy.

205
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:05,270
And what if I were? Who would prefer to get a $20 today versus $20.10 years from now at 20 or $20 today?

206
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,559
Who would for a $20.10 years? Why don't you prefer $20 when you're still $20?

207
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,580
And let's say I guarantee there's going to be no inflation. I guarantee I'll definitely give it to you.

208
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,580
I'm not going to skip out of town. Why? Why is that?

209
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,520
Oh, because it will bring me utility right now. So my immediate utility payoff is higher.

210
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,020
Yeah. So you get immediate value now, and actually you don't have to spend it now.

211
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,570
You could, you know, keep it in your pocket. And if you if you have an emergency next week, you'd have that available to you.

212
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,170
Right. You could you can use it now if you need to versus if I told you I'm going to give it to ten years from now.

213
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,040
If you have an emergency next week, next month, you don't have that available to you.

214
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,540
So we prefer having resources now to resources in the future.

215
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,990
Was there another comment or. Yeah, I was just going to say, because it's worth once again.

216
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:02,510
Yeah. Now, what if, you know, some of you might have student loans, so you understand this, what if you had a $10,000 debt?

217
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:10,580
Would you prefer to pay the $10,000 debt today? Or would you prefer to pay the $10,000 debt assuming no interest?

218
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,350
10,000 our debt. Ten years from now, we'd prefer to pay the $10,000 today.

219
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,910
Who would prefer to pay the $10,000.10 years ago? Okay.

220
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:26,089
Right. So you prefer to have resources and just think about this as the interest in if you don't pay the $10,000,

221
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,360
say you have those resources available to you over the next ten years.

222
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,710
So we prefer to make payments in the future, as in today.

223
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,610
So there is this time value of money, even ignoring inflation.

224
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,499
We prefer to have resources today than in the future.

225
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,010
And we and if we have to make payments, we prefer to make the payments in the future than today.

226
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,570
So a dollar today is different than a dollar ten years from now or $10,000 today is different from $10,000 one year from now,

227
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,110
ten years from now, 20 years ago. So that's what discounting is.

228
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:04,490
Is it is it's translating our preference for things and making them equivalent to something in the future versus something today.

229
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,790
So now who would not once say, let's go back to 10,000?

230
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,810
Who would prefer to have $10,000 today or $20,000 a year from now?

231
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,450
What's 20? Assuming that it's, you know, guaranteed and trustworthy, that you'd actually get that a year from now.

232
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,460
So who would prefer the 10,000 today would prefer 20000 hours a year from now?

233
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:32,480
Okay, so but now I think a lot of who would prefer 10000 hours today is $10,000 a year from now.

234
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,280
10000 hours today, 10000 hours a year. Okay.

235
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,240
So you prefer to have 10000 hours today to 10000 hours a year from now,

236
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,640
but if it was 20000 hours a year now, you'd prefer 20000 hours and somewhere between ten and 20000 hours,

237
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,340
there's an amount where you're indifferent between having that a year from now and having 10000 hours today.

238
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,840
And that's that's when we know that amount. We can figure out what your discount rate is or your time preference for money.

239
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,770
Now, in this class, we're not going to look at your individual discount rates.

240
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,490
We're going to take a kind of societal level, discount rate of 3%.

241
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,530
And so let's get to some examples here, supposedly.

242
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,900
Yeah, go ahead. Question.

243
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:25,249
So the 3% like discount rate, that's like the sort of general standard is not like just being totally blown up by how crazy inflation is right now.

244
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,440
That like it used to be 3%,

245
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:35,540
but now it's probably going to have to be like 11% because like inflation that that's that's precisely that's precisely a good point.

246
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,280
Here is let's say let's say you have, you know, a 3% discount.

247
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:52,210
I'd call that the real discount rate. So that's that's I really I want to have three, 3% more in real terms next year than I would have today.

248
00:25:53,170 --> 00:26:04,030
But then let's say we have 8% inflation. Inflation expectation for for the next year and so your nominal discount rate.

249
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,150
This would be roughly 11%.

250
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,290
So if I expect 8% inflation, I'm not going to I'm not.

251
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:33,590
And I have a 3% discount rate. If you say, oh, I'll give you a instead of $100 today, $108 next year, you say, no, thank you, I need $111.

252
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:56,930
I need $111 next year. To be equivalent because that's going to take into account inflation and my preference for money in the future versus today.

253
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,410
I mean, technically, it would be 11%.

254
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,390
It would be 8% two times the 1.0, eight times 1.03.

255
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,390
So yeah, 11.1 and $0.12.

256
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:20,210
So that's that would be then if I have 3% real discount, 8% inflation, you know, 11 point something, not all discount rate.

257
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,910
So $111.12 would be equivalent next year would be equivalent to $100 today.

258
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,670
Now some people ask, well, if I think about things in the future, that gets complicated.

259
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:41,240
So think about inflation and discounting and all that kind of stuff. Now the good news is typically in a cost effective analysis, we're well,

260
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,710
if we need to take dollars of the past and put them in today's value, we will we will definitely use inflation to bring it up to today's.

261
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,060
But typically with the cost of our resources, we do not worry about inflation in the future.

262
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,970
Why is it inflation is actually important, but for the purposes of a cost effective analysis,

263
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,310
we're just going to put the real costs in the future and we're not going to discount them.

264
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,920
But then we're also not going to worry about discounting back inflation either.

265
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,790
We're just going to use the real discount rate as well.

266
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,050
So if something if something costs $100 today, we're just going to say, okay, we're going to assume that costs $100 in the future.

267
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,420
We're not going to inflate it because if you inflated it, you're basically multiplying them by 1.8.

268
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,480
But then you have two divided by 1.08 kind of in your in your inflation adjusted discount rate.

269
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,730
So we're just going to use a real we're just going to use the real discount rate for the future,

270
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,409
and then we're going to ignore inflation and ignore nominal changes.

271
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:45,170
And so when we're thinking about the future. Okay.

272
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,550
So let's go back to just think about inflation of bringing dollars from the past up to today.

273
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,910
So let's say an MRI costs $1,500 in 2015.

274
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:04,700
We got some sort of national database that said MRI costs 1500 dollars seven years ago.

275
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:13,110
But as we know, there's been inflation since 2015 to today. So we pulled up some data from the Consumer Price Index.

276
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:19,630
And in 2015, the consumer price index level was 233.7.

277
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:31,810
Today it's 296.2. How would we translate that MRI cost in 2015 to a today's equivalent cost using an inflation adjusted?

278
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,020
Yeah. Up to 96 minus stupidity.

279
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,380
Also to 96. -23 minus two.

280
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:56,780
33 divided by 22 divided by two 3302 hundred.

281
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,120
I mean, that's how we get the the percentage. And so this is the percentage increase.

282
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:13,850
Yeah. So so to 96 minus to 33, it gives us 27 which.

283
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:25,020
63 over 233. So that's a 27% increase.

284
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:38,490
And so you could take that and take the 20 and so you could say $1,500 times one plus the 27% or 27%.

285
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:49,260
Or another way to do it would be 1500 dollars times two, 96 over 233.

286
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:56,610
So this is this is in 20 $15. This is 2020 $2.

287
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:01,850
This is 2015. And so you can do it that way here.

288
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:17,050
So. So that should give us $1,905, I think, or one that doesn't I don't want to optimize here.

289
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,850
So you should be able to multiply by the ratio of what is the what's today.

290
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,010
Today's value over the past value.

291
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,740
Multiply by the dollar on the past and that'll give you today's value.

292
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:52,070
Okay. So just to be fair, my children publicize information about their cost of delivery.

293
00:31:52,340 --> 00:32:01,090
I was at my parents house a year or something, and for whatever reason, my mom had the actual hospital bill from when I was born here.

294
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:07,339
So again, you couldn't now, you probably can't actually, you know, be careful of this here.

295
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:15,739
But here's the total charges. Back in 1975, $538 were the total charges.

296
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,500
Now, in this case, the bill did not list charges versus the actual payment.

297
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
I think maybe I heard have insurance back in the 1970s.

298
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,009
And actually the prices I mean, that's that was a lot of money back then,

299
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:34,399
but not nearly as much as tens of thousands of dollars that you might pay today for delivery anyway.

300
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,459
But they probably, you know, anyway, just pay for it.

301
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,640
Not worrying about insurance or if there were the insurance payment paid wasn't negotiated down from that.

302
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:51,880
Anyway, so here are the RTO charges. Finally, $38 again, a pretty, pretty standard delivery and so forth here.

303
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,260
But now $538 again in 1975 is not five or $38 today.

304
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,500
So if you wanted to try to convert that, you'd need to do inflation adjusting.

305
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:11,030
So back in 1975, the CPI was 52.1 and here in 22 it's 281.1.

306
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:19,760
So how will we convert that here? The 500 cost today is cost in the past year or so, $538 times.

307
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:34,390
How would we convert that? 281 divided by 52.1.

308
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,200
Yeah. The 281 divided by 52.1.

309
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:55,960
Okay. So. That gives us $2,902 or something, I think.

310
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,370
So now that is that's that's a lot cheaper anyway than my kids.

311
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:11,380
So why why that? I mean, one of your doctors, maybe 1975, we're not as well-paid as they are today.

312
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:17,110
Same thing with nurses and the quality of what that procedure was in 1975.

313
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:22,570
Probably very different from the type of care that you receive at a hospital today.

314
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,650
Not saying that my you know, I was born in the back woods in a hut or something like that.

315
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:35,229
But, you know, if and I think the delivery is relatively uncomplicated, but I think, you know, if you have a delivery at my hospital,

316
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,420
if something goes wrong, they have a lot of equipment and facilities and people there to help take care of you.

317
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:49,329
And it's just a much more intense level of potential care that they can provide to you there than maybe in a hospital in Minneapolis.

318
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:59,319
And they need some time. Yes. To in cost effectiveness analysis, do we ever think about like basically that just the health you're talking about,

319
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,620
like technology and sort of like the skills of the people in the hospital.

320
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,810
But I'm thinking more about like hospital consolidation and like the market for hospitals.

321
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:14,709
And certainly that that could affect it too is, you know, maybe the the hospitals back then were smaller and I was consolidated.

322
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:21,130
They didn't have the market power. And so maybe they weren't able to ask for as higher prices as they are today.

323
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:29,380
Yeah. And I'm not sure if if you're you community hospital, maybe it was a nonprofit that wasn't looking to,

324
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,790
you know, you know, extract every last dollar out of the patients.

325
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,800
Or out of the insurance companies that we're covering. Right.

326
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:44,740
You know, again, if the if the fraction of the population covered by insurance in 1975 was much,

327
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:52,660
much lower than the hospitals would have to price things, that would be something that their community could pay for versus today.

328
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,790
You know, the hospitals kind of you know, they can put a, you know, list price chart.

329
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,820
They want to kind of get as much as they can because they know it's not your.

330
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,930
Liquidity is going to allow you to pay for it.

331
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,400
It's the liquidity of Blue Cross Blue Shield that has billions of dollars that's going to be able to pay for it.

332
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:19,430
Anyway. So this is how you would do inflation again. I don't recommend trying to inflate something by 1975 after today.

333
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,250
It's qualitatively a different product, if you will, then, than the product offer today.

334
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:34,459
But I think it is instructive just to highlight that we certainly have a lot of inflation and then a $500 bill is not a five from 1975.

335
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,180
It's not a $500 today. Okay.

336
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,139
Any other questions about inflation or adjusting, as I'll say in these examples,

337
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:50,310
that you the consumer price index and actually there are several flavors of that. It's the Consumer Price Index, all consumers.

338
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:57,479
You can also use the medical version of the Consumer Price Index or use the GDP deflator.

339
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,930
There's nothing if you really interested in that wonky stuff. You know, I've seen some papers look at.

340
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:11,320
To move on to the discounting. So first of all, I guess I just mentioned the 3% discount for a year.

341
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:18,130
That's designed to be a societal level of time preference for things today versus the future.

342
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,370
It's taken from, you know, long, long term historical averages for what Treasury bills get paid.

343
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,560
And the assumption is that this was created and so forth.

344
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:33,760
So the economists think that 3% is about right for society levels of time preference per year.

345
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,600
With that said, there are some debates about that.

346
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:45,159
And so in a cost effective analysis, oftentimes people will vary that down to 0% or maybe up to 5% or 7% very that I think in in Canada,

347
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,590
the recommendation to use three and a half percent.

348
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:54,700
So, you know, this isn't written in stone, that it must be that although if there is anything cross-referenced that's close enough to it.

349
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,780
And so it is during yes, that's it's about 3% anyway.

350
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,390
So what's the present value equivalent of a $10,000 payment that you have to make a year from now?

351
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:14,470
How will we convert that back to a today's value present day equivalent is counting by 3%.

352
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:26,650
So yeah. So how do we discount by 3%? What's the what's the mechanics of the math of discounting by 3% or 10,000 multiplied by.

353
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:37,950
I mean, 13,000 -3% of people. 10,000 -3% times 10,000.

354
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:49,190
Yeah. So that's one way. One way to do it. And basically, that's that's the same as taking 0.97 and multiplying by 10,000.

355
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:00,259
So that's one way to do it is is that discount factor. Technically, the way we usually do it is and it's slightly different here,

356
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:07,850
but it's 10,000 divided by one plus 3% or one over whatever that discount rate is.

357
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:13,790
Yeah. So, so that would.

358
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,120
I would bring things back to one year. But how would two years? What if you had a 10,000 hour payment?

359
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,990
You have to make two years in the future. How would you discount what's the mechanics of discounting now?

360
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:31,040
You do it like I'm compounding. Like by year, by year by year.

361
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,430
Yeah. So it's kind of like compounding. So what would the math be there for that? So.

362
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,820
So let's say so today is today.

363
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,350
One year in the future. We have two years. The future.

364
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:51,719
So it's $10,000 two years in the future. Would it be the 10,000?

365
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,830
And then under you have one plus one plus 2.3% and then you bracket it.

366
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:00,330
But the it's usually like an X or in two.

367
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:10,979
Is that. Yeah, exactly. So if we if you if you bring it back one year, it's 10,000 divided by one plus the interest rate for that.

368
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,180
So that's the discount rate and that's actually to the first power.

369
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:25,770
But if you have to bring it back two years, we just take this amount. We divide by one point, and that's what that was.

370
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:35,280
But then we divide it by one plus hour again, which is the same as one plus R squared for worrying about two years.

371
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,450
We just bring it back. We divide by one plus r squared.

372
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,620
If we have to be back three years, we take the amount divide by one plus r killed by 17 years.

373
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:53,400
Take the amount daughter one plus R to the 17th and bring it back so that many years in the future.

374
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,070
Back to today. Yeah.

375
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,280
So that's kind of how the discounting works.

376
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:10,050
And again, we think about it for, you know, taking costs and benefits in the future and bringing them back into today's present day equivalent.

377
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,430
Any questions about this and discounting?

378
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:26,650
Actually, let me just also think about the way I sometimes like to think about this and was presented is kind of run up on a timeline here.

379
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:39,440
And maybe you have some benefits or costs, you might think about costs and benefits happening over time.

380
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,490
And so we want in the end, we want to be across that net impact or something.

381
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,480
What's the total net impact of your costs and benefits over time?

382
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,760
And we need to make these you to turn these things into a present day equivalent.

383
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:03,400
So some sort of payment or cost where in the future we need to kind of discount that back to a present day equivalent,

384
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,400
both costs and benefits kind of we need to bring it back to some sort of present day equivalent.

385
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,980
So actually maybe ask you guys, so why is this discounting important?

386
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,350
How do you think it might affect our economic interpretation of the value of some sort of health effects?

387
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:34,560
Can you think of any medical or public health interventions that we do where we make an investment today and see a payoff way off in the future?

388
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,700
She's got vaccines. Vaccines? Yeah.

389
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,160
So there are some vaccines like a human papillomavirus vaccine.

390
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,290
Right. So with HPV vaccine, you maybe have a cost today.

391
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,680
And then 40 years in the future, someone doesn't have some sort of cancer.

392
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:09,070
And so you have the benefits of averted cancer. So your HPV vaccine today, you a 12 year old HPV vaccine,

393
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:15,070
and we don't immediately avert cervical cancer or anal cancer or penile cancer or oral cancer, all this stuff.

394
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:22,120
We don't avert that today. Right. No. One, you know, very few if anyone has cervical cancer at age 12 or 13 or 14,

395
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,400
if they do end up with those outcomes, it's in their fifties or forties or thirties or seventies.

396
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,990
Right. And so those averted outcomes are way, way off in the future.

397
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,709
Now, those are certain outcomes that can be very expensive, you know, tens of thousands,

398
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:40,780
maybe $100,000 total cost of care for someone with some of these aggressive cancers.

399
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,380
But that's occurring decades in the future. And we need to think about how do we weigh those things?

400
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:55,630
How do we think about spending tens of thousands of dollars, many decades in the future versus spending, you know, $250 today?

401
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,950
And so discounting how to translate those tens of thousand dollars in the future back to a present day approach.

402
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:12,280
So it takes into account that time parents know now.

403
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,390
So actually the choice of the discount rate can can affect things, too.

404
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,389
You can imagine you can imagine an intervention like HPV vaccination if the benefits occur way

405
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:27,430
in the future and you have a high discount rate like let's say you had a 10% discount rate.

406
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,570
Actually, I'll ask you guys if you had a high discount rate,

407
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:37,210
like a 10% discount rate instead of a 3% discount rate, would that make the HPV vaccination look better or worse?

408
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,460
One vote for worse. Anyone else? Another vote for worse or worse.

409
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,650
So why would it be? Why, if you had a high discount rate, why would that make HP taxation look worse?

410
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:02,860
I think you like spending more. Is it you're spending more today than what would be in the future?

411
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:10,820
Because when you're spending the more today. But really it's stuff in the future, right?

412
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:17,420
If you have a high discount rate, that means things in the future. They don't matter as much to me.

413
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:25,430
They're not as important. And so if I've got this, you know, several hundred dollars worth of vaccine today and yeah,

414
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,470
I'm going to avert some cancers in the future, but it's way, way out in the future.

415
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:34,760
It's not really that important that I value it less the higher discount rate at the the the less important things become in the future.

416
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,340
So if you use a high discount rate, that means things are less important in the future.

417
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,060
And so you're really worried about things today, but you're not so worried about things in the future.

418
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,840
And so that would make HPV vaccination look less valuable because yes, I mean,

419
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,210
some benefits feature, but they're they're being minimized by this discovery.

420
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,139
Conversely, if you had a 0% discount rate or a very low discount rate, and that says,

421
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,500
hey, those costs in the future, they're almost as important as cost today.

422
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:11,070
And so that $50,000 cost of a cervical cancer or whatever is really important and

423
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,690
maybe outweighs the cost of the $500 with the vaccines or whatever I'm doing today.

424
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,940
Actually, I should specify too also that that's cancer in the future.

425
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:26,700
We also have to think about our our decision trees. You know, do you actually get infected?

426
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:31,360
Does that infection mean HPV? Well, I just mean cervical cancer.

427
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,210
All those other things do. And and, you know, HPV vaccination is not a guarantee that, of course, you're going to.

428
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:47,260
Verse. Yeah, but yeah. But anyway, so the discounting though is making things in the future comparable to something today.

429
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,690
And typically we're going to discount that again 3% per year.

430
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:58,780
So the outcomes in the future are not as valuable than they would be if they happened today.

431
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:07,270
Other questions, your comments. Okay.

432
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,270
So after a few examples here of just costing in general.

433
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:19,710
So one of the readings you had today was this article on seasonal flu vaccination for pregnant women.

434
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,360
And in any cost effective and any good cost effective policies, they should.

435
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,260
Describe all of the different costs in a table in the methods section of the paper.

436
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,920
So here we have an example of a table.

437
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:40,140
Table one here. Here at this table is probabilities and cost inputs.

438
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:49,500
And let me kind of zoom in on the cost section here. So we're talking about costs for associated with influenza vaccination of pregnant women.

439
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:54,880
So here we have some vaccination.

440
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:59,780
Well, actually, maybe I'll have you asked me. So what are some of the major categories of costs they include or what are the.

441
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,260
So when you look at this table,

442
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:10,570
what are the things that they included in terms of costs for associated with evaluating the benefits and costs of flu vaccination?

443
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:20,620
What are the things that they thought were important? How well the vaccine works.

444
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:29,890
And then a lot of them or the cost of it, the cost of getting sick, I believe, and then a lot of like side effects for it.

445
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,740
Yeah. So you want to think about in the way if I were to kind of break this into large categories,

446
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:41,890
think about what's the cost of the intervention in this case, the flu vaccination, and then what's the cost of downstream disease?

447
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,000
And so we see that they do have cost of the intervention. That's the vaccine.

448
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:57,480
That's the vaccination cost here. And also the cost of the intervention also might be of adverse event, adverse effects.

449
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,980
So what if you do get Guillain-Barré syndrome or some other costs and so forth?

450
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,670
And that is that is a real cost of the vaccination besides just the cost of the vaccine dose.

451
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,690
And then keep in mind, also, they include the labor to administer it.

452
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:19,259
So a nurse or a doctor jabbing your arm. So we include those costs of the intervention.

453
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:24,210
And again, it should be also of the side effects of unwanted side effects of the intervention as well.

454
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:28,350
And then they have the costs of of disease as well.

455
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:36,050
Now, what are some of the interesting things about the cost of. Of disease here.

456
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,310
Maybe I don't. Maybe this is what interest me. Yeah, well, the campaign is going to cost more than the mother.

457
00:49:52,360 --> 00:50:00,570
I think that's interesting because it's a baby, but it makes sense over the extended time that we're expected to shoulder that.

458
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:09,560
What is the first thing I'll note is this is a this is an analysis looking at the cost effects of vaccinating mothers or,

459
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:17,470
you know, these are these pregnant women. And notice here they have vaccine.

460
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,870
This is not really part of the cost, but vaccine efficacy. They include mother and infant.

461
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,610
So the idea is that if we vaccinate the mother, that will protect the mother, which is good.

462
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:33,970
But also the mother might pass antibodies on to the newborn infant, which would also protect the infant.

463
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,409
And so they're they're actually taking they're looking into the benefits not only to one person,

464
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,650
but also another person here as well, mother and infants.

465
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,459
And yes, you're right, they have slightly different costs for the mother.

466
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:50,410
Infant infant hospitalization might be slightly more expensive than one for the other.

467
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,300
So, yes, I mean, I guess I'm curious, why isn't it like.

468
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:08,860
The pre prenatal care part of that if if this person was hospitalized while pregnant so that they would receive health care and like the.

469
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,460
But a fetus would also receive health care as well.

470
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:18,540
But during. Yes, that's interesting question. Yeah.

471
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,949
Yeah. I mean, you're right. I don't I don't think they included kind of specialized care.

472
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:31,409
So if your. Eight and a half months pregnant and then get influenza and are hospitalized, maybe that type of care would be more intense.

473
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:36,480
And then then just for the random person off the street who gets influenza.

474
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,140
Yeah. Yeah. It looks like they probably didn't include that.

475
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,440
You're right. That that kind of care would be probably more expensive.

476
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:55,260
And although if you, if you vaccinate someone during the pregnancy, um, it's possible that you'd be averting flu while they're pregnant.

477
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:59,280
But also, it's also possible you might be averting a case of flu after they delivered.

478
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,750
So it'd be kind of a mix of, of types of hospitalization.

479
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:09,150
And and this goes back actually almost to the micro cost versus macro costing, I'm guessing.

480
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,469
And look at the details here,

481
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:20,250
but I'm guessing this $14,839 was just a average cost for an adult female being or maybe just adult being hospitalized for flu.

482
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:27,210
And so they maybe didn't make it specific to a pregnant person or someone who had recently given birth.

483
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:33,929
Probably because that data just isn't stored in whatever database. But yeah, that's an interesting thought.

484
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:38,400
Is, is perhaps those costs would be even higher for a pregnant person, you know?

485
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,910
So anyway, there are and I should also mention to here at the bottom we have transportation costs.

486
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:55,950
So that's another thing that they included is some of these other costs of that might be

487
00:52:55,950 --> 00:53:00,569
associated with either getting vaccinated or taking your kid to an outpatient visit,

488
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:04,520
things like that. Yeah.

489
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,180
Yes, no question. What? They do not have the range, the transportation cost.

490
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,900
So that's a good question. I'm not sure why they don't have a range.

491
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,050
So that's that's another important thing I should note about this table here.

492
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:24,760
We have three important columns here at the end where we have the name of what the parameter is and we have a base case.

493
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,620
So that was that the main number that used but also range that they used for sensitivity analysis.

494
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:33,110
A few weeks we'll talk about sensitivity analysis, the part of prospect classes.

495
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:40,009
And so it's a range that we would study or evaluate what if this cost is higher or lower?

496
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,540
This probably is higher or lower and so forth.

497
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:47,210
And then the source of where it came from and yeah, for whatever reason, they don't have a range for transportation costs.

498
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,780
I'm guessing they just felt that that wasn't important to to explore that there

499
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:57,079
was a minor part of the overall cost that maybe the source didn't have a range.

500
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,659
Typically, though, even if the source doesn't have a range,

501
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:03,680
you'd probably make sense to pick a range and just choose something to look at everything else.

502
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:11,059
Going back to the mother house position, they did look at slightly higher cost, at least up to $21,800.

503
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,920
So in sensitivity, Alsace, they did vary that cost up and down to $5,000.

504
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,880
So that would maybe give you a little bit of a sense of how important that would be

505
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,960
to take the overall conclusions about the cost effectiveness of a petrol station.

506
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,380
Yes. So that's those are I trying to, you know, in this study to point out some things related to costing.

507
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,900
I think it's important to think about the cost of the intervention.

508
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:41,090
Also costs of of negative effects of the intervention downstream like the adverse events.

509
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:46,850
Important to think about the direct medical costs, but also some indirect costs like transportation.

510
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,129
And also important to think what the downstream cost effects of the intervention.

511
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:58,550
So if someone if you do vaccinate someone they might not get hospitalized or might not have outpatient visits,

512
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,870
they might not have to buy Tylenol or over-the-counter medications.

513
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,130
So one of those downstream medical impacts of the intervention and what are those costs?

514
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:14,000
And this is an interesting case, too, where they think the cost is not only to the person that to whom the medical intervention is delivered,

515
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:23,360
the pregnant person, but also the infant. So they're looking at both of those things and, you know, a lot of different things.

516
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,829
Yeah. Any questions? And one last thing,

517
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,399
I just want a second paper you write for Che was the one by Kim and I'll look

518
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,150
at the perspective and think about that for costing cost effective analysis.

519
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,930
And I know some of you work in your projects or thinking about, well,

520
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:48,210
should we do a societal level analysis, should we do it health care system or payer perspective analysis?

521
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:55,260
And this is just showing a few things about just cost effectiveness analyzes in general over time.

522
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:02,700
So there are various that bars are the number of cost effectiveness analysis performed or published in different years.

523
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:13,500
And what we're showing here though, too, is that the sector stayed kind of consistent here, the fraction of analysis taking a certain perspective,

524
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:19,379
and you'll see that, you know, about 80% of these analyzes 70,

525
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:23,850
80% of these analysis typically would take some sort of health care sector or payer perspective.

526
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:31,380
And about 20 to 30% might be taking a societal perspective in the United States.

527
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,889
And I guess I should say, know typically in this class, I'll recommend one of these two perspectives.

528
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:42,540
And that's kind of the actual actual new recommendations,

529
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:49,079
newest recommendations in the United States are to do both in a cost to make themselves as both a societal and a health care perspective.

530
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:57,090
Analysis on some countries, like in the U.K. and I think Canada, to also actually encourage the health care sector perspective.

531
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,639
So that might be and most analysis, if you read them and they say they're taking a societal perspective,

532
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,880
oftentimes they are really mostly taking health care sector perspective, which actually isn't too far off.

533
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:11,400
Oftentimes, the health care sector is a majority of the costs anyway.

534
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:17,399
Yes. Why why would in those two I mean, just in those two countries in particular,

535
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,650
versus like any other country that has like closer to a universal health care system that we have,

536
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:27,570
like why would they encourage health, like looking at it from the health care sector perspective?

537
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:37,260
Yeah. So my understanding you're in the U.K., for example, is that they are thinking about this in terms of their national health service budget.

538
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,830
And they want to say for our National Health Service budget,

539
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:47,040
what's the biggest bang you can get in terms of health for that national health care service, NHS budget?

540
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,530
And so there so they're not going to look at the impacts outside of that.

541
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,610
You know, I would argue that's maybe a little bit shortsighted because if you do something that

542
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:01,319
saves the criminal justice system some costs or saves a lot of people out-of-pocket costs,

543
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:06,630
that's also valuable that if you're a government organization, you should be concerned about that as well.

544
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,169
But that's kind of how they started their analysis.

545
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:16,380
And I think part of it, just maybe historical how they well, they did I will say health care sector analysis a little bit easier to do.

546
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,190
You don't have to think about all these other things outside of the health care sector as well.

547
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,280
You know, in defense of that, though, I mean, most health and public health interventions,

548
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:31,050
you know, 90 something percent of the costs really will probably be in the health care sector.

549
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:35,850
But sometimes there are things outside of that in terms of productivity where where,

550
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,970
you know, it could be a substantial part of the overall benefits of an intervention.

551
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:53,630
So here are some other issues. Just another graph from that, showing a sense of the fraction of studies that included different types of costs.

552
00:58:54,660 --> 00:59:02,540
And so it's not too surprising to see that direct medical costs related to that disease are included.

553
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:09,650
I should comment. But what's I guess we have direct medical costs and we have future medical costs.

554
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,170
And you can see how they're related and unrelated.

555
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:24,350
And the distinction there is what's considered related are things that are directly downstream or again, related to that disease.

556
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:32,960
Now, if it's something like a flu shot, it would be a flu hospitalization or a influenza outpatient visit.

557
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:39,860
If it's diabetes, it could be heart attacks and strokes and amputations.

558
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,170
All those things that blindness that are related, potentially related to diabetes,

559
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:52,030
future medical costs, unrelated are just general costs of health care.

560
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:55,510
However, if you're doing an analysis of some sort of diabetes drug,

561
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:03,670
an unrelated medical expense would be breaking my leg or getting cancer, things that would be unrelated to diabetes.

562
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:11,730
And there's a little bit of a debate within the cost effective kind of economic community about whether those kind of costs should be included or not.

563
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:19,690
So if you have some sort of intervention that you know. Let's say it's the stopping people from falling over and dying immediately.

564
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:24,010
Dropping dead. Intervention. Okay. What if you stop people from dropping dead?

565
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,320
Now they're alive. And then they get a runny nose and go to their doctor and they break their leg and they

566
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,220
go to the hospital and then cancer and they have tens of thousands of medical expenses.

567
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,200
So those would be kind of unrelated to tripping and falling and dropping dead.

568
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,179
But some people would argue that those long term medical costs should be included.

569
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:51,190
Other people argue they shouldn't. I think the consensus is that they probably should be included as well, but that isn't done very frequently.

570
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,530
Anyway. Big picture here.

571
01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:04,190
Most of the cost in a cost effective analysis are these direct and future medical costs that are related to that, that intervention.

572
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:13,520
But some other I mean, I would argue some of these things here are very important, but oftentimes they're not included in cost effectiveness analysis.

573
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:20,450
Now, some sometimes in intervention might not affect productivity or caregiver time or patient transportation or patient time,

574
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:21,560
patient out-of-pocket costs.

575
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:29,540
So maybe sometimes it's appropriate not to include those things, but just keep in mind that very few cost benefit analysis do include them.

576
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,060
And if you're reading one and you think that that should be included, that might be an important information.

577
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,140
But again, it depends on the type of intervention and whether you think it really does affect productivity.

578
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,309
Things like caregiver time maybe doesn't impact a lot of things,

579
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:51,880
but for some other things like dementia care, things like that, maybe caregiver time really is important.

580
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,100
Yeah. Is there a comment or question? Yeah.

581
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:04,059
I was curious for the peers doing cost benefit analysis for their to analyze their own future savings from intervention.

582
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:09,880
Now, would they typically incorporate the fact that a lot of patients would leave their

583
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:14,710
insurance coverage and then the benefits would occur to a different insurance company?

584
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:21,100
Yeah. So going back here to this this health care sector size payer perspective, typically in those analyzes,

585
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:25,780
we assume that it's going to be the same payer for the rest of that person's life.

586
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:31,840
Now, in reality, you're right, especially here in the United States, people switch payers all the time.

587
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:39,070
I think the average amount of time someone's on insurance here in the United States is maybe 3 to 5 years, and then they switch plans.

588
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:48,640
So and so, as you rightly point out, that does change the incentive structure for insurance companies.

589
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:57,470
If I am an insurance company and I know on average the people I cover are only going to be with my insurance company for 3 to 5 years.

590
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:05,670
And if there is some sort of intervention that averts outcomes in ten years or 20 years, I'm not going to see that payback.

591
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:13,549
And so that is going to be less kind of financially relevant to me as a private insurance company,

592
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:18,560
for example, if there's a lot of churn, if not a lot of people switching insurance companies.

593
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,820
So that does certainly affect the financial incentives of insurance companies.

594
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:31,280
Now, you know, in most pretty much every cost effective analysis I have seen that's been published kind of academically in a peer reviewed literature.

595
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:38,390
No one includes that. No one looks at people who are dropping off of plans.

596
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,600
What they might do is they might look at a short time horizon.

597
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:47,690
So they say, let's look at this new diabetes medication and we'll only look at a five year time horizon for something.

598
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,020
So that's one way you might kind of look at it.

599
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:56,390
Now, I don't know if kind of behind closed doors within the insurance companies, if they do that, they probably do.

600
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,870
I think I mean, I think you probably be responsible for them to do that.

601
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:09,889
And look at what do we think the net financial impact of this intervention will be on us, given that a lot of our of our patients that we cover,

602
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:15,110
that we give this new prevention to, you know, might not be part of our insurance plan five or ten years from now.

603
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:20,530
So we won't see the benefits of that. Yes, just building off of that is I wondering if,

604
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,930
like insurance companies have also a different set of incentives because they

605
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:28,819
know the vast majority of people will roll on to Medicare at 65 or whatever.

606
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:34,040
So it's like it's not very cost effective for them to invest in like prevention

607
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,509
stuff if it's a disease that almost only hits older people because they're like,

608
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:42,649
it's not our problem. Like, we don't have any skin in this game. Yeah, well, that's absolutely true.

609
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:46,070
Yeah. If you are if you're a private insurance company and you know,

610
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:52,310
you're covering people who are in their fifties and early sixties and you know that they're going to be on Medicare at age 65,

611
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:58,880
then you have a lower incentive to invest in prevention for those people.

612
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:04,730
And when I say prevention and vaccines, where things like taking statins to prevent heart attacks and and so forth,

613
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:11,720
you have less of an incentive to do that because that's not a cost that you incur after age 65.

614
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:20,530
So that certainly is my take on market inefficiency or how how things are organized here in the United States.

615
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:27,430
And I will say, you know, so that's one reason why people think that some kind of universal payments are good.

616
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,210
And actually, it's kind of interesting cases in Israel.

617
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:35,680
They actually do have private health insurance companies who cover people.

618
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:43,720
And I think there are about four of them. And my understanding of it is that when people join a certain insurance plan,

619
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,680
for whatever reason, I'm not really sure why they stay with it through their entire life.

620
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:54,370
They never switch, really, or very rarely switch. So that then does a better job of, I think,

621
01:05:54,370 --> 01:06:00,519
aligning the incentives between the insurance company and the patients does a better job anyway in terms of making sure that

622
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,860
that insurance company is really invested in investing in that patient and keeping them healthy throughout their lifetime,

623
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:11,650
versus say, hey, this person's old, they're probably like 65, that it's someone else's problem.

624
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:20,079
Also, they also have really great longitudinal data on their patients with the oftentimes they can do really interesting studies of

625
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:29,920
longitudinal disease progression and effective things because they have these patients in their insurance systems for decades.

626
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:38,250
And so they can really study what happens to their kids. So anyway, yeah, there's some interesting things that are the impact of, you know,

627
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:44,230
against patients switching between insurance payer companies and then also switching to Medicare and age 65.

628
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:48,430
That kind of change the financial incentives for these insurance companies.

629
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,500
And so then there are some interesting policy questions about how should that be resolved.

630
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:58,270
And so one solution, of course, is kind of single payer. Another solution is maybe Medicare.

631
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,370
If you stick with a private health insurance company, Medicare or someone else,

632
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:10,989
probably Medicare gives some sort of incentives to private insurance companies to invest in prevention in people in their

633
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:18,580
late fifties and early sixties so that they will be well prepared and well cared for when they transition under Medicare.

634
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:25,600
Another commenter I was. I know.

635
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:36,100
I like the. So we're also going back to that health care sector or payer perspective.

636
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:44,110
The U.S. doesn't have really many no official guidelines about how these analyzes should be done.

637
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:49,510
But you'll see here the health care payer or health care sector.

638
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,470
Most countries around the world are recommending that that be the perspective.

639
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,460
The health care parent health care sector are pretty similar, kind of very minor differences.

640
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:09,100
I guess the payer is off the hook for any co-pays that people might have, but pretty much that they're pretty similar.

641
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:14,440
And then there's this societal level analysis and you'll see here, Canada healthcare payer.

642
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,620
Mexico health care payer. Anyway.

643
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:26,029
So most countries here are healthcare payer perspective, even many in Europe or health care payer or health care sector,

644
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:31,050
although there are some that have this brown societal perspective recommendations.

645
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:46,350
Any questions? So the perspective will affect kind of what types of cost you want to include in the analysis.

646
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:51,570
Health care sector, I think it was recommending it for some of the groups. For your class projects.

647
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:58,800
It might be easier to start with a health care sector perspective analysis and just look at health care costs, health care sector costs,

648
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:04,799
and don't worry about productivity cost or don't worry about if we give this intervention to people,

649
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,400
will they're less likely to commit crime and the criminal justice system or whatever else.

650
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,470
Just really focus on health care sector costs. That's probably a good starting point for this class.

651
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,390
Kind of keep your projects with a smaller scope so they're manageable throughout the semester.

652
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:24,809
But if late October rolls around, November rolls around and you say, Wow, that was so easy to do.

653
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:28,080
The health care sector perspective twiddling my thumbs. I've got a lot of time on my hand.

654
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:34,380
If you're up to it, then you could. If you want to kind of expand your analysis and start adding some of those societal costs,

655
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:38,190
I'd be kind of my recommendation for you as you're thinking about this spring practice.

656
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:45,410
So that was really all I had for costs.

657
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:48,140
Today, I want to leave some time for you to work with your project if you want to.

658
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:51,830
Actually, before I get to that, though, does anyone have any other questions about costing?

659
01:09:55,070 --> 01:10:03,800
You know I mean it's called your project worked on so that and so I will post and I also maybe send out an email about those Zoom links for next week.

660
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:11,510
Actually, we'll talk about quality adjusted life years and how do we measure health quality like all that good stuff.

661
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:14,840
That's one of the more complex concepts in this class. We.

662
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:21,050
So thanks. We will stop talking here and let you guys talk to your groups.

663
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:30,530
And I'm up here fielding questions and of oh, producers.

664
01:10:30,780 --> 01:11:02,320
I wanted to tell you this is something that I mentioned earlier in the day, because I know that there's always something more than 3 seconds ago,

665
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:13,019
because what happens is that last night our apartment was like a chic pyre, and I was.

666
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:21,960
So I guess I understand what that means.

667
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:40,680
Yes. Yes. It's nice that they had to know I live here.

668
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:46,629
I don't know what that means.

669
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:56,140
My my my first thought was for instead of saying this surgery is absurd.

670
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:22,210
Yeah, I know. That's true. That is it's sort of like this would be much easier to attract new customers because, you know, for me,

671
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:37,660
this specific I mean, I usually like a smart girl right now because it's such a huge difference.

672
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:54,340
And we're probably just saying it was one of our really interesting answers to everything else, which is we're trying to get it right.

673
01:12:55,270 --> 01:13:02,020
And I guess there are others who like to go to work, like, what are you doing right now?

674
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:08,500
You know, I don't know. What do you do in life?

675
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:18,370
You should have a plan. Your stuff that goes to your insurance plan, you kind of think about it because it's going to change something different.

676
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:28,580
It might be more expensive, but once it becomes an exception to that, people can buy shares in the last four years.

677
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:42,580
Yeah. So I think they give a good deal of the cost.

678
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:44,340
They don't want to have to because like we'll be able to everyone.

679
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:56,559
Yeah, but you know, I feel like my cancer is in there and their thing is they might get a lot of surgery,

680
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:18,130
but not until maybe the other one's going to be able to say, Oh, it's really like having your first presentation, Superman, take a loss on aspirin.

681
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:26,050
Like your nearest hospital might actually get to know what it costs.

682
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:37,260
I mean, that's their job is to go to other industries and really know that there's no diseases or not even there.

683
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,159
First diagnostics.

684
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:49,560
I actually had an insurance guy from the application and he was bragging that their insurance company negotiated these arrangements.

685
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,100
And also, I think it was going to be, you know, it's convenient.

686
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,350
I don't even know what it is.

687
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:06,580
I mean, I know that earnings are lower than their costs, and I think about that to be true.

688
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:15,700
But before she was only waiting for the teachers comment.

689
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:22,270
I don't know. Like I it's more like I wouldn't be here physically.

690
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,250
Okay. Yeah.

691
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:34,750
I mean, I actually I would say you should have a laundry list.

692
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:44,229
I think I don't know if it's if it's probably a 60 year old.

693
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:50,200
Sometimes I think, you know, I've never seen actually a bunch of side effects.

694
01:15:50,950 --> 01:16:09,350
I just want to say that I'd like to start with something else where it's, I think some sort of surgery or high value to make sure I feel like this.

695
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:18,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

696
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:22,670
That's also easier. But then meet your wife next to me.

697
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:27,579
We're also going to see what I mean.

698
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,580
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

699
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:35,650
Who's going to prove it? Sounds fun.

700
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:41,910
The insurance companies do care how rusted in the background.

701
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:51,430
I know. Incredible thing. And then we go to the chat and see what they decide to do is get more complicated.

702
01:16:52,180 --> 01:17:11,270
But I don't think I mean, there's all these it's hard to get us because I just did not get how they do everything in class.

703
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:17,379
Yeah, I just wish I could do what?

704
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:23,709
It feels bad. That's great. That's good.

705
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:28,840
I just had a fellowship radio show, so.

706
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:34,510
Thank you. Fingers crossed, which is really interesting.

707
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:56,650
Sometimes it was like they just don't get the message that was.

708
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:03,240
I just thought it was a sweet deal.

709
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,300
I don't know why they said it at all, except for what it was like.

710
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:18,020
Okay, well, you already started. I started listening and connected to what I'm doing.

711
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:33,510
I want you to have something that nobody wants to hear in its current practice, but not anymore.

712
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:45,740
You just do whatever makes the most sense really isn't one sentence.

713
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:54,260
So we walked through. You know what I mean?

714
01:18:54,510 --> 01:19:05,220
What? I would like to ask you to do something a little funny, Billy.

715
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:12,790
Like if everybody was running on basic things, like for.

716
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:19,109
Like, everybody wants us to think that whatever.

717
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:33,990
We don't have any of structure or shall we find interesting.

718
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:43,820
It's. So yeah, we're working on that.

719
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,870
We just laid out really just the bad or, you know, the bad things.

720
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:57,720
And you're. You're talking about.
