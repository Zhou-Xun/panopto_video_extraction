1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:09,420
Oh, gee. And then we should go to the gym, too, you know?

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,160
Oh, yeah. And that's going too far to the right.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,720
And then I think it might be a good one.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:31,820
Okay. If you if you just yesterday I just went to the multipurpose rea.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:58,100
It's just kind of, you know, I think I just need to go get over the shops and I feel like she's just, like, super busy shopping.

6
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,950
Yeah, you just don't can make a difference.

7
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,150
I just didn't work, you know, exposed to that.

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,170
I'm starting to disagree. Just. Okay, there's appetizers.

9
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:32,730
So. So the idea is that.

10
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,730
That's the way. That's the way. Oh.

11
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:55,280
So I was like, you know, when she was at my and I was like, I don't know, I was talking to some other issues that are my way as a mutual.

12
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,230
Oh, she did. And I don't know. And you can do it.

13
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,960
Yeah. Yeah, I no, I was like, I was going to.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,190
Where did you get here? I was going to bring you like I actually like that's what you were saying.

15
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:26,970
You're like, yeah, but all of my there was like, yeah, like more like,

16
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:35,040
I don't know because I was like anything from like that's I was going to be dressed like all day because I know,

17
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:48,570
like, I kind of just think of it as I think it's just like you didn't really just write something like, I know.

18
00:02:49,110 --> 00:03:02,950
So I don't have to think about the structure of the take a lot of people on a personal level, just the location of what I did before,

19
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:24,970
I was kind of thinking like, you know, like, did you see like I shouldn't be trying to think through my numbers just somehow, you know?

20
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,440
I know she's doing it. Yeah.

21
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:40,590
Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I have I have to tell you, it's like everyone else.

22
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,850
They love life. Like, oh, my God.

23
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,790
It's it's just like.

24
00:03:47,820 --> 00:04:00,420
Oh, like, it's all going to be like, if you want more food, it's going to be hard on all the food that they took away as consumers last night.

25
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,360
So, I mean, like, oh, this guy's a great kid.

26
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:24,209
Or did you talk to any of those? I talked to the one who thought, wow, I think I'm like, I'm going to meet you in the morning.

27
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,760
Everyone gets conscription is the greatest thing on the list.

28
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,280
Let's continue our conversation around decision analysis with the same thing and

29
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,210
still who believe that we are going to finish the problem that we started last time.

30
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,280
And then you have another problem. I'm going on.

31
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,570
You're on and on. So I also posted homework.

32
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,730
Excuse me. And and they are so.

33
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,870
The statements that I have informed and I will be criticized for that.

34
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:23,540
So you remember what we did last time was to build a payoff table and we'd be left of table with the entries by by creating a

35
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:35,180
formula and general formula for the number of stocks of the machine that you would store and then the units that machine demanded.

36
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,310
Right. So that those are the state of nature and those are the probabilities of this data.

37
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:52,549
And we so the parameters of that problem was that you have you you it costs you $20 per machine,

38
00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:01,500
but you can rent that out for $100 per machine is that you have a profit of $80 and revenue

39
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,790
of painting or export per machine that you read if you was told that ahead of time.

40
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:18,079
But if you have to write the day you add it, it will cost you 150, but you still have to sell it by a hundred.

41
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,870
So you are losing 51, right?

42
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:34,810
So it's been depending on how much, how many you just talk in advance and how many units you you are requested in the future.

43
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,990
Then you have your, your pay when you add your unit profit here.

44
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,810
And we did that with a two way table in Excel.

45
00:06:48,300 --> 00:07:03,570
Right. So. If you remember, I recommend that you try to wait tables and how to do and to wait tables.

46
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,350
Those are going to be useful for you in the future.

47
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:15,930
But if you remember, what we did is we created a number of possible units, stock of the possible units of demand,

48
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:24,000
and created a general formula here, the total revenue we have to satisfy that demand.

49
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,960
So the total revenue is then the unit cause that you need revenue.

50
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:36,030
So three times the demand, the total cost is have to be divided into two parts,

51
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,330
one of the appropriate with our costs and those are to say calls, right?

52
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:47,850
So the regular call is going to be this line time unit cost for you.

53
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,240
If you place that, you order those given in advance.

54
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:01,890
And then if there is a shortage of units, people demand more than what you have.

55
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,120
You have to rush order of each.

56
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,580
So these extra courses date or.

57
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:18,939
Yeah. Big surcharge or new costing, the average American closes.

58
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,900
What is the. I'm not saying this shortage.

59
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,720
This is actually going to be the maximum, the demand minus the supply.

60
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:36,520
Right. This is when you start this is where you are and this is what you people what people want is that he's going to be doing it,

61
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:44,110
which you're sort of taking. But you don't want this. Do you compute a negative shortage because that's zero.

62
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:53,380
So that means if you have a demand and supply some greater, the demand is simply I going to,

63
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,940
you know, get extra supply that you're not going to be able to sell that that's it.

64
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:11,170
But it's not a negative shortage. So what what we need is that we compare to the be positive, short and zero and ask which one is greater.

65
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:19,389
Right? Or did or did these formula we zero and we find we ask which one is greater.

66
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:26,890
So a correct and if it is is positive is going to be greater than zero.

67
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,370
So you're going to get that number. So if it is this number is -0, it's going to be greater than that.

68
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:40,480
And then you get zero. If they're the same those in line, right, you will take zero.

69
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:51,160
So that's the point. And then that total, total you might ask is is it pay you?

70
00:09:51,700 --> 00:10:01,400
What you need to do is get either you you create all this formula I'm put in here, you simply referred to these formula and put it here, right?

71
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:08,470
So it is equal to payable. And I can do that because I label that to say I'll pay you.

72
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,220
Right. So is there. But I'm blanking it out so.

73
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,409
So we don't have to see it. No need to do that.

74
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,490
The formula there I'd like, you know, by changing the font.

75
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,340
Right. You.

76
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:41,700
I mean, so this is the background, Paula, of the phone calls on they found for reporting, right?

77
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:50,760
Right. If you want to see the number is there, you know, ten different photos, -120 there, but I keep it white.

78
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,630
So in many years, we think with the background. So you don't see.

79
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:04,470
Right. And then what I did is I, I like that I selected the whole table without the labels.

80
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,260
Right. But you need. You need the.

81
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,460
The numbers or the supply of the numbers or the demand.

82
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,510
And then I'm going through all the data. And then after data, I'm going to do what is.

83
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,470
And so I'm going to data. Sorry.

84
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:42,399
And then I'm going to go into what is analysis and band aid and people is is asking me okay all these numbers the numbers in in there in this row,

85
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:51,250
where are they going to be put in that spreadsheet? I want them to be placed in there, in here, this scale.

86
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,100
But people these imagine so I would imagine they are.

87
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:10,390
So I can use you know, find them and or we can click on this one so you will see them and the column on the right,

88
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:18,790
where do you want these all these numbers to place those numbers correspond to this line, which is the same here.

89
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,500
So I can either click I know I'm going to do that now.

90
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,430
So you can see I can either clean there or all of that. So glide.

91
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:42,810
The same thing is when I return to that sale and if I hit enter, then I will get my my payoff date, I get my pay off.

92
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:54,190
Facebook tells me I know, for example, I have I have five units stock and people want one unit.

93
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:01,509
So I am only losing $50 for four.

94
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:09,820
So that's got me on there that I'm that amazing and I am going to be making with one.

95
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:40,750
You're going to be making just $100, right? The revenue is going to be I approach one of those or in I very I I getting one unit right.

96
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:52,620
I'm getting one unit and I'm losing four guys unit and I'm not losing I'm making $80, right.

97
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:03,490
Or when the unit that I that I'm getting and then for the all their units they are for I'm you're losing $20 each.

98
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:11,360
Right. And $80 because I, I framed in the worry itself is 80 was 80.

99
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:18,550
And that's what you have to do. So it's spell check to see if this is correct.

100
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,080
Oh, so this is where we start right now.

101
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,560
Let's continue the problem and say.

102
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:51,270
Singer. And it is it's really painful.

103
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,730
So that's it. So we constructed the pain of making excuse me and my own decision problem.

104
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:06,379
And then how many units with a pessimistic decision maker on and how many units an optimistic

105
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:12,980
decision maker and how many units should we only for wish to maximize expected profit?

106
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:21,790
So it's telling you first assume that you don't know the probability and optimistic criterion and vague and pessimistic idea.

107
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:30,890
And so let's use maximize our maximally optimistic one and then we use the third one in party line.

108
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,940
So for maximum x, let's do of these criteria here maximize.

109
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:53,530
Not mean. So I.

110
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:09,150
EMV. So for the Maximus criteria, what do I need to do?

111
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:16,260
So let's say that premise. I don't know anything about the probabilities of the fate of nature,

112
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:26,520
but I want to make the decision that will allow me to make the best possible profit for the largest profit for me.

113
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:36,899
So I don't care about much about losing money or always or smaller payoff if I have the opportunity to win.

114
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:44,100
If I win, we meet. So it's an optimistic criteria because you can represent these.

115
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:52,830
Okay, I am lucky. Nature is in my favor and whatever I decide, right?

116
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,810
Nature is good and present a good scenario for me.

117
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:06,900
So and so I'm going to try to maximize that, that love that I think and decide to get that which is income.

118
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:21,420
So what you do is you simply take the maximum of each decision, the maximum penalty, each decision,

119
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:33,280
and then out of all these maximum, then you pick which one is the largest and the largest is this one is five units.

120
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,350
So because it will allow you to get $400.

121
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:44,370
So this number here is what you use to determine that five you and your maximum.

122
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,780
So now if you want to have the opportunity to maximize your profit,

123
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:08,199
you go for five units that you don't five units and you know, they do you you have you know,

124
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:21,180
you can have $400 available right now if you are risk barriers like most people are is not you know what,

125
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,030
you don't have any idea of the state of nature.

126
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:34,060
And you you want to prevent, you know, big losses, like losing $250 or $200 a year.

127
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,600
Right. Or getting it in May of zero of their all of your your work out your net.

128
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,290
You say then you you think, you know, what's the worst that can happen in any situation.

129
00:18:47,290 --> 00:19:01,410
So you you look at the meaning of all these entries and.

130
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:14,160
And then once you get the minimum of all these entries, you look for the maximum, right?

131
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,650
The maximum here was 40.

132
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:30,760
Okay. So the. So if you go for the number two is to use the worst that can happen is that you lose 40.

133
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,090
So in all those, you kind of look to 50 on there.

134
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:55,450
I think the here book, the best of the less dominant, you know, of this possibility is going to be over to you in your head.

135
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:06,310
And this is that this is going to be is talking to you and it is going to be your maximum for your maximum criteria.

136
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:16,800
Right. Your mathematical choice. So that means that I don't know what coming up in here, but I'm going to start to write.

137
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,610
And the worst that can happen is I'm going to be losing 40 everything.

138
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,860
Now you'll get me for the possibility of losing which one.

139
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,340
And I don't want that to be.

140
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:41,310
Now, if you know and in most of the cases you're going to have these numbers or any of these number that you're going to use,

141
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:50,350
you are going to wait every decision or the payoff for every decision with the probability of copies.

142
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,530
And it looks like a weighted average of all these different tables.

143
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:04,540
And that's expected at any time, you know, when this expansion of your earnings is going to be.

144
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,850
And this is equal to some of.

145
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:24,240
She wants. The sum of the probabilities.

146
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,840
And those probabilities must be. And of course you can call me that.

147
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:51,060
And then times first that role that responded to a stocking zero unit and then you get one 42.5 was the first one and we go down and you get that day.

148
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,130
And the one that maximizes perspective monetary value is doubling for you.

149
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:02,579
It's a lot which is gave you $190 of expectation.

150
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:10,680
So if you have these probabilities and you want to use this probability, it should use as more information.

151
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:17,300
Then you will go for stocking for units of the machine.

152
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,490
That's it.

153
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:35,150
That's. That's what they made their model required out of the problems we were.

154
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:42,630
So if you were asked, for example,

155
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:51,030
how much would you pay to hire someone to have the exact information about how

156
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,680
many young people are going to the man before you make the decision to stop?

157
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,020
Right. This is computing, baby. And you can compute an EVP.

158
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,910
I mean, it's been pretty much the same thing, but including Third Way,

159
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:15,030
once you compute the expected opportunity loss and meaningful in the spectrum of your expected value of perfect information.

160
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:23,590
And the other one is you compute the MVP and subtract that from MVP.

161
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:33,149
So what we do with that case, and I've told you the MVP AI is equal to the maximum.

162
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:39,770
So equal to the maximum. I'm interested in each column.

163
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,300
I mean, what's the best that can happen? It's all of these things.

164
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:57,120
So the idea is you would be able to make these choices that I'm going to, you know.

165
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,260
Get from those columns if you have information in advance about what is going to happen.

166
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,970
So because you are maximizing your profit, right?

167
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,330
So the reason is that you don't know what's going to happen.

168
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:27,780
But, you know, if someone tells you that you are going to have a zero unit demanded, then you're going to get zero units stock.

169
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:35,729
If you if someone tells you that you're going to have 80 units,

170
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:44,430
that someone tells you that you are going to have one unit demand and then you maximize that by stocking one unit and so on.

171
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,330
Right. So that's that's to.

172
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:57,960
So what we want to do is it is given that you have the idea of what you're going to do.

173
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:06,149
So this is save this is just saying, if someone tells me that I have, I'm going to have zero units, which is done zero unit.

174
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,680
And someone tells you that you are going to have one unit, your stock, one unit.

175
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:15,000
Right. So is your mind to demand to maximize your body.

176
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:24,160
But then on expectation, if you where you have that flexibility, how much would be would you be making?

177
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:30,450
And this is what we call the FBI, right? The FBI would be here.

178
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:55,060
She's going to be equal to the sum total. Was based.

179
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:13,300
So it's going to be on the. Oh, these are these these these pay.

180
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,010
This is a maximum that you are going to get.

181
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:25,010
If you have that information, you are going to multiply that times the probability of.

182
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,440
Did. There will be.

183
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:57,930
It's 25 and 23 on.

184
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:16,130
You know. And then the FBI is 228.

185
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:24,700
So the point is, if I knew in advance what is going to happen,

186
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,520
I would be able to be much in demand by changing my decision and I would be making it to 28.

187
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:37,490
Right. And so they.

188
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:43,090
How much would I be paying? What how much would I be willing to pay for?

189
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:50,919
Perfect information is what I would be making with perfect information in my nose,

190
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:58,000
what I will be making on my own, which is I will be ordering for I'm getting 190.

191
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:06,340
The difference is, is so that's before I make the decision, if I don't know anything,

192
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,349
extra information, just the probability of the state of nature, I will own there.

193
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,750
I will always, you know, further forward.

194
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:21,830
I think that's what this big station that maximizing nice expect the money anybody and I and 190 of respecting it.

195
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:28,330
I think for me if I have the information before me that's the last thing to happen.

196
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,650
Then I would be able to order in the amount I'm still,

197
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:40,770
if someone told me is going to be if I know that I'm going to have a reminder to you in

198
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:48,160
age of two instead of four if I so if I know that I'm going to the money for three,

199
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,660
I don't. Three. Four. So.

200
00:28:52,660 --> 00:29:09,600
So that that advantage of switching and having the possibility to three I it is you know is what makes me what makes me win one ball.

201
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:25,990
And that extra winning is going to be what we call the BPI in the extra no extra profit that I can get with perfect information.

202
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,740
And then that's going to be always equal to the EVP.

203
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,590
What I can get with perfectly perfect information, my news,

204
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:43,120
you know what I can get with no additional information, only the probabilities of this, the nature.

205
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:57,380
And then this is why we got. So in this case, the inspector monitoring the expected value perfectly for me is $38.

206
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:13,110
And that means that if someone asked me for someone tells me that in one day they know how to forecast the future.

207
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:24,870
They know exactly how many units of people are running on a man made between before I start on and that information is worth to me up to 38.

208
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:38,870
So if I have to pay for that information, I would basically go to pay 15 and no one on the TV.

209
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:46,370
Could you show the formula for the EDP and the.

210
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:59,960
Is the E and BPI minus their maximum in the 228 minus one night.

211
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:11,250
Thanks. Any questions about that?

212
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:28,310
Right. Okay. So that's. You don't even have to do the API for that question, but I think that we can practice it.

213
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:46,280
They API. One thing that I would like for you to do weekly so that that could respond to homework

214
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:59,540
number five with lower number five because in you practice you are not going to use I.

215
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,360
So I went to get her one of the five.

216
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,990
I think what I wanted to tell you about.

217
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,930
But I put it in them before anyone notices.

218
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:40,160
And then you go back. Get the vote.

219
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,010
And I'll put that on for a moment. Move forward.

220
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,630
Be thankful to be with five.

221
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:11,220
Plus. Okay.

222
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,100
I want you to do right now.

223
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:25,690
You behave this problem. 15.7 is part of your homework.

224
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:36,210
But I would like you to do it. And it's not that you have to have anything to do with fish in your life, but it is.

225
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:50,800
It's enough of an exercise I'm going to exercise that you will be able to use this technique.

226
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:57,220
So this is this is something that you're going to have to do for next to any week.

227
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,470
So it's 1033,

228
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:15,339
and I would like you to work in groups and actually groups of three or four key entities that it's okay and collaborate with your group and your seat,

229
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:23,710
whatever you want. But, you know, this is how you can get these done and work together.

230
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:33,850
And it's a three, three, four. So by 11, I am going to, you know, four, and we're going to do it together.

231
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,780
But try these. This is going to be very important.

232
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:45,440
And I'll check what you don't understand and then ask me.

233
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:57,130
And go ahead, collaborate on it. Excuse me.

234
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,690
Seriously, let's get to know your family.

235
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:17,840
It's on the list.

236
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,180
I mean, you know.

237
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:38,520
All right, here's your first topic.

238
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,380
So I think we can start with. Yeah.

239
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,740
Yeah, I guess if you want to.

240
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:03,320
You know, I'm so on. You know what?

241
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:12,290
What are you doing?

242
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:19,600
I think he's right. Yeah, for.

243
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:30,000
No, it would be tax revenue because this had two transactions.

244
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,560
So it would be happy revenue through purchases.

245
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:47,370
What are you.

246
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:54,570
Oh, you want to know?

247
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:06,030
Yes, you can. We just keep negotiating, like, for like it's the same matrix.

248
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:09,840
So we're like you guys, working groups.

249
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,750
Revenue allowed to talk about it?

250
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:23,580
We will. But right now I'm talking like total.

251
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,580
Yes, total revenue is equal to the last year.

252
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:56,650
So revenue for summer evenings and little cross things that we wouldn't have any statement at ten 3124 would be on this is what he's doing.

253
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:02,740
But he didn't react. That was that was a good time.

254
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,170
You know, I think he was going to guess what.

255
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,380
Why did you do it? But we didn't.

256
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:24,330
Oh, so what are you doing? I think it just doesn't matter.

257
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:31,770
But there was a chance to leave this. Oh, you don't try and put in like, two rows.

258
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:41,440
400000, yeah.

259
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,940
So I, I just don't understand the sentiment.

260
00:38:44,940 --> 00:39:09,780
Let's stick to stuff you guys going this scheme so it's a wanted to find a range of things I forgot so it's this

261
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:19,169
little white smoke do so we just got this initial oh so like this but just like in spring that sometimes we recycle.

262
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:24,690
I think it's a different numbers.

263
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:40,560
Oh yeah. Just being like that makes it easier to get your register, so we just do it every time.

264
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:53,430
So that's pretty sure the revenue is going to have the same demands and trying to match them also doing like the Constitution.

265
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:06,530
So if you are discussing these demands, it is going to be substantive results.

266
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:28,610
Yeah, exactly. So you have to because plus, if supply is greater than something like this, think the difference that from zero.

267
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:37,690
Okay, so let's just see.

268
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:48,190
And then from there, you know, I like that.

269
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:55,589
I mean, by any reason you feel uncomfortable working with other people probably or something.

270
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,790
That's fine. So just so what do you do?

271
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:14,670
Kind of work? I just don't think they're going to end up being much an that that's where it is with your boxes and stuff.

272
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:41,480
Did you hear? You should not be doing your taxes just straight like I was referring to this.

273
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:53,430
Okay. Let's turn to something that's nothing like it doesn't have an extra cost.

274
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:58,570
It's extra like an extra 20%.

275
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:11,920
Yeah, but it's pretty soon it was like, well, you know, it's, it's all part of the higher cost, 3% cost.

276
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,190
No one got a real one.

277
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:25,450
You don't have a lot left leftover extra revenue I think from extra costs.

278
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,860
Yeah. Then.

279
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:50,990
Two months, six months.

280
00:42:54,850 --> 00:43:04,250
So we got to start monitoring that in just a moment ago.

281
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,220
Oh, it's the same thing to me.

282
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:22,580
It's I guess that makes sense because to me, there's a demand of Italians at least splurge or charge me ten or 23 times less than that.

283
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,830
And the janitor is doing just that.

284
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:41,880
So you have to be able to do the players 120 times plus because it's supposed to all value is right around.

285
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:50,770
If it's greater than supply, it's great for the sum total.

286
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,430
I didn't really think so, but it wouldn't be luck. Yeah.

287
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:03,780
Yeah. If the demand is greater. And that's the difference.

288
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,680
What do you say you could demand?

289
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:18,790
Find a supply for zero 31 site and so forth.

290
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:26,199
3.4 because of some of the residual that comes in associated with this.

291
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,450
What would be the extra cash at the end of the day?

292
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,900
I don't know. I guess I'll make time to do something else.

293
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:56,550
Yeah, I mean, that's true. So I guess I'll just kind of get mixed up because it's one of those that I don't mind too.

294
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:08,360
But I was two times a week when you were saying, Oh, no, it's okay, okay.

295
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:20,340
I'm not sure. Well, what you're saying because you're selling it that so like because they're getting rid of that.

296
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,270
I think you get anything like that.

297
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:43,030
I see. It's like, you know, if you want to change things, you have to start off because I'm going to do the calculation when you get into the big.

298
00:45:51,440 --> 00:46:01,920
Oh. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

299
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:12,740
I'm trying to do.

300
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:21,050
What was intended to be funny was very simple.

301
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:26,180
Excuse me. You were trying to say.

302
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:32,450
What did I just did right now?

303
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,330
No, no. Yeah, but it was just a shoot.

304
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,280
Well, is that what? You're your work. You know what I mean?

305
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:51,810
So I was thinking, this is actually quite interesting.

306
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,999
Just like some people are like, well, this is just coming over now.

307
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,440
Just thinking that this is just going to answer the question.

308
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:10,100
Okay. It's already on. Well, that's when you find out.

309
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:16,530
Remember that next week, like a week from today by midnight that will assign the returning said.

310
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:29,130
I'm just going to let this one choose to do this for the sake.

311
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:42,150
It. And I have a great.

312
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,600
They're now working on your grade, so can you feel that?

313
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:51,690
It's certainly possible. We listen to you.

314
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:56,300
I'm so excited to do something like that.

315
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:10,400
See in the world. I just feel like that brings us to the things that we have that we have to do.

316
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,370
Having fun. It's not under the table.

317
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,700
It's like my.

318
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,860
That's my point. So the future of this.

319
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:46,230
What? Do you love it?

320
00:48:47,250 --> 00:49:00,900
Yeah, it's. That's great. So let me try to match the presentation.

321
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,310
Why would you change propositions or anything?

322
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:20,340
It's so hard for me to hear myself.

323
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,890
And we can always go back tomorrow night on the topic versus the things.

324
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,500
You know, this is just the latest.

325
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:35,210
But you know what? It stands for elections.

326
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:47,160
So things like that. Is that what you're trying to do?

327
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:58,610
I'm going to get the supplies. It's great information.

328
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,750
So we just plain zero cause otherwise it's demand for this tax revenue.

329
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,810
Yeah. And then it's sad for me because it didn't say otherwise.

330
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:15,900
But did you know that? I did, actually.

331
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:22,920
I was like, that's what I was doing on Monday.

332
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,720
No, no. I just wanted to find a way to justify it.

333
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,590
Yeah, that's essentially.

334
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:41,730
Do I tell what I think?

335
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,150
I think I should tell you to get it sort of early.

336
00:50:46,620 --> 00:51:12,810
I don't even want to conceive of children had actually have some sort of music video for me to raise about it.

337
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:30,120
Oh, no, that's extremely emotional, again, for me to restrain myself.

338
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:37,980
You know, just remember to supply.

339
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,390
It was worth knowing. It was actually doing it for me.

340
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:48,480
Yes, that's right. Oh, wow.

341
00:51:48,750 --> 00:52:01,580
That's competition. And there were two different ways we could watch it myself from head to toe around his work and drink.

342
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:14,700
Just if you could, you know, you could just raring go in the last one, which is why I just, you know, I don't know your own.

343
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:39,270
Holy smokes, you know, because how did you are that and so it shouldn't be extra put so you know how much like a maximum.

344
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:45,630
But obviously we can't compete. I don't have that line of work.

345
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:56,980
I'm just trying to think of how to put into that. Fortunately, to do the demand positions in a man like can't be someone like that.

346
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:02,610
I was just trying different numbers, flexible work because like as long as it works,

347
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,740
as long as supply is not lower than it should be fine all the way around.

348
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:17,470
Although we have a lower level and we've been able to do that.

349
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:31,870
Yeah. I think that has the ability to do that.

350
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:36,570
Yeah. The supply. Well the probably won't come in yet.

351
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:44,990
So I was trying to like make the formula to them for the table. It comes and when we start, just like every other country.

352
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:54,860
That's right. I think it's going to be something like this.

353
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,800
So is there a crime?

354
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:10,250
We know the same thing here. Yeah, that's true.

355
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:17,219
Right. So this should be 1.25.

356
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:33,410
And I think that's when I subtracted this information in the middle of the crisis.

357
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:43,010
That's when we'll be calm. But it should be sufficient minutes.

358
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:47,460
Yes. Friends from this time.

359
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,900
Okay. Yeah, that's good.

360
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:07,510
It is. Yes, it is.

361
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,910
Why are you so close?

362
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:27,610
Get back. Okay.

363
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:35,200
Okay. I did. I did. It's just.

364
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:55,090
I think that we use the demand, but it's not something to which you should just especially to be less than what you and know looks like.

365
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:13,510
That works because it's not like if you go ask questions and not just like you're the table and think we don't have finished, you know,

366
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:39,130
it's it's so for doing like this we're not actually also there's more reasons why he so that's why it's the next letter,

367
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,209
you know, it's the extra what have you.

368
00:56:43,210 --> 00:57:01,780
But I don't understand that either because they have things on the same thing.

369
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:09,990
So I don't know.

370
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:16,130
Yeah, no, it's an investment in values here this year.

371
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:21,180
In the first year, not too busy and it's.

372
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:38,470
Oh I didn't get because that's somebody suffering from mental illness and all the subprime was then exactly what happened.

373
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:47,630
Yeah. It didn't check I said the double check.

374
00:57:48,610 --> 00:58:02,550
Right. But like the way that I'm trying to do it is to truly level with people.

375
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:19,230
You speed. So let's see.

376
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:24,670
So this is similar to the problem we we dealt with before.

377
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:38,350
So, so we have a regular. So our parameters here are the regular fries, the leftover fries and the the unit, the cost.

378
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,540
And then we have supply and demand.

379
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:46,240
So we stock the numbers.

380
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:57,940
We we have some rounds. Right. And then if the there is not enough throughout the people, you you then have to go short.

381
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:03,130
But it is you have so you lose every month.

382
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:13,510
But if you have it throughout, then at the end of the day you sell those things that I would buy for $1.40 except that,

383
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:17,379
you know, you, you bought it for those thousand 2.5.

384
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,130
So you are wasting you're losing one.

385
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:33,300
So the first thing I'm going to do is label this sales as I am going into data.

386
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:51,700
And then after the data with the formula for the formula and the create name from selection, I'm going to use the left corner to have those labels.

387
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,390
So all of these sales here are going to be over like these labels.

388
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:03,920
So in this case, you this is new and this is supply and demand and so on.

389
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:17,620
So this let's get a generic supply and demand so that I want an equal one as well.

390
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,430
So I just thought 15 rounds and people, number one.

391
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:27,260
Well, let's see.

392
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,670
So this are just numbers two.

393
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:48,310
These are going to be my parameters here. These are going to be my decisions.

394
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:52,750
These are this. This is the state of nature, right? This is my decision.

395
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,380
So then I have my decision as well.

396
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,890
So this is what I need to decide.

397
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,980
And this is something that nature is going to present.

398
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:18,560
Right. So now let's do the calculation. So how many?

399
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:22,130
So when I closed that, I.

400
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:34,590
I wrote that formula, those computations of total profit or net revenue of non profit algorithm modeling.

401
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:43,250
I broke it into computing the revenue and there are two types of revenue, right.

402
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:48,719
The regular revenue that you get very high by selling around 50,

403
01:01:48,720 --> 01:02:00,870
95 and then the less doctor left dollar of revenue that you can sell at one would be five and then some of it with the total revenue.

404
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:04,020
So let's talk about the regular revenue.

405
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:12,060
How many droughts can you sell in general at $3 or 95 it?

406
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:18,500
So right now, how many travelers can you sail here?

407
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:23,710
15 or 12? 12? 12.

408
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:29,680
Well, right. Because 12 is set. You have 15, but people only have 12.

409
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:33,080
So you're going to have three left over. Right.

410
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:41,260
So you can you can you can always count. So suppose that people won those 12.

411
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:55,010
Right. And but all you have is eight throughout our you say 11, but how many can you send and you have the right people one.

412
01:02:55,150 --> 01:03:01,550
Well, but we only have 11. So the only thing you can do is 11, right?

413
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:09,050
So between the supply and demand, how many travelers can you sell at the regular price for five?

414
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:16,690
This is always the smallest of the two, right?

415
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:28,790
If I have the mind of this, people want to have it in my movie and I get 20 star.

416
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:33,540
Then I can own only self esteem. Right. That that's what people want.

417
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:40,080
But these I have is talk 12 people, 115.

418
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:46,080
I can always sell 12 because that's why I that's the problem between the two.

419
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,070
You always come to sell at regular price, the smallest one.

420
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,520
So this part is going to be the regular price.

421
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:10,090
Nine times the minimum demand.

422
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:20,720
On the supply. You can you can do that with that statement that you were doing.

423
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:32,840
So you can do that exactly like any other thing is the demand is greater than even the demand is greater than the supply than supply.

424
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,770
Otherwise demand. Right. Exactly the same thing.

425
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:43,879
So that's the first one. Okay.

426
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,150
So now what happened? What is the leftover remedy?

427
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:54,550
Well, we need to compute the leftover and multiply that times the leftover price.

428
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:01,520
So the leftover component, what would you do? Exactly the same way that in the previous problem.

429
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:11,120
So we can say the leftover is always going to be that the supply minus the demand.

430
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:17,650
Right. That's the leftover. If it is positive, if it is not, if it is -0 zero.

431
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:22,220
So we can do that exactly as before. So this is where it should be.

432
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:30,670
The leftover fries. I won't apply the leftover fries.

433
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:34,950
Lose it, meaning the maximum.

434
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:52,030
Of the supply. Minus nine or zero.

435
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:03,160
Right now, the supply is lower than the demand.

436
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:08,050
Therefore, we will have a left over. And within that, we don't have that.

437
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:17,370
The total revenue is just as some of the to this is equal to regular revenue.

438
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:25,450
No left over revenue.

439
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:37,210
So that's it. And what about the total cost, the total process?

440
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,709
The total cost is simply your supply times.

441
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:48,460
The unit cost. Right. This is this is what you would start and this is what it costs you.

442
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,850
So it's going to be a unit cost.

443
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:00,980
Times in supply.

444
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:10,980
And the profit is going to be the revenue.

445
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:29,680
Minus total cost. All right, so we have our formula.

446
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:34,920
So these these these numbers are calculated.

447
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:42,040
And what I'm going to do now is create my my my two way table, as I did before.

448
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:49,420
So my way of table when it start here, when I leave, will not be table.

449
01:07:56,450 --> 01:08:00,679
And then for my payoff table, I would need to get there.

450
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:20,990
The amount of trials and the amount of drugs, I think it is 11 to 20 or ten to play 10 to 20 times in 20.

451
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:41,550
In. The amount of.

452
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:55,920
And the same thing for a supply you have in the man from 10 to 20 then.

453
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:02,840
Your and you're going to have a supply from 2020 to this.

454
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:23,720
And you know now how people would be. This is the man's baker, so I'm not going to.

455
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,980
Yeah, I'm. I'm showing the leftover revenue formula.

456
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:37,100
Sure. Leftover revenue pieces and you it for their.

457
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:50,880
So is this this leftover, his excess of what was left at the end of the day because you couldn't sell it?

458
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:56,730
It's always what you have, like people want and you don't you sell.

459
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:02,040
Right. And if the supply is greater than the demand, then you have leftover.

460
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:08,219
But if the supply is more of a demand, you have this negative number that you want to get rid of.

461
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:13,260
So you think the maximum between that formula, environmental demand or zero.

462
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,610
If it turns out that you have a leftover, you get a negative number with and demand.

463
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:23,160
So the maximum between negative number and zero is zero.

464
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:36,960
So that's it. And so we have my supply of the demand we put equal to profit here.

465
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:46,469
Right. That's a formula. We can always just simply say equal to zero, because I just want to label things.

466
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:50,610
So there are the money, right? So let me do this.

467
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:57,720
I'm in this this time. And when I leave this 16.5, so you don't get confused and think there's nothing there.

468
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:02,850
And then what I'm going to do is select the long table.

469
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,310
I approach these and then I roll them to the right.

470
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:21,600
And once once I have that and I have one or two data, I'm saying what is analysis in data table?

471
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,270
And this is the way that they will.

472
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:34,050
So they have to wait and then the row input itself or response or I need to take all these numbers and put it in my cell.

473
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:44,840
The Forum. I know. Here I have to take all this knowledge and put it in this place.

474
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:55,440
And then we have our hour.

475
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:18,800
I want to pay off the. And then you can answer all these question marks back to me on that idea.

476
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:24,440
But I want to to practice created this big thing that's going to be important.

477
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:31,610
I ask you to create the huge table and you have a practice.

478
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:34,920
Did you think, you know, this are crazy?

479
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:42,409
But if you learn how to do this, you know that you can create a formula to do this, right?

480
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:47,870
So I'm not going to do it. It's not my intention that you in three days calculating.

481
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,770
The thing is, you don't do it. You are not being.

482
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:09,370
And one of the things that we didn't practice before was to create that really great table, great opportunity, those people.

483
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:37,360
So let's do that one. The if I go when I just simply copy the structure of the computer and then place special values in the form,

484
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:49,320
and then I can delete the 16.5 and check these numbers into.

485
01:13:51,510 --> 01:14:04,860
And so if you remember how to create the day of the regret table, I do take, you know, the modesty of each quarter, nine of them three.

486
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:13,220
So this is going to be have a maximum of.

487
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:19,530
He's got a son. Right.

488
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:28,230
And I want the the if if if I qualify this for meet up for each sale,

489
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:38,830
I want the rose from 5 to 15 to remain things and what I want is when I move column that

490
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:45,630
one and the maximum to move one other column within the same within the same column.

491
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:51,700
If I tried to calculate this number I want to calculate I'm going to subtract from the same maximum.

492
01:14:52,350 --> 01:15:02,139
So so my point is that I need to pick the row that rows and leave.

493
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:07,230
Leaving on floating the lines in each one.

494
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:14,720
And simply copy this formula.

495
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:30,940
And at least in my mind you'll see that you always have a zero in always having zero corresponding to the maximum to the maximum one of the payload.

496
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,990
In that regard, people this is not regret here, not regret here.

497
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:44,460
And so and that you can you can put probabilities and completely expected opportunity loss

498
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,270
to come through the probabilities here compute this make their monetary value in fear.

499
01:15:49,540 --> 01:16:00,159
They ask you If I ask you what is the BPI, then all you need to do is finally tell me the minimum expected opportunity.

500
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,750
Not is the BPI. So you have two ways to compute the right.

501
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:12,750
So the minimum respected opportunity knowledge or you can do the MVP minus the amount of money,

502
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:24,340
which is exactly the same is another way to do to create the of your breath to to manipulate like I.

503
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:33,000
So this is something for you to start doing and I need to stay on.

504
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:42,160
And they are other problems. Actually, you know, I'm going to I'm going to change that.

505
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:45,500
I'm going to this is the only thing that you are going to be responsible for.

506
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:53,340
Because the other two, I'm talking about the activity theory that I am going through.

507
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,310
So we'll go through a delivery and do it and then you can do this problem.

508
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:12,610
But he already posted the videos for the theory this is that do will start working with decision trees next week and then you have your.

509
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:29,500
So to me a half and we will have this conversation over again when I would like to get either anonymous or still by my office,

510
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,879
get your feedback about how you feel with the class.

511
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:46,020
But would you like to change how it is, is that I'm going to slow to fast or is that what what do you think that Dr. McKinney said and instead what?

512
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:53,720
I really want your feedback because we have a lot of time to educate in the classes.

513
01:17:54,260 --> 01:18:03,550
So I'm that and I appreciate feedback at the scene is I know that you are very,

514
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:10,250
very, very very concentrated in looking at potential jobs for next year.

515
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:18,060
And that's great just to remember that this is that unique opportunity.

516
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,250
Grad school is two years unless you are going to do a doctorate.

517
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:26,390
These these two years are precious in your location.

518
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:37,220
And it's going to make you know that you're going to make use of these applications, the relations that you've been working for all your life.

519
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:44,510
And don't waste it. I pointed out that it's good that you put your emphasis in getting a job,

520
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:52,370
but also remember that your principal, your main goal when you are in the program.

521
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:56,110
Right, is get educated and get this killed. I do, indeed.

522
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:03,379
And so that's the point. To stay next semester, you know, do it, you know,

523
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:14,900
don't say don't think things very lightly and say I'm going to take it easy classes or I'll get out of here.

524
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:23,840
Challenge yourself, you know, go any way you're put, you know, get some skills that you don't have that you think you're going to need.

525
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:28,340
And it doesn't matter how difficult is just quote, for instance, your last chance.

526
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:36,180
I can tell you for my experience that being in a situation like this,

527
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:43,100
a concentrated two years we spent with the various smart colleagues around you with,

528
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:50,030
you know, examine this is a university that have a hundred programs and the top ten.

529
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:56,360
Right is the only university that they might not have the number one or number two put in the top ten.

530
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:00,920
You know, we have about more than 800 of programs and that's unique.

531
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:08,750
So, boy, everywhere, you know, take geology to other places that you need and don't waste your time,

532
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:14,200
not simply we make it so we can talk about more about that later.

533
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,960
And so I'll see you do that.

534
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:31,520
I know those are gone. I'm going to give us a chance to with you all for us.

535
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:48,550
So we've got an hour and a half but I'll in there that I don't really know the answer so you know,

536
01:20:48,680 --> 01:21:01,880
it's it's it's like you're trying to say, I don't really like that, but I like to know if I should go.

537
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:10,900
Michael Yeah. Matthew I'm sorry.

538
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,670
I don't know.

539
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,660
I got to go now.

540
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:24,900
I've got to tell you, I was freaking out personally.

541
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:32,540
I didn't. I didn't have practices night, so.

542
01:21:33,410 --> 01:21:37,760
Julie Oh, no.

543
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:49,950
They told me that the Jack in the box is going to be frightening.

544
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,800
No, I know. So she wants to stay in shape.

545
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,370
So, you know, maybe what are doing here?

546
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:04,610
I mean, I don't know what she's different know.

547
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:11,420
I know. You know what she said? She said, tomorrow we see, you know, when you want to be outside later in the day.

548
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:24,000
I mean, I never asked someone to talk to me outside like you got me.

549
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:32,120
I was like, Oh, we wouldn't do anything different.

550
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:43,130
So I guess I will see you there. You know, we started like each o'clock and then, like, that isn't so determined to do it.

551
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:52,800
So why don't we bring some food and a game and then, I mean, we have to have an effort.

552
01:22:53,540 --> 01:23:07,739
We know. But to do it. So once we finish that she has the midterm on that you know what to do you know if it is easier for you to just say, okay,

553
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:18,830
now I am going to do this because these are who I see, because I work, because I was like asked me to, do you care?

554
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:27,250
Oh, I have a chance. Yes. I'm sorry. Just because it's over my head now, like I would not remember this.

555
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:31,070
I don't know what. The more I do, you got to accept this.

556
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:35,750
Well, are you sure there's chocolate frosting?

557
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:39,010
Chocolate like me? Yes.

558
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:48,170
Oh, okay. Okay. You have to let me back up because you got it.

559
01:23:50,810 --> 01:24:02,320
So that's my change of clothes, because I was like, I almost forgot.

560
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:09,470
And I did. And I was just like, oh, it's just.

561
01:24:09,770 --> 01:24:14,120
Oh, he did say those years ago.

562
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:17,660
I would agree with that.

563
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:21,970
I don't I don't think so.

564
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:30,450
How did you know? You just like you just keep it there.

565
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:34,450
Just like I was like, oh, yeah.

566
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:37,960
No, it isn't like 30.

567
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,610
I have five shoes getting to sell.

568
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:52,970
And then when I realized how the 50% of me somewhere else.

569
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,130
