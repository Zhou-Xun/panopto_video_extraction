00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,090
Hello, Peter Jacobson. Continuing our discussion of the US health care delivery system.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,280
Now we're going to conclude the session with a discussion of how we regulate health care.

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,210
First question we should ask Why do we regulate?

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,080
And the first reason is that there can be market failure.

5
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,250
An organization could build a monopoly. Microsoft or AT&T.

6
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,490
You can have information asymmetry where different segments have more access to important information.

7
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,860
And to overcome the market failure, we impose some governmental oversight.

8
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,520
Second reason is to protect the public health and safety.

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,080
That's largely a function of the public health system.

10
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,100
And third, we might have some redistributive goals.

11
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:17,090
Equity, for instance, we might say that health care is unevenly distributed because only wealthy people can afford access to it.

12
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,640
And we might. And so government, you need help in through federally qualified health centers and through governmental insurance,

13
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:34,320
potentially even single payer systems, to make sure that everyone has equal access to health care.

14
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,520
But there are certain reasons where one might say we should not regulate to

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,020
begin with where the market failure and there is also governmental failure.

16
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:55,080
Governments are hardly perfect. We have seen many difficulties with all governmental programs in how they're implemented,

17
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,690
with cost overruns, not being able to provide the care that was promised.

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,620
Second, there's a concern the government might intrude on individual or the private sector,

19
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,540
particularly in the case with regard to public health intervention,

20
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,080
for instance, on requiring motorcycle helmet when people want to exercise their free choice.

21
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,210
The antidote to not regulating let the market work and it can be unduly burdensome.

22
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:39,000
Health care is a heavily regulated entity, and some argue that the regulations are not only unduly burdensome, but they're not very effective.

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:49,680
Let's think back to the start when I mentioned the idea of competition policy, where the government oversees the private sector.

24
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:59,130
While some entity like the Cato Institute, the libertarian think tank mentioned earlier, believe in minimal government.

25
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,720
Most agree that governmental intervention is appropriate to control the private sector.

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:17,069
The government promulgates more standards that the market can operate by and monitor the economic and social system so

27
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:27,160
that the issues of equity and access can be addressed and governmental intervention can range from coercive oversight.

28
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:37,480
A heavy regulation of fraud and abuse in health care to providing incentives and savings for accountable care organizations we talked about earlier.

29
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,810
And what are the goals of regulation? Given that it's not time to oversee competition policy?

30
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:53,970
First, we want to improve quality of care, to control costs, to improve access to care,

31
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:04,050
ideally to facilitate market arrangements, not to impede them, and to reduce waste, fraud and abuse.

32
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,060
Let's look first at how states monitor the health care system.

33
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,180
They do so in several ways. First, they licensed medical care professionals.

34
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:23,850
Both hands and nurse practitioners must be licensed to provide care once they're licensed in the state.

35
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,260
Fourth scope of practice regulations that determine the extent to which they can provide care.

36
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,150
In some states, for instance,

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:45,990
a nurse practitioner can only practice under her or him in others and have a wide scope of practice independently of physicians.

38
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,750
Secondly, states regulate health insurance.

39
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,810
Although the federal government provides insurance through Medicare and Medicaid,

40
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,500
the federal government plays no role in regulating commercial inherent at the state level.

41
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:08,940
Instead, states regulate health insurance in terms of the benefits that need to be provided,

42
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,150
with the caveat that the Affordable Care Act poses minimum benefit requirement.

43
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,840
And states regulate the premiums that health insurance can charge.

44
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,820
30 States license hospital and nursing home.

45
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,390
You need a license to open a hospital.

46
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,800
That license can be through a certificate of need that some state imposed.

47
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,220
But even if there is no certificate of need, you still must have a license.

48
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:52,920
And that would regulate solvency. And if they meet certain sanitation requirements at the federal level, there is considerable regulation.

49
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:03,180
First, the Department of Health and Human Services has a number of components that directly affect how health care is provided.

50
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:14,100
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and determine a variety of aspects for Medicare and Medicaid services.

51
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:24,660
It's through Medicare and Medicaid that we have the many regulations that health care providers need to follow.

52
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:35,160
In particular, the fraud and abuse regulations that run to well over a thousand pages in the Federal Register.

53
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,790
The FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,

54
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:51,239
is responsible for ensuring the safety of pharmaceutical products and an extensive process that pharmaceutical manufacturers must

55
00:06:51,240 --> 00:07:01,930
go through to demonstrate that a drug is safe and effective and can be marketed to the public and National Institutes of Health.

56
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,960
We've already talked about in CDC and HQ as well,

57
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:15,659
the Office of Management and Budget playing a very important role in regulating health care because all proposed

58
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:26,640
regulations must go through the Office of Management and Budget before they can be promulgated as rules.

59
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:38,130
The process here we go through, for example, to monitor fraud and abuse or antitrust regulations.

60
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:45,930
First, the government works with the industry to build the regulations.

61
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,510
The government has the final say, but it's often advantageous to get input from both the government and the community.

62
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:06,270
One way to do that is that the government issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and invites comment from the public.

63
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,100
For the most part, the commentary comes through organized train associations.

64
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:18,030
But on the other hand, the nonprofit sector, particularly health care advocates,

65
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:29,520
have been very effective in consolidating a lot of public comment to be a countervailing force to industry observation on the proposed rule.

66
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:37,080
How the government would ensure a proposed rule would go out for comment after the comment.

67
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:43,740
The government is required to take into account the comment to issue a final rule.

68
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:52,710
That final rule would go to the Office of Management and Budget because the OMB, as it's called,

69
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:00,300
is responsible for ensuring that there is a cost benefit analysis before the rule goes out.

70
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:08,550
So OMB would make sure that the rule is not overly economically burdensome to the industry.

71
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,760
And then once the rule is issued,

72
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,470
you don't have to see them in other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor progress and to seek sanctions.

73
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:34,480
If the health care system isn't appropriately implementing the guideline, the most onerous sanctions have been through the fraud and abuse process.

74
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:46,660
For example, the HCA about a decade ago paying well over $1,000,000,000 because of allegations of systematic fraud and abuse.

75
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:57,610
In more recently, physicians in Florida and Michigan have been accused of criminal conduct in the fraud and abuse.

76
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,010
Congress playing an important role here also.

77
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:10,840
Congress not only oversees the federal agencies through the Health, Education,

78
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,030
Labor and Pensions Committee, they help committee and the Senate Finance Committee,

79
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,399
and particularly the Health Subcommittee, but also the House of Representatives,

80
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,860
Ways and Means Committee, where all laws involving tax implications originate.

81
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,130
And then the Committee on Energy and Commerce in the House Subcommittee also provide oversight.

82
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,470
Congress enact legislation.

83
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:45,940
The Affordable Care Act then holds hearings to see how the government is implementing it and what other aspects need to be addressed.

84
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,050
So that's the basic overlying process of regulating health care.

85
00:10:52,450 --> 00:11:00,729
But there are limits to health care regulation. One is that in a rapidly changing and competitive market,

86
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:10,330
so it's very difficult for the government to keep up and get ahead of the market in particularly very hard to regulate.

87
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:21,400
Now, near 18% of gross domestic product seems to me that we need a whole new way of thinking about regulation because

88
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:30,160
you have ongoing tension between the regulators and the regulated and that the regulations are too onerous,

89
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,500
too detailed, too complicated.

90
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:44,049
I can tell you from teaching the front end abuse regulations that it's almost impossible for attorneys to figure out what the rules mean,

91
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:51,520
let alone health care administrators. And it's very costly, far too costly structure.

92
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,260
And while no optimal regulatory structure,

93
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:10,690
the fact is that we can change how we regulate to make it easier to achieve regulatory goals without burdensome micromanaging at the federal level.

94
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:21,729
One way to think about broad guidance and parameters and let the market work out how to meet those goals with the

95
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:29,830
government regulating to make sure that the health care industry isn't taking advantage of that added flexibility.

96
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:40,600
But the problem is that standard arrangements that would be adaptable in the marketplace that are really favorable to patients are being blocked.

97
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:50,350
They're impeding because a concern that they may be inducing referrals which drive up the cost of health care.

98
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:57,430
And finally, difficult to block market changes absent over onerous regulation.

99
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:08,080
And we want the market to evolve. We want market to be flat, humble, and we don't want onerous regulations to include them, impede them.

100
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,470
Finding that balance is a challenge.
