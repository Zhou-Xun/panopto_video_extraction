1
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay, Good morning, everyone. let's get started so at first we'll go over quiz Number 8.

2
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You have something I want to mention. Maybe I should have done that earlier.

3
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is that yeah, I don't want you to worry too much about the score I got from the quest. the party.

4
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Everybody want to get a good score, I mean, as always.

5
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But first of all, you know, the quiz was always challenging, especially for multiple choices.

6
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll talk about. it. Seems like the the auto grader of this online quiz is that if they have a multiple choice question.

7
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I if you made any mistake on any item I mean if you have a false positive where you say like a one shouldn't be selected, or you've have a personality where you'll miss the one you should be

8
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
selected always come as one mistake, and then they will subtract the points.

9
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
For whatever mistake. So, for example, if the original multiple choice only have one correct answer, then if you make one mistake, you got 0, no matter what kind of mistake. So you you may be choosing the right?

10
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Answer. but if you choose any wrong, answer you have a 0 I know it's just being like overly harsh they shouldn't be.

11
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But that's what the greater is doing there's nothing I can do about that. and also some of the multiple ways are now made particularly straightforward.

12
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's you know I I think those are good questions made by my product.

13
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But but there are last. I think it is straightforward.

14
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So. so you may not get a score that, as you expected in the quiz.

15
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But but you can see that you know the course, the quiz.

16
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There are 9 different quiz. Each one has 4 or 6 questions. Yeah.

17
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And all the gathering. 30% of the final grade right.

18
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And then, as far as you participated, as long as you turn you all the assignments on the impact in cost projects, you gotta be other 70% already. Right?

19
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So. for those of you who take for credit, especially as long as you turning everything, you should get a reasonably good great India.

20
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So don't worry too much about a scorecard from the quiz trial back, and we'll take wait no, we'll take into consideration everything i'll participate is the sign of final grid Okay,

21
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that's what I wanted to say here. i'm done let's go through the quiz. If I have any question.

22
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Please let me know

23
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So it seems like the first question is especially challenging. I think the keys that we review these questions right?

24
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So that you try a best, and then review what mistake you make That's how we learn.

25
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So let's look at it. this is this wise especially challenging.

26
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Cause I can see the statistics from the cost.

27
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So you sample 51 recently diagnosed with handle me metals, cancer.

28
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
10 of them reported that the response, Smoke cigarettes.

29
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You sample another 50 woman without cancer. Both of them report that they spell smoke cigarette.

30
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So you know. there's a lot of information here and you Have to recall what I call the buying cost to see what they mean, based on how these information, which of the follow statement is correct.

31
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Choose every response. So this is you know a case i'm audible choices.

32
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Thank you very hard. so let's go over it one by one number One.

33
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This study is an example of case controls time anyone won't go ahead for this.

34
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, I can answer this question. so for the first statement I said that the study is an example of a case control study because they're comparing 2 groups of people which in here. it's in the question.

35
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's woman diagnosed with cancer. and the other group being woman without endometric cancer.

36
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So you have those with the disease, or or condition under the study, which is the case portion, and the other group who does not have the disease or the condition which is the control portion portion.

37
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So your answer is, this is okay. Thank you very much.

38
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Anybody has they're from the painting

39
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay, Yeah, you're you're absolutely right it is a example of case control study.

40
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I I guess you know the wording make it a little obscure. It says they didn't say how they gather women right?

41
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But just from the data description. First of all, there are 2 variables.

42
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
One is smoking cigarette, the otherwise high having.

43
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And let me true cancer. so apparently smoking will be exposure and the castle will be outcome right, cause that's what we usually want to study, and they didn't say how they got a woman by since they're comparing to

44
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:49,000
a group, one with cancer, one without cancer each was 50 women That's a signature of case control study where you've got, you know, a certain number of case and certain level control in this case equal size. right?

45
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's the optimal design. So you can't imagine that's how they design the study.

46
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So they actually record 100 women in a study and 50 with cancel 50 with all kinds. So if they recruit subject in the study based on their outcome status, that is a signature for case control study.

47
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So you're absolutely right, Thank you very much yeah and second 1Â s hand smoke from spouse will increase the chance of animal metro cancer.

48
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Anyone won't try this Oh, good I was gonna say that this is not true partially, because you can't definitely say that this is the actual.

49
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Case like you had to have an experimental design for that to actually be proven.

50
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Thank you. Someone else was also trying to answer. Yeah. I also said that this was a incorrect.

51
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because there you cannot draw the conclusion based on the on the information you have.

52
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There might be automatic, other possible confounding factors that that calls the the cancer in the other group.

53
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And you can draw the conclusion that it is due to secondhand smoking.

54
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Thank both of you very much. You both are very correct.

55
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Right. this is observational study, and the you know you cannot really draw things like, you know.

56
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The statement of this is the cause of statement. right so typically this this particular statement may be true.

57
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not saying it is one, but you just thought the the evidence from this study is not sufficient to draw this conclusion.

58
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Both of you are very correct. I apologize. I just got this new version of zoom which keep hiding itself.

59
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You know the the control bar queue hiding from the screen.

60
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So trying to figure out how to work it on. But, you know, apologize.

61
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If you see some weird stuff coming out on the screen. Okay.

62
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Number 3, 2 of every 3 smokers have a wife.

63
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
In what kind of metro cancer this is Why, especially tricky.

64
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Anyone wants to try this

65
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, yeah, I can go with this. I Find it kind of hard to explain why it's robot.

66
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I I feel it's around directly because I feel the most call queue.

67
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We have we hand gather. They say that we draw.

68
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We we draw back representative and large sample of of the smokers from our population, and to emphasize their if they have indoor match or cancer, then we can have the most closest computer which is

69
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:39,000
we have after something like a hypothesis testing we can have we have a drive it, and so not enough that ever evidence for this control.

70
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But here, exactly the sample size is about the wind or the women with all we both cancer rather than the sample size, I thought, which would be a random and representative sample of smokers from a population, so that's Why.

71
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think it's wrong Yeah, and to because this country is I think it's it's reflected, too, right? it's point to the choosing that rather than how about that is as the

72
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:21,000
result also because of this is this is not true because we cannot directly conclude or say something in the choose from this kind of study.

73
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So You're saying, This is not true right thank you yeah. I I think you're you're you're absolutely right.

74
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is not true. there there are. many way first of all you know. this sentence by South seems like you know, 2 of every 3 smoker have a wife with I don't meet, you can so.

75
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But actually, if you think about in the population Hmm! 2 or 3 cool every 3 smoke, and they may not even have a wife at all. right.

76
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So you know that that's a same whole thing of looking at the sentence.

77
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So. in fact, in this particular study, if you look at it, indeed, 2 or 3 smoker in this study they have a wife with.

78
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let me go to cancer, But without that condition, right? if you talk about the population, this is not true, and the the the very reason that the most important reason is is because, to make a conclusion like this you need to sample small cars

79
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
randomly from the population, and that require a call for study.

80
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, we have a case control study Here we are some company based on outcome, not based on exposure.

81
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So this study just do not collect the kind of information we need to make this kind of conclusion.

82
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So the fundamental issue is that we are doing a case control study from case control study.

83
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We cannot assess population risk of having cancer even within the smoking group that goes back to what I talk about yesterday.

84
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Right case control study cannot give you estimate on the population level risk period.

85
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
They do not provide a kind of information nevertheless they can add to the ratio between cancer and the smoking unbiasedly.

86
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So that's exactly why you know we study all the rational Wisconsin case control study. but you know, So that's the table massive. right?

87
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This is not call world study. You just cannot collect this information.

88
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Any questions so far

89
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Alright number 4, the odds of having a spouse who smoke is twice as great for women with handle metro cancer than women without.

90
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
In the natural case. This, again is a little tricky, because you need to. understand.

91
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You know that definition of all and risk, and so on, and so forth.

92
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Right? Anyone will answer this

93
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I I don't remember the exact math, but I think what I I just calculate the odds ratio for the 2 groups, and then they they It was the It was not to the one without smoking.

94
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Exposure was not too. or they there was it was when you divided the audio .

95
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So, for example, like if you're gonna look at the group with the smoke exposure.

96
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So, according to this question, 10 out of 50 has smoke exposure.

97
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So the other 40 did not. So your odds ratio there.

98
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:38,000
See 10 of them report that their spaces. so I think the odds ratio I did was like point 2 to buy by point 8, and then the other Audrey show would be 5 over 50 so that point one divided by point

99
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:49,000
9 and then you take those 2 odds ray shows. and, it does not equal to you are absolutely right.

100
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So to answer this question, you need to make a table like this right?

101
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So for sure as stands for smoking, so the rows are smoker.

102
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Now smoker and columns or tas are lung cancer by you pushing, you know, for example, in the Castle group you have 50 total, and then among them Taylor small person.

103
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So on, and so forth. From this table you can compute all ratio.

104
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What the Saturday will be 10 times 45, divided by 5 times 40.

105
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That will be. what is that? That will be 450, divided by 200.

106
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That will be 9, divided 4 by the ratio will be 2 point, 2, 5.

107
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So the whole r is 2 point, 2 5, which means, if you look part ratio is the ratio of which means the odds of having a spouse.

108
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Could smoke is 2.2, 5 times of the law in in the auto. Let's not, too. so where do they got this 2 twice?

109
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:02,000
They are actually looking at the the risk right? because the risk of having a small curve as a spouse is is 10, over 50, 20% right.

110
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The rest of having a smoker in the non-caser group is 10% right?

111
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So that'll be 2. So basically if you you if you if this is not odd.

112
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's actually a rest, then, that'll be correct so this is again, you know i'll i'll come back to this when we talk about this regression, but you can only you've added the risk in according to your study design so here

113
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the study device case can talk. therefore we can evaluate the rest by which the P.

114
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is the risk in the in the you know. Taste group right?

115
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We can rather risk of having a smoker, and you know, in the Catholic group, right?

116
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That is 10, over 50 that's 20% q one p 2 is having a small group in the non has a group. that's 5 over 50.

117
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's 10%. right So py over K. 2 is 2.

118
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So then we re referring to the rest of that is too, that's number one.

119
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay, let me. I don't know if I have enough space.

120
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So you know, I I really want to have a enough space to write about this.

121
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay, let me apologize. But let me, reap reproduce a why bore cause I think this is hi kind of important.

122
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So why did it help again? Okay, So I have bigger space, Right?

123
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So this is a smoking. This is non smoking because it's.

124
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Cancer is non-cancer, right? This is 50, 5,100 total.

125
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Is it? 14, 5, 45, is 15 or 85 right?

126
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So let's let's do a lot of calculation Okay, So the rest.

127
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The P. That's what have to spell it very clearly right. the risk of having a smoking given cancer that is 10 over 50.

128
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's 0 point 2 that's called p one Okay, P.

129
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
2 of having a smoking in the non-casable that'll be 5 over 50.

130
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's 3.1 right now, with this tool risk you have computer. absolute difference in risk will be 0 point 2 minus 0 point, one at 0 point, one right?

131
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But more more importantly, we can compute P. one over P.

132
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
2 that's called the relative risk that'll be 0 point 2 over 0 point.

133
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
One, that is 2. That is what the question is talking about.

134
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The rather the risk of hiding a smoker in the cancer group versus non-profit.

135
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
On the other hand, people want to compute a different kind of rift, which is a really risk of interest, right?

136
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The risk of having cancer in the smoking group. If you do this, you can see you have 10 over 15.

137
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That is 2 third 0 point, 6, 7, but the rest of having oh cancer in the non smoking group that is 40, over 85.

138
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That is, I don't know exactly this number maybe 0 point 4, 5, or something like that approximately.

139
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Okay, I don't have a calculator so you see the risk ratio here is about on the 1.5 or something.

140
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But this whole thing is wrong, because, remember, you cannot evaluate risk like this in the past control. Study right?

141
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because you'll sample your subjects you know vert vertically.

142
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So you can only compute the risk for vertically you cannot compute the risk Horizontal

143
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This is stillly wrong, right. If these are correct, then in the population, we should have 50% people having these cancer, And that's not true.

144
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The only reason we got such a high number here, just because we over sample the paces.

145
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The true rest of hiding hazard. given a small price way lower than this right?

146
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So this asked me, is a wrong

147
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Are you with me? right if you let me know if I have any question.

148
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So in case control study, we have only divided the risk the other way.

149
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We cannot. But this risk that's very even interest right giving a cancer. What's the risk of being a smoker?

150
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That's not an interest, but we pay you better with that but the really interesting risk is the population level risk of having an outcome given.

151
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Treatment we given the exposure. But we cannot evaluate this in the case.

152
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Control study, because these are over estimated because we over sample the paces.

153
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So these are wrong. therefore the risk ratio is also wrong.

154
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So let me wipe this out now let's see what hesitate to study.

155
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Can give us

156
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay, Actually, I like to put it up right. This is 2 third.

157
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
This is about you know 40 over 85 right let's divide up.

158
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's 8 over 17 okay that's that's the rest.

159
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
These are wrong, Nevertheless, let's not convert comp computer odd ratio.

160
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Okay to all the ratio computer using this this but going to 2 risk.

161
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That's true, that will be Remember the all right that will be 0 point, 2 over 0 point.

162
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:41,000
8 divided by 0 point, one over 0 point 9. If you calculate this whole thing you will get.

163
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Let me do the math very quickly. 9 over 4 that's 2 point, 2, 5, right.

164
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Just do the coupling that's all the regional calculator from this, too.

165
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Now let's calculate the ratio from this wall this are wrongly at my risk, but nevertheless, that's computer audio.

166
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So all the ratio cocktails down here we'll be 2 third.

167
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You buy them by one third. that's the all right the one group over 8.8 over 17 divided by 9 over 17, right?

168
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Just computer corresponding all through the audio. If you do your math.

169
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Interestingly again. you've got an iial report

170
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So it turned out that even though you overestimate the risk here, because you overestimate both for the same amount.

171
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Finally, the all virtual actually is unbiased you see either way about the same audio, because the definition of all ratio is the metric.

172
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It doesn't care remember, the definition of all the ratio doesn't care which one is the exposure which wise i'll call so even though you sample based on outcome not based on exposure you still got

173
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,000
the same operation

174
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So what do you think that the relative risk? this is good?

175
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But this relative risk is how we will work. The relative risk here is bad.

176
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:24,000
We cannot estimate it right but that's really what we want So the random rest in the population is what we really want. but we cannot estimate it from this case.

177
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Control study, but case control study can't ask me the ratio unbiased me.

178
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
No, there's a guy We wander out of the rift.

179
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, we cannot get it. We can get all the rifle but that's not what we want.

180
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So how do we get through this gap it turns out that we can get through?

181
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Because, although we don't know the relative risk we don't know the risk in each group, what we know is that the risk is very low, because cancer and the metro test is a rare disease, right?

182
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We know the true risk of this are both very low, because the true risk are both very low.

183
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Then remember, when the risk is very low, the odds will be very similar to the risk.

184
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Therefore the odd ratio. will be very similar to the relative risk. so we don't know this number, but we know this number will be similar to 9 over 4, so that's the power of case control study, and rare disease.

185
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
We can ask me to audio unbiasedly, and we can.

186
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We know the relative risk will be close to it. Or where are these

187
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay, I you know i'm supposed to talk about this Indiana just regression.

188
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But I just think it's the time to bring it up right so.

189
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You know. I hope you take your nose. but you know you can always review the the recording.

190
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Well, that's that's why about everything cause I run out space right?

191
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So essentially I don't even know how to wipe you know the phone open here.

192
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So essentially right for or red, these

193
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We need to use case control study because it's more efficient

194
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Higher. how i'm hoping about cuban small sample size no for red.

195
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If we know queue will be approximate equal to P. that's positive will be probably equal to risk Therefore all the ration will be across metal, relative risk right and in case control study.

196
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We can get all the refo. we cannot get a relative risk, but somehow all the refo.

197
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
They are similar to relatively. So we we we can actually get a relative risk pretty accurately, even though we don't know it.

198
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So that's the whole cycle that's Why, for rare disease page control study.

199
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Be awesome.

200
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Then I will think about you know where we'll talk about it doesn't really matter right when you have a 2 by 2 contenders table.

201
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You do whatever you need to analyze right high-squared past, you do a little just regression.

202
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The study, the the physical model doesn't really care your study design They don't care how you got your pay your invitation cares right.

203
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So you're getting all 3 from you cannot get up you can still cut it around the risk.

204
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But that will be wrong that's not the real one but somehow you from the operation, you know the true out of the risk will not be far away.

205
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Any questions so far

206
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Okay, let me go back

207
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, the last wise is wrong, because the operation is 2 point, 2, 5 dot 2, and the 2 is is the other random risk we can compute from this case control Start device, not of hi relative, you know, practical interest.

208
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The next one is relatively easier. Most of you got it right Let's do doing quickly, right.

209
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Your population interest is adults living in a South Easttern Michigan for the 20 age of 70 and 80, and live along along in a single dwelling home.

210
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You have a sample of $100 randomly sample from this population, from a question there, and served by each of the $100 to find 20.

211
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
5 of them reported really lonely and list once a week.

212
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Based on this. what's the 95% common for the actual proportion of policy and property homep?

213
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So many number here are not used, for some are useful, right?

214
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So you need to find a the right equation to use and find the right number.

215
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Anyone also answer this: Can you tell me how you got your hands That's more important, I said. for this one that the confidence interval would be point 1, 6 to point 3, 4.

216
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Is asking to calculate the 95% conference interval for the actual proportion of adults that feel lonely. I started by finding the actual proportion which would be the 25 out of

217
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
100 or 0 point, 2, 5, and then you have to find at least this is how I did it.

218
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You have to find an interval that is equally distant on the lower end and the upper end, because you're adding and subtracting 2 times the standard deviation by the square root of n which is 100 in this

219
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:58,000
case, if i'm correct that, you are using this product right Is that right?

220
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So this this is the point estimate, and this is the standing arrow plus minus 2 right?

221
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So that will be 0 point 2 pi plus minus 2 times something.

222
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I I need a couple of them for that. but I turned out to be 2 times 0 point 2, 4 with something right.

223
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
No 0 point 0 5 or something right so that's the hazard.

224
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
God. is this: Is that right? Yes, Yeah. So you just need to find out the right honor to use right.

225
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So this is the common level for the P. You ask me a standard error.

226
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Use the right formula. they've got a found inable Yeah, one thing you can see, the common world should be sent around them.

227
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The point. I think so. Only the the first one, the second one could be possibly be correct.

228
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But then you still need to pick the Y one right? not required to resort to the funding any questions here

229
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And this one is relatively straightforward and a third one again a little tricky.

230
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
A cars Protest Association would be a property test.

231
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The little test. for which of the following result: again audible voice, one, a study collapsed data.

232
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Who compare the press of recreational marijuana using 3 age group of dollars.

233
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Is that correct?

234
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Okay, yeah. for this one. A study collects data to compare the prevalence of recreational marijuana.

235
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I said yes, because It collected data like it, almost like is from a survey.

236
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It took information from people. Okay, Cool: Thank you. Yeah, this is correct.

237
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So the Chi Square test, apply to a situation where you have multiple group I for each group you have a categorical outcome.

238
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So in the end the summary of the data into a contingency table.

239
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That's where it has no problem. we have 3 age group.

240
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah, we have audio group for each group. We are comparing problems of a recreational model.

241
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
This, again, is the problem of something like the rate of something is like the performance port or something right?

242
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Is the population problem, which means that for every single adult answer is yes or no is a binary outcome.

243
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Bye, how you can you imagine you organize the data in this study as a 3 by 2 table right?

244
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The roles are 3 columns. The columns are.

245
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know how many people use barrier versus how many people don't use you school right?

246
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
So 3 by 2 table that's why this works any questions so far

247
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And the second one A study wishes to compare every day from one of Miss School and among inner city children's apartment children.

248
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The rural children, age 16 to 80 years old. Anyone say this is by the wrong, I said.

249
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:25,000
This one is incorrect because when it comes to a chi-square test we're not really comparing the values of the populations of interest, even though we have 3 different population groups, testing, but we're

250
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
not really looking into the mean values, really looking into the proportions and just to us.

251
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank you. Yeah, high school test. Take categorical binary outcome.

252
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But here the allcom is days per month from this school. So that's a continuous outcome, although we're compared to 3 groups. High school tests is not the one to use gear.

253
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So who can tell you which past we learned can be used here?

254
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Would it be the one way in over? That is correct. Thank you very much.

255
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Yeah, okay. third one study. we should compare association between the problems of absence of a genetic notation of having diabetes in the dolls age. 8 to 22.

256
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yes or no.

257
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Sarah, I was speaking. we we can't hear you

258
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Okay, speak. Now, i'm sorry we still can't hear how to decide.

259
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Can't hear you Sorry about that

260
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah, I guess, while you you work on a microphone Yeah, I'll, i'll just go over hot this one.

261
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah, you know you've kind of applied i'm.

262
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Sorry, Sarah, but it doesn't work. all but hopefully you can fix it so you you can use high for our past year because we are comparing association between 2 variable one is the prevalence of half sensor denomination that's

263
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
binary, the others having or not having diabetes that's also binary right?

264
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So the data will be a 2 by 2 contagious table that's what Chi Square test can be applied.

265
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And finally, the study class data will assess gender differences in rate of concussion.

266
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Individual, one college soccer player. Anyone sure this will be a 2 by 2 table as well.

267
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
More yes or no percussion, and male or female.

268
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So this you you would do a chi-square test for this awesome Yeah, you're absolutely right.

269
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's a 2 by 2 table, so high school test yeah Finally, below is a condensed table.

270
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's already continuous table right summarizing data class would run those on for high school children examining some of number of parents living in their home.

271
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
There's a lot of information right which are following it correct So the first variable is on diet.

272
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes or no. Second one is type of a family. so we have swallow evidence that there is association between anxiety and the number of parents.

273
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That child live with anyone? Only answer this

274
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:58,000
For the having a strong association that one if i'm, reverend, correctly wasn't True, because if you run the chi-squared, it was greater than 0 point 0 5 of an alpha value thank

275
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:08,000
you. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely right. You would give run a path to get a keyboard before you can make this statement right just from the table alone.

276
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You cannot tell. Actually I haven't surprised if you even go out while the test that's great.

277
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But here I think the purpose of the question was that without the past week, and i'll say it right. yeah.

278
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
One thing you guys pointed out already, are you? How do we do so?

279
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:36,000
For the fish or exact test. right? You could do feature exact on this, because you know, the high spread has assumed large sample the rural town is that every single salad here has a kind of larger than 5, and then this cell

280
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
has only kind of 2. So although I think high school has, can still be applied here.

281
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But some people will argue, maybe feature exactly as it's better.

282
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Your other alternatives right? There are yay corrected hypothesis, a different version of test for this kind of table.

283
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But that's be honest, though, but I think that so the message here is that you cannot say the association until your testing.

284
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Second, The result of study are not valid because we do not have equal number.

285
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Children living with 1 0, one and 2 parents. Anyone

286
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:26,000
This one is not true because you don't have to have the same number of subjects for each category in the chi-square test absolutely. Yeah.

287
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Just like one way and over right high school has doesn't require an equal group size, although you know, with the fixed total sample size.

288
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
If you have equal group size sometimes, that give you a higher power everything else equal.

289
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But that's not required for target Cars for the apply you're absolutely right.

290
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Thank you 3. Do you observe the Os. of anxiety for children living with one parent, with relative to children living with 2 parents is less than one.

291
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Anyone

292
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So the from how we got is that we should use the 6 yeah, and plus 20 to be divided by 10 plus 14 of us we can see that the 2 by 2 conditions.

293
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
They take also. So it's 120 plus 140.

294
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So it's less than 1 1 point yeah 0 thank you you're absolutely right.

295
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I mean, except that I think you've got your answer right but when you say it's it's 6 times point not 6 plus point.

296
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But you did 6 times 20. So you're right thank you very much.

297
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yeah, Basically, this could modify, divided by the other to modify.

298
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Okay, Finally, the observe, the rate of anxiety's greatest amount children living with 2 parents, anyway.

299
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I think I picked. I think this is true.

300
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What I did was I just took like 20 divide by 30 to the last, like point 6 6.

301
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And then did you take my 14 over 20 that's less than point 6 6.

302
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And then, boy, no, actually go ahead I don't remember Okay, I I think you you did it right?

303
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Just Okay, rock. So, sushi you, you want to say something.

304
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, yeah, I think it's easy enough it's just to you use term to be divided by the number of to zoom ways, maybe with 2 parents.

305
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You got the opposite of rate of anxiety, which is one one which is one divided by 3.

306
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Sorry i'm not about the English expression not very familiar, and then for anxiety rates among children, in which one parents is similar, which should be 6 out to be divided by 6 6 plus 14, and then for children with no parent

307
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
she should be 2 paths to be divided by 2 plus 6.

308
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah. and you'll compare the 3 quotient Thank you.

309
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, I think both of you are right the to couple of the the rate one on driving each group I just take this number divided by the total.

310
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So in the 2 parent group is 10 over 30 that's one over 3, 33%.

311
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The 100 group is 6 over 20 that's 30%. A No parent group is 2 over 8 that's about 25%.

312
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So the rate of anxiety is highest in this group.

313
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So. Yeah. So if you want to talk about the rate of anxiety in the whole population, right, you have to look at a study design.

314
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But this is a random solve of from all the high school children. Right?

315
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So you would say, this is actually this is not a page control study.

316
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
This is not a cohort study. This is actually a How do you call it?

317
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
This is actually a full call across sectional study, or something like that?

318
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Or is it similar to a call for study? but you're not really recruiting based on exposure?

319
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
All from either. You just run them in some of the whole population, right?

320
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So you can analyze it either way, And from this data you can really It's it's it's more similar to the cohort study that says not a basically in this This is the most powerful.

321
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Study. You know since that you got assessed any proportion you're gonna assess, the the proportion of people having different kind of parents, because that's the people have a different kind of anxiety or you kind of assess the risk

322
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:18,000
of having anxiety given Paris because that's the risk of having different kinds of parents together, as I even have the class all the way. you're gonna assess everything on bias from this kind of study.

323
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Okay. So we had on the bandwidth both because you got everything from home.

324
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That's the power of having a simple random sample from the population.

325
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You got everything on virus sample. The downside is that if any of this is a rare event, you got very little number in there right?

326
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So so Downside is on. You may not have enough power for this kind of stuff.

327
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So any questions so far for these questions, I know this question is a little little tricky, but most of you did reasonably.

328
00:47:47,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Well.

329
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Okay, Thank you very much. Now i'm moving on to

330
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Remember yesterday we so call day pretty much finish the lecture here right

331
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So the day last through for the rest of the day let's try to finish the exercise.

332
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So. so. Project Ib and the quiz will be due tomorrow morning.

333
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So that's first work on a project 90 that's opening up

334
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Again i'm not used to this new version of zoom Yep.

335
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So this time we're gonna use the article the firearm ownership and suicide rate among us man and woman.

336
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That's exactly the the data we use actually in the left terms right?

337
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So the table is found out the page, and then we use the data from table.

338
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
One, and maybe also from table to a little later. right?

339
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So this question. I finally, we also have another set of questions right that's a one.

340
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:24,000
How does the Gada today? And I think this is the this seagull, hey, Per? right?

341
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So these are the single papers. The payroll is here

342
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Oh, this is single data, and a single paper is key here, so can dollar a sequel paper and take a look at the the questionary virtual table.

343
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:49,000
One table 2, you know, you guys can take a look at this data and the the data is here.

344
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I just download it right? Yeah. And then you may need to use this brashet.

345
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I will explain a little bit

346
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:14,000
This new version of Zoom is trying, right? So this is a spreadsheet for simple linear regression.

347
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
What we can do is that we have a 2 column.

348
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
If our access is access, why is the Y-axis?

349
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Both are continues right. Why does he plot? Put the data in?

350
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
You got a scalar pop? Oh, you gotta leave. Regret your line.

351
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah. Then you got all the regretted fitting. You can make it a little bigger by double clicking right?

352
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Exactly. This is the table we show in the in the lactur if not more, but it's the intercept slope.

353
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It's. an estimate of this is a is the B. at the right is the standard error for A. for B. The T.

354
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Statistics which the ratio of the tool statistic. The rate of this over this and the P value correspondingly so.

355
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
This is the pivot for the smoke usually it's a quite a bit interest on top of that.

356
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
We have mean square arrow. we have R. Square. we have A.

357
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We also have a, you know, correlation. so this portable does both regression and correlation.

358
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So the correlation between X and Y. 0 point 1 7.

359
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
If you square it, you should be getting this number, and then this is the lower upper power for the correlation, the pivot for the coordination.

360
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You see the Q Idle for the carnage are always equal to the pivot for the slope, because it's the same path.

361
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So that's all you need to know about this spreadsheet which should help you answer all the questions in this.

362
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So lecture any questions before I move you to breakout rooms

363
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Okay, stall. It will be time for a break during your during your exercise.

364
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So i'll just give you more time right usually we have 25Â min.

365
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Now i'll give you 35Â min you'll really use them all your exercise, or feel free to take a break any time.

366
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:08,000
In the meanwhile, also feel free to stay in the main room, or, you know, jump across the window. Different rules.

367
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
I'll give you 35Â min for this project which already have break included.

368
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
If you Have any questions, please let me know Now or i'll send you 2 more breakout rooms.

369
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Let's see you in 35Â min

370
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Okay. hello, everyone, i'll come back. I hope you had a good time in the groups, so let's now i'll also have you have the chance to take a break.

371
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So let's not review what we did so the first one is about table one saying the buyer H.

372
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Adjusted and explain what you mean right and why why does the author want to do that?

373
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:06,000
So let's come here. People want to talking about this age of just the suicide rate, so anyone will do.

374
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Give a give a shot, you know you don't have to know that the answer but you know, tell tell us what you think

375
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Sure I can speak take a take 2 here so the way we interpret It was that there are certain people are certain age, and i'll certain gender that have higher rates of firear ownership. and are we looking in the paper it

376
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:47,000
doesn't say like which which gender or which like with which particular age you've always gender has higher far.

377
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I'm carriage rates, so we just prefer that when they say like age adjusted.

378
01:29:51,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It just means like behind the scenes they looked at, different for our carriage rates or different age groups. and then they took different weights, based on each age group, depending on like how how more often or less often or they carry

379
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:18,000
firearms. Thank you, Andrew. I think you You answer very well. huh?

380
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Yeah, I mean they they didn't really spell out how exactly did the adjustment, and very often they do that.

381
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So, which is unfortunate. So so. the whole whole point is that you could have confounding right.

382
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:39,000
So your goal is to compare. I I think the goal of this study is to compare different policy on on ownership versus suicide, right?

383
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:52,000
So the exposed to the main exposure of interest is there's a sort of a policy. but then policy will sort of have impact on the gun ownership and the guy all of you have an impact on far

384
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
i'm reading, suicide I think that's the thought of this study right?

385
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
But when you do this kind of study you have the ability.

386
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,000
There are many compounding you to consider and how to deal with those confounders is an issue right now.

387
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
There are many, many way to do with that that we can imagine.

388
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:14,000
May or the female have different suicide rate. So if you compare different states, because the States is the level where they have different policies, right?

389
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
So they all compare different states because they have different policy to whether there's a difference.

390
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
But the different States has different male versus a female ratio.

391
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Then the suicide rate in the State is not really comparable, Right?

392
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
So there, sort of they are rid of the gender impact.

393
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Similarly, we know different age group have different suicide, right?

394
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:39,000
If a different States are different, age distribution is also not fair so you don't get rid of the age ag 5.

395
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So the gender-five router is easier.

396
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Remember what we did in the past. When we compute a Pmi within gender, it has standardized Vmi with the gender via Zoom right?

397
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:57,000
So instead of comparing the Bmi directly, if you standardize within the each standard group, then the Vmi are now comparable Right?

398
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
That's why we'll get rid of the gender in fact, the other way.

399
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Oh, that's called standardization right the other way is what we did in this paper on the right hand side.

400
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You know they they stratified. May one of the email right.

401
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
They compare the suicide rate, you mail only where's the female? Only right?

402
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So that's also Why, we you stratify we talk about that right?

403
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
The third of it is something we're going to talk about later is that you would include the general email model.

404
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
So you can have multiple variable in the model that's multiple regretted out another way.

405
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
But sometimes, you know, just want to compare 2 variable right?

406
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
So example come here correlation. So another way is to address by by adjust.

407
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Usually people may regret out some of the events. So you can imagine.

408
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:44,000
This different age group have different suicide rate. So what they could do is to computer age. Specifically, of course, you cannot do it for every single year, but you can group them by 5 years.

409
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:53,000
This right? So for the particular age group, they have a higher suicide rate. What they go Do they have a lower suicide rate, and because different state has different age distribution, right?

410
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So they could somehow standardized the age distribution. So they think I have a habitatical age.

411
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Distribution across the whole country, like one State, has more people in a particular age group than an average right naval.

412
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Reduce the suicide rate for that state accordingly. but once you figure out, if specifically, is a more sophisticated way of doing standardization, because age is continuous, age is not binary.

413
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
If ages binary, you know how to do, a buffer continues.

414
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
You just abandon them and then do it, You know more sophistically about the same idea as dealing with Chandler.

415
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
So I got that what I meant here. but unfortunately didn't talk about details.

416
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
So, I think, Andrew, you are very spot on that, you know.

417
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
They somehow do this waiting scheme right? They should have written more clearly.

418
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
How they do. They do the adjustment. But but the the whole Russian.

419
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:50,000
No, I guess the question is going to why do they do that it's because it's not fair to compare past days.

420
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:55,000
If their age distribution is not the same, Ages are confounded, they need to get rid of it.

421
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Any question.

422
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Okay, No second one as a student from exercise to run a regression using a spreadsheet.

423
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Why versus ask Right? So why is the male suicide rate?

424
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Actually the firearm ownership no not otherwise the female suicide rate on the part farm ownership.

425
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Okay, let's first go. the first one so this is linear regression. The X will be param ownership. The Y will be suicide rate.

426
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:43,000
All of these are adjusted so let's take the is already the 3 column here. you know scratchy, so we take.

427
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
We can't just take the 2 column directly all together control c.

428
01:34:46,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Who copy and the control b to pay you and that's it right so i'm not getting it live.

429
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Oh, I got in the wrong because yeah i'm getting a run right what's what's wrong with them?

430
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Hold on a second that's what we got alright did you got the same answer.

431
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:30,000
But they're fun. This is what we got to thank you. i'm just checking the the answer key that I had.

432
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Yeah, it is correct. So once you're plotting here, you see this actually the figure we saw in lecture many times. right?

433
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
So now you know what they are, and then we have seen this right.

434
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Remember the partition of 0 point 8 4 that's what we saw in the in electric right, so so and so forth.

435
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
You can do the same thing for female let's just look at the mail.

436
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I think the question was, based on your analysis. Does average fire all ownership have a strong association with mail?

437
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Really the suicide a stronger. We, I guess we have to do both right, male and female, provide evidence for your answer.

438
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
So we can do for mail and see email is alright.

439
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:18,000
We can just start another sheet and then copy everything on this sheet.

440
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Who the second sheet, and then plug the female there that's that's the easiest.

441
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,000
So now the second sheet is for female I guess that's also what you've got.

442
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Let me just tell: Yeah, this should be correct. So now we compare back and forth, right this 2 sheet.

443
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Of course they have different intercept, but the intercept is not of interest.

444
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
The slope are also different. Here the slope is 0 point, 3, 2.

445
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Here. the slope is much lower. correct the figure doesn't show a whole lot of difference, you see.

446
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
The figure almost similar

447
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I think we don't quite get Oh, I guess this figure is wrong somehow.

448
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:15,000
The figure is still bye through the first she just copy paste.

449
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
The figure won't work of the modify the fever that will be awful.

450
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:28,000
So the the numbers are correct. The figure is not I don't know how to deal with that.

451
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Let me. okay, let me just deliver this feed. Start over again.

452
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I will download another scratchy we just do is duplicated the shit.

453
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
And in that case we go like a different quiver came up for the woman.

454
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Let me. thanks, let me do it. Sliding

455
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Yeah, So this is, you know. Now I have a new sheet that should work.

456
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
So we'll be what I can do is that again I take fire on the older.

457
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:17,000
For you. Alright, pull up delay, and then take the female with some right here over here.

458
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
This time it should be correct. Yeah, this time it is correct.

459
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:36,000
So now we have the 2 sheets. Yeah, see? Oh, my goodness, Now this is a 2 sheet.

460
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Okay, So the male has a slope 0 point, 3, 2 female has 0 point 0, 5, 2 right?

461
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
You don't really see that from the figure because the scale on the Y-axis are totally different.

462
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Right. So here the male suits already go up to 20.

463
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
5% hear them. Female only go up to 4.5%. A female has way.

464
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Lower suicide rate that's why we want to do gender specific analysis right longer.

465
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,000
The guy is not meaningful. So look at the correlation.

466
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
The male is 0 point 8, 4, the female 0 point, 7.

467
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Most key value are highly significant. my Female don't Tell too much, and the mean square arrow here is 7.6. Here is much lower 0 point.

468
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
4. Now you can think about what part that's the case and R.

469
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Square in the mail is 0 point 7 oh, 9, and the female 0 point 4, 9.

470
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:32,000
So give me all these numbers right? The question is, does average firearms.

471
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:38,000
If you have a stronger associated with mao or female, and why, Dr.

472
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:47,000
For I'm. speaking on behalf of group 3 I Guess that's the number of the group we answer this question.

473
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Looking in to the what in these credit plots we analyze that.

474
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:02,000
If this data, if the sample points were distant from this little, I think the association is decreased.

475
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
But for a male they did a very closely flow, so I think, have a stronger association.

476
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And then we look into the and yeah for mail.

477
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:21,000
They are quite close to one. so I think it's a moderate too strong association.

478
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Thank you very much. Yeah, there are many of you can look at. And luckily in this time the office gave the same conclusion.

479
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
A male you know, in mayo they associate it stronger right? I don't know.

480
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I mean, if they give complex conclusion, we have to look at more deeply.

481
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But here you look at the R mail has higher correlation, and the party they will have higher R.

482
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Square. right so male has higher correlation also has higher R.

483
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Square, and, on the other hand, both associate has sort of very significant pivot.

484
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
We cannot tell, but the male has a larger key statistic.

485
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Here is 10.8. Here is 6.8, right? So although both have comparison to the pivotal, the male key value is should be more significant than that.

486
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Email. So all of this piece of evidence show you. Mayo has this, and also you kind of got a bigger right male.

487
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Here they they! they are more concentrating around the line female.

488
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Here a little more scattered right so all this piece of outlines showing you mail this associated stronger than email but that's not like a guaranteed right.

489
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
It could be that Mayo has a higher R. square, and R.

490
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:36,000
A female has a smaller pivot right that could happen it didn't happen in this case, because they both had the same sample size.

491
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Therefore the the higher, the the smaller the vlan but they're a tool study.

492
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
They have different sample size than this this. Some of those can go different way. Right?

493
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
That really depends on what do you mean by stronger association?

494
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Do you mean stronger effect? Size, which is stronger? Correlation was straight like that.

495
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Keep by right. they these 2 may not always go together. Just keep your mind right.

496
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
But in this case they are so. The answer is very simple.

497
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Any other comments

498
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Okay, So if you want, I can type it off but I just don't think I need

499
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Yeah, if you want me to type it up, you know, if you do.

500
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:29,000
The following: Exactly what I said. I can have it on. Just let me know a number 3.

501
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Suppose all firearms in Michigan are banned, and only if you drop the 0 using our Philly modeling tool, what are the have to make the the race of B male and female part of our release suicide?

502
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:50,000
On these good estimates. Explain your answer so let's first go to the mail.

503
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Okay, this is a mail so they're asking one Michigan.

504
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I don't know which. Twice in michigan but actually it doesn't matter sorry which 1 2323, no, I mean

505
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:20,000
The 0. 23 roll, 23. Okay. got it this one? Yeah.

506
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Thanks. but you know actually so. doesn't really matter for this question I guess so.

507
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:34,000
So, paul's the our own ownership drop to 0 right from this model of it.

508
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:48,000
What raise a male suicide rate? Would you expect anyone

509
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:58,000
If if if x is 0 the only thing remains in the equation is the intercept. So that would be your suicide rate.

510
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Awesome. Thank you very much. Thank you, Nick. So yeah, exactly.

511
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:10,000
That's the interpretation of intercept the slope right So let's go back to who the question. Answer.

512
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
She key? right? So the equation is, y equals a plus B x.

513
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
In this particular case, you're male If you still remember the the inter stuff is about 0 point.

514
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
One. Oh, it's all the one plus b 0 point 3 2 x right?

515
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:31,000
So that's the equation interests of this one Oh, my 0 point 3, 2.

516
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:39,000
So which means that if x 0, then we have, why equals 8?

517
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:46,000
In this case one. so that's exactly the definition of intersect in the subject is the expected Y. of Y.

518
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:58,000
When X is 0. Okay? So if I work with well, I think it's easier to draw here.

519
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:09,000
But figure doesn't go to one right but in a typical Let me go on here in the typical regression.

520
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Model X, and Y. if these are 0 right, and the regression lies here, the data Now, if you extend the regression like, go across the 0 that this distance is the it's the interesting But the inner side is where the regret from

521
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:32,000
life call out the y access when access 0 that's quite interesting. right?

522
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So in this particular case you got this this line doesn't go through there, though I have to.

523
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:48,000
You know the standard that's the end of that which is one alright, t equals one

524
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:56,000
So in this case, right? So the bye expect it.

525
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I'll predict that the suicide rate will be one per second. This is per by one person in Michigan.

526
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Well, you're female study it turned out to be minus point one. Okay, let's first pull it up right?

527
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Or email.

528
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Y with minus 0 point. one. Well, I think it's 0 point 0, 5 x, which means when x is 0 why will be 8 minus 0 point 1.

529
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Right, so that's like exactly what Well, partly it doesn't make sense.

530
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
The suicide rate cannot be negative. so the question goes.

531
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Here are these good estimates seems like they are not at this problem.

532
01:46:44,000 --> 01:47:14,000
This one is not right now why it is not anyone wants to answer

533
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I can make a guess, but i'm not sure it's, because these numbers are only based on suicide caused by firearms.

534
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
But there are a lot of other causes of suicide.

535
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
So Okay, Thanks. Yeah, I think I think you are right in practice.

536
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
But here we are asking for us the fifth call interpretation right so i'll i'll go here because I didn't talk about the cost.

537
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:46,000
It's not fair for you to answer this question but the the interpretation of inter stuff is nothing wrong.

538
01:47:46,000 --> 01:48:01,000
The cut off the value here, right? But we are using the We are extending this line to make predictions, and the the reason we can do that is that we assume the line face some reality. right?

539
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:08,000
We are assuming this Kubernetes are linearly associated which seem to be supported based on the data.

540
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Well, the problem is that what we expect in your life, whereas Huning, the the the leadership goes on beyond the data.

541
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:30,000
This is something called the extrapolation right? If we make prediction in the range of the data that we are doing interpolation, which is safer because we are making assumption of linear relationship between X and Y within the range of data

542
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:37,000
we can somehow check that. I look at the data. But if you make extravilation, you make predication outside the range of your data.

543
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:46,000
You will make me assumption beyond what you see from your data that's totally assumption based, which is not reliable right?

544
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:53,000
So that's why the interpretation intercept is right But the interface is itself may or may not be practically meaningful.

545
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Depend on whether you know whether 0 is in your range of a data.

546
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,000
If 0 is outside the range of data, then the inside itself is not practically the meeting.

547
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:13,000
That's why the prediction will not be meaningful So there are 2 way you can do with that one is that you can shift the data right, for example, instead of manager.

548
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
The suit, the firearm ownership you can subtract everything by 20 or 40.

549
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Now you're basically move your data across 0. Then the intercept there will have a different interpretation.

550
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:35,000
The individual will be the car ownership will be the suicide rate, when the How far ownership is 40, Then that's meaningful, or you're doing interpolation there.

551
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:43,000
So. So you essentially, if if if 0 is not in the range of the tax value, you can't imagine right.

552
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:51,000
If I manager if we level age and the high, are you fiddling your model, or for for for for children?

553
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
But that model will be. Nothing will make prediction for adults, right?

554
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Because the linear trend will will stop to be the trend after you.

555
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
You know you're out of adolescence right same thing here.

556
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Think about. So the fundamental reason is because that's making for prediction that at that 0 is x your acts travel.

557
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Later there, and which is not reliable

558
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:33,000
And but as the May big cost oh, thanks, 12 or later.

559
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Okay, any question here

560
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:44,000
But, nevertheless, this question, you know, tell us what the interpretation of the interests right now.

561
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Let's look at the Okay, the next question is if there relationship relation between our

562
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
So is our rate of man and the women right they're correlation.

563
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,000
So to answer this, we need to change the data a little bit.

564
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Right. we need to gather so by the, for example, male suicide rate.

565
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:12,000
And then put in a freshly here right? so we need to.

566
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Study Mayo suicide rate versus the female Suicide rate.

567
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Right. So now ignore whatever we find from the linear regression just from the Pearson correlation. right.

568
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:44,000
It's highly correlated. Take them a pivot and the company interval is wave away from 0, which means there is a strong positive association between May and the female suicide rate

569
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:52,000
This is something you have think about. So across the States right mail space, I read: a female survivor are highly correlated.

570
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:59,000
This correlation is actually higher than the correlation between Mao and the and the thorough ownership.

571
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:05,000
So something must be driving this. It could be far ownership, or could be something else right?

572
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Because different states they have many different, probably beyond our ownership.

573
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:27,000
But you know, at least for association. we can say they are highly hi positivity associated bye.

574
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Any question here. What does that mean like I don't understand Why, we would even compare the 2, and like what like, if I were to look.

575
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I just don't know what that yeah I mean they are highly associated, which means they are highly associated right to to go beyond that in terms.

576
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I mean the 2 variable, typically 2 verbal will not be highly associated with any brought to go interpretation behind them.

577
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So it's it's definitely draw some interesting Paul Well, that doesn't mean we can answer this question from this data alone.

578
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Right. so it seems like something is driving this right? So if I tell you a state with high mail suicide rate, also tend to have high females with our rate.

579
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:27,000
You you gotta think it's not by chance something is driving this This probably has something to do with that thing right all with all the States.

580
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:38,000
But that doesn't mean we can answer that question from this data, because this data doesn't really measure anything from the State by other than far on ownership Yeah, that's a very good question.

581
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Unfortunately it's very hard to have some in practice I have just a thinking, you know, when now we find something highly associated that draws more interest right? Sometimes it's a this analysis as a for example, I tell you you know high screen, consumption and

582
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
the droning is highly associated and you'll figure out exactly seasonal, right?

583
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:07,000
So you could say it's either either interesting or not but sometimes they are interesting.

584
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:16,000
For example, you'll find smoking and the long term are highly associated that you need to draw like decades of study to to figure out what's the reason?

585
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:27,000
So just having a highly association is just I think it's interesting finding for people to follow up to figure out a reason.

586
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Now your finding association is the first step of forming a hypothesis, and the trigger downstream, you know, studies

587
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:42,000
That's what the peabody is saying right this pivotal measures that this associated do not happen by chance.

588
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:48,000
This is not a some people would see by chance something is going on.

589
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Okay, that's up next. Suppose the rate of male suicide in Wyoming was actually 6.1.

590
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Is that a 26.1, without refitting the modeling too, with the via of means by error, increase or decrease.

591
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Explain your answer. let's look at the mail so we side right right, Wyoming.

592
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Here is 26.1 is the highest so he's had a rate.

593
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:41,000
So. Hi, believe this, this this one right is wyoming So I'm saying, If you drop this point down to you drama down here 6.1 by the far ownership doesn't change but you drop the suicide

594
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:50,000
rate, What do you think that means we're arrow will change

595
01:55:50,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Anyone. Yeah, I think it would decrease as well. because the model is sensitive to allliers.

596
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Thank you. Any other calls. I kind of had the same reasoning, but I said that it would increase.

597
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Okay, yeah, I mean in this case, it's very easy and just change the data repeated Right?

598
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:29,000
But, you know, think about what might happen before you read the data exactly very helpful for you to understand.

599
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:35,000
So the mean square error is the average where distance between the fiddle line and the data points. right?

600
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
If you drop this point here, you can imagine the line would have killed a little bit.

601
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:50,000
But nevertheless, this point we will have a very large residue, and that will drive the photos software of the era to go on.

602
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
We'll drive with the mexico however, to go off let's just try right.

603
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:01,000
26.1 let's change it with 6.1 you will see the line killed in a little bit.

604
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:10,000
No, by the means barrel goes up greatly. Okay. So the slope goes down a little bit.

605
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Keep by is still significant. But the case that goes down a little bit correlation goes down a little bit.

606
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:24,000
The misconduct goes up a lot by our smart goes down quite a bit, So that means, you know, those the correlation and the regression.

607
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
They are somewhat sensitive to outlers. Now this become a Hawaii right?

608
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:35,000
All that will drive a lot of all these numbers. Okay? So the mean square actually goes up and our square goes down.

609
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Any question here. Now let me undo this. So you have.

610
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
You can see the change

611
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I cannot keep this. I cannot keep the figure I don't know why?

612
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:59,000
But yeah, I just cannot let me drive the drag the bigger down here.

613
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:07,000
And then she did 6.1 you see i'm going back and forth.

614
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
The 2 the down a little bit

615
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Okay, Now, table 2 see the value highlighting in red boxing table 2.

616
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:27,000
This file suggests that your firewall should be increased by 10%, say from 15 to 25 a month.

617
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
2,009 goes down 2 point. 2% sounded.

618
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Therefore a politician claimed that the government was beneficial for society, because at least through last, now parallel suicide met, because, whether or not okay, so table 2

619
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Here. So this is one day through the model right they have 3 different model.

620
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:58,000
We'll talk about later on. but depend on whether you're you're putting covariance on your regression right?

621
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Just say this particular number is all across the thing. You know.

622
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:11,000
This is a simple linear regression model. Where are they regress The non fire on, you know.

623
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Flu is already honga on mail on fire i'm older here, right? So in this case, that means if you reduce reduce 10%, increase, 10% on a fire.

624
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Ownership will reduce the not far from suicide rate by 2 point, 2%.

625
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Do you believe that or no?

626
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:59,000
No, because the overall suicide rate increased I guess have a higher proportion of people having fire, i'm associated to a sense.

627
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Yeah. So yeah, you're you're right I mean you cannot just look at a non parable suicide rate.

628
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:14,000
We really change that, you know we really increased power ownership no, i'm sorry I read decrease, but the farms which are really increased as a total of the actually increase.

629
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:28,000
That's the first level of answer right because i'll just look at one level the second level, as to say this is observational data, right?

630
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:39,000
You only explain association, you really don't know which one is causing which, when you try to change policy to change our ownership, that's the experimental experiment, right?

631
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Observation of data cannot really determine what's going to happen when you do intervention, because that required causal difference, right?

632
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I'm saying, maybe this association is causing by some confounding factor, you're not really observing here.

633
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:01,000
And then changing the file ownership will have nothing to do with the outcome of suicide, or maybe have something about the end of this time.

634
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Right. So So this happened. layer of logarithm.

635
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
We cannot make causal inference all of this but that was the last, you know it's very interesting.

636
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Look at this, right? Yeah, I I think, for all of the May on the female, for all the model.

637
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:21,000
It seems like final ownership is positively associated with with fire on the related suicide.

638
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:26,000
But it's negatively related to now farms previous reason which makes sense right.

639
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
If someone welcome coming through, we thought, and they will use the most convenient approach right.

640
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:40,000
When they have a far on they just use baron when they don't have parameter use other means right so sometimes change the fire owner should just change the way suicide is committed.

641
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:47,000
May not be in popular total, and it seems like the total amount of food he's at is associated with our ownership, but only in mail.

642
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I seem in female the total amounts is that not really it's not really associated with style ownership.

643
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
So it seems like maybe on a female They are I mean i'm not trying to make any calls open conclusion.

644
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:06,000
But from this association it seems like May on a female, behave very differently, right email when they decide to commit suicide.

645
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Unfortunately they will use param if it's available otherwise It's other thing. not only can make a difference Oh, May always seems like with more available, they tend to make more suicide right, I don't know one of those

646
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:24,000
gender difference, or whether there's some confounding other things going on, at least from this table.

647
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
You know you can see a difference between male female.

648
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Any comment here.

649
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Yeah, I mean, actually this paper. they consider all other compilers right?

650
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I think, a good level, you know just the model and the final model.

651
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:58,000
If you really down here, right they actually adjust control from anything like region, level or realization.

652
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Population, density, education, and payment by employment, meeting house income, many, many divorce rate by incarceration they adjusted for many, many, many basically collect many data. and the just for all of them as much as they can But

653
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:24,000
still you see the result. Only quantitatively change you can I don't know just it, but doesn't quality change.

654
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:35,000
So it seems like the difference between man and the female it's still there, regardless whether you adjust for company or not.

655
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
And that really draws you to think about what is driving this gender difference, and so on.

656
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:44,000
So basically, that means the policy change will have a different impact on Mayovers and female right.

657
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Seems like for mail. If you reduce the power ownership they will reduce the total number suicide.

658
02:03:51,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It's very possible, assuming you know all the potential panelists are just as well, but in female that doesn't seem to make a difference.

659
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Right, we are reduced our ownership the the fire I'm related to this how we're already deals.

660
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:12,000
But now far resistance I will increase right as a total it doesn't change.

661
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I'm not saying we could draw that concluded because it's still causal, but because the author adjusted all the confounding they could think about right really make it a little convincing case that you know it

662
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:30,000
may happen the way it is expecting

663
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Any questions.

664
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Okay, now. we move on to second set of questions and before the break.

665
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:54,000
So it's to do with this bigger

666
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So we have a 1,302 Ucla students.

667
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Half of the survey we are after about their high, their fastest speed.

668
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:12,000
They have ever driven and gender. But now we have 2 scattered polynomials, the same scale of pop this up on the left side.

669
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:17,000
You just mix both bay and female together, and the right hand side you have made on the female.

670
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Okay, separated by caller. So so that means the scalar part really showed the association between 2 continuous variable.

671
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:33,000
But sometimes you can overlay another like kind of garaca, variable on top of it, using different color.

672
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
We could actually overlay other things like shape or size.

673
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Right. you can overlay several more variable on the speaker, but you know the more variable you openly I'll have it. make the figure more hard when you interpret it.

674
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Right, but nevertheless you can. You can pop 3 or more variables if you really want, You know, a single figure, Number one.

675
02:05:51,000 --> 02:06:04,000
This primary relationship between high and the path to speed anyone want to save here

676
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:14,000
We'll do see from this bigger I see from a week. but positive correlation between these 2 variables.

677
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Yeah, Thank you. Yeah, I see a a a week for a positive association of this line.

678
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Right. You may also know that there are field off on the left boundary on the bottom boundary.

679
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I don't know about this. Oh, this are the other people will never drive right.

680
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
You probably want to get rid of them. they never drive.

681
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:43,000
So there are fast speed in driving doesn't make any sense right this I think this is just how I all right.

682
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Wait when someone showed her that something. they just cap it from below.

683
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Well now, with the last. These are people who never go on.

684
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:58,000
My very thought week positive association. Then I look at the right side right?

685
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Why do we think there's a weak positive association, and when, when when you look at a gender right, I will try to add some question.

686
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
B. and see the gather right? we've got a gender Do you have an explanation?

687
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Anyone wants to tie us or Bnc. together.

688
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Dragon tight answer So we think maybe there's like a positive correlation, because, it's indirectly Co.

689
02:07:44,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Sounded by the gender of the patient. Oh, if you want the the graph that! the plot on the right side here seems like mail subjects tend to try faster than female subjects.

690
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Because the green dots our eyes are are more are higher, then the red dots, or then the red X's.

691
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:16,000
So we think that, the week positive correlation is not because of the subjects height.

692
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:22,000
But it's more because of it gender that's contributing to faster speeds.

693
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Thank you very much I think you're offered by that's what you're showing here.

694
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,000
If you look at each caller by self, and there seems to be no association, or very, very weak, associated right.

695
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
But we overlay them together, and you gotta pig on the lab.

696
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
There seem to be a positive association. Right? so, which means gender.

697
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Here is a compiler. right? So because mail or polar, or every time female and drive, pass on that email when you put them together, ignoring the gender, You see this relation, we call this a spurious correlation

698
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,000
which means the 2 variable actually has not need to do each other.

699
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:05,000
But they were parted because of third right. So only including the server in the model, you can explain it without collecting data on the tender without looking at the gender.

700
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Just look at the left hand side you can have a figure out if I'm saying you have many explanation happy to see the people on the left.

701
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:22,000
People say, Oh, maybe how are people just on? Glad you have right more, because Polar people they drive bigger cars and be good cost.

702
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Drive faster. Oh, because Polar people, they are older and other people drive fast.

703
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:37,000
You can't have like an Internet information right I look at the right hand side is pretty clear that at this gender is one of the driving. for, because if you look at a gender specifically with email and within female there seem to be

704
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:47,000
almost none associated with high end speed. So that means you really think about what are the possible confounders and the desire, study and collect those terrible.

705
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:52,000
In the first place, right if you don't collect those variable you'll study.

706
02:09:52,000 --> 02:10:02,000
You can have already analyze them. right so that's my study design. very important part of the original study, especially right or random, as trial is not a big deal.

707
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:15,000
If you randomize you don't even care because every compiler is being run on my dog what other possible confounders and try to clap all of them.

708
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:20,000
New York. say the collection, if you don't do that and you are missing.

709
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Why important, controller, there's no way right you can you can figure it out later on.

710
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Right. So statistical analysis cannot save you of that study.

711
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Design alright any question or for this particular scenario.

712
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Can you say age could also be a co-founder amongst undergraduates which is graduate students?

713
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Or is that like? not, it definitely could be. But without the data on age we cannot say anything.

714
02:10:53,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Right.

715
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Yeah, And the other thing is that if you look at the gender right within gender, the high and the speed has no correlation any more. Then we don't worry about age anymore, right?

716
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Because there's already no association right so there are people of different age.

717
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Probably in May on the females already. but if the partition goes away once, you would just for gender.

718
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Of course you have each day like i'm putting the model but since we don't.

719
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:34,000
We are making cases right. it's more likely that age has nothing to do with this.

720
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I thought actually, I think young people drive after but that's just my thought right and without data, you can hypothetize anything.

721
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Gotcha So it's very important for you to have a apologist, and then design experiment and use data to validate or refusal.

722
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:05,000
If you don't do that, right you just collect data and then look at the data trying to make up explanations. you can always make a 1,000 different donation, and many of them are wrong, right?

723
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:14,000
That's fine part of the driven size is very important and while design well, design experiment is very important.

724
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Any other questions.

725
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Okay. So now let's take another break for 10Â min, and Then after that we work on 9 8 together.

726
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:41,000
But you know, after the day these stop made 90 and quizzes are deal. Tomorrow morning, Okay, tomorrow we're gonna start a new lecture.

727
02:12:41,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I'm article in your regression see you after 10Â min

728
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Hey, Dr. Here, how are you? Yes, please,

729
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I have a question in in the last project. be the one that we just did.

730
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Cool in like, for example, you in your answer for the question you plot male versus female, right? Yeah.

731
02:14:49,000 --> 02:15:03,000
But if you week we change the order like put female in mail, would we get different with all of like would be per yeah in the parameters?

732
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Okay. Very good question. That is one of the exam questions when I teach this course.

733
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
So? very good question. So, depending on what you mean by result, right?

734
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:16,000
So the correlation will not change, because correlation is symmetric.

735
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:20,000
When you see the core, when you say the correlation it's R.

736
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Is square and brighter. Yeah, our our itself will not change. Of course.

737
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Our square will also not change, because no, the R. will not change.

738
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Therefore the company name of R would not change the pivot, for R would not change.

739
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Our square would not change right by the the regression line.

740
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
The inters have the slope, they will change right because they they are hasty.

741
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Metric in the definition. So the even the mean square error will change, because mean square error is not symmetry, but the p value for the slope will not change because of the slope is the same as the

742
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:02,000
pivotal for the R. right so basically you've got a different regression line, which is still significant.

743
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:12,000
But the line itself will be different. I try to do it here now, and I got a different Islope P.

744
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Value you will get a different slope.

745
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Yeah, you would get a different slope for sure and we'll have the same pivot at the previous note.

746
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Yeah. but the the yeah, all right. But the relationship is to the same.

747
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:40,000
All right. I got it. Yeah, there's still still strongly or something that that conclusion doesn't change Alright, Thank you.

748
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:47,000
You're welcome

749
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Yeah, go ahead I have a question, and the question for is the correlation between firearm related.

750
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Suicide rates of men and women, so that can you can you?

751
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Can you explain that answer? Again we provide evidence for your answer.

752
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Is that correlation

753
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Yeah. let me open it.

754
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Hi, Paul! ready! Close the window! Oh.

755
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Question for you right. Is there a collection bd far i'm ready?

756
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:50,000
So it's already. a man and a woman yes, we did a analysis. Alright, if you still remember, and the the correlation is very high above 0 point.

757
02:17:50,000 --> 02:18:02,000
9, right. So there is a I remember I i'd have it here a strong, positive correlation.

758
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I missed that part of the attention

759
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I will actually share all the answer. Keys of all exercise.

760
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:38,000
After a long lecture, so you can't do that now review them whenever you need

761
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:44,000
So there is a question in the chat just in terms of Scatterpot.

762
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,000
The correlation. Strength has nothing to do with the slope, only with the dispersion.

763
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Yeah, that is fine. The party has slope. They are associated but they're not the same thing.

764
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
They always have the same direction. they always have the same sign.

765
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Oh, their strength depends on the unit of acts on Y.

766
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
The unit of what? Oh, X and y right, what do you?

767
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:34,000
?

768
02:19:34,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Okay, i'll be back quickly

769
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Okay, let's continue so for the rest of time today.

770
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:13,000
We work on 9, 8 together. it's a long exercise so for the sake of time.

771
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:23,000
We'll do it. the gap so if again about this football and the concussion paper which we work on before.

772
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:29,000
At that time. Remember, we did 2 samples he has and a noba analysis right now.

773
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Let's look at the same data, but now let's now do regression.

774
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:40,000
So this is to learn the link between ethic regret them is actually the more general than to simultaneously.

775
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:46,000
That's all. So first let's use excel sheet to feed the line.

776
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Why, where's this at your wise reaction time access year of football experience?

777
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I see what we do. reaction time for the experience. So the data is here.

778
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Reaction, time and which one is which a wise reaction, time, access, food by experience cool.

779
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:19,000
So I copy reaction time with Here is why and copy years of football experience.

780
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Who here is that? So what we got here is a reaction.

781
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Time versus year of football appearance, we see we have a negative association.

782
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Hello, Mitch is the more for put like the more years.

783
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:43,000
The food box. Here is the lower, the reaction time Here I assume the smaller the reaction time, the thought that they react.

784
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Oh, maybe not actually I don't know how do they imagine how this reference time, probably in many seconds, or something like that.

785
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:55,000
If that's the case the you know the more experience you will have you react faster.

786
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:02,000
That makes sense right? And the R square is 0 point 2, one alright.

787
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:10,000
The slope is negative. The question was, the those years football experience have a stronger association.

788
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Yeah. and the answer is, Well, this is the modeling association, right?

789
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
So it it it is in the and subjective to call it.

790
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:28,000
But personally, I think I don't know from below point 3 is like a week.

791
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Right point. 3 to point 7 or point 8, maybe. fish is moderate, about point.

792
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:39,000
8 is strong, I mean it's the subit it's subjective. but this number is definitely bothering or week to monitor.

793
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:45,000
It will stay right. And the Our Square is also not very high.

794
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Okay, And then the same thing for

795
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:58,000
People have us volume that's why

796
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Same same level of moderate association negative. So the more your experience. the smaller the people.

797
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Cameras by. I suppose That's something that's bad thing. Yeah, Actually, i'm not that sure the reaction time was mattering the the thing for reaction. You may also be may possibly be you know the more the experience You react actually

798
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:34,000
slower. I really don't know what they month anyone has idea i'll react.

799
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:40,000
And I would define. Okay, in their conclusion of paper the exercise.

800
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:49,000
That's no got a paper, a corner on safer Okay, concluded.

801
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Years of football experience. Also, currently with slower reactor time after we reactive time.

802
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Smaller one is, the is slower. I was actually, honestly wrong.

803
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,000
So actually, the more years we played actually react so lower, not faster.

804
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Any question here first one is pretty straightforward, as I will move on quickly

805
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:23,000
The second regression is to regress why on act same thing.

806
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:28,000
But your wise, you know, with my experience, reaction, time, and people kind of volume.

807
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:41,000
All of these are continues, Remember, in regression the wise continue, you know, access concussion, access, actually binary here.

808
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
So with concussion, with operator, we are ignoring the control group.

809
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
We just come compare the football player with over doctrine, cutter.

810
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:52,000
So if you're access I provider if you recall in regression, we require y to be continuous.

811
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:59,000
But we have never actually said whether X can be has to be confused actually actually can be binary.

812
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:03,000
So let's do it

813
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Let's get concussion the concert here is 0 and one binary.

814
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Previously. We use concussion to analyze, you know.

815
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:21,000
2 group Tpas right. But now we are doing continue.

816
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:28,000
This is concussion, and the people kind of us volume you see, it's very funny when actually is binary right.

817
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,000
The scalar pop look very funny because you only have 2 violets. There are 2 groups.

818
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Remember that was 2 sample tasks We did before, but nevertheless, we can still run a regression, and there's a regression line.

819
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:49,000
There are, you thought correlation. There is everything else works right, and the slope is negative and sticking everything

820
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Okay, So we just hope of focus on these people Cameras volume.

821
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:00,000
But the other 2. Why are the same For the sake of time that spoken of the third one we find an inter side.

822
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:19,000
We find a slow, So that's now move on to question Number 3, because in projects 7, 8 would did this While we were analyzing this data, using it assembly

823
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Last. Now to go back to it, and do it again and I know it.

824
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Take time, but it's actually very fun let's go back through the scratch.

825
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:50,000
He find the 2 sample t has sheet to sample he has let's see what we get

826
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,000
This is the 2 sample key type let's get the same data.

827
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Alright compassion. The people kind of volume get the same data into some of these that

828
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:07,000
The group should be 0, and one instead of one, and the 2.

829
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:14,000
So now you'll see the group mean as a difference right and the sample size.

830
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:19,000
The T statistic is 3.0, 9 viole is 0 point 0 0 3.

831
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Just bear with me to remember this number briefly I know it's hard.

832
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I have a very bad short of memory. Just the right. The first group is higher, second number is lower.

833
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,000
There is a group difference. there's a piece that is 3.0 9.

834
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:39,000
There's a P. out of 0 point 0 0 3 that's come back.

835
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:47,000
The first group is higher, the second group is lower there's a There's a slope there is a t statistic minus 3.0.

836
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,000
One Oh, 9, there's a pivotal 0 point 0 3.

837
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:54,000
You would notice that these statistics are the same, you know you can all assign.

838
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:00,000
The pivot is identical

839
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:08,000
This is not by coincidence, Okay, i'll explain a little.

840
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:27,000
I'll explain a little use my why board i'm really appreciate the capability of being able to write on my ipad so

841
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:43,000
So in a simple integration, we have sorry in 2,000 right

842
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:51,000
We have group, one group, 2 we have oh, X, one bar x, 2 bar.

843
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:59,000
We have other things right, you know, as one as 2. Do you want sample size we call n one and 2.

844
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:04,000
We have all of this right? Why, essentially, what we did is that, yeah?

845
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:14,000
That you know, simple in your regression

846
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:24,000
We have. Why, on that? Well, here, when we apply the same type of data, the access is binary, right?

847
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Hex is 0 for group, one Texas, one for group, 2

848
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Excuse me so. what's happening is that when you fix the way you fit the model Y equals a plus bx right fit this model.

849
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Well, how far is that? Well access 0, which means y equals that plus the arrow right?

850
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Why is a plus bx i plus ei the yi equals state plus Dr.

851
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Well, next is one Yi equals 8 plus b plus Dr.

852
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:11,000
So that's interpretation. So from this what you can see that in the end A.

853
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Will be the best pay will simply be X one bar. Hello!

854
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Sorry. No. yeah. the November is really screwed up.

855
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:28,000
So let me take off here. let's suppose in the original data we call the Y one Y 2.

856
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Because why is the measurement? Okay, Access the code. So in this case, hey, you will be Y one bar and will be the group men of the first group, and then from the second wife I figured out B will simply be Y 2 Bar minus Y

857
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:50,000
one bar.

858
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:58,000
So essentially a way of fixing pulling your brand model on group data where you're called the 2 group has access to 0 equals one.

859
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:06,000
You're you're slow we're intercept will be the group. me of the first group Your slope will be the difference of the group.

860
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Mean? okay for them all. Remember the hypothesis of H.

861
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Not P. equals 0 in the in the simple regression that we all have all of this versus H.

862
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:29,000
A B is not equal to 0. that in this case translates to it's not same mu.

863
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:32,000
One equals mu 2, because the 2 group have the same mean, hey?

864
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Hey? new one not equal to new right because the the slope the slow.

865
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,000
It's basically the difference between the 2 group mean passing whether the slope is 0.

866
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I mean this should be Beta equals 0 because we are having the parameter of the population right?

867
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,000
He's just the activate right passing whether the slope is 0 or not.

868
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:04,000
It's equivalent to happening whether the 2 group have the same mean

869
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Any question on this before I go back to the for the spreadsheet

870
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Okay.

871
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Let me go back

872
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Alright. So in this case, you see, the industry is 3,206, that's the same thing as the the first group meet. the 2 group.

873
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Difference is 344.5, not the same as the slope, but with negative sign.

874
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Right. they develop which group subtract this reach group right?

875
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,000
So, because you're attacking the same no it turns out that he statistics and people are the same ignoring the sign.

876
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Decide, even though which group you put first

877
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:42,000
So this is not by Co. isn't it is by default, which means you could apply the simple integration to 2 group data.

878
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Just call the X at 0 to one right. Put the y there.

879
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:53,000
I got the same answer. you're you're certainly running the same path I had to.

880
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:00,000
You know, distinguish a little bit because the 2 sample T. That's a different version, and the Stimuli version is, you call it one version of it.

881
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:07,000
There are other virtual which is not so equivalent where they assume different group have different standard deviation, right convergence.

882
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:13,000
We use is when they have the same standard deviation. the 2 group have the same standard deviation can do this if they have done, they don't have a different version of food.

883
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I would do that which is not quite important to this, but those are beyond this fourth

884
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:09,000
I think you're muted

885
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Sorry, always forgot, I don't know why I was muted thanks for letting it know. Yeah, So that's why regression is more flexible, and in general you can run with regression on all kinds of data regardless access continuously

886
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:33,000
binary. It all makes sense after even if y is binary and access also binder, you can still run the regression.

887
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:41,000
You got something all of it. Okay, there. there are other, you know, battle type of regression like, not just regarding how, a later on.

888
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:47,000
But if you just write them on any working, you still get something holiday

889
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:53,000
So some of the tools are designed for some type of data like, you know the 2. Very well.

890
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:02,000
You can apply it, you know, in the more general setting. As long as you know, the the pros and cons and the limitation, you know of each 2 an army is using them.

891
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:07,000
They should be fine

892
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Okay. Number 4. Yes. So i'm not going to do I I only did people kind of volume here, right?

893
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:26,000
I'm not going to do years a football experience or reaction time, but they are the same star we can try as an exercise after one number 4.

894
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Use regretments, pressure to fail. regression line where we have reaction time versus people.

895
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Campus volume. Okay, let's. do it so Now we have reckon time he will go, so people come with volume will be the act and reaction time.

896
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Oh, this is very funny if I take X and Y at the same value.

897
02:42:54,000 --> 02:43:01,000
This has an example. You got a perfectly fitted line Right inside is 0.

898
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:05,000
The slope is perfectly one. Your t statistic after you go through infinity.

899
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:11,000
That's why you blow up right your pp value should be exactly 0 here.

900
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,000
But you know. so i'm hoping a lot the art you know is 0.

901
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:18,000
The comedy interval is from one of the R.

902
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Is one coming from one to one. A pivotal is exactly exactly 0.

903
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:26,000
The r squared is one means per 0. This one should be 0 to some other.

904
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:36,000
The scratchy prolong. But this is what we've got, we have a perfectly linearly related data right access itself just for demonstration.

905
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:46,000
So from the data we got the year. I think the reaction time racking time on people Channels volume.

906
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:51,000
We see that we have a positive association week rounded you a week, though right, and P.

907
02:43:51,000 --> 02:44:00,000
By always, you know, marginally significant. Okay, the word. Go back here.

908
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Number 4. Bye: Okay, is 0 0 point 0 3 bye sticking everything.

909
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Moda greatly and the r equals 0 point again.

910
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:44,000
It's up week regression or weak correlation. Okay, So remember, previously, we regret reaction time on years of food voice here, and also people kind of volume all of the regretting time and people kind of

911
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:59,000
logging. so essentially, we have 3 models here. let me draw a little bit

912
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:09,000
What this is year of football experience, Sorry for for short porting, though this is the reaction time.

913
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:15,000
This is people countless volume. We know these are Wiki weekly, or maybe these are moderately.

914
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
These are weekly associated. all of them are associated with each other. right.

915
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:31,000
This association has no direction. This is R equals minus 0 point 4, 5.

916
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Something like that is R goes minus 0 point. 4 5 is R.

917
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Equals 0 point 3 right? So they all associated positively or negatively.

918
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:46,000
And the the question asked you to explain right which one might be causing, which apparently we never know.

919
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Oh, what's your star right so the correlation has no direction. The regression has a direction, but it's obviously decided right.

920
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
When we regret we take one that's why the other ones are.

921
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:03,000
But we could possibly take the other one. as Why, the otherwise act right so supposedly we should take the the I'll comments.

922
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Why exposure as acts? We should, you know, some help.

923
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:13,000
The differentiated explosion outcome based on our knowledge now based on the data, the data doesn't have a direction.

924
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:20,000
So in this particular result, right? What do you think could be the underlying direction for this graph?

925
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:50,000
How do you, Paul?

926
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:12,000
By no means. i'm i'm an expert in like a brain sort of all of you, right?

927
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:21,000
But what you can think about is that the year of football experience is, I like it to be affected by either of this.

928
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:27,000
It's more likely that the the year of football experience will have an impact on people.

929
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Come along with right, and then it's unlikely that the reactant time will probably impact on people have a volume, but rather this way, right?

930
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:39,000
The people have a volume might have an impact on reaction.

931
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Time or the year of football experience might have other background.

932
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:53,000
We have some time right so i'm drawing these arrows based on my no, you've understanding of the sort of a reality here which may not be right at all.

933
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:59,000
And there may be a lot more other factors we didn't consider here, right.

934
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:13,000
You could argue. Actually, the year of football here is, you know, in some degree may also be impacted here, because you know, if you react slowly, that you are no longer to be as a happier as a professional player, that you may quit your

935
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:23,000
career early, right? So you know the puzzle sort of a thing. it's very hard to draw, because that radar knowledge and your experience and your argument.

936
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:27,000
All of those are sort of a subjective from the data.

937
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:38,000
We cannot say the data. only this association Okay, i'm just going some plausible arrows from my limited understanding of the biology here.

938
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Any comments, but by knowing if they are the truth. Hello!

939
02:48:46,000 --> 02:49:08,000
At most there are my hypothesis. Any problem on any question

940
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Okay, Let's now move on to 6 and 7 they are again to do with some of question in the textbook.

941
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:21,000
You know i'm attaching the pdf here Okay, let's answer this question.

942
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:28,000
This is a hospital on the Y play, though. So the Great Britain office the population.

943
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:37,000
And and and you know, censors and surveys, they collect the data on the random sample.

944
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:41,000
One in the sanctuary call by in Britain. Hi!

945
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:51,000
There are record their age and height. How on the what this kind of plot on the lap shows the one stage against husband's age on the pollen Right?

946
02:49:51,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Oh, shows the white wives. Hi again, husband! hi! So my first question is, it has time in the Louis presenting here right what the so-called subject you find.

947
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:14,000
This done what you know, what is a subject in this study?

948
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Couples exactly. Each couple is a subject so the husband's wife husband's, pipe, wife, age, husbands you know age.

949
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:28,000
These are just 4 different variables. if you are all of this data site.

950
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:36,000
You have a table of 170 by cool 4 columns, so it's not individual.

951
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:43,000
It's a couple no number 8 right i'll do that relationship between husband and wife's age.

952
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:52,000
It's a left figure here

953
02:50:52,000 --> 02:51:05,000
The older the husband, the older the wife yeah that that that's true right There's a I I guess what is the possible to to to say, is a positive, strong correlation, a strong, positive correlation.

954
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:10,000
And then here is a I will say, is a weak, positive correlation.

955
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Is that right? So yeah, I want to guess this correlation may be above point 8.

956
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Right, maybe point 9. This is a pop point, 2 point, 3 or something.

957
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Oh, even lower, and which plough has a stronger correlation.

958
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:30,000
I guess we're not to say this one definitely has stronger correlation, right?

959
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:36,000
So the last question I want you to answer right now. The height was measuring, anxious.

960
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:53,000
If we convert them to 7 meters who the carnation change

961
02:51:53,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Anyone

962
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I feel like it should not change it's just different units.

963
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Yeah, that's right so correlation is independent of the unit of measurement.

964
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:26,000
So you can think about when you change it. When you change the units, you just change the number here, right?

965
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:32,000
This for example, this 70 become like a one. I know 1 80.

966
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Hi just change the number. Here the pl stay the same if the pause stay the same.

967
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:42,000
The correlation. Stay the same you've got correlation measures the strength absolutely right.

968
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:48,000
You could actually shit right. If you shift the access this 60 becomes 0. then this become 15.

969
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:58,000
The plot also. don't change so correlation is independent of any scaling and shifting of the measure.

970
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Thank you very much. And the final question, There are 4 feature here, and there are full correlation here, and you have to match them.

971
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:19,000
So, for example, R. equals minus 0 point 7. Which figure do you think that come from

972
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Or number 4, I only this one has a strong negative correlation. R.

973
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Equals 0 point 4, 5, which one

974
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:45,000
You 1 one. Why is that I was gonna guess C is 3 in.

975
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:54,000
E is 2, these 2. Yeah, these 2 correct? apparently right.

976
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:58,000
This is a strong holiday, so I think, we have to look at one and 3 right.

977
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Which one do you think I will hire or positive partition i'll change my answer.

978
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Yeah, I think you're right right here this is nonlinear.

979
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:27,000
So calculus correlation. first of all doesn't make sense. A part of the graph is negative on Pop on the other part is positive. So in the end, actually, if you compute it, the card is almost 0 here are this up slightly you know

980
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:34,000
positive trunk. The cars are actually turned out. That we are is 0 point 4, 5.

981
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Any question.

982
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Okay, that's cool. Yeah, i'm sorry I didn't give you enough time to work on 7 B 90, because I you know some more electron will finish.

983
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:12,000
But before we move on again wrap up a little bit about the correlation lecture

984
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:20,000
So one thing is that we talk about when we have this data is it?

985
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Why, I suppose there's 0 that I regret a lot right we talk about a standpoint.

986
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:31,000
The intersect. So in the model, y equals a plus vs.

987
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Right, hey? stands for the interests. So what does Peace stand for?

988
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:44,000
The slow. So it turns out that beef it's a little bit more complicated.

989
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:55,000
But if you take a value here, call the X one right, and then you look at the corresponding value.

990
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Why, why then, you know why on the curve, Why am I equals a plus P. X.

991
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:11,000
One. No, i'll take another value this is x one plus one. How you look at corresponding way that's called y 2.

992
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:23,000
They have y 2 equals a plus d this is x 2 equals that's cool, and that equals a plus b x one plus one.

993
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:27,000
You just, you know, Mark, but off the X one plus B.

994
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:39,000
That goes 8 plus b plus B x one actually I I don't need to do this.

995
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:48,000
That equals 2 Y one last week correct wisely for y one plus t just algebra.

996
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Right so essentially what the B really stands for piece that's for Hello!

997
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:14,000
The increase in predicted What like this kind of expected? Why, or you know.

998
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Oh, hi! average while whatever you can, you can form any name rather increasing predictive.

999
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Why for unit increase the impacts. So basically these times. But if you increase X by one unit, how much changing?

1000
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Why you would expect that's the So essentially if you linked it as a triangle.

1001
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Right. So if you call off angle here, if this plus is one, then this less is B

1002
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:53,000
So that's one of the b stands book right That's why it's called a slope right It B.

1003
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Is positive. then a line trying to upwards. If these not leave the line type backwards.

1004
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:04,000
If the lines platform be 0, the the larger the beat, the more telescope.

1005
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,000
But just from this definition you'll see that both a and B.

1006
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Depend on a unit that acts from Y. R. department right?

1007
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
If you change the unit, the both A and B will change.

1008
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:24,000
But that are the correlation with Not here

1009
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Any questions on this slide

1010
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Okay.

1011
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:52,000
The other thing I want to talk about is no one to use which the physical methods right?

1012
02:58:52,000 --> 02:59:04,000
So there are many, many scenario that's less personal cap, You know you have one

1013
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:27,000
One variable right, you're gonna have one marble there you have for example, if it's you, if that marvel is is binary, they use one sample

1014
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Proportion, have

1015
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:45,000
If that variable is continuous, the obvious one sample you have

1016
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:48,000
You that are about this other thing. I don't know what other day could be.

1017
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:56,000
But you might, you know, other part of a pet. if you have 2 variable

1018
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:03,000
But that really depends. You have a bigger table view, right

1019
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:07,000
The tour, depending on, you know, hacks on the what right?

1020
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:15,000
If apps is binary, well access continues I don't know what other actually could have like.

1021
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:24,000
But why is binary? The why is continue Why is categorical?

1022
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:30,000
And there are other wife. But no, why could be so

1023
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:33,000
So they are a big table, and they're managed you can do right, if possible.

1024
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Xy or binary. you can do the Chi squared half.

1025
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:42,000
You go to the 2 sample proportion has.

1026
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:56,000
You could also don't need your graphic but that's where you use, and if access continues, you know if I could buy the wise, continue, then you have 2 samples you have

1027
03:00:56,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Sorry about the handwriting. And then you could also do regression right single in your regression that you could do. bye.

1028
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:09,000
By the way, why is categorical to those high school at that?

1029
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:14,000
But other things. For example, there are parts, regression. there are other things more.

1030
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:20,000
The month you've access continuous wise binary that's very funny.

1031
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:26,000
You've got to use something called a logist regression.

1032
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Okay, that's what we're gonna talk about later Friday.

1033
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:34,000
Let's regret it also covers this case as well, so as well as why is binary.

1034
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:42,000
I use a specific question if both X and y are continuous use the you know. simple linear regression right?

1035
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:47,000
That's so awful if wise categorical access continues.

1036
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:54,000
You could studious regression, but you need to use the Federal coding scheme. And here you also use cost regression.

1037
03:01:54,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Yeah. Then there are more sophisticated schemes where you have 3 variable

1038
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:15,000
You know, 3 plus variables. Now, what you use it's multiple regression

1039
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:21,000
The regression contains multiple linear regression and multiple of this regards to multiple cost regret that depend on different kind of outcome.

1040
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:24,000
So the model regression is the tool where you have 3 or more.

1041
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Actually it also works when you have 2, 2 or more. right.

1042
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:31,000
So the regression is the fundamental tool we have different kind of data.

1043
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:37,000
That's why we start from simple But now we you know going towards the the

1044
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:48,000
The more complicated case. Okay, on the

1045
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:56,000
You know you don't have to take notes here because I will show you

1046
03:02:56,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Hold on a second

1047
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Now you know how to look at this right?

1048
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:20,000
So, for example, if you want to say week, the physical tool.

1049
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Hmm! I used right. There are many, many papers. Are you kind of figure out, depending on the hybrid data develop type of study?

1050
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:32,000
I I would like to look at it. The no, they are tables.

1051
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:39,000
They are decision diagram, right? and look at why your life So you want this one That's pretty much the type of you know payable.

1052
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:42,000
I just showed. Of course they are more sophisticated.

1053
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Right. But, for example, this one sorry, and I make it bigger right.

1054
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:53,000
So that depend on the type of data, right nominal data.

1055
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Or you know data, right? If you have continuous day in a different type, right?

1056
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:04,000
And also different type of y right? They have different type of mathematics, path or model.

1057
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:09,000
And down here right one sample, 2 sample K sample, right?

1058
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:14,000
Different contacts, right guys for our past. And then the the key has right.

1059
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:27,000
They also have a lot more, because they also cover, you know, independent sample, dependent sample. you cover, you know parametric, non-parametric. You remember the talk about Cruisco Wallace has right Now, you need to

1060
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:39,000
think many, many, many courses to get all of them. But but the basic idea is that you know you use different kind of tests or different model dependent on data.

1061
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:45,000
And also if you come back there also decision graphs like this right which passes.

1062
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:49,000
I use right? Let me ask you what kind of data you've got this great data.

1063
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:52,000
You have 2 group. you have nonpayer right? and so on.

1064
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:55,000
The issues Chi-squared has, or feature exact, has right.

1065
03:04:55,000 --> 03:05:00,000
You have continuous data. You have 2 group, you have nonpaired. You do.

1066
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Tpa bye, and so on. So if you have now normal data they use Will Coxon or you know, basically essentially, you can find this kind of label or or physician diagram a lot more detail than the one I just showed

1067
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
you right, because I only talk about things I talk about in cost.

1068
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:21,000
This is just one cost, right? But essentially this final diagram is everywhere.

1069
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:26,000
You have fine any question, and there's another one I I figure.

1070
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:31,000
But you want to compare with that. You compare 2 unpaired samples.

1071
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:37,000
The those unpaired teeth have, or you know, depend on the continuous use. key test, categorical use.

1072
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Chi square or feature exact, right, you know there or you have 3 group contains all.

1073
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Come, you don't want me to no longer right so essentially I told you a few things in the table which are the most widely used.

1074
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:56,000
But there are a lot more. other tools can be used. Okay, Any question

1075
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:03,000
I just want to give you a bigger picture of, you know, statistics, and why we have so many different tools in statistics.

1076
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:14,000
Right? any question.

1077
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Alright. Yeah, please remember to turn in ib and the perform the quiz after today's lecture. I do tomorrow morning. Now let's move on to.

1078
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:27,000
So the multiple in your book is going to take 2 days and the logic right?

1079
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:37,000
Let me take you one day dish and the only 2 partying the project of quiz for the like a 10, because the lecture dilemma will be done on Friday.

1080
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:43,000
Oh, you don't have the tie you anything afterwards

1081
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:50,000
That's move on to multiplying regression

1082
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:58,000
So multiple in your Russia is the generalization of simple and regression in the sense that single in your writing only study acts on.

1083
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:01,000
Why, what if you have a Z, We have a even more right.

1084
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:08,000
Other variables. Thank you. multiplying regression so that's the only time now we are reaching out to more than 2 variables.

1085
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Previously. Only study one or 2 variable now? let's go ahead? What do you have?

1086
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:18,000
3 variable or more multiple in regression is the way to do so.

1087
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:22,000
Again. we go back to the It's got a Plot of gun ownership.

1088
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:26,000
This is Kan ownership. This is a suicide rate in math.

1089
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:32,000
But what if we also ought to consider the women suicide rate into consideration?

1090
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:37,000
How do we do with that

1091
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:41,000
Here is also we can study Mayo versus email. Who is our rate?

1092
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:46,000
We can do all the pairwise analysis, how we want to put them into one picture, one model.

1093
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:57,000
How do we do it? Okay. So this is the tool regression, the first one being fire ownership.

1094
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:01,000
You know male suits are right now, far all evolution.

1095
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:05,000
The second one being male suicide, is a female suicide.

1096
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:08,000
We did both in our exercise. We got this 2, you know, table.

1097
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Of course they have different intercepts flow. Both are singular, because both are highly associated.

1098
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Right. Just compare this to model. which one do you prefer, And what can anyone tell me which model you think feed the data battle

1099
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:41,000
I would pick the second model because the r squared is higher, which means that the model.

1100
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:55,000
It's the data better thank you yeah you are right? Everything else he called R Square is better, which means a little more more variation in males which are really explained by females which are written by our ownership,

1101
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
which is also you see the the pivotal.

1102
03:08:57,000 --> 03:09:13,000
Both are significant. but the piece that this is higher right? is the case when you have equal sample size, we don't have equal samples that you know things are not so cleaning, consistent, You know, talking too much on the slow because the slope depend on the

1103
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:20,000
unit by the slope can go up and talk to another unit view you'll measure but nevertheless the second model piece about everything else equal.

1104
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:26,000
However, that doesn't mean you'll always use the second model, because you build a model trying to make crack the invitation right?

1105
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:33,000
This. The first model has an invitation where you know fire ownership in the State is associated with mail suicide written.

1106
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:47,000
That's very useful, and you know interesting knowledge but the second one is less interesting, right, you know, female male please already associate with each other. Well, that doesn't mean much by myself, right, because there must be something underlying driving this right?

1107
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:55,000
So you pick them out of according to your 30. Now, the quality which model has up R squared.

1108
03:09:55,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Okay, So the association between me and the female parameter.

1109
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:06,000
So it's a great it's very strong but it's unlikely that male is causing female vice versa.

1110
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:13,000
Right. So something else is underlying right. So to really study that strong association, we need to find the compounders right.

1111
03:10:13,000 --> 03:10:27,000
There could be many things happening on the State level, For example, rural versus urban living by access to mindual health, unemployment rate, or anything like final ownership is one thing, but there could be many others How do I put all

1112
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:37,000
of this back into consideration. we try to explain the the variation. The male suicide rate of females recently by the idea is on you.

1113
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:50,000
If we, after we control for any of this factor or many of these factors, the association between file ownership and mail suits are read, either diminish or vanish, or even go to the different direction that means that association

1114
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:56,000
is, is furious because you have so many variable in the world.

1115
03:10:56,000 --> 03:11:00,000
You have a 1 million variable. If you measure a parabola, there definitely be.

1116
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:05,000
Some of them are probably associated that by itself is not surprising at all right.

1117
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:10,000
It's only interesting when they they are some you know how's already there between them?

1118
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:18,000
And then, you know, looking at all the confoundings might help you to better polish or hypothesis.

1119
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:25,000
So that's joy right So far our ownership. could potentially a fact may or fire on suicide.

1120
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:30,000
So this all have all of this, and they are turned out to be associated.

1121
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:38,000
But we need to consider the other component. For example, maybe email phone related to suicide is associated with both.

1122
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:44,000
Once we adjust for this. Maybe this associate will go away.

1123
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:48,000
Okay, so don't take this face value of this variable too much right.

1124
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:53,000
Just think about. We have 3 variables right. Any of the 2 can be associated.

1125
03:11:53,000 --> 03:12:05,000
So how do you put all 3 in the same model. Well, maybe after a dropping for the third variable, the original 2 variable no longer associated.

1126
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:11,000
If that's the case. that means the third one Could be a confounded Now let's you know.

1127
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:19,000
Learn the math to do it. Do it right. so Remember multiple in your regression is a generalization of simple in your regression.

1128
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:29,000
You generalized in a sense. Now we could have multiple exposure So now we don't use the word exposure anymore, because usually exposure is one variable. right?

1129
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:41,000
So we use different world. So first of all, always, why stands for sometimes people say, Why is the dependent, variable right, and ask, could be the exposure?

1130
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:47,000
Could be the treatment right could be the group when actually 0, one could be the group variable group indicator.

1131
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:55,000
But acts could also become funer who in this in case actually confounded by the whole areas. Awesome?

1132
03:12:55,000 --> 03:13:03,000
Well, sometimes X is called independent, variable. So there are many name for x, many name for one, regardless in the multiple direction.

1133
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:09,000
We still have One walk, if you have multiple y that's that's called a multiple outcome regression that's a more complicated model.

1134
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:12,000
The other scale of this course. So suppose we still have one outcome.

1135
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:18,000
But we have multiple sort of a variable that can be explaining the outcome.

1136
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:22,000
So we call them X, one x, 2, right. if you call them X and Z.

1137
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:25,000
Then what do you have a cross one you'd be you run out of names? right?

1138
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:32,000
That's why part of what one like 2 with the expectation that we could have X 3 x 4, if we need.

1139
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:38,000
So in this particular model, you have y be in the mail suicide rate, x one being the power on ownership.

1140
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:41,000
X will be in the female. so it's our way but that's just our model.

1141
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:49,000
You can build a different model if you want right so trick pick which one could be wide, is really subjective.

1142
03:13:49,000 --> 03:14:05,000
Nevertheless, once you'll pick y and xy you have this model here, I want to explain what the model really mean, because in is simple in regression, we have a pretty good geometric in the potato i'll find the

1143
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:12,000
Beta right? Well, now is multiple slope. What do you really need?

1144
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:17,000
In fact, the reason we introduce simple in regression because we have a simple plot.

1145
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:23,000
There multiple you're you're in we cannot even make a plot.

1146
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:31,000
You cannot plot it. You are not really you know feeding a line there.

1147
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:36,000
Actually what's your really fitting is a hyperplane?

1148
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:42,000
So if you really want to plan monitoring your regression what's your will have?

1149
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:48,000
Is that you have 3 access right

1150
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,000
Yeah, this is x. One is x 2. This is the one.

1151
03:14:51,000 --> 03:15:06,000
And the data points are you know there's a 3 d path, and then you have a plane, you know, feature data. so it's very hard to drop, and each, you know, data point will have a in will have a projection to the point i'm

1152
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:14,000
not going to draw it, because that probably cause more trouble they help just to show you It's actually very hard to make a pot of model in your aggression.

1153
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:20,000
And then it has a plan. We have 2 access but you have 3 that that's a 4 d part.

1154
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:24,000
We cannot even imagine it right so it's going to higher dimension.

1155
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:33,000
There's no way to product so how do we you in terms of Alpha and Beta

1156
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:39,000
One way to interpret the Rick Molly on the environment model is to rearrange the terms.

1157
03:15:39,000 --> 03:15:44,000
Right here is the model. Y equals alpha beta, one x one plus beta, 2 x 2 plus some Arab.

1158
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:48,000
Now we regroup this 2 times so it's become Alpha!

1159
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:54,000
But hey, guys, too, was made the one x one plus e.

1160
03:15:54,000 --> 03:16:00,000
No, we call this term Alpha x 2. So this is how far will you consider X.

1161
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:09,000
One as your main exposure variable, and the actual as a whole, vary as a confounding, and finally also adjustable.

1162
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:17,000
So in this case, us see that by the way it's still the flow for X.

1163
03:16:17,000 --> 03:16:27,000
One. what's really changed is the intersection So now, instead of you have a fixed intercept alpha for all the data points.

1164
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:33,000
Now the intercept is changing from data point. the data point.

1165
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:40,000
Yep: So the So the data points with the same X 2 will have the same interests.

1166
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:43,000
But they the point was different. Acts Who? we have different interests.

1167
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:48,000
So you have a varying interaction that's Why explanation?

1168
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:51,000
Apparently this is arbitrary because we are grouping Act 2 right.

1169
03:16:51,000 --> 03:16:54,000
You could also do the same, grouping X one with intersect.

1170
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:56,000
Now you have a varying intercept. Depend on X.

1171
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:03,000
One. They have a sixth call for tax 2, right? We do this because we think Xy is the main variable of interest.

1172
03:17:03,000 --> 03:17:07,000
So we we care about beta one we don't really care about beta 2.

1173
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:11,000
In this case we grouped up. We are showing we have a varying intersection.

1174
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:18,000
It's just white interpretations of this model so keeping this in mind.

1175
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:26,000
Now we can do something. This very intersect right means that for every single data point we have a different intersection.

1176
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:33,000
Depend on x 2 measurement

1177
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:46,000
And how do we really draw it? It means that everything that has potentially a different regression line with very interesting

1178
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:54,000
That way. By allowing the regretful line to change the intercept, we can interpret the more variability in the data in the while.

1179
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:59,000
Right the model for you to do that

1180
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:06,000
So let's show it right this is the original data original linear aggression.

1181
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:10,000
You can already, in the female suicide rate now introducing a female service, I rate every single data point.

1182
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:15,000
I'll have a different female suicide rate they have different interests.

1183
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:21,000
That'll be very hard to draw, because we need to have like a 50 different regression line, because they all have a different in person.

1184
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:26,000
So use that, let's assume female suit high rate is categorical.

1185
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:32,000
It has only 3 levels that's possible. Now We have low females with our rate in the medium.

1186
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:50,000
It's people who are read and high people in that case all the States with low Tv who's going here and the States with intermediate and the space points and even higher you know females don't really have

1187
03:18:50,000 --> 03:19:02,000
A. So now we are basically doing a stratified analysis, and then putting them all together, You see, the black line is the original, simple in your graph. and ignoring the female suit.

1188
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:08,000
I read When you consider the female suites are rate. Now, your packet data have 3 different regression lines.

1189
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:18,000
They have the same slope because they are parallel to each other, but they have different intersect

1190
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:26,000
So the multiple in whatever in this case you know it's the 3 dash lines, because every single group have a different intercept.

1191
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:38,000
But they have the same slope that's why we understand this. I will see the slope for the dash line is smaller than the slope for the solid line, which means female suits are right?

1192
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:52,000
I explain some of the variability away. i'm dropped your you know, in fact, for the mail freezing i'll call for the final owner.

1193
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:56,000
That's what happens when you are actually it's not next next slide.

1194
03:19:56,000 --> 03:20:09,000
Any questions so far

1195
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:13,000
So this is already a simplified model, because I draw 3 lines right I'm.

1196
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:18,000
Turning a female suicide rate into a categorical variable in 3 groups.

1197
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:25,000
In reality, female space already is continuous, which means every single data point has its own slow.

1198
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:27,000
Alright. Well, all the regrets for all the data point.

1199
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:33,000
They are parallel because they have sorry there have their home intercept, but all the smoke are the same.

1200
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:42,000
They share. So that's now feed up multiple in your graph and model here.

1201
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:54,000
So basically, we've paid with fifth this model

1202
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:59,000
Okay, remember it for simple integration, although I have all the formulas.

1203
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:01,000
How do you get a? How do you got A. B How to get the key statistics?

1204
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:11,000
You probably got a standard error right here i'm not going to show you the formula, because of follow that will be super complicated has to be a matrix form is just very complicated.

1205
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:18,000
If you'll hang out take a regression force in the you know department of statistics, you know you're gonna learn or full semester.

1206
03:21:18,000 --> 03:21:21,000
How to fix something on your record models. right Now you will learn all the math behind it Right now.

1207
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:24,000
I'm going to show you but when you're parking the data.

1208
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:34,000
The software will spread out all of this right? just like a single in your regent. If you put up, put the data in the monitoring regression model software, they will give all of this.

1209
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:43,000
Essentially this is, hey, the interesting. This is a B one the slope for beta one.

1210
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:54,000
This is B 2. The has made small for beta 2 right just like simulation. Each one of them will have a standard arrow. Yeah, we'll take the ratio of the estimated versus standard error.

1211
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:58,000
You got a piece that is, you got a piece and the whole model again.

1212
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:11,000
We'll have a mean, square error. We have r square Okay, So there are anything to do with this the first question.

1213
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:24,000
You might be wondering. Remember the R. Square. is the correlation and square the correlation. But that's why interpretation of Our Square, and we also call it R Square.

1214
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:29,000
Here. But what correlation are you squaring? But there are 3 variable.

1215
03:22:29,000 --> 03:22:38,000
You could have 3 parallelized correlation. which one are you squaring

1216
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:43,000
Okay, i'll answer that question, and then call it and for the day.

1217
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:49,000
So in the simple integration, the R is the correlation between X and Y.

1218
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:55,000
But here you have a Y. Well, you have x one x 2, right.

1219
03:22:55,000 --> 03:23:02,000
So. which one are you putting here in the correlation

1220
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:06,000
It turns out that the correlation between X and Y equals the correlation.

1221
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:15,000
Did you a plus bx, and one because remember correlation doesn't change when you'll scare our data away or shift your data.

1222
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:19,000
This is where you both scale and shift your data the card doesn't change.

1223
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:24,000
And what is this? This is so called the Y hat, the predicted one.

1224
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:29,000
So in the single integration, the correlation is both between X and Y.

1225
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:34,000
Also between the predictive y, and observe the wine

1226
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:43,000
Now that problem solved, this is the part of your ly brought in the cottage between y and a plus B one x one plus b 2 x 2.

1227
03:23:43,000 --> 03:23:52,000
So it's This is why half again so you manual integration, the quality between the again, the ex you know the observe the log on the predictive one.

1228
03:23:52,000 --> 03:24:01,000
It's not a partition between why and any act is the partition between the Y and the combination of both acts

1229
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:07,000
Okay. So

1230
03:24:07,000 --> 03:24:14,000
So the R square here is higher, which means the correlation is higher, which means the predictive.

1231
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:17,000
Why approximate the 2 wide battle, which means the model.

1232
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:25,000
Explain more variation. You will see that this is not by coincidence, by adding a variable your model.

1233
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:28,000
You always increase the elsewhere, sometimes a little, sometimes a lot.

1234
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:39,000
In this time a lot, so you should not aspire looking at R squared to determine which model is better, because even if you had a noise variable has nothing to do with outcome.

1235
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:46,000
The correlator R squared still will increase. tiny bit

1236
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:53,000
And then you see, many things change right, the slow change even for the for the slope for power ownership.

1237
03:24:53,000 --> 03:25:07,000
This way it's very high. This one is much lower and the the pivot actually drop, you know, become less segregated and still very single again by the piece that did drop which means a periodic increase the mean square always

1238
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:13,000
decreased, ours are always increased, the full decrease.

1239
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:17,000
I want the calling to stop now and the continue tomorrow. Yeah.

1240
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:34,687
If you have questions, please let me know otherwise i'll see you tomorrow and the piece I remember the turning in exercise for the for the electronic.
