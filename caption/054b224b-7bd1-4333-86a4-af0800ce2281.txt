1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,060
Well, good morning, everyone. Look, you had a good long weekend.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:23,970
So for today, I guess you were supposed to watch those three prerecorded lectures kind of go over if you have any questions.

3
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,700
And then there was a quiz related to that.

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,330
We'll go to that quiz, see if anyone has any questions.

5
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,710
And then I have a practice problem so that we can work on in class.

6
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:54,030
And then we will work on it in groups. So maybe we can we also kind of set up the groups or the problem sets that I think

7
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,000
the first problems that will be posted today should open up today after class and.

8
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,100
Well, that that would be. That would be good work.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:14,580
So the problems. So we can we can just get started and assign ourselves into groups today.

10
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,080
Yeah. Um. Um.

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:28,980
Couple things I know. I'm still missing couple of people who did not do the integrity integrity pledge.

12
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,260
So please, if you still have not done that, send the home page.

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,450
Go ahead and do it. You get five points for doing it and then think there's another due date.

14
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:51,530
So I'm going to start emailing you soon if if it's not done else.

15
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,810
Yeah. So maybe that we can get started. Were there any questions about those three lectures?

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,940
So these are like important introductory lectures.

17
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:15,960
I know how familiar well all the information is, but it's important to be able to know what is an area,

18
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,570
what is this that you don't need, like, you know, tie up with, tie, that kind of stuff.

19
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,370
I mean, questions. Yeah.

20
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:41,760
Um, when you went over how to calculate the degrees of freedom, you were saying to number of genotypes minus the number of parameters estimated.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,420
Can you explain a bit more about what you mean, number of parameters estimated and like how you find that number?

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:56,579
Yeah, I love this. I would say it's this one, I think.

23
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:11,540
Right? That's right.

24
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:21,320
So the question is regarding the Chi Square statistics that we calculate for hard fought, hard to win equilibrium.

25
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,950
So whenever we're testing whether our population is in how hard they went broke or not, we do calculate.

26
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:39,560
We do. We have a population, we have an observed number of individuals and each in each of those genotype groups.

27
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:46,760
So that's CHI statistics is meant to test how much deviation we have in that number of observed

28
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:54,530
people from what we would expect is the population is actually under quality one third equilibrium.

29
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,429
So we would just apply what we know about the probabilities like probability of having an annual times of probability

30
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:08,750
that big eight times the probability with the big A and then try to calculate how it's the expected number of people.

31
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:18,410
So the CHI statistic would test how much deviation we have from this expected population.

32
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,309
And then so it's a degree of freedom.

33
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:29,330
This is like a concept of, let's say, have you see like an estimate.

34
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,160
Well, so we we do have those same genotypes.

35
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:51,170
So those would be the number of so those would be okay.

36
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:57,830
So in this scenario and the party one want we know that we know the probability of one of those things.

37
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,170
So the probability of little a and little age that would be Q Q squared.

38
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,180
Right. So just by knowing this one quantity, which is the Q,

39
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:20,480
we're able to tell what is P and calculate those so that the one degree of freedom is coming from the fact that you only need to know one,

40
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:28,670
one parameter if you want to be able to get the genotype of the other two.

41
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:39,770
And I've seen this formula, the degrees of freedom, I think I've seen it written as the number of genotypes minus the number of LDL,

42
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,370
and that would slightly make make it more intuitive.

43
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,550
So if you have three genotypes and you have two illegals, then that would be one degree of freedom.

44
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,280
So that it's typically the number of observations minus one.

45
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360
And then but here we do have the number of parameters estimated.

46
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,870
So if you have a try a little snip.

47
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,300
So that would that would be what do you think, what would be the degrees of freedom for that?

48
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:20,360
So try have a look snip we have six genotypes, so six genotypes and then minus the number of three.

49
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,230
Then that would be three degrees of freedom. Is that does that clarify it or.

50
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:37,159
Yeah, so it's basically how many quantities can actually vary and how much you would know just by knowing that one quantity and in this case,

51
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:48,290
just by knowing. P, we would know. Q And then you actually have one of the few questions that.

52
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,270
What? What would we need the degrees of freedom for?

53
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,980
Like, what does it tell us? So what does it tell us?

54
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,870
So. So the chi. So whenever we have the chi statistic.

55
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,960
So that's like that is our.

56
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:24,560
Our measure of testing. Whether and whether our population is actually is following is under hardly one word, equilibrium or not.

57
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,270
And then the case, the chi squares.

58
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,390
I don't know if you've ever seen the chi square tables, if you're looking for a critical value.

59
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:44,080
So we're trying to know something called the critical value, and that would change by the degrees of freedom.

60
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:50,540
So there's not actually one. If you remember those probability tables, the chi squared.

61
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,550
It's not it's not like the normal distribution where you would have the standard normal.

62
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,520
It's just one you're able to look at your parameters and able to tell the probability.

63
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:10,430
But for CHI statistic, we do have different kind of distributions based on the degrees of freedom.

64
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,250
So you need to be able to have the degree of freedom to be able to look at what

65
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,750
clinical value do you have here so that you only have 5% probability left?

66
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,160
And this in this in this table over here.

67
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,460
So this 3.84 is only for a chi square distribution of one.

68
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:48,180
So one degree of freedom. And whenever you so whenever you have to a little snip, that would always be the case.

69
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,180
You would always use the 3.4 to tell you whether this is actually significant.

70
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:00,630
You do have to be patient from day one. And whenever this whenever you were calculated.

71
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,280
Chi chi chi chi statistic is greater than 3.84.

72
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,150
Then you do have significant findings and you can reject the null.

73
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:44,680
Any questions? Anyone? Would it be helpful to go over snips, genome types, quick definitions, or are you guys doing all good on that?

74
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:55,999
No. I don't know if that's a good idea, but like whenever you're watching the lectures, if you think of a question, I know it's hard.

75
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,590
Like you watched the lecture like maybe a week before,

76
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,690
so but you can just email me with questions and we can go over them in class once we start that way.

77
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:15,160
Not like forget. Okay.

78
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:24,660
Maybe we can just. I was thinking of this thing, you see.

79
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:46,980
Okay. So if we do have like a string of double to take out that reason.

80
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,260
So let's see. You have this one from the mother. It's one strand of DNA from your father.

81
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,580
And then we're looking at a specific snipped. So snip one or.

82
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:07,650
So let's see, you have a serial here and two of you here.

83
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,210
So, so this is a snap with two, two of these options.

84
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:22,350
CMT And then can anyone tell me what are the possible genotypes of this snip?

85
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:32,470
Seated. So this is the actual yeah, this is the actual genotype.

86
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,080
And then if we go to other MacAfee, if we're looking at other people, different population,

87
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:47,080
what would be the other possible genotypes that could happen in CC and so CC identity?

88
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:55,210
So a genotype is referring to the combination of two illegal's from two from both parents.

89
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:04,389
Do you have questions? So yeah two aliens from two different from two different parents.

90
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:20,540
So the combination of two emails at a specific snap and then let's say we add another snap snap to the G here and then two and here.

91
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,140
So. Can someone tell me what haplotypes do?

92
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,590
Well, I have a question for t c also not be an option.

93
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,030
T c. Yeah. I mean it's the same do you see.

94
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,610
Or c t is just different. Yeah.

95
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:50,800
I think it's more common that you put the alphabetically first letter first, but it's the same c t or to see that would be the same.

96
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:05,410
Okay. So the Edison here. So what would be what are the helpful types that we observed in this person?

97
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:20,280
So remember, haplotype is the kind of combination of yields along the same strand of the C, C, G and t, a and then.

98
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:33,860
So this is what we observe. And then we can also have different combination of C, A and t c disease is also possible haplotypes.

99
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,490
Any questions on that? So. Yeah.

100
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:50,080
So the haplotype, if we have multiple snips, is like the combination of those snips from one parent.

101
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,650
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Along the same. Yeah.

102
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,080
Along the same strand. Which is coming from that. Yeah.

103
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,489
But just knowing that snip two can either have a G or a t,

104
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:11,530
then the haplotype is actually it's could you observe a CG but it could be a C with a T and someone else.

105
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,579
Just like they would still be coming from a single parent.

106
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,200
But it could vary. Yeah. Any more questions?

107
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,300
Yeah. Why is a g observed? What happened to the g a as I have full time.

108
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,830
Yeah. How come that is so. This is so.

109
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:42,700
Remember how content is the combination of like we need to have a combination of slip one and two so the G and the are coming from this thing.

110
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,850
So it's not really helpful. There would be there would be a wheels or forms of the difference.

111
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,890
Yeah. I'm sorry.

112
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:05,790
How is JI and any coming from the same snake? So her question was specifically, why don't we have a G8 as the haplotype group?

113
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,680
Okay. So and then what I'm saying is that for a haplotype would be a combination of two different snips in this case.

114
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,410
So, so you would need to have,

115
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:26,910
you need to have something from the seed from this snip snip one and the only options for snip one is a C or a T and then to fill in the other.

116
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,010
So here you can have a CRT and then fill in for snip two.

117
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:42,990
You could either either have an A or a G and g, so you can't really have an A and a g because snip one does not have an a, which was the question.

118
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:54,390
Yeah. And just to leave any more questions on this is clear.

119
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,290
And then typically, like when we talk about snakes, we're talking about two alveoli and the legs.

120
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,879
Snips and childlessness are rare.

121
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:13,290
And then snips where you see all defense for bases are also rare.

122
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:22,499
So you don't really observe those. And any more questions?

123
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:38,450
You we go over the quiz answers. I.

124
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,110
So I think I'm just maybe maybe I don't know how many people maybe two people didn't do the quiz.

125
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,490
Remember that? You do get the credits just for answering the quiz.

126
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,710
I think it's worth five points to the total my course grades, so make sure to do them.

127
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,660
They open up after typically after class on Thursday and they would be due on Tuesday.

128
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,500
So I'll try to do them. Okay.

129
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:25,679
So step one has two possible emails and C and then you have a second snip snip two as to possible and we'll see.

130
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,240
And g. So what are the possible genotypes for snip one?

131
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,610
This is kind of similar to what we just did. Most people got it right.

132
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,990
So step two here is just to confuse you.

133
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:50,100
But then A and C are the possible appeals for this one and you would have the only option vis a, C and CC.

134
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,540
Any questions about that clarification?

135
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,030
Okay. So second one.

136
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,850
So a certain snips and one gun has two possible heels A and C and then snip two has CMG.

137
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:18,420
So what are the possible haplotypes for this gene? So remember, we would need to have a combination of snip one and snip to.

138
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:29,100
So you could have been A with a C and a G and then C with the CMC with the G.

139
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,420
So eight. Yeah, this one's. Okay.

140
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,770
So you didn't talk with Temple of 20 people at a party.

141
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,760
You have ten people with genotype A, ten people with genotype 80 and No.

142
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,320
One genotype 20. What is the genetic frequency of 80?

143
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:04,400
So this is just just a calculation of how many people you observed with the 80 and you divide it by the total number of people.

144
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,060
So for genotype frequency. So at ten over 20.

145
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,189
And then on this one, whenever we're calculating aliens frequencies,

146
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:21,140
we have to take into consideration that each person would have two copies of each.

147
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,470
So if you have so the T, we can use the gene counting method.

148
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:37,880
So so we calculated adding how many t's here and then this one t here and then divide by 20 times two.

149
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:51,440
So. So 40. So this last one, if you find that snap is in highly one word disequilibrium,

150
00:19:52,310 --> 00:20:01,879
what could be potential reasons for that genotyping error is actually the most common reason of why you would see disequilibrium.

151
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:12,140
And that's why a lot of genetic studies use like hardy one big disequilibrium to kind of filter out low quality snips.

152
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:21,800
So so genotyping is the reason why would you observe this equilibrium nonrandom meaning where you have people kind of not.

153
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:34,310
So the flow of eels or the flow of yeah the flow of illegals is not solving an independent assumption so that they're not just the probability,

154
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:39,650
it's not just the multiplication of like having an eight times of value, of having a,

155
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,410
you have kind of nonrandom mating happening and then natural selection event.

156
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,860
That's kind of like the example in the, in the lectures about the malaria and sickle cell.

157
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,920
So you kind of have a pressure for the genotypes to be more prevalent or less prevalent.

158
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:05,610
So these are all factors that would result in disequilibrium and habitat insufficiency is something else.

159
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:17,810
Totally. Most people do that. Right. Questions on that quiz and I'll post the answers to the quiz after class today.

160
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:32,030
So if no one has any more questions, I think we can do a different paper copies for the problem set that we'll work on today.

161
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:42,660
So this is just a practice that this problems, it's not to be turned down, but I think it's good to kind of work on it today.

162
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:55,260
And then we so maybe one person from each group can come down here and if you can let me know who is in your group and I'll assign them one on canvas.

163
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,230
This would be a group kind of for the rest of the semester to work with actual problem sets.

164
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,611
So I think that.

165
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:26,666
So maybe we can go over questions one or two things and then you can finish working on this question three.

166
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:35,156
So questions four and five are kind of optional. So if you get to them pretty good, but they should at least go to three.

167
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:44,426
I know a lot of stuff like to do that, but it's it's important that after we go over questions the next time.

168
00:22:47,576 --> 00:23:04,366
But let's do question ones into now so. So approximately one in 2500 locations are Europeans has a very recessive disease, close to 60,000 this year.

169
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:09,266
It is most commonly caused by deletion of the gene called Delta 508.

170
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:14,126
And then you have 15,932 people for genotype.

171
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:17,276
So we do have actual genotype data here.

172
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:32,126
And then the big D represents the normally this little D represents the the mutation, the Delta 508 this is a rare recessive disease.

173
00:23:33,356 --> 00:23:37,436
And then here you have the actual counts of people for each genotype.

174
00:23:39,656 --> 00:23:44,686
So what are the three genotype frequencies? What did you want to do is get?

175
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:55,006
Yeah. We said India was 15,000 by 1500 troops.

176
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:58,216
Like 97%, I think. Yeah, that's the point.

177
00:23:58,276 --> 00:24:07,926
97844 are the 2.12% .0212.

178
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:15,436
Yeah. Oh, yeah. So 337 divided by six number the total.

179
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:24,406
And so the next percents also are off by seven over 15,032.

180
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:30,706
Yeah. Yeah. When it comes to frequencies, do you want them in decimals usually.

181
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:33,556
And how many like digits do you want. Yeah, I know.

182
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:41,896
So in the chi square and like little small changes in the decimal points, we would kind of carry over.

183
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:47,146
So I think just as a you don't have to wear them as percentages,

184
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:54,166
just give them as probabilities like .97 and then do four, maybe four significant figures.

185
00:24:54,366 --> 00:25:01,726
Yeah. Yeah. So everyone got that the first one.

186
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:08,506
Any questions about it? So what are the the frequencies of the big D and the of little.

187
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:16,316
We got for the big point 99. Yeah.

188
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:24,986
So you use the gene counting method. So counting how many of the reels you can take into consideration that you have two copies

189
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:31,736
and then calculating the frequencies for the big D without any question about that.

190
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:39,776
So here we could use the gene counting method just because we, we, we have actual data, actual genotype data.

191
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:50,066
If we didn't have that and we want to make the assumption of like, let's say you got a certain number of people,

192
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:54,456
you know, it's the recessive disease and you can do the square root of Q to get.

193
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:58,046
Q But that would that one would require, we're assuming hardly.

194
00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:10,285
WEINBERG And then we're we're also assuming that carriers and those people with the big, big D are showing the same the same phenotype.

195
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:14,966
It's so that that was in this class. So there's two ways to calculate the other frequencies.

196
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:23,486
You can make the assumption that this is a recessive disease and then you only have you calculate the

197
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:30,866
probability of Q by doing the square root of Q Q squared to get that the Q or if you have actual data,

198
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:34,066
which is in this case, then you would do the gene coding method.

199
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:41,726
Yeah. Is that clear. So the second question we that's when we do the square root of Q but we don't get to it.

200
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:53,495
So what is the carrier frequency? So this is a recessive disease.

201
00:26:53,496 --> 00:27:03,366
So a carrier frequency is people who have the the heterozygous 3.02 or 2%.

202
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:08,076
Yeah. So you did the frequency of this, the big deal.

203
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:12,696
So 337 divided by 50 932.

204
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:18,596
Any questions about that? Okay.

205
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:29,846
So let's do a question to. So tiny sex is a very recessive degenerative disorder, causes mental retardation within the first few years.

206
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:34,346
It's like it's prevalent in Ashkenazi Jewish population.

207
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:44,185
And the way we approximate that three in 10,000 infants have the actual phenotype.

208
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:52,346
So are they showed that disease. All individuals with two recessive reals developed intersex sex phenotype.

209
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:58,076
The big T represents the normal available to possess the recessive LDL.

210
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:03,025
And then the first part is what are the little frequencies of big T?

211
00:28:03,026 --> 00:28:08,056
Little T? You guys get?

212
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:19,326
Small 2.0 and seven. Yeah.

213
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,346
So you did that by doing square root? Yeah.

214
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:29,376
So three over 10,000. That would be the genotype frequency of the little t, little t.

215
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:36,665
So the recessive, the resistance, the two recessive yields that would be Q squared.

216
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:45,336
And then to get Q you do square root of Q and then for the big T, that would be one minus that quantity.

217
00:28:45,336 --> 00:28:48,666
So that would be the .9827.

218
00:28:50,516 --> 00:28:55,546
Step one. Get that. You know, it's. Okay.

219
00:28:55,816 --> 00:29:19,776
What is the carrier frequency? 2171017227220.034.

220
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:24,376
I know, I know. Did you. What did you have for you?

221
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:31,356
Excuse me. Just. Maybe it's.

222
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:39,756
We. Can you explain how to do it? How to do it? Can you just.

223
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:56,416
Okay. So.

224
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:10,906
So the relative frequency. Frequency of t t is three over 10,000.

225
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:22,996
Right. Okay. And then that would be point of C and this would be Q squared.

226
00:30:23,516 --> 00:30:28,426
Right? And then so to get Q or the probability of the little T.

227
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:40,846
And you would do square root of 2.003, which would be .017.

228
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:44,566
So that would be Q.

229
00:30:44,776 --> 00:31:04,426
And then we know that the is equal to one minus Q because there's just two elements that would be one minus .0173 and then P 2.9827.

230
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:08,586
So that's the probability of the big T. That's the little T.

231
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:15,736
Yeah. And then the question is asking, what is the carrier frequency?

232
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:24,406
So carry a frequency is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype.

233
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:30,646
So. So the big T little T and we know that too.

234
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:38,415
P Q Right. So because you have to way you can have pretty small T and and small t t, so it's two p.

235
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:47,226
Q So that would be to. 3.9827.

236
00:31:48,816 --> 00:31:52,025
That should be 0.03 for everyone. Get that.

237
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:56,306
Or what did you guys get? Yeah. Is that clear?

238
00:31:57,236 --> 00:32:09,266
Yeah. So here we make the assumption that we use this method to go from the genotype to the frequency,

239
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:16,306
because we do not we cannot do the gene counting method because we we don't know how many people have the big t t.

240
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:21,625
So are you just supposed to assume that it's like hardening? Yeah.

241
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:25,706
In this case, because we don't have more information, we're going to do one more.

242
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:30,835
And then we're going to assume that only people who are sick have the little T,

243
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:37,216
little T and the rest of the population has big T, a little too big t t are normal.

244
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:43,186
So they're they're kind of homogeneous that's not showing the disease.

245
00:32:44,816 --> 00:32:55,996
So it's like we're kind of dividing them into two options. Any questions about that question?

246
00:32:57,986 --> 00:33:02,186
Well, the third question, I know we can go over it next time, but try to finish it.

247
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:12,386
So so we have cases, we have controls, and then we're asked to do a test for hardly one word.

248
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:23,515
So for each for each of those snips, we have to do alien frequencies in the controls, expected number of people in the controls,

249
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:29,126
and then calculate deviations from the expected individuals that do the same for the cases.

250
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:35,336
That's for one 6% to you would do the same thing.

251
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:42,985
But I mean if feel like in the slides it shows like a good set up how you do it so we can go over it next

252
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:52,136
time to any more questions and the problem set the first problem set which is actually over this one,

253
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:59,786
you don't have to turn in. It's just practice. The other one, the problems that will be posted today, probably open up around ten.

254
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:05,866
You'll have time to work on it during class on Thursday. We do have a short lecture and then you can also have time to work.

255
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:13,406
That would be resume next Thursday. Yeah, it was sense for me to wrap.

256
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:17,406
I did post the slightly modified version of this.

257
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:35,236
This basically we had to shift them to the very last guest speaker and then I added where the office hours feel like I'm going to talk about.
