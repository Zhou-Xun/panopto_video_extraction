1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,560
So in this section, I'm going to introduce
you to focus group discussions and

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,760
walk you through some ideas for

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,840
thinking about when a focus group might
be best used in a research study.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,820
So focus groups are useful when
you want group interaction.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,960
When you want the exchange
of ideas among participants.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,800
When topics can be debated
among participants.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,850
So focus groups usually have
a moderator to ask the questions and

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,620
often have a note taker even if
the conversation is audio recorded.

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,860
So focus groups can be less costly or more
time efficient than end up interviews.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,930
But really, I would want you to think
about using focus groups when you want

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,130
to encourage dialogue among participants
and when you want to discuss social and

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,690
community norms or
attitudes among a group of people.

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,350
So often I'm asked like how many
participants should I include in my

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,020
focus group?

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,940
The standard is to have between six and
eight participants.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,177
So you don't want too few that there
will not be enough conversation.

17
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:03,460
And you don't want too many
that it's impossible to manage.

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,400
Though it's important to remember,
for some settings,

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,510
you may need to invite more people, so
that six to eight people show up, but

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,400
I would encourage you to
proceed very cautiously.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,960
The next question to think about is,
how many focus groups should I conduct?

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,780
So again, the standard is that we usually
encourage you to conduct two focus groups

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,970
for every defining demographic
variable in your sampling frame.

24
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,290
So you think of who to include, whom to
invite to the focus group discussions.

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,150
Usually we say that you
should think about having

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,280
a homogeneous sample on
critical characteristics.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,875
This way you can also think about
potential power dynamics that could

28
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,180
have happen among participants because
you want to make sure that everyone is

29
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,240
feeling comfortable enough to share their
opinions and ideas in a group setting.

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,000
So usually we establish some
eligibility criteria for

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,330
the focus group before we do recruitment.

32
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,500
So the moderator of the focus group is
there to ask the questions, keep the group

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,795
focused and maintain flow of the
conversation dialog between participants.

34
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:06,535
The moderator summarizes the answers and
then asks for agreement or

35
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:10,695
disagreement to encourage other
participants to also share their ideas.

36
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:14,575
And the moderator should be there to
enforce the agreed upon ground rules

37
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:17,930
of the focus group discussion.

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,580
So thinking about how we structure a focus
group or how we conduct a focus group.

39
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,410
So the moderator would start by helping
the participants to establish and

40
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,120
agree upon ground rules for
the discussion.

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,934
Then you start with having an introduction
or opening where you get the participants

42
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:35,118
name and you maybe ask an initial
question just to build some rapport.

43
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:38,441
And make sure here that everyone
has said at least something

44
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,980
to kinda get their participation
off from the start.

45
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,160
Then you move into some transition
questions to get initial thoughts on

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
the topic.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,310
And then move to the key questions of
your focus group discussion guide.

48
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,160
So here you should really think about
what are the most important questions to

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,410
discuss.

50
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,420
And then you want to end the discussion
by having participants state their

51
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,070
final positions,
maybe you provide a summary of key ideas.

52
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,380
And again, ending the focus group
with asking, have we missed anything?

53
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,510
To give the opportunity for
participants to add their own thoughts or

54
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,030
ideas on a subject.

55
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,520
So in summary, focus groups discussions
can be time and resource efficient.

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,840
Which really, they should be used when
you want to encourage dialogue and

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,170
interaction among participants
on your research topic.

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,200
And then also, it's important to keep in
mind that you should carefully consider

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,720
eligibility criteria to
ensure open dialogue and

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,845
avoid potential power dynamics.
