1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,920
In this video, we will
discuss efforts to

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,095
address market failures
and health care,

3
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:14,850
focusing on both the consumer

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,920
and provider sides
of the market.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,800
Many are the products of
government regulation,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,270
but others have
been developed and

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,920
implemented by private actors.

8
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,250
Our learning objectives are to

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,720
assess the relative merits of

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,925
private market-oriented
and public

11
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:32,370
legislative and
regulatory approaches

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,485
to improve the performance
of the health care system.

13
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:37,940
Both public and
private payers and

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,790
other organizations have
developed initiatives to

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,340
facilitate better
consumer decision-making

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,480
by decreasing
information asymmetries.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,400
Two primary initiatives are

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,350
price transparency and
quality reporting.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,145
Imagine going to a car dealership
with no posted prices,

20
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,875
taking a car and
driving it home.

21
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,010
A week later, the dealer
sends you a bill for

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,720
whatever price they choose and

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,060
you're legally
obligated to pay it.

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,565
Sounds crazy, doesn't it?

25
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,775
Well, that's how we
usually buy health care.

26
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:13,790
It's hard to shop on price
because we can't easily

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,675
project the full set of
services we will receive.

28
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,580
Care needs can be urgent.

29
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,140
Even if those barriers
can be overcome,

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,780
it's hard to get
quotes from providers.

31
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,090
Consequences include
providers having

32
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,030
little incentive to compete
on price and creating

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,800
surprise billing situations for

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,810
out-of-network care
that motivated

35
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,450
legislation passed in 2020.

36
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,930
Similarly, assessing
quality requires data and

37
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,220
technical expertise that

38
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,515
consumers generally
don't possess.

39
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:44,645
To address this limitation,

40
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:46,220
public and private entities have

41
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,320
issued quality reports often

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,180
adjusted for
observable differences

43
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,895
in case mixed across providers.

44
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,040
What are the goals of creating

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,020
greater price transparency?

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,935
In principle, at least some
services should be shoppable.

47
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:04,085
For example, imaging
studies, lab tests,

48
00:02:04,085 --> 00:02:06,185
primary care, obstetric care,

49
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,090
and many planned procedures.

50
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,385
Further, increased
cost-sharing in

51
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:12,800
many health plans such
as high deductibles,

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,080
provides an incentive to shop.

53
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,360
The hope is to engage consumers

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,805
by facilitating informed
decision-making,

55
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,325
ultimately reducing
out-of-pocket spending

56
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,635
and total health care spending.

57
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:28,490
How can consumers actually
find health care prices?

58
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,060
Some insurers and state
governments have developed tools,

59
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,850
find one and try it.

60
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,980
In 2021, the federal
government also mandated

61
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,060
hospital reporting of

62
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,075
negotiated prices for
selected services.

63
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,550
Go to a few hospital
websites and

64
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,800
check how easy it is to
find this information.

65
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,730
Although price
transparency initiatives

66
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,515
are still rapidly evolving,

67
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:54,395
early efforts don't seem
to have been impactful.

68
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:56,570
Most studies find
low use rates for

69
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,525
the tools and no
impact on spending.

70
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:01,550
Some evidence even suggests

71
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,425
that spending
slightly increases,

72
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,750
which may reflect consumers
who have already met

73
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,560
their deductibles using price
as a proxy for quality.

74
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,450
One important
question is whether

75
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,860
the limited success is due

76
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,055
more to lack of awareness
or lack of usefulness.

77
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:18,050
To address this, a study of

78
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,720
an advertising campaign
for New Hampshire's tool,

79
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,060
found that use increased
substantially,

80
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,160
but higher use did
not translate into

81
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,500
increased selection of
low-cost providers.

82
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,360
One way of highlighting
prices that has made

83
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,135
a major difference is
called reference pricing.

84
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:38,780
Given the large variation in
prices even within a market,

85
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,340
some payers have implemented

86
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,110
a system where prices are set at

87
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,390
the median or some other cutoff

88
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,640
near the midpoint of
the distribution.

89
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,580
Employees choosing more
expensive providers have to

90
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,955
pay the incremental cost
above the reference price.

91
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:54,620
This applies best to

92
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,810
shoppable non-emergency
services that

93
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,590
are onetime choices and were
priced very substantially.

94
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,050
Examples are cataract surgery,

95
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,995
colonoscopy, arthroscopy
and joint replacements.

96
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,500
Reference pricing
creates an alternative

97
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,375
to a narrow provider network.

98
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,950
Patients get coverage up to

99
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,290
the reference price
in a broad network,

100
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,725
versus no coverage at all
outside of a narrow network.

101
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,205
The California State Employee
Health Insurance Program

102
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:25,580
applied reference pricing
to a number of services.

103
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,330
Prices for joint replacement
ranged from $12,000 to

104
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,760
$75,000 when a reference price
was introduced at $30,000.

105
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,190
Expensive hospitals responded by

106
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,955
reducing prices to
avoid losing business.

107
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:41,720
Seventy two hospitals were

108
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,255
below the reference
price in 2015,

109
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:47,000
versus only 46 in 2011.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,010
The program generated $2.8

111
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,440
million of savings in
its first two years.

112
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,835
Shifting from price transparency
to quality transparency,

113
00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:00,050
quality report cards are
standardized tools to rate and

114
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,390
communicate aspects of
healthcare provider

115
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,355
or health plan performance.

116
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,505
The first step is selecting
measurable outcomes,

117
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:10,655
preferably one's that are
validated as being important,

118
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,650
variable across providers,

119
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,765
and risk-adjusted if necessary.

120
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:16,910
The second step is
creating scoring

121
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,225
algorithms to wait and
combine multiple measures.

122
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:24,125
In the CMS quality reports
on their compare websites,

123
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,030
the raw scores are
converted into

124
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,680
five-star categories to

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,080
facilitate interpretation
by consumers.

126
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,460
Here is a screenshot from

127
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,500
the Nursing Home
Compare website.

128
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,870
The user enters a location and

129
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,795
the site loads ratings
for nearby facilities.

130
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:43,600
Multiple facilities can
then be selected for

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,580
more detailed comparisons and

132
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,565
the underlying measure
they are available.

133
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,980
How have quality report cards

134
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,035
affected choices and outcomes?

135
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:55,360
Public reporting could
improve quality by

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,760
driving demand towards
better providers,

137
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,320
and research suggests that they

138
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,820
have been modestly effective at

139
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,285
shifting demand and incentivizing
quality improvements.

140
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:07,210
Providers may also have an
intrinsic motivation to

141
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,420
perform well or dislike
of being ranked poorly.

142
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,340
One study found that surgeons in

143
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,440
Pennsylvania responded
more to how they

144
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,240
compared with peers than to

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,745
actual changes in
patient volume.

146
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,820
Finally, another study found
that patients choosing

147
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,475
high-ranked nursing homes
achieve better outcomes,

148
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:27,620
suggesting that the
measures are meaningful.

149
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,060
Although improving
choices, quality,

150
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,230
and clinical outcomes are

151
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,795
the primary objectives
of quality reporting,

152
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,760
releasing data may also impact

153
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,460
prices and access disparities.

154
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,175
In a paper with Sean
Huang from Georgetown,

155
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,510
I found that highly rated

156
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,890
nursing homes were able to raise

157
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,655
prices 5-6 percent more
than poorly rated homes.

158
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:51,130
This can be interpreted
as prices becoming

159
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,054
more informative and
better rewarding quality,

160
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:55,330
but it could also limit

161
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,910
access to high-quality
facilities.

162
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,520
Another study found
the quality reporting

163
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,425
increased disparities in care.

164
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:05,860
Nursing home star rating
performance improved over time,

165
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,160
but Medicare/Medicaid
dual-eligible beneficiaries became

166
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,660
relatively more likely to be

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,975
in lower rather than
higher-ranked facilities.

168
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,690
We will now turn from
interventions targeting

169
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,325
the consumer side of the market

170
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,830
to those targeting
the provider side.

171
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,530
Health care providers have
traditionally been paid

172
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,050
based on the volume of
services they provide,

173
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,735
not the value those
services generate.

174
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,250
If we pay for volume,

175
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,690
we will get volume.

176
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,090
So a large emphasis
in payment reform has

177
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,850
been tying payments to
some measure of value.

178
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,890
Value has two components,

179
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,510
the quality or effectiveness of

180
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,285
the service and the
cost of the service.

181
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:45,310
Loosely, you can think of value

182
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,830
as effectiveness
divided by cost.

183
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,170
This slide includes
definitions of

184
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,880
both their traditional
fee-for-service

185
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,830
payment methodology and

186
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,035
a number of alternative
payment methods

187
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:58,705
that link to some
aspect of quality.

188
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,670
Please stop the video and review

189
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,290
the different
payment mechanisms.

190
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Many of the innovations and

191
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,540
value-based payment
were motivated

192
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,705
by the ACA for testing
in the Medicare program,

193
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:16,690
but they are also being
adopted by many payers.

194
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,850
Almost 90 percent of payments in

195
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,500
the traditional
Medicare program are

196
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,660
now tied to value or quality.

197
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,390
Nationally, less than
40 percent of payments

198
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,820
are not tied in some way
to value or quality.

199
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,320
Evidence about the
effectiveness of

200
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,390
leading Medicare
value-based programs

201
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,340
is summarized in this table.

202
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,350
Results are variable, but

203
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,735
several programs
generated savings.

204
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:42,790
Though much of the
savings disappear from

205
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,555
Medicare's perspective after
incentive payouts are made.

206
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:49,240
Evidence on quality
is also mixed

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,535
but tends to be
favorable or neutral.

208
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:54,250
Equity concerns arise
as providers in

209
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,190
lower socioeconomic
status areas appear

210
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,890
less likely to participate
in several programs

211
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,090
and may not do as well

212
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,950
financially if they
do participate.

213
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,260
There has been substantial
experimentation and evaluation

214
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,760
of value-based payment models

215
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,350
since the passage of the ACA.

216
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,810
A number of recommendations

217
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,910
have been made for
moving forward.

218
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,710
Next steps could begin with

219
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,870
expanding model shown
to reduce costs and

220
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,270
improve quality and
streamlining and

221
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,920
coordinating
multiple models that

222
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,615
are operating in parallel.

223
00:09:25,615 --> 00:09:27,910
Scaling models requires finding

224
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,560
ways to engage late adopters of

225
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,490
voluntary models or shifting
towards mandatory models.

226
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,175
Results could also be
enhanced by moving from

227
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,800
upside-only shared
savings models to

228
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,114
models that also require
risk-sharing on the downside.

229
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,520
Finally, more focus on
equity is crucial to support

230
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,230
participation and success by

231
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,965
providers serving the most
vulnerable populations.

232
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,980
There are several
challenges to consolidating

233
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,830
the gains that have been
demonstrated by some models.

234
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,240
One of the greatest is

235
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,670
inconsistent incentives
to providers.

236
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,120
Most providers face multiple
payment methodologies across

237
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,840
payers rather than a consistent
incentive for value.

238
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,610
Even when an organization

239
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,920
faces value-based
purchasing incentives,

240
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,630
its physicians may still be paid

241
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,495
primarily by traditional
fee for service.

242
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,520
Administrative complexity and

243
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,990
complying with program rules

244
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,880
and reporting data
on multiple measures

245
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,620
could also be reduced.

246
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,170
Finally, incentives
focused solely on

247
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,570
one side of the market
are likely to be less

248
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,400
effective than
aligning incentives of

249
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,070
providers and patients
to transform behavior.

250
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,015
To summarize what we've learned,

251
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:39,160
governments and private
payers have developed

252
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,370
a variety of mechanisms to
help markets function better.

253
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,070
On the consumer side,
price transparency,

254
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,680
coupled with cost-sharing
and quality reporting,

255
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,740
seek to create
better-informed decisions.

256
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,360
On the supply side,

257
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,710
payment systems that reward

258
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,750
providers for value and quality,

259
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,190
rather than just how much they

260
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,785
do, have expanded dramatically.

261
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:03,120
However, the impacts to date
have generally been modest.

262
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,345
Although we are learning
more about what works,

263
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,680
it would be reasonable to expect

264
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,020
incremental improvements,
not miracles.
