1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:09,629
two by two tables and go through examples of calculations that we can do using

2
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:15,629
to buy two tables to estimate measures of association.

3
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:20,629
First, we will discuss two by two tables, which are a fundamental tool in calculating measures

4
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:25,629
of association in epidemiology. Then we will go through several examples of

5
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:30,629
using two by two tables to calculate measures of association and 95

6
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:36,629
percent confidence intervals that go along with measures of association.

7
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:41,629
This slide shows a two by two table that would be generated using count data from

8
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:47,629
a cohort or a case control study. In the rose, we

9
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:52,629
have the levels of the exposure, assuming that we have a binary exposure that takes

10
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:57,629
on the values one or zero, indicating that the exposure is present or not

11
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,629
present in the columns. We have the levels of the outcome. Again,

12
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,629
assuming a binary outcome where an individual has the disease or the outcome equals one

13
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:12,629
or the individual does not have the disease or the outcome equals zero. The cells in

14
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:18,629
the middle of the table, A, B, C, D indicate the counts of individuals

15
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:23,629
in the study population according to the four different combinations that are possible

16
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:28,629
of the exposure and outcome. In the bottom row, we have the totals

17
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:33,629
for the number of people who have the disease and do not have the disease in the cut

18
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,629
in the far right column. We have the totals for the number of individuals who are exposed and

19
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:46,629
are not exposed. And in the bottom right corner, we have the total size of the study population.

20
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:53,629
We can use a two by two table like this to calculate the cumulative incidence ratio.

21
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:58,629
When we have count data from a cohort study and again, this would be where we do not have person

22
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:03,629
time data available, or we assume for some reason that we have complete follow

23
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,629
up on all individuals in our cohort. And thus we are confident in calculating cumulative

24
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:14,629
incidence. So let's assume a hypothetical study conducted over a 10 year time period.

25
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:20,629
We have the exposure shown in the rows of the table, which here is being a smoker versus

26
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:25,629
a nonsmoker. And we have the outcome shown in the columns of the table, which here

27
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:30,629
is coronary heart disease or C HD or no coronary heart disease.

28
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,629
We see that there are a total of eight thousand people in this cohort study, three thousand

29
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:41,629
of whom are smokers, 5000 of whom are not smokers. And there were one hundred and seventy one

30
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:46,629
cases of coronary heart disease over the 10 year time period and seven thousand

31
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:52,629
eight hundred and twenty nine people who remained free from coronary heart disease.

32
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:57,629
We can calculate the cumulative incidents ratio using the formula from the

33
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,629
previous session. We know that the cumulative incidence ratio is simply the ratio of the

34
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:08,629
cumulative incidents in the exposed and the unexposed individuals, and tabulating

35
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:14,629
it out into the two by two table lets us readily see that the C i r

36
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:19,629
is equal to A over A plus B over C overseas plus

37
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:24,629
plasty. So we have the total number of smokers who had C HD

38
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,629
divided by the total number of smokers. So the total number of smokers who had CJD

39
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:35,629
divided by the total number of smokers. And then the total number of nonsmokers who had CJD divided

40
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:40,629
by the total number of nonsmokers. This gives us a cumulative incidence ratio of one point

41
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:45,629
six. We can interpret this as smokers have one point

42
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:50,629
six times the risk of coronary heart disease compared to nonsmokers over a 10 year period.

43
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:56,629
I have bowled a 10 year period here because it's important to remember that we must always

44
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:01,629
state the time period that goes alongside a measure of cumulative incidents

45
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,629
or the cumulative incidence ratio. And this is because time is not inherently included

46
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:13,629
in the measure itself. Even though we take this measure over time.

47
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:18,629
Another type of two by two table looks like this, and it is generated when we have

48
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:24,629
person time data in a cohort study similar to the previous example. We have

49
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:29,629
levels of the exposure shown in the rose, but the columns are a little bit different this time

50
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:34,629
in the first column. We have individuals with the disease or outcome and then we have person

51
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:40,629
years in the far right column.

52
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:46,629
We can use a table like this to calculate the incidence density ratio. So let's work through an example.

53
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:51,629
Imagine a hypothetical study where we aim to assess the association between asthma and

54
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,629
risk of influenza. We conduct a cohort study over a five year period.

55
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:01,629
In this study, we observed that asthmatic children contribute a total of 40.

56
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:07,629
Sorry, four hundred and forty seven point eight person years of at risk time over the

57
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:13,629
follow up period and have a total of three hundred and twenty two episodes of influenza.

58
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:18,629
Non asthmatic children contribute a total of seven thousand one point seven person years

59
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:24,629
at risk and have two thousand two hundred and seventy four episodes of influenza.

60
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,629
Let's calculate the incidence density ratio. So we can take

61
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:35,629
these data from the previous paragraph and insert them into the two by two table

62
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:40,629
that we use for person time data in a cohort study.

63
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:46,629
We can then apply the formula for the incidence density ratio, modifying it to fit

64
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:51,629
the cells that are shown in the two by two table. So recall from the previous session

65
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:56,629
that the incidence density ratio is simply the ratio of the incidence density

66
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:02,629
in the exposed and the unexposed groups. These values are readily

67
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:07,629
apparent when we map them out in the two by two table and we come up with an incidence density ratio

68
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,629
of two point to. We interpret this as the incidence of influenza in children

69
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:20,629
with asthma was two point two times the incidence of influenza in non asthmatic children.

70
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:25,629
Now is a good time to bring up the relationship between the cumulative incidence ratio and the incidence

71
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:31,629
density ratio. And you may have actually intuited this already, but it's important to state.

72
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:36,629
So the cumulative incidence ratio approximates the incidence density ratio when

73
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,629
the period of observation is small. And when the number of at risk at

74
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:47,629
the start of follow up or teen not are followed for the whole time period,

75
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:52,629
the number at risk thus approximates the person time at risk because we have complete

76
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:57,629
follow up on all individuals in the study. And thus it does not matter whether we use the cumulative

77
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:03,629
incidence ratio or the incidence density ratio. Conversely,

78
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,629
and this should be intuitive as well, as time goes to infinity. Everyone

79
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:14,629
in a study either becomes a case or dies, and thus the value of the cumulative

80
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,629
incidence ratio approaches one.

81
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,629
Let's return to the two by two table where we used count data and this time. Let's

82
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:29,629
think about a case control study. So I've shown a simplified version of the two by two

83
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:34,629
table on the right hand side of this slide here indicate where E-Plus indicates

84
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,629
the presence of the exposure E minus indicates there is no exposure, D

85
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:45,629
plus indicates the disease and D minus indicates no disease. So

86
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:50,629
when we have a two by two table, we can calculate two different. Well, four

87
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:55,629
different forms of the odds. We can calculate the odds of the exposure

88
00:07:55,629 --> 00:08:00,629
and the odds of the disease. So let's work through how this might look.

89
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:06,629
The odds of the exposure among the disease are equal to a oversea.

90
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:11,629
The odds of exposure among the non diseases are B over D. The odds of

91
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:16,629
disease among the exposed are A over B and the odds of disease among

92
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:22,629
the exposed are C over D. So we simply work down the columns and across the

93
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:29,629
rows to come up with the different types of odds that we can generate from a two by two. Table.

94
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:34,629
Let's work through an example. If there are 40 people in the room and 10 people

95
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:39,629
have a cold. What are the odds of having a cold if you are in the room?

96
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:45,629
And I'll note that we actually don't need the two by two table to calculate this, but

97
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:50,629
the two by two table is actually very helpful. Before wrapping your head around calculating

98
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:57,629
odds. So I recommend drawing out the two by two table when you're asked to calculate odds.

99
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:02,629
And what we're doing here is we are calculating the odds of a disease which is having a cold. Among

100
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,629
the exposed, which is being in the room. So here the odds equal A over B, which

101
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:12,629
is 10 over 30 or zero point three three. Please note that we could also define

102
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:17,629
the odds of being exposed as having a cold. And the odds of disease as being in the room.

103
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:20,745
The semantics here are arbitrary. Recall from

104
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:25,849
Let's work through some other examples of measures of association that we can calculate

105
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:30,849
using to buy two tables. Let's take a hypothetical study where

106
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:36,849
we aim to calculate the association between oral contraceptive use and bacteria

107
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:41,849
in a cohort of women who are followed for one year. We conduct our study and the results

108
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:46,849
that we observe are shown in this hypothetical two by two table here. And there

109
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:51,849
are many things we can deal with this to buy to table.

110
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:57,849
We can use to buy two tables to calculate the attributable risk. So here's an example where

111
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:02,849
we calculate the attributable risk. Per 100000 women. Recall that

112
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:07,849
attributable risk is simply the risk of the outcome in the exposed, minus the risk

113
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:12,849
of the outcome in the unexposed. Using the two by

114
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:17,849
two table, we know that we can take the total number of

115
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:23,849
oral contraceptive users who have bacteria area, which is cell A, divided by the

116
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:28,849
total number of oral contraceptive users to get the risk in the exposed.

117
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:33,849
Similarly, we can take the number of non oral contraceptive

118
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:38,849
users who have bacteria area divided by the total number of non oral contraceptive

119
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:44,849
users to get the risk in the unexposed. This translates to a over

120
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:49,849
A plus B minus C over a C plus D, which gives us an attributable risk

121
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:55,849
of one thousand five hundred and sixty six cases per 100000 women.

122
00:10:55,849 --> 00:11:00,849
And we can interpret this as among every 100 thousand oral contraceptive users.

123
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:07,849
There are one thousand five hundred and sixty six access cases of bacteria area.

124
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:13,849
We can take this one step further and calculate the attributable risk percent recall that the formula

125
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:18,849
for calculating the attributable risk percent is the attributable risk divided by the

126
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:23,849
risk in the exposed group times one hundred percent. And again, we

127
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,849
know that the risk in the exposed group is a over a plus C., which again is

128
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:33,849
the number of of oral contraceptive users who have bacteria area divided by the total

129
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:38,849
number of oral contraceptive users. We ultimately get an attributable risk percent

130
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:43,849
of twenty seven point nine, six percent. We can also calculate

131
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:49,849
the population attributable risk or PJR recall from the previous session.

132
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:54,849
Again, that the PR is equal to the risk in the total population, minus

133
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:59,849
the risk and the unexposed group. And it's easy to think about this when we map

134
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:04,849
it out using the two by two table. The risk and the total population is

135
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:09,849
a plus C. which is one hundred for individuals over

136
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:15,849
A plus B plus C plus D, which is the total population size, which is two thousand three hundred

137
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:20,849
and ninety minus the risk and the unexposed group,

138
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:26,849
which is seventy seven individuals who are those who have bacteria area

139
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:31,849
who are not oral contraceptive users over the total number

140
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:36,849
of non oral contraceptive users, which is one thousand nine hundred and eight individuals. And

141
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:41,849
this gives us a PR of three hundred and sixteen cases per 100000 women

142
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:46,849
per year. Under the assumption that this

143
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:51,849
is a causal relationship, we can interpret the PR as there are three

144
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:56,849
hundred and sixteen access cases of bacteria per year in a population

145
00:12:56,849 --> 00:13:04,849
of one hundred thousand women that are due to oral contraceptive use.

146
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:09,849
We can also calculate the P. R percent recall from the previous session that the

147
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:15,849
formula for calculating the PR percent is simply the P p r

148
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:20,849
divided by the risk in the total population. Times one hundred percent. Again,

149
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:25,849
we can readily map this out using the two by two table to get a PR present of seven

150
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:31,849
point three. Now, let's move on to talking

151
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:36,849
about confidence intervals, and we're talking about this now because two by two tables are

152
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:41,849
very useful in allowing us to calculate the variance that is associated with a

153
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:46,849
measure of association. We use confidence intervals to assess the statistical

154
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:53,849
significance and the precision or variance that are associated with a measure of association.

155
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:58,849
I'll also note at this point that we will get into topics around statistical significance, precision

156
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:04,849
variance and random error in more depth in the session on systematic

157
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:10,849
and random error. And so we are only going to introduce the basics for now.

158
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:15,849
And this is really important because variance essentially is a fancy word

159
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:20,849
for random error. And we need to take this into account. Random error happens in

160
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:25,849
epidemiological research because we do sampling into our study populations from the underlying

161
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:30,849
source populations that they are meant to represent. You may remember that we introduced this concept

162
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:36,849
in the introductory session. If we have a small sample size, the more random

163
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:41,849
error there may be in our results because it is more likely that our sample

164
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:46,849
may not represent the underlying source population. And the results that we see

165
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:51,849
may be due to chance. We always assume that there is a certain degree of random

166
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:56,849
error in the findings of our studies and we can quantify random error

167
00:14:56,849 --> 00:15:01,849
through calculating the variance that is associated with the measure of association that

168
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:07,849
we are using. A really good way to do this is to calculate a confidence

169
00:15:07,849 --> 00:15:12,849
interval. And this is often preferred over a P value because it gives an indication

170
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:18,849
of both statistical significance, as does the P value, but also the precision.

171
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:23,849
So over infinite repetitions of a study and assuming no bias

172
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:28,849
and that we are using a correctly specified statistical model, the confidence interval will

173
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:34,849
contain the true value of the measure of association no less than its confidence

174
00:15:34,849 --> 00:15:41,849
level. And usually we use ninety five percent as the confidence level.

175
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:46,849
When we have a tight confidence interval around a given measure of association, we say that the variance

176
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:51,849
is low and the precision is high when we have a wide confidence interval around a given measure of

177
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:57,849
association. We say that the variance is high and the precision is low.

178
00:15:57,849 --> 00:16:02,849
This is demonstrated nicely by the figure shown here. So the figure

179
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:08,849
note's estimated mean this actually could be any measure of association and the measure

180
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:13,849
of association lies right in the middle of the bounds of the confidence interval.

181
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:19,849
And in fact, is the value that is most likely to emerge as the true value.

182
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:24,849
The upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval is indicated on the right

183
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:29,849
hand side of the figure, and the lower limit of the 95 percent confidence interval

184
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:37,849
is indicated on the left hand side of the figure.

185
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:42,849
So how do we calculate this using a two by two table? This slide here

186
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:48,849
shows the formulas. They look complicated. I promise they're not. Make sure you have a scientific calculator

187
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:53,849
on hand for the class session, because we will work through examples of calculating the confidence

188
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:58,849
intervals, using information that is found in a two by two table. So

189
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:03,849
we use confidence intervals, mostly for relative measures of associations such as the cumulative

190
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:08,849
incidence ratio, the incidence density ratio and the odds ratio.

191
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:14,849
We use one point nine six because it is because it is the Z value that corresponds to a 95

192
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,849
percent confidence interval. And I will also note here, a common mistake

193
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:24,849
in using this formula is forgetting to take the square root of the variance of the lawn

194
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:29,849
of the risk ratio or odds ratio. We need to take the square root because this gives us the standard

195
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:35,849
deviation.

196
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:40,849
So let's work through the formulas. This slide shows how to

197
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:45,849
calculate the variance for the lawn or natural logarithm of this cumulative incidence ratio.

198
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:51,849
The incidence density ratio and the odds ratio. The most

199
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:56,849
simple thing here to do is to just refer to this slide when

200
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:01,849
you are calculating the variance. And again, I'll note this, these slides will be available on canvas

201
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:07,849
during the in class activity. OK, so here's the steps that we take.

202
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:12,849
First we could do we could calculate a confidence interval for

203
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:17,849
several different measures of association. As I just mentioned here, we're going to work through an example

204
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:22,849
of calculating a confidence interval for the odds ratio or O r. I

205
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:27,849
will also note here that confidence intervals are often referred to using the acronym C. I

206
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:34,849
just make sure that you aren't confusing this with cumulative incidents. Which is also referred to as S.I.

207
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:39,849
OK, so the first step is to calculate the odds ratio or whichever other measure of association you

208
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:44,849
are using. Then select the appropriate Z value. It is usually one point nine

209
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:49,849
six because we usually are estimating ninety five percent confidence intervals which

210
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:55,849
correspond to an alpha level of zero point zero five. If this is confusing or doesn't make sense,

211
00:18:55,849 --> 00:19:00,849
don't worry. This is probably going to come up in any biol statistics class that you take. It will also come up

212
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:05,849
in the lecture that is forthcoming on systematic and random error. Just for the purpose

213
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:11,849
of this course. Know that we will use Z values of one point nine six and confidence levels of

214
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:16,849
zero point nine five or ninety five percent. Step three, calculate the variance,

215
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:21,849
according to the formulas I showed you on the previous slide and then calculate the lower limit and

216
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:26,849
upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval using the formulas. I showed you two slides ago.

217
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:31,849
And then we presented altogether with the odds ratio and it's associated lower limit

218
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:38,849
and upper limit for its confidence interval. OK. Let's work through this very briefly.

219
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:44,849
So here is a hypothetical data for a study of smoking and coronary

220
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:49,849
heart disease. We can calculate the odds ratio from the information given

221
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:54,849
in this two by two table. The odds ratio is equivalent to a D

222
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:59,849
over B.C., which equals one point six. If you're not convinced that the O. R, in fact

223
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:04,849
equals 80 over B.C. and there's no reason why you should be convinced. Because I actually haven't shown it to

224
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:11,849
you before. Don't worry. You will be convinced after the lives you lecture.

225
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,849
Then we select the Z value, and this step is not so important because I've already told you

226
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:21,849
the Z value is pretty much always going to be one point nine six. OK,

227
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:26,849
so next we calculate the variance. We use the formula that I showed you a couple of slides

228
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:31,849
ago, and this is the formula for calculating the variance of the lawn or

229
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:37,849
natural logarithm of the odds ratio. And that's done here.

230
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:43,849
Next, we calculate the upper and lower limits of the 95 percent confidence interval using the formulas,

231
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:48,849
I showed you a few slides ago. Here is the calculation for the upper

232
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:53,849
limit of the confidence interval. And the formula for the calculation of the lower limit

233
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:59,849
of the confidence interval. Now, let's put it altogether

234
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:04,849
and let's present it as we would in the results section of a

235
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:10,849
paper, for example. And this is how we express it. We express it as oah

236
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:15,849
or odds ratio equals one point six. And we show the 95 percent confidence interval in brackets

237
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:20,849
with a comma separating the lower limit and the upper limit.

238
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:25,849
And that's the end of part two. Thank you for sticking with me through these unusually long prerecording

239
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:31,849
sessions. Don't worry, we will make up for it with a shorter lecture during the lives election.

240
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:37,849
The ones who lecture and more time for in class activities where we will work through examples

241
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:43,849
ourselves of calculating various measures of association as well as confidence intervals.

242
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:49,295
The Lives Zoome lecture will happen on Tuesday, September 15th, beginning at ten thirty a.m.
