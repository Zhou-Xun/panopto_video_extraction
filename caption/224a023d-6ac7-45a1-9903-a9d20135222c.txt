00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,147
Hi, I'm Carrie Karvonen-Gutierrez, and

2
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:12,316
we're sitting today in one of the clinic
spaces for the Center for Midlife Science.

3
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:15,944
This is where we bring our research
participants in every year,

4
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:20,320
year after year, to understand
their overall health and function.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,420
It's important for
a longitudinal study like mine.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,090
More importantly, we're sitting within the
University of Michigan Healthcare campus.

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,610
We're in an amazing environment here
at the University of Michigan with

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,680
both the school's public health as
well as behind me, our health campus.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,505
You can see many of the major
hospitals that are here.

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,109
And this engagement with both the medical
and the public health system is really

11
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:46,604
a unique piece here at
the University of Michigan.

12
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:50,525
So I want you to think about a time
you've experienced stress recently.

13
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,510
How did your body feel?

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,270
Were your palms sweaty?

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,250
Did your stomach feel tense?

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,989
Was your heart racing?

17
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,220
Perhaps you had a headache.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,540
All of these are physiologic
responses to stress.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,296
And some of these responses
are completely normal and

20
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:12,233
even helpful as our body senses and
prepares to respond to a stressor.

21
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:16,564
In this session we will learn about what
stress is and how our body responds.

22
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:21,621
Throughout this module we will examine
how this response can be beneficial.

23
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:25,727
We will also examine how chronic
exposure to stressors or

24
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:31,460
our inability to respond to
a stressor can make us ill.

25
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,150
In the field of public health, our
overarching goal is to promote health and

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,333
prevent disease.

27
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:41,300
So first, let's think about,
what is health?

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,050
Health is a condition in which the human
body performs its vital functions

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,530
normally.

30
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,875
We call this when our body
can maintain homeostasis.

31
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,902
So you might be asking,
what is homeostasis?

32
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:56,836
Well let's break up that
word into two parts.

33
00:01:56,836 --> 00:02:01,040
Homeo means same, and stasis means stable.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,453
So homeostasis is when our body
can maintain the same levels

35
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:10,670
of a variable under fluctuating
environmental conditions.

36
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,442
Homeostasis is a great balancing act.

37
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:17,411
Think about all of the ways in
which our body stays stable,

38
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:22,597
in terms of body temperature or
blood levels of key fluids, concentrations

39
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:28,041
of blood glucose in our body, the rate of
our heartbeat or blood flow to organs.

40
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:32,094
Each of these variables has
a range of normal variability for

41
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:38,620
a variety of reasons, and that variability
is just part of how homeostasis works.

42
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,490
These variables might vary
by the time of day or

43
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,200
the level of activity you're engaging in.

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,250
And so our body is able to manage
these normal fluctuations through

45
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,880
processes related to homeostasis.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,930
Each of these variables also have
a threshold of variability that our body

47
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,380
can handle for
other reasons related to stressors.

48
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,393
However when these measures exceed
an acceptable range of high or low values

49
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:10,113
of variability, our body responds
in a way to counteract that change.

50
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:14,859
Sometimes, however, we are unable
to counteract the change, and

51
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:19,490
this is when disease onsets.

52
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,950
We talk a lot about stress,
but what is stress?

53
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,320
Well stress is your response to stressors.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,940
Stress is what happens to us
when we experience a threat or

55
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,540
a perceived threat to homeostasis.

56
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,773
We can think of a lot of
examples of stressors.

57
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,617
And I encourage you to think
about your own life and

58
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:43,420
your own work in terms of what type
of stressors you might encounter.

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,510
We can characterize these in terms
of whether they are not emotional or

60
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,280
physical stressors.

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,962
We can also think about whether they are
internal stressors or external stressors.

62
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:58,757
We can characterize them in terms of
their magnitude or their severity,

63
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:04,430
as well as their chronicity,
how long the stressor persists.

64
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,700
So again, think about what stressors
you encounter in your own life,

65
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,480
as well as what type of
stressors might be relevant for

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,470
our understanding of health and disease.

67
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,940
I'll give you a few examples here.

68
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,480
Stressors might be a pathogenic insult,
such as a bacteria or virus, which causes

69
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,420
our immune system to respond in a way
which might deviate from our homeostasis.

70
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,720
Stressors might be a chemical exposure,
such as smoke or particulate matter.

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,329
Or a stressor might be an environmental
exposure such as radiation.

72
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:41,890
There are an innumerable number
of stressors that are available.

73
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,930
And so, in your own work and your own
disciplines, you will think about and

74
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,450
understand what those stressors are and

75
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,292
learn about how they might impact
your own normal physiology.
