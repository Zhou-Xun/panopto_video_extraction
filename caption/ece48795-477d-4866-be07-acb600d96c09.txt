1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,250
In this module, we're discussing

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,590
environmental health policies,

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,870
and the agencies that set
and enforce those policies.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,369
I want to ask you though,

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,630
take a moment and think about

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,000
the first environmental
health-related agency

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,305
that comes to mind.

8
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,760
For most of us here in America,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,950
that's probably the
Environmental Protection Agency,

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,095
and they absolutely
do set policy.

11
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,880
But I want to make it clear in

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,669
this module that there are
many different agencies,

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,150
nationally, locally, all the
way up to the global level,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,190
that have some role in

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,230
setting environmental
health policy.

16
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,790
Before we dive into that,

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,260
I just want to refresh us on

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,850
the environmental policy cycle.

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,920
So we've covered this
in a previous module,

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,050
but I want to
emphasize that we have

21
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,260
multiple steps here
to the policy cycle.

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,100
The first being formulating and

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,230
defining the goals of the policy,

24
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,125
setting an agenda for what
we're hoping to accomplish,

25
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,555
actually establishing
the policy legally,

26
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:01,310
and then implementing
it on the ground,

27
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,670
and finally, assessing how
well the policy is working,

28
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,195
and making tweaks as necessary.

29
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:09,060
So that's the policy cycle,

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,420
but I also want to
emphasize the link between

31
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,165
environmental health
science and policy-making.

32
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:15,920
In any type of
scientific endeavor,

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,280
we typically start
with a hypothesis,

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,420
and we gather scientific evidence

35
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,640
to evaluate that hypothesis,

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,050
we then synthesize that evidence,

37
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,570
and use that evidence as

38
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,430
part of our
decision-making process.

39
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,390
So now, we've entered the realm
of policy with this step,

40
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,455
and finally, we set our policy.

41
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:36,260
So we can think about some
of the additional components

42
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,080
that are not previously
shown on this graphic.

43
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,120
So in terms of
scientific evidence,

44
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,250
that could include
environmental data that we

45
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,530
collect in communities
around the world,

46
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,740
it could include observational
data of people's behavior,

47
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,750
it could also include
experimental data,

48
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,460
where we evaluate a particular
hypothesis and test it.

49
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,350
In terms of
synthesizing evidence,

50
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,370
this is often done with
statistical modeling,

51
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,900
or with what's called
risk assessment,

52
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,585
which we'll cover in a
different module in the class.

53
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:05,480
For decision-making, we
always have to ask ourselves,

54
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,370
what is the strength
of the evidence?

55
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,380
Is there enough evidence here to

56
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,115
suggest that we need to move
forward with the policy?

57
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,960
We also absolutely have to
acknowledge uncertainty,

58
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,190
what don't we know,

59
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,600
and how might that impact

60
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,700
the effectiveness of our policy?

61
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,590
There's many different
values that go

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,390
into the decision-making
process too.

63
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,810
Those can be social,
ethical, moral values.

64
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,920
There's also issues around

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,425
the cost of implementing
this policy.

66
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:32,960
Finally, there's also
political concerns

67
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,115
with crafting and getting
the policy passed.

68
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:39,335
I want to give you just
a very brief overview

69
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:42,680
of some environmental
health related agencies,

70
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,150
from a global scale all the way

71
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,950
down to a very local scale.

72
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,510
So at the left side
of this figure,

73
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,730
we're looking at a global
agency, in this case,

74
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,425
the World Health Organization,

75
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:53,540
which isn't associated
with any one country,

76
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,720
but actually is part
of the United Nations.

77
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,830
At the national level,
here in the US,

78
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,810
we have the Environmental
Protection Agency, or EPA,

79
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,650
but then each of our
50 states also has

80
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,060
agencies that are very much

81
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,620
involved in environmental health.

82
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,635
So I'll show you
three examples here.

83
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:11,090
Michigan is the example
in the top row.

84
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,010
We have a number of agencies that

85
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,855
do environmental
health related work.

86
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:17,120
The Department of
Natural Resources,

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,850
the Environment Great
Lakes & Energy Department,

88
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,130
which is concerned with the
quality of the environment,

89
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,705
and how it impacts health.

90
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,550
Air Quality Division that deals

91
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,320
specifically with air pollution,

92
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,285
and an Environmental
Science Board.

93
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:30,950
There are examples of states

94
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,150
that have a simpler structure.

95
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,230
In New York, for example,

96
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,030
there's a Public
Service Commission,

97
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,690
and the Department of
Environmental Conservation.

98
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,050
It's also not always that simple.

99
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,380
The bottom row here is
the state of California,

100
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,035
which has its own Environmental
Protection Agency,

101
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,850
an Air Resources Board,

102
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,250
specifically focused
on air pollution,

103
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,470
an Integrated Waste
Management board for

104
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,080
other types of waste
in the environment,

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
an Energy Commission, and a
Public Utilities Commission,

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,970
and local cities and counties

107
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,770
may have additional agencies.

108
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,330
So there's a great deal of

109
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,980
variability between our states,

110
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,150
even though they're all trying to

111
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,935
accomplish the same mission.

112
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,750
So there's many
different agencies

113
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,355
at all levels of government,

114
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,260
locally, all the
way up to globally.

115
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,360
I'd like to walk you through
a couple of examples of

116
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,795
agencies you may already
be familiar with.

117
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:18,470
The first one I'll start with is

118
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,910
the United States Environmental

119
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,300
Protection Agency, or EPA.

120
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,590
EPA has a couple
of different jobs.

121
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,460
One is to develop and enforce
environmental regulations,

122
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,160
another is to provide
educational material,

123
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,390
and a third is to fund

124
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,825
scientific research
on the environment.

125
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,890
EPA is an independent agency,

126
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,225
it's not aligned with any

127
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:40,715
cabinet level
departments in the US,

128
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,560
and staff at the EPA work

129
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,890
collaboratively with state
programs in all 50 states.

130
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,650
The EPA is actually a
very complex agency,

131
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,290
in that it's comprised of
many different centers,

132
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,570
each of which focuses
on a specific topic.

133
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,044
So for example, air, or water,

134
00:04:56,044 --> 00:05:00,110
or radiation, environmental
assessment, et cetera.

135
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,530
A second agency I'd like to talk

136
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,270
about is the US Agency for

137
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,920
Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry, or ATSDR.

138
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,720
This agency differs from

139
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,165
the EPA in that it
doesn't set regulations.

140
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:15,010
It's an advisory agency,

141
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,810
with a focus on chemical safety.

142
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,210
They conduct
toxicological research.

143
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,775
They also conduct
educational outreach,

144
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,950
and they host
registries for types of

145
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,600
exposures and diseases that

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,395
are related to the environment.

147
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:31,245
ATSDR also works collaboratively
with state programs,

148
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:33,239
and they conduct public
health assessments,

149
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:36,435
and create toxicological
profiles, basically,

150
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:38,710
massive scientific
volumes, compiling

151
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,425
our knowledge about
specific hazards.

152
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,020
Zooming out to the
international level,

153
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,120
the European Union
has something called

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,985
the European Environment
Agency, or EEA.

155
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:51,860
The EEA basically provides

156
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,960
advice on the
environment to all of

157
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,840
the European Union Nations
to allow those nations to

158
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,370
establish and implement
their own national policies.

159
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,810
Now, the EEA works collaboratively
with something called

160
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,370
the European Environmental

161
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,830
Information and
Observation Network,

162
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,020
which actually has
established itself

163
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,120
across all 33 member countries,

164
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,285
and also six additional
cooperating countries.

165
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,610
To give you a little
bit more information

166
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,945
about this network,

167
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,150
it basically consists
of three elements,

168
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,045
cooperation infrastructure,
and content.

169
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:24,350
In terms of cooperation,

170
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,485
this network has national
cooperation between countries,

171
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:29,480
there's regional cooperation, and

172
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,195
also cooperation across
the entire union,

173
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:35,405
all of this involving a lot
of international networking.

174
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:38,100
Those efforts are related
to infrastructure,

175
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,830
so this network basically

176
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,810
sets infrastructure standards and

177
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,700
tools to make sure
that data can be

178
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,580
shared broadly among
all of these parties.

179
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,070
Lastly, cooperation
and infrastructure

180
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,700
are related to actual contents.

181
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,269
So this network is
responsible for monitoring

182
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,075
environmental conditions,
gathering data,

183
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:58,430
looking at that
information, assessing it,

184
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,200
and passing the knowledge gained

185
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,835
along to all of those
participating countries.

186
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,140
Another agency that
you're probably

187
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,820
familiar with is
the United Nations,

188
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,230
which has one component called

189
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,770
the World Health
Organization, or WHO.

190
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,800
The WHO gives advice to

191
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,900
the 194-member nations
of the United Nations,

192
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,785
creates recommendations for

193
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:22,070
global environmental standards
on particular hazards,

194
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,320
and also creates
educational materials

195
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,915
that can be used
throughout the world.

196
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:29,090
I'll give you just
some examples of

197
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,560
US environmental health laws,

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,330
kind of zooming
back into America.

199
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,490
So we talked in a
previous module about

200
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,010
the National Environmental
Policy Act, or NEPA,

201
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,320
passed in 1969, which gave us

202
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,090
a very broad
framework to allow us

203
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,340
to protect the environment
going forward.

204
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,400
Shortly after that, the
Clean Air Act was passed,

205
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,710
that set comprehensive
regulations on

206
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,440
air emissions of
pollutants in the US.

207
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,000
The same year, the Occupational

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,680
Safety and Health
Act was passed to

209
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,360
regulate and make safer and more

210
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,045
healthy working
environments in the US.

211
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,030
In 1974, the Safe
Drinking Water Act was

212
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,100
passed to protect
specifically the quality

213
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,495
of our drinking water.

214
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:08,090
A few years later, the
Clean Water Act was passed,

215
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,030
which gave us comprehensive
water pollution regulation,

216
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,320
even for bodies of water that we

217
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,945
don't directly drink out of.

218
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,740
In 1976, we passed

219
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,020
the Toxic Substances
Control Act to

220
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,485
regulate and require the
reporting of chemical hazards.

221
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,495
That same year, 1976,

222
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:26,720
the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act was passed,

223
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
which for the first
time gave us something

224
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,590
called cradle to grave reporting.

225
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,170
Basically, this required
that people who created

226
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,895
hazardous waste had to track it

227
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:36,785
all the way from creation,

228
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,160
until it was properly
disposed of.

229
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,670
Fast forward about 20 years,

230
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,220
and we passed the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide,

231
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,239
and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA,

232
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:47,555
which regulated
pesticide distribution,

233
00:08:47,555 --> 00:08:50,030
sale, and use specifically.

234
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,805
So not all standards are created

235
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,920
equal when it comes to
environmental health policy.

236
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,125
If we look, for
example, at the EPA,

237
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,890
they set or recommend limits
on air and water pollutants,

238
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,020
on water-borne pathogens,
on pesticides,

239
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,740
and also on radiation.

240
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,255
That's not always true of

241
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:11,140
all types of environmental
health agencies however.

242
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,530
Zooming in a little
bit more, so EPA,

243
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,240
when they focus on
air pollutants,

244
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,870
can set limits of
air concentration.

245
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,210
Basically how much of a
pollutant can be present

246
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,550
in the air at a
given point in time,

247
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,905
or even over a person's lifetime,

248
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:28,295
and what is the risk
associated with that exposure.

249
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:30,845
All limits, including
those set by EPA,

250
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,405
makes some inference or

251
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,760
some assumption about
an acceptable risk.

252
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,685
In the case of EPA,

253
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:38,530
they will often say, for example,

254
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,410
with a cancer-causing chemical,

255
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,890
or a carcinogen, the risk can be

256
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,810
no more than one case of cancer

257
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,970
per million people exposed.

258
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,415
If we have fewer cases than
that, it's acceptable,

259
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:50,810
if more cases than that,

260
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,660
the exposure is unacceptable.

261
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,790
EPA also sets limits
for physical agents,

262
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,200
and so those limits are based

263
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,640
on levels that are expected to

264
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,350
produce either no or a
very small health effect.

265
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,760
EPA sets limits on the amount of

266
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,835
pesticides that can be
present on food products.

267
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:10,760
So basically, they say,
below these levels,

268
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,625
pesticides can be
present on food because

269
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,245
those low concentrations
only present

270
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:19,450
at low or acceptable risk
of a health outcome.

271
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,420
Finally, EPA can set limits
on the amount of a pathogen,

272
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,050
or the concentration of a
contaminant in drinking water.

273
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,920
So EPA regulates different
kinds of hazards,

274
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,920
they also have different
types of exposure limits.

275
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,235
So some standards
set by the EPA set

276
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:40,760
a one hour average or a
one hour maximum exposure.

277
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,860
These types of short-term limits

278
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,420
are designed to
protect you and me,

279
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,665
and the public against

280
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:48,670
acute health effects that
can happen very quickly.

281
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,140
EPA also will establish sometimes

282
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,240
an eight-hour average
exposure limit,

283
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,980
that's designed to protect
us against something

284
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,910
that's not going to make
us sick immediately,

285
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,345
but might give us
health effects over

286
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:02,525
a portion of the day if
we're exposed for that long.

287
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:04,820
In some cases, EPA
sets a limit that's

288
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,340
based on a one-year
exposure average,

289
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,480
and that's designed to protect

290
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,175
against a chronic health effect.

291
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:12,680
Nothing that's going to
happen on a day-to-day basis,

292
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,120
but something that
could happen if you're

293
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,030
exposed for multiple years.

294
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,260
Finally, EPA also
sets what's called

295
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,330
a maximum contaminant
limit for water.

296
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,760
So that's basically the
absolute highest amount of

297
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,410
that contaminant that can be in

298
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,125
water and still meet
the EPA limits.

299
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,670
So you can see here,

300
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,140
this is a complex environment.

301
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,790
There are many types
of hazards that are

302
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,875
regulated by many agencies,

303
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,500
and they have multiple
ways that they approach

304
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,299
establishing and evaluating

305
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:41,888
these exposures, and
then limiting them.
