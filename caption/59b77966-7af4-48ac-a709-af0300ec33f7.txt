1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,430
Good. I didn't I think I. I think I'm on the papers.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,790
It's like a middle author, so I. You submitted. So we, we definitely want to get started.

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:31,340
But I also like, you know, I can see the direction that I took, everything that I was working on.

5
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,430
I should've done something different.

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,670
Yeah. Give me your specific rules.

7
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:49,379
Yeah. Yeah. That's all I learned is that it's actually super hard to get data that's not publicly available.

8
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,440
So obviously there's a lot of people.

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,390
Exactly. And here is this student.

10
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:09,750
Yeah. Yeah, he he works closely with, you know, so he mostly like, you know, I met with him a few times, but.

11
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:20,090
Yeah, but when I go to all these things.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:35,790
Yeah. I don't know. I guess that's what I'm saying.

13
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,480
Well I think that that's way I was managing that research.

14
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,250
Is that because you are.

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,600
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

16
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:57,830
We, we got so tables around and especially if you got slimmer, people only find your little easier to get into.

17
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,469
So happy to have Ollie Hartman here today.

18
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:17,340
So he was a student here C students you graduated 18 months ago so that some of the work she's done since she moved to case Western and

19
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:30,410
also sort of a school is I emailed to be interested in talking with anyone who might be interested in these D program cases features.

20
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,590
Well a few slides here but anyway so you just want to come to my office between 1011 so it's for

21
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,690
you actually apply to first or second year master's students deadline I is December 15th so you.

22
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,530
You are interesting to us to think about that. He was a student and we still have time to write.

23
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,400
Anyway, so Holly will tell you. Okay, so she's going to talk about some of her work in prostate cancer.

24
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,270
All right. Hello, everyone. It's very exciting to be back.

25
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,010
Thank you, Jeremy, for inviting me. I feel like a speech has somehow gotten fancier in just the year and a half that I did.

26
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,140
So that's kind of fun.

27
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,930
So, like Jeremy said, I graduated from the program last August, and then I started a position as an assistant professor at Case Western.

28
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,620
So this is a project that I've been working on this year as a new professor.

29
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,300
You're working to start collaborations and kind of get things rolling and get data.

30
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,510
And that process can take a really long time. So this is a project where I'm using publicly available data.

31
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,600
So I'll talk a little bit more about the sources that I use and kind of how they can be used for other projects as well.

32
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:53,089
Okay. So first, some background. So I heard that you guys have had a lot of talks about prostate cancer, so I'll just briefly go over it.

33
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,149
So it's the most common cancer among us men. It's part of the male reproductive systems.

34
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,740
And so here's the prostate and here's a prostate with prostate cancer.

35
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,729
And so one of the symptoms of prostate cancer might be trouble urinating,

36
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,860
but it also, if this cancer is pretty small, can also be totally asymptomatic.

37
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,630
So prostate cancer raises levels of prostate specific antigen,

38
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:26,420
which is a biomarker that you can just get with a simple blood test and that that blood test can be used as an initial screening for prostate cancer.

39
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,310
So PSA screening can detect prostate cancer even in the early stages.

40
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,590
So if a man goes and gets screened,

41
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:42,650
he has a high PSA level that [INAUDIBLE] be followed up with a biopsy to diagnose or figure out what's causing that high elevated PSA level.

42
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,870
Other diseases can also increase PSA level, but it's also it's a very good indicator of prostate cancer as well.

43
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,460
So in terms of survival rates, prostate cancer has great survival if you catch it early.

44
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,240
So for localized cancer and five year survival is over 99%.

45
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,500
Regional also over 99%. And then Destin is only 31%.

46
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,610
This figure is pretty old. It's from 26. It's actually very, very old.

47
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:17,050
But you can kind of see the dramatic difference between localized survival and regional survival and distant survival.

48
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,930
So screening is really important because we want to be able to catch more cases in that localized stage

49
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,200
to hopefully prevent them from progressing and hopefully prevent prostate cancer specific death.

50
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,360
So the history of prostate cancer screening has been kind of up and down.

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,350
So PSA testing was first approved by the FDA for detecting prostate cancer in 1986.

52
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:52,290
Then in 1992, the American Cancer Society recommended screening for men 50 years and older and high risk men at a younger age.

53
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,510
And high risk men also includes men of African American descent in this case.

54
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:07,050
Then in 2008, the US Preventative Task Force recommended against PSA screening for men 75 years and older.

55
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,010
And that's because prostate cancer tends to have pretty good survival.

56
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:18,750
Most people are diagnosed in that localized stage. And so if you are a 75 year old person,

57
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,959
getting screened for prostate cancer might not make sense because it might just lower your quality of life because then you're burdened with the

58
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,080
knowledge that your prostate cancer had to go to routine checkups when really that might not actually impact your quality of life long term.

59
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:37,500
So yes, the USP, STF recommended against screening for older men.

60
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,930
Then in 2012, it recommended against screening in all men.

61
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,490
And that was because we were diagnosing a lot of localized cancer.

62
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,000
And even in the localized stage, even with that great survival, it's still scary to have a cancer diagnosis.

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,799
Even if you have all the data,

64
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,650
it's still a scary thing and that can decrease your quality of life just in general and also requires more appointments,

65
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,100
especially if it's not going to actually cause you any harm.

66
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,960
Getting screened and being diagnosed with cancer might not actually be a benefit.

67
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:19,950
So in 2012, the recommended against screening for all men and then in 2018 they changed their guidelines once again to be even more vague.

68
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,450
And essentially it's that people now should just discuss if they should get tested with

69
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,540
their doctor and they still recommend against testing for men who are over 70 years old.

70
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:38,489
So this guidance isn't great, especially if you are a doctor and you want to know if you need to screen your patient,

71
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,770
because there's not really any sort of guidance in that.

72
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:51,690
It's talk with your doctor so we can see the effects of screening in the historic diagnoses of prostate cancer.

73
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,550
So up here, this is all all stages of prostate cancer.

74
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:10,770
So you can see that in 1986, we started to increase the number of diagnosed cases and it went down as we sort of stopped screening so much,

75
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:17,549
we realized that a lot of people have some kind of indolent cancer and that's not great to always diagnose it.

76
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,160
So it went down, kind of studied out, and then you can see a drop in starting in 2010.

77
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,400
But then especially in 2012, when it started, we started recommending against prostate cancer screening.

78
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,300
And here is the incidence rate for distant stage and this is the one with lower survival rate.

79
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:43,760
So in 1992, you could see a very extreme drop in the number of cases of distant stage cancer that are

80
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,330
diagnosed with a small starting to increase again here when we started routine screening for men.

81
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:58,700
So we can see that increased screening will change the distribution of the incidence rates year over year.

82
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:05,810
If we're screening a lot more, we're going to have a high rate of localized cancer, but hopefully a lower rate of distant cancer.

83
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,240
Okay. So there's a lot of things to consider with screening.

84
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:18,110
So like I was saying, increasing the screening for cancer means increasing the rate of diagnosed localized cancer.

85
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,990
It also means a lower incidence of diagnosed distant cancer.

86
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,240
And that's hopefully because we're catching the cancer earlier and preventing it from spreading.

87
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:38,060
However, all of that considered screening alone doesn't have an impact on the true number of prostate cancer cases.

88
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:48,080
It's just a way to detect those cases. So if we go back here, this is not an actual increase in the true number of cases.

89
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,550
This is just the increase in the number of diagnosed cases.

90
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,930
So that's something that is important to keep in mind. Just because a person is not diagnosed, it doesn't mean they don't have cancer.

91
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,650
Okay. And then lastly, a cancer diagnosis is scary.

92
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:13,890
It requires, you know, many follow up appointment to the expensive chronic disease, essentially.

93
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:21,120
So being diagnosed with the prostate cancer, that's not going to spread and not going to end up being your cause of death.

94
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,310
And being diagnosed with that might not actually increase your quality of life.

95
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:34,990
So you don't want to just go around screening everyone and increasing the localized diagnosed cases just for the sake of it.

96
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:43,560
We really want to balance the rate of localized cancer and the rate of diagnosed distant cancer.

97
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:49,070
Any questions so far about screening and how we're thinking about it?

98
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:57,310
Yeah. So it doesn't it depend a little bit on how effective treatments you've got.

99
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,180
I mean, if you had wonderful treatments for localized cancer and you probably detected early.

100
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,450
So that plays that plays into a decision. Yeah. Yeah, that's true.

101
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:18,180
So for localized prostate cancer, especially like Gleason score six, the treatment can be something like active surveillance.

102
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,640
So there might not even be a actual treatment that you're going to give this person even though they've been diagnosed.

103
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,990
But yeah, of course,

104
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,920
if you're going to give them a treatment that's going to guarantee they the disease doesn't regret that you'd want a diagnosed localized.

105
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,830
But it's not always the case that we're even treating these men who are diagnosed with localized cancer.

106
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,610
Another thing about prostate cancer is that there are huge racial disparities in all aspects of prostate cancer.

107
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,080
So non-Hispanic black men are more likely to be initially diagnosed with this different type of disease,

108
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,420
almost over twice the rate of non-Hispanic white men.

109
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:08,480
And since we know that the distant metastases stage of prostate cancer is the more deadly one, then that's not that's really bad.

110
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,500
That means that we're diagnosing more men at a later stage and we're not catching it early enough.

111
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,060
And that's ultimately possibly going to be the cause of death.

112
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:28,200
Black men are also diagnosed at a younger age by about three years, diagnosed at 62.6 versus 65.2 years compared to white men.

113
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,280
And then they also have a higher prostate cancer specific mortality.

114
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:41,340
Again, two times over, two times the rate of prostate prostate cancer specific mortality relative to white men.

115
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:51,150
So altogether, black men are more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age, at a more severe stage, and are more likely to die from their disease.

116
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:56,370
And that's not great, for all the obvious reasons.

117
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,260
There's also racial disparities in prostate cancer screening itself.

118
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:09,780
So this is especially compounded with the constantly changing guidelines on what and who we're going to screen.

119
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:19,770
So we had previously frequencies of PSA testing at 32% for non-Hispanic white men and 30% for non-Hispanic black men,

120
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,230
or 21.8% for non-Hispanic black men.

121
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:37,080
And then we saw a decrease in screening rates when we stopped recommending it by 9.5% for overall.

122
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,400
But it was a larger decline in non-Hispanic black men than non-Hispanic white men.

123
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,270
So combined with the already previous lower rates of screening means that there's

124
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:54,030
even wider disparity in prostate cancer screening between white men and black men.

125
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:02,640
So to say in another way, when PSA screening was recommended, black men were already getting screened at a lower rate than white men.

126
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,780
Then, when it wasn't recommended, the drop was larger for white men.

127
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,780
So that difference between those those screening rates between white men and black men grew with that policy change.

128
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,780
So what we can see here is that poor policy can aggravate already present disparities.

129
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,890
So policy is critical when we're thinking about how we're going to work our way towards health, justice and health equity.

130
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:35,230
There's also a lot of nuances when we are studying racial disparities.

131
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:42,070
This is something that I started here at Michigan was learning about how I statisticians we can

132
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,920
be part of studying racial disparities and what good we can do and how to avoid doing harm.

133
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,570
So the first thing to note is that race is a social construct.

134
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:01,600
The definitions of race groups has changed over time, and it's not always related directly to a person's genetics or ancestry.

135
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:14,800
As an example, Irish people did not used to be considered white and they were they were minoritized and had racial discrimination against them.

136
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:20,650
So race is not necessarily always directly tied to genetic ancestry.

137
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,589
However, this is a quote that I've used in several presentations that I really like.

138
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,160
Race, as we know it has no deterministic biological basis.

139
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,660
All the same race is so powerful that it can have life or death consequences.

140
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:42,310
So one of the things that is important when you're thinking about racial disparities, especially in prostate cancer,

141
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:54,130
is that it's not necessarily that a person's biology is making them more prone to prostate cancer or prostate cancer outcomes.

142
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:00,370
But it might be their lived experiences, their excess stress, etc. that's having these consequences.

143
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,870
In the United States, race is correlated with tons of different factors that have impacts on people's health.

144
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:17,390
So where a person lives and your person a person's income, just the daily stressors a person has their access to resources,

145
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:24,050
all of those things can impact a person's health, health and are highly correlated with a person's race.

146
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,400
It's not necessarily that race is causing all these different things,

147
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,670
but really that race is related to a lot of these factors and those factors are causing those poor outcomes.

148
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,890
That's what I just said.

149
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:46,080
So if you're interested in learning more about racial disparities and how to research them and how to think about racial disparities,

150
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,729
I have a couple of recommendations. So the first one is this book Superior by Angelina.

151
00:16:51,730 --> 00:17:02,110
Say, Audie, this book goes through kind of the history of how race has been studied, going all the way back through, you know,

152
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:14,129
pre colonization times all the way through the modern era and kind of how people have used race to justify the poor treatment of people,

153
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:24,630
but also how that poor treatment sometimes ends up with minoritized races being studied like lab animals.

154
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,840
Essentially, they tell this horrible story in this book about a human zoo that existed.

155
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:38,150
So it's just kind of an interesting way to think about how people have been racialized

156
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,830
each other for centuries and how that allows us to dehumanize people as well.

157
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,569
So this is a really interesting book.

158
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:54,090
It also talks that even through modern age, there's a lot of misinformation out there masquerading as true scientific fact.

159
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:04,720
And this touches on that a little bit as well. Another article that I really like is this one the public health critical race method methodology.

160
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,450
And this is kind of a theoretical framework for thinking about race when you are doing a research project.

161
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:17,050
So when you're doing a research project and you include race as a variable in your model,

162
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,820
you are essentially capturing a lot of information about a person with a single proxy of their race.

163
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:34,750
And this talks about how to go about interpreting that and how you go about thinking about race in your research.

164
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:45,010
This last one raises a bundle of sticks. It kind of encapsulates my what I've been saying about race in this talk.

165
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,560
Race is really composed of a lot of different factors.

166
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:55,480
Where you live, what neighborhood, your skin color, religion, ancestry, all of that is kind of encompassed in race.

167
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:01,120
So essentially what they're saying when you're adding race as a model, as a variable in a model,

168
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,820
is that what they're saying you're doing is essentially adjusting for all those other things that you're not including in your model.

169
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:14,889
So for example, if you have a person's race and income in a model, then race is no longer a proxy for income,

170
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,500
but it's still a proxy for somebody's neighborhood, their job, etc.

171
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,190
But you're not adjusting for their income any more.

172
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:33,550
So I think all of those are really good examples and things to think about when you are studying racial disparities.

173
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,370
Okay. So now I'm going to talk about the actual study that I am doing.

174
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:48,090
Does anyone have any questions before we go on about prostate cancer screening or studying racial disparities?

175
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,550
Yeah.

176
00:19:52,300 --> 00:20:02,500
So I guess, I guess the recommendation to adjust for race and interpret it correctly or to suggest I think that that really depends on the context.

177
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,720
So. Adjusting for race just to adjust for race isn't always a great idea.

178
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:18,280
But if you truly think that there is a difference that can be captured by race, then it would be important to adjust for that in your model.

179
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:26,229
But it would also be important to do think about that smartly. You know, race being a proxy for all these different things,

180
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,840
you have to think about what you're actually adjusting for and if there's another way to include that information.

181
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,700
So you wouldn't want to just include race if you also have all this other data about a person.

182
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,910
So that would be my recommendation. But I think I think that this one would talk about that best.

183
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,540
And this, I think, is like a political science article.

184
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:54,480
So it's not necessarily health related, but I think it's a great way to kind of conceptualize race.

185
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:04,140
Question What happens if someone like an individual doesn't fall into this stereotype or the race that they're in?

186
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,320
Does that impact the prediction? Yeah, definitely. So race can be a proxy for all these things,

187
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,760
but it's not a very good proxy for all these things because there is diversity within a race classification,

188
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,909
especially something like the census race classifications.

189
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:27,360
We know that those are way too broad of categories that to really capture the nuances of most Americans.

190
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,650
So that's another reason why I would say if you have other data that might capture some of these things, I would put that in the model.

191
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:42,540
Unfortunately, adjusting for race is just so common, but I really think that it's important to think through.

192
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:49,020
Wired Why you're adjusting for race and how you're putting it in the model and what what that is a proxy for.

193
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:56,940
Um, but yeah, there, there's a lot of problems with adjusting for race, and you're absolutely right.

194
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:08,070
A people who are of the same race aren't going to share all of these traits in common, thinking about, you know, religion and diet and neighborhood.

195
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,360
Those things are all going to be highly variable within a race.

196
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,479
They just might be correlated with race a little bit, but definitely not 100% correlated.

197
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,290
So good. Good question. All right.

198
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:30,850
Okay. So for going back to prostate screening, we have identified a couple of problems.

199
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:38,920
So first of all, the current policy is way too vague to actually be useful and to be able to be implemented in any sort of strategic way.

200
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,579
We also know that black men are diagnosed at a younger age than white men,

201
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,140
so any sort of age based screening policy might actually increase disparities.

202
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,750
So, for example, if you say, excuse me, don't screen anybody until they're 50.

203
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,740
Black men are going to have a higher incidence rate before they're 50 already.

204
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,840
So you're not going to be capturing that. So any sort of age based screening isn't going to be great.

205
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:10,409
However, we do have to balance that. Increasing screening will increase the overall incidence of localized cancer, which is bad,

206
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,640
but also decrease the incidence of diagnosed distant stage cancer, which is good.

207
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,050
So there's a balance there that we talked about earlier, too.

208
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,580
So those are the three main problems with screening that I've identified.

209
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:31,560
So essentially what I wanted to do was design a study to examine the effects of screening policy on prostate cancer specific mortality,

210
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:38,010
and identify a screening policy that doesn't increase the disparity in prostate cancer specific mortality as well.

211
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:47,360
So here's the conceptual model that I was thinking about when I was designing this study.

212
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:55,130
So here I have a person's demographics, and for this project I'm considering demographics of just age and race.

213
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,719
And a person's demographics can impact all sorts of things in their life.

214
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:07,230
So how often they're going to go get screened for prostate cancer that might be based on a person's age and race?

215
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:14,989
And then the incidence by stage. We know that black men are diagnosed with prostate cancer at a higher rate than white men.

216
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,430
So incidence by stage is also impacted by demographics.

217
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,570
And then survival, the prostate cancer specific survival is also related to a person's race.

218
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,550
We know that black men die at a higher rate of prostate cancer than white men. And then up here we have the policy.

219
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,320
The policy really only affects directly the screening rates.

220
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:43,540
How often a person goes to get screened is based on if prostate cancer screening is recommended or if it's not recommended.

221
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:53,920
And what we want to do is design a policy that takes that person's demographics into account in order to have a downstream effect on survival.

222
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:02,200
So what I really wanted to do with this project was only tweak the policy and see what we could do.

223
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,720
Not being a health behavior person, I don't know. Ways to increase screening rates, I don't really know.

224
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,530
I'm not a clinician. I don't know really how to prevent this cancer, but I know that I can look at different kinds of policies.

225
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,470
So that was really the only thing that I wanted to tweak here.

226
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:29,560
So essentially what I decided to do is do simulations to look at prostate cancer mortality based on screening guidelines.

227
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,980
So some assumptions that I made was that in order to be diagnosed and treated, a person had to first be screened.

228
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:42,220
Sometimes people immediately get PSA screening and they get a biopsy if they're having really bad symptoms.

229
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:48,580
But typically, a person is screened for prostate specific antigen, and then they're diagnosed afterwards via biopsy.

230
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:58,630
So more screening can result in more diagnoses and just and it will change the estimated incidence rate by stage screening rates.

231
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,040
Incident rates by stage and survival are all based on demographics.

232
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:09,780
And then survival rates vary by stage of diagnosis, which is impacted by the screening rates.

233
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:18,300
So we're kind of going to be looking at how all of these things work together, especially when we're just changing the policy here.

234
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:26,500
Okay. So in order to do this, I needed several different rates and data.

235
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,600
So first, I needed the screening rates by age and race from when prostate cancer,

236
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,620
prostate specific antigen screening was recommended and when it wasn't recommended.

237
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,520
I needed the incidence rates of prostate cancer by stage, age and race.

238
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,730
Also, when PSA was recommended and when it wasn't recommended,

239
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:58,030
and then any overall rate of prostate cancer specific mortality by age at diagnosis race in years since diagnosis this one I don't really need it for.

240
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:04,390
When PSA is recommended when it's not recommended because we're essentially conditioning on a person's stage at this point.

241
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,400
And by conditioning on a person stage, then it doesn't matter how they were diagnosed at that stage,

242
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,840
what the overall frequency is of the different incidences by stage.

243
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,890
And then lastly, I need a non cancer mortality rates by age and race.

244
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:26,680
So do you see where all of these different components are needed to get at to do this simulation?

245
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:36,659
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the general hypothesis that I was using to develop this study was by changing the PSA screening

246
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,569
policy based on a person's age and race will be able to impact the population level prostate cancer,

247
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,460
specific survival. So we're only tweaking the policy.

248
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:56,580
We're going to make it based on a person's age and race, and we're going to look at the downstream effect on prostate cancer specific mortality.

249
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,250
Okay. So to do this, I use publicly available data sources.

250
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,940
So like I was saying at the beginning of this talk, it's it's rough getting data.

251
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,340
You have to go through so many IRP processes and data use agreements.

252
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:18,570
And if you're not directly working with the person who has the data, if you're doing maybe a secondary data analysis, that just takes time.

253
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,220
And so publicly available data is much quicker to get.

254
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:30,030
So the resources that I use was first I looked at the behavioral risk factor surveillance system,

255
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:39,480
and this is a survey that's intended to be nationally representative, and it has a lot of information about health behaviors.

256
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,320
And one of those is prostate specific antigen screening.

257
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,510
Well, a few things about using this data is that you have to use survey weights when you're analyzing the data.

258
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:55,030
And I thought it was easiest to analyze and they have code available in for SAS.

259
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,730
And so it's kind of copy paste a little bit.

260
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:05,200
If you want to get fancier, it gets a little bit more complicated, but they have really good documentation on how to do the analysis in SAS.

261
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,130
I did try doing it in R and it just took up forever and DOS was much faster.

262
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:23,680
So including so other things that they look at there, things like other kinds of cancer screening, colorectal screening, other diet kinds of factors.

263
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:32,230
So you get this data is pretty rich when you are going through this data though, just be careful because not every question is asked every year.

264
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,940
So I found that the PSA screening question was only asked every other year.

265
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,129
So before I realized that it had some weird estimates, I was like, What is happening?

266
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:49,810
Why is all of a sudden my standard deviation so big? So just keep that in mind when you are going through this data to make sure that your question,

267
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,370
especially if you're doing something longitudinal over time, actually your questions asked each of those times.

268
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,650
The next data that I used was this seer stat data.

269
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:06,940
So this is registry data from SEER, which is that big cancer registry that I'm sure you've heard about a zillion times in this class.

270
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:16,329
Now, the SEER stat data, though, is specifically its own software that you can download.

271
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:23,920
So it's its own software, so you can't really do very fancy things with it, but you can get, you know, rates of events.

272
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,640
So I was able to get incidence rates by age and stage and then survival rates by age of diagnosis and stage as well.

273
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,960
So that's good for just getting those those raw data, those raw incidence rates.

274
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:45,370
The last one is CDC one hour. So this is national data on mortality from many different causes.

275
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,499
And you can get this drill down by age, race and so many more.

276
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,830
So CDC Wonder has a web app that you can use to get the rates from there.

277
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,790
So those are the three main ones that I used.

278
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:06,550
But that said, there's a lot of publicly available data out there, especially if you're interested in looking at disparities.

279
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:15,150
There's the county health rankings, the area deprivation index and the Social Vulnerability Index are all kind of.

280
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:24,179
Related to how well a specific area is doing in terms of different metrics.

281
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,150
So financial, economic stability, education, etc.

282
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:42,830
And this other one, it all of us is an NIH sponsored data set and you can use R and Python with it, but it's also through a web app too.

283
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,870
But this is a lot of interesting data.

284
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:52,220
I haven't explored it a ton, but it has a lot of cool properties and they make you go through this training which.

285
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:00,819
It sounds terrible, but it was actually really cool because they also really emphasize equitable analyzes and try to promote

286
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,470
health justice and making sure that your analyzes aren't accidentally causing any harm to people.

287
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:13,959
So and it's all people who contribute their data to this dataset can also review all the research that's being done with this data set.

288
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,650
So that's a pretty cool resource that I haven't seen used very much, so I would recommend checking that out.

289
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,050
Because I want to have questions about publicly available data or how to find it or anything like that.

290
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:35,810
So all of us know this race is all about you ever wants to can enroll, isn't it.

291
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,809
Yeah. So, yeah. So it, I think look, I think do enroll in it.

292
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:48,320
You have to allow them to access your medical records. So it has like tons of data on these people.

293
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,049
And I think their goal is to get to like a million people think they're not there yet.

294
00:32:54,050 --> 00:33:00,720
But yeah, so it has a lot more medical information and not just self-reported information to state.

295
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:07,520
Do we know how representative it is to give you weight? So do they tell you to enroll in it?

296
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:15,860
Probably not. I don't remember. I was playing with this like earlier this year, so it's been a minute since I've opened it up.

297
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,469
They say that one of their goals is to make it diverse, though,

298
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:28,500
because they do want it to be used for looking at health disparities and resolving health disparities and that sort of thing.

299
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,370
But I don't know if they give you weights and all that.

300
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:39,380
I'll have to revisit it. I'm not sure. Yeah.

301
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:44,320
Okay. Okay. So here's where I got all the data.

302
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,870
So we're going to look at the one you're screening, right?

303
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:54,879
So essentially, I looked at the survey question and B are obsessed about when was the last time you were screened for prostate cancer?

304
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,260
And I looked at who said yes. In the last year I was screened for prostate cancer.

305
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,309
So I first looked at a time when PSA screening was recommended.

306
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:10,870
So I used 24 and 26 for that. So the policy changes happened at 22 and 28.

307
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,660
So I kind of wanted to get kind of more in the middle of that.

308
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:22,000
And then I also looked at a period where PSA screening was not recommended, and that was between that was 2014 and 2016.

309
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:29,030
Then I looked at the incidence rates by stage for those same years using see or stat.

310
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,600
And then I looked at the general survival data from CDC.

311
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:38,900
Wonder by age and race. And then I also got cancer survival from Seer Stat.

312
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:48,080
Yeah. Okay. So the general process for the simulations that I set up.

313
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,280
So first I generated a cancer free cohort at age 40.

314
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,550
I generated 100,000 white men and 3000 black men.

315
00:34:55,970 --> 00:35:00,080
And then I worked through this process at each step.

316
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,530
So first I looked at if they had a previous diagnosis to start with.

317
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,330
Nobody did. So then I randomly generated if they were screened or not.

318
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:13,430
And that was assigned with probability based on age, race and the current PSA screening policy.

319
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:20,450
If they weren't screened, then I randomly assigned if they survived that year based on the CDC Wunder data,

320
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,230
if they were screened, then I randomly diagnosed. If they were diagnosed and at what stage?

321
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,890
And that was based on age rates and the incidence by stage rate based on policy.

322
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:41,550
If they were not diagnosed, then again, their survival for that year was just based on the general public data from CDC.

323
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,400
Wonder if they were diagnosed.

324
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:53,720
Then I looked at survival based on their cancer diagnosis and looked at the one year survival for the stage, age and race.

325
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:58,650
Then we added a year to everybody's ages and worked our way through this again.

326
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:07,280
And if a person was previously diagnosed, then we did their survival based on their cancer survival probabilities.

327
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,370
And then at the end of the simulation, I ran this until all the men in this cohort were 100.

328
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:21,560
And I looked at prostate cancer specific mortality. Does anyone have questions about this simulation process that I went through?

329
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,940
Yeah. So the rates are all taken from people who didn't receive any treatment?

330
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,090
No. So the rates, you mean of survival down here?

331
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,850
Right. Because I'm just saying, like, there's no, like, biological difference based on race.

332
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,200
Right. So, like, it should be the same. Right.

333
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:52,140
So this is from Seer Stat. So this is not based on what treatment they received or something like that.

334
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:57,630
This is just like what's currently happening in the world basically in terms of survival.

335
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:05,160
And so it's taking that population level estimate and not really drilling down into much else.

336
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:14,190
So what I did was I got. So for a man who is diagnosed that year, 67 or something like that,

337
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:22,319
I looked at the survival curve for that person's age, a diagnosis and then their race also.

338
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,200
And so I had a bunch of survival curves and that's what I did.

339
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:33,880
So then I looked at. Like how many years since diagnosis and looked at the probability of survival for that.

340
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:40,149
So it was really kind of a bird's eye view of what's happening rather than thinking about,

341
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,020
okay, what's the probability that they were then treated this way or treated this way?

342
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,920
So I tried to minimize the number of assumptions I had to make.

343
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,700
So one of the assumptions that I didn't want to make was simulating the true underlying disease status.

344
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:06,880
So you'll see here that I never actually simulated if a person actually had prostate cancer or what stage they had prostate cancer at.

345
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,950
And the reason for that was that that would require a lot of assumptions.

346
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,630
And I would have to be making assumptions about things that are still being actively researched.

347
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:23,520
So the first thing that I would have to assume is the timing of the development of undiagnosed localized prostate cancer.

348
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:29,520
So I'd have to at some point simulate, okay, this person developed prostate cancer, but they haven't been diagnosed yet.

349
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:37,889
But it's not really known how the time between the first appearance of the disease and when it's diagnosed because it hasn't been diagnosed,

350
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:44,820
we don't really know how long a person is living with that disease. I'd also have to then think about progression rates by age and race.

351
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:52,200
And progression is something that's being actively studied, going from that localized stage to does metastases.

352
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:00,780
And I'd have to look at the rate at which that occurs, and then I'd have to think about the sensitivity and specificity of PSA screening.

353
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,150
So given a person has the disease, how likely is it that they actually were detected?

354
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,500
And then also, if they don't have the disease, false positive rates, etc.?

355
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:18,749
So that was going to be a lot of assumptions and opened myself up for a lot of debate and critique about how I made these assumptions.

356
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:24,190
So I didn't want to do that. So I really just did it based on screening and diagnosis.

357
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:28,380
I didn't simulate the underlying disease there. Okay.

358
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,060
Any questions about the methods that are used or the process or.

359
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:41,609
So when you go back a little bit, when you're looking at these publicly available data sets, you just reading off, right?

360
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,440
So you're sort of fitting models to.

361
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:56,330
So for these I was just looking at the rates, so I was just calculating the rate of screening, the incidence rate and CDC wonder.

362
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,790
I have those results so I can show up. So those two were like logistic regression models.

363
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,110
So this ended up being a fairly simple process.

364
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,020
It took a while to like think through all the components, but in the end it ended up being somewhat simple.

365
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,480
So, so here's as an example the screening rates under different screening policies.

366
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:28,830
So this is just from the beta data versus, as I call it, in my head.

367
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,690
And so this is an interesting plot to me.

368
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,680
So the solid line is the screening rates.

369
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,120
When PSA was recommended, the dashed line is when it wasn't recommended.

370
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:48,480
The red line is the rate for white people and the blue line is the rate for black people.

371
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:56,880
So things that I think are interesting here. So it makes sense that when PSA screening is recommended, the rates are higher.

372
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,030
I actually thought that there would be a larger difference between when prostate cancer specific antigen,

373
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,100
but PSA screening was recommended when it wasn't recommended. But that's not what I saw.

374
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,660
I think that's because I consider myself to be a rule follower.

375
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,090
And so, like, if it is recommended, I'm going to do it. If it's not, I'm not going to do it. So I guess that's not the way everybody works, though.

376
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,150
Another thing that I thought was interesting is that there at younger ages,

377
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:32,150
black men are more likely to be screened for prostate cancer, but at older ages, they're less likely to be.

378
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,379
So there's actually a cross here. So at younger years, the blue line is over the red line.

379
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,740
And over here the red lines are the blue lines.

380
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,489
I think that this is because for younger ages,

381
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:51,030
they recommend that high risk populations get screened at a younger age and black men are considered a high risk population.

382
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,770
So I think that that's why that happened.

383
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:01,880
However, ideally, since black men are more likely to be diagnosed and have worse disease, etc., we'd like to see.

384
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:07,500
We would hope that they would constantly be screened at a higher rate to prevent that distant disease.

385
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,670
But that's not what we see here. Another thing that I thought was interesting was.

386
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:16,770
And I think this is probably just a weird fluke of the data,

387
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,880
but it's strange that it happened both when PSA was recommended and when it wasn't recommended.

388
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:30,120
Is this little dip at the 70 to 74 year old age range in the black men screening rate?

389
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,980
So you can see with white men that it's kind of a nice curve here.

390
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:41,100
And then for black men, it's kind of a slower curve. And then it has this weird dip at this age range and then goes back up and down.

391
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,870
Sure, what's happening there? But I'd be open to if anybody has thoughts.

392
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,190
I'm not even sure if that's real, but it happened both times. So.

393
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,570
So that's the screening rate under different policies. Oh, yeah.

394
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:59,460
So what's the vertical axis? Explain to us what the denominator is and stuff.

395
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,680
Yeah. So this is the proportion of men who received PSA test in the last year.

396
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:16,140
So here at between 40 and 44, you know, about 25% of black men were screened when PSA screening was recommended.

397
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:27,480
So this is the proportion of all men who are in these age ranges and of this race that were screened for prostate for using PSA screening.

398
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,620
This is your simulation? No, this is real data. Okay.

399
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,059
Yeah. So this is from the the VR FSS data.

400
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:43,840
So this is just looking at those rates. I'm supposed to stop screening when men get to 75, but they have a high rate.

401
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,240
Yeah. Yeah. See, again, I feel like I'm a rule follower.

402
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:53,640
If they say don't screen, I'm not going to get screened. But they're still screening 75 to 79.

403
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:59,700
And look at the 80, 80 or older. They're being screened for white men 60% of the time.

404
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,160
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

405
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:10,170
Because it's differentiated, I guess at all between like if a man has symptoms and his doctor is like,

406
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,670
well, I don't know what's going on, but let's check your PSA versus oh, we're to screen it.

407
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:21,420
Yeah. So this doesn't differentiate. I wonder if it was really solely based on that single question.

408
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,820
When was the last time you were screened for prostate cancer or using PSA?

409
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:35,350
And this is screened in the last one year. Okay.

410
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,650
So this is also just the data that I collected that I'm used to simulate.

411
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:49,000
This is not simulation data. This is from Seer Stat. So this is the local localized cancer incidence under different screening policies.

412
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,770
Again, black men are in blue. White men are in red.

413
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:58,180
The dash line is when PSA is not recommended, the solid line is when it is recommended.

414
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:07,150
So we can see here that there's a big increase in the number of localized cancers

415
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:11,920
that are diagnosed when PSA is recommended versus when it's not recommended.

416
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:20,380
We can also see that black men are diagnosed at a higher rate across pretty much all ages, regardless of screening policy here.

417
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:33,280
One thing that I think is interesting when looking at this plot is that the rate of localized cancer decreases after age 65 to 69 or so.

418
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:42,010
I think that this is interesting because I'm thinking about all the times I've modeled cancer and stuff, and I always include age as a linear term.

419
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,490
But this is very clearly not a linear trend here.

420
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,330
We're not more likely to be diagnosed with localized cancer as age increases.

421
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:58,240
So when you're looking at localized cancer, you might want to include a quadratic term here to do an age squared kind of thing.

422
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:04,260
That does, of course, you know, it matters which what age range you're looking at.

423
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,260
If all your men are over age 65, you might be able to get away with a little bit more.

424
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,740
So I thought that that was interesting in this plot. Any other thoughts on this plot?

425
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,520
4 minutes. Okay, great. Almost done.

426
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,470
Okay. So this is the distant cancer incidence under different screening policies.

427
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,110
I think this is another plot that I find very interesting. This is also from c r stat.

428
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:37,970
So unlike the localized cancer, the case of distant cancer only increases with age.

429
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,930
One thing to note, though, is the scale is highly different. So here we are only going up to 50 and here it's like 400.

430
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,670
So very different scale.

431
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:58,760
We can also see that there is a decrease in incidence and distant cancer when PSA screening is recommended primarily for white men.

432
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:06,050
For black men, the screening recommendation seems to matter less.

433
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:17,510
For white men, there's a clear trend where higher screening decreases the rate of of distant disease, less so for black men.

434
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:23,720
But you can also see that black men are in general much more likely to be diagnosed at distance than white men.

435
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:35,250
So now here's the actual simulations that I did. So this is just the cumulative number of prostate cancer deaths over the course of my simulation.

436
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:39,200
I didn't have to do any sort of censoring because I followed these men until they were 100.

437
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:49,840
I think that this kind of plateaus a little bit because prostate cancer, it takes a while for you to succumb to the disease.

438
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,870
So I think maybe these men just were not followed long enough to actually see that.

439
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,510
But you can see so this is when prostate specific antigen is never recommended.

440
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:10,010
You can see that white the total number of deaths are about 10,000 versus 13 and a half thousand for a difference of 3000.

441
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:13,730
And this is in 100,000 white men and 100,000 black men.

442
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,870
So a 3,000% difference isn't negligible.

443
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:23,270
And you can see the big difference here and the cumulative number of specifically prostate cancer deaths.

444
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:29,329
This is when PSA is always recommended. The axes on these two plots are the same.

445
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:37,730
So you can see the decrease overall in the number of prostate cancer deaths when PSA screening is recommended.

446
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,340
The difference, unfortunately, is still pretty high between white men and black men.

447
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:48,680
Number of deaths. It's just under 3000 here.

448
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:56,960
And then the last thing that I looked at was where I had PSA recommended for only men between 65 and 85.

449
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:05,380
And this was to look at if that actually did increase the disparities and it did about by 200.

450
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,620
So this is 29 now, is it 2900 and this is 2700.

451
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:16,850
And you can see on the plot this top line is the cumulative number of deaths in black men.

452
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,910
You can see it increases ever so slightly, whereas the white men one doesn't really change at all.

453
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:30,530
So it's a subtle difference, but there is a difference between black men and white men when there is an age based policy.

454
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,580
And just to sort of summarize that, here's the number of prostate cancer deaths overall.

455
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,620
If it's never recommended, the difference is about 3200.

456
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:44,190
When it's always recommended, it's about 2700.

457
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:50,790
And when it is recommended for these specific ages, it's 2900.

458
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:57,666
So that is overall, the. And of the simulations that I have, I have a lot more things.
