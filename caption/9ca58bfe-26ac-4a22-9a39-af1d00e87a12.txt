1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,840
All right. And I'm also going to start recording. So you're also happy? So I'm here.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,600
Would you like a microphone? Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,110
My name is Jonathan James and one of your first three class reps to say hi to everyone.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,040
Feel free to attack me off email or b but that everything good.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:30,030
One thing that the cider mill this Saturday from 2 to 5 and that stir more information is going to come in the group chat soon so they can.

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,570
Hey, guys, I'm Sam. I'm also a first year rep.

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:42,160
And same thing about what Jonathan said. You guys contact me through scrutiny, WhatsApp, emails, all of that, all in the chat.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,740
And again, the cyber stuff.

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:52,030
I know that some people usually for transportation logistics will figure out stuff, but we might just try and figure out who has cars.

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,709
We have plans on going and get them guys. Hi everyone.

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:03,250
I'm Christoph. Along those lines, I think I'll be putting a poll in the group chat tomorrow.

12
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,790
If you don't have transportation, we'll make sure you're covered for this trip.

13
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,510
Everyone on Rainy. Yeah. I'm not going to talk about this later.

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:20,889
Okay. But yeah, if you we have a really good line of communication between us and other reps and faculty.

15
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,700
So if you have any concerns or anything whatsoever,

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:34,150
you can messages or email us or even just approach us and we'll bring it up right away and you just get on business with them.

17
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:51,390
Oh. Once again, I hope we stay in this high energy mainstay without a lot of quite important thinking and group work for you guys to do so.

18
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:06,719
What are ready for that? You can do this. So today, the outcomes of environmental policy on climate change, which is part of our valuation series,

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,490
there is several different sessions during this class where we're asking you to

20
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:19,740
start thinking about how do you figure out whether we want to see is a good 14450.

21
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,600
Okay, you guys start with these simple exercises around picking some core values,

22
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:34,590
figuring out what those core values fit, maybe thinking about to today, how you measure some of those core values.

23
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,750
So we're giving you this simple three part structure with equity efficiency and efficacy on purpose,

24
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:51,450
because we're asking you to think about some of the tensions between those core values that might be present when a policy decisions are being made.

25
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,399
And that doesn't mean you can't think about planning all the core values that you

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,750
might be trying to use to evaluate and assess whether a policy choice is a good one.

27
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,300
So there are lots of other methods that you have to be will behave with ease.

28
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:15,360
But ethics might be a clear concern. Somebody might have the class suggested empathy, which just goes to target all students in that class.

29
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,110
Well, I believe that we can share a really good point with that.

30
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,450
You're talking about patient doctor relationships.

31
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:29,010
So there are plenty of other values you could use, the ones that we've had to use so far, we're going to carry over today.

32
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,690
So three A's.

33
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:40,259
Want to talk a bit about surprise billing and the emphasis is a little bit more on you this time to really get into the details of the policy.

34
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,720
Don't worry, we're going to be helping you through that. But we want you to think a bit more about measurement today.

35
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:56,880
So in the context of whether a policy is equitable, efficient and effective, there are some key measurement concerns.

36
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,079
So you can think of this as important.

37
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,780
Thinking to do now is going to be taking more and more logical focus classes throughout this course.

38
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,990
Maybe you'll do cost effectiveness analysis later. Maybe you'll be doing some more advanced econ.

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,590
But this kind of thing is going to be very helpful for everybody at all levels of policy evaluation.

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:31,920
Now, for our three concepts, when you're thinking about one of the most important points is how do you actually measure need?

41
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,730
If an equitable policy is about figuring it out,

42
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:44,580
who has the biggest need and trying to bring them up to the level of other people and create or more even outcomes across the population?

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,850
Well, how do you assess that? Need some very important things that actually don't always fit well with existing models of policy evaluation.

44
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,769
You want to understand what is the policy prioritized?

45
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:06,780
Does it empower groups that might have been marginalized? You might need to have a very clear idea of that before you start evaluating.

46
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:15,180
And guess what? You might actually need to talk to some of the affected people in order to understand what their needs are now.

47
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:24,299
I hope that shows that you might also want to talk to the experts who study equity to get a better idea of how this is going to play out.

48
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,390
Right. So we don't mess around with equity.

49
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:35,850
We need to figure out how to tap into expertize and firsthand accounts of experiences in addition maybe to doing some other data analysis.

50
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,690
And I hope this shows how this is showing my bias is a qualitative researcher.

51
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,850
Qualitative data might be very important when you're thinking about equity.

52
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,160
Now contrast that to how people think about and conceptualize efficiency.

53
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:03,450
Oh yeah, because you could measure the inputs and outputs and potentially we've got a way to put producing the desired outputs,

54
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,060
which would be optimal from the point of efficiency. But then how is a policy both efficient and equitable could be a very important question.

55
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,140
Can you justify spending a lot of money? So understanding that relationship is quite important.

56
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,460
So part of the difficulty when you start using concepts like efficiency,

57
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:34,500
if you listen to political debates, policymakers quite often equate efficiency and overall cost.

58
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,970
This program is expensive. Save more. It is wasteful and inefficient.

59
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:47,520
I want to disabuse you of that notion. Right. Sometimes we have to spend money on something to make it work, to make it efficient even.

60
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,360
And so the political debates around this can really muddy the waters around policy evaluation.

61
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,880
For example, it's arguably more efficient to take money and spend it on preventative care or public health

62
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,310
than it is to try and treat people after they've been infected by serious health problems.

63
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,460
Oh, Andrew, I'm seeing you going like this. Do you want to come in? Well, we just talked about this yesterday in Econ.

64
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,650
So, yeah, tell me, the econ, you know, it's okay.

65
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,240
You're pretty loud, so that's good. Yeah. I think we talked about that.

66
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,440
And I think that's the comment. Like, everybody thinks it's easier to screen something and catch it and treat it early.

67
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,580
Well, screening is a but it doesn't specific. Okay.

68
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,560
So what what specifically are you referring to? No, I'm just kind of confused.

69
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,159
So, you know, if we screen somebody and we catch it early, great.

70
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,920
But if we screen everybody in an effort to catch things, it costs the system a whole bunch more money.

71
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,389
Yeah. So I haven't always thought along the lines of what you were discussing, but I was cause to think about that a little yesterday.

72
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:04,560
And so I'm not having, you know, run through the numbers or anything, but it was good day pass for me to think about it.

73
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:11,040
Yeah, I don't think we disagree at all. So screening is one of those things where I do think it's preventative,

74
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:19,190
but it's not necessarily what I'm talking about when I'm thinking about spending more generally on prevention and public health measures.

75
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,569
Right. Because spending is a problem, especially the way that we structure screening programs,

76
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,430
you detect certain patterns of health problems that you might not otherwise have detected.

77
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:37,740
And so the cost of those things, you're right, can be maybe prohibitive, especially if you're taking a universal approach.

78
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,650
I don't think efficiency means.

79
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:51,660
And I don't think my critique here is necessarily saying don't scream, you should scream university and waste a lot of money.

80
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,970
But what is that screaming compared to Carol?

81
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,810
I think would be my comparison of understanding whether or not to do that.

82
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,860
And I think and also I'm sorry to interrupt, but also the other thing that comes with that is a lot of false positives,

83
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,490
which cause a lot of extra spending that we might not have otherwise.

84
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,620
Right. And it's a real issue in terms of cancer screening, for example.

85
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:24,960
Maybe some of these papers I actually teach that specific example in the prototype of this course I do,

86
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,010
where there are some studies that show if you screened everybody universally, you are going to find false positives.

87
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:38,820
It has some kind of weird effects on the amount of money that you would be spending later on.

88
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,300
But I still think screening is an example of something rather specific.

89
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,350
I think it does hold in general that if you spend more money on preventative care,

90
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,800
but particularly on public health, you're going to save a bit more money in the long run.

91
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,700
But yeah, I would say screening is a weird one.

92
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,770
I'm losing my friends now, but you know, that's good one of these discussions.

93
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:23,410
And so anyway forget everything you're economists from Steve Jobs this I hope that you can hold these two different frames in your head effectiveness.

94
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,540
So when you're thinking about evaluating policies based on effectiveness,

95
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:35,040
you're trying to figure out whether they do what they say they're going to do. Again, screening is a problem for evaluation, for effectiveness,

96
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,600
because if you screen defined just, oh, so does the policy create the desired outcomes?

97
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,940
I think there are a lot of ways to determine this.

98
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:53,040
Using quantitative research techniques, you can figure out various ways of examining pre and post what the situation is.

99
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,710
It's a little bit of an art and a science. You have to be very careful about the fantasy of controlling people.

100
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,550
And so using a logic model or something like that to understand what is supposed to be

101
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,520
the causation can be very important when you're doing the evaluation for effectiveness.

102
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,830
How can we sure be sure that the policy is causing this and not some other intervening factor?

103
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:25,340
Most quantitative methodologies in this case will have some means of controlling for these kinds of factors.

104
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,320
You have to be a little bit careful when you're doing policy because the data is often.

105
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,370
And then how can we assess the likely efficacy before we've even rolled out a policy?

106
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,900
This is a really tricky one. We have a lot of problems with this and tobacco control.

107
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:49,879
And we're trying to figure out, well, what different approaches to labeling on packaging actually make a difference.

108
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:57,560
And then you're in the realm of trying to do experiments and figure out people's reactions to different forms of advertising or labeling.

109
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,140
And it ended up being a quite difficult research challenge.

110
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,790
So evaluating likely outcomes is also something that you've got to be doing if you're looking at efficacy.

111
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,190
So like I said, these are three different ways to approach this.

112
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,760
There might be a lot of other different concepts you might choose to use.

113
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,229
What we're trying to give you to do in this class is no, not really any analysis yet,

114
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:32,930
but us understand some of the tradeoffs between thinking in different ways about these the same policy and maybe applying different core values.

115
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,890
And we see this tension a little bit, I think, in covering current government policy decisions.

116
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:55,459
A good example is the Justice 40 initiative, where you actually have now outside groups that are representing minority minoritized communities.

117
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,210
And they're actually saying to the Biden administration,

118
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:05,630
we want to see measurement and evaluation of how well the government is adhering to its promise

119
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:13,120
to provide 40% of government in public investment to disadvantaged and minoritized communities.

120
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,920
That's the way that they're framing this. That's the government policy.

121
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:26,300
It's kind of a weird situation that we have folks that would be normally asking for consultation with affected groups,

122
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,970
normally asking for quantitative qualitative evidence, and they're actually asking for quite a lot of quantitative measurement.

123
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,830
And I think it makes me feel a little uneasy. I think there's some problems with that.

124
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:46,879
But I'm really been what sounds like you're providing a certain proportion of public funds to these groups and to these communities.

125
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,300
And these groups are asking for accountability and accountability framework.

126
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:59,659
I wonder to what extent it would be effective to evaluate quantitatively how that's going on on the ground right to this?

127
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,920
It's kind of a complicated implementation process. All that is to say,

128
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,820
we're in this kind of very interesting moment in U.S. policy where I think we're seeing all

129
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:18,440
of these kinds of things turning away a little bit from actually the advice of economists.

130
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,390
If you look at the student debt discussion, a lot of economists are very upset about debt relief,

131
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:31,700
why the Biden administration, including economists who are working for previous governments on the debt.

132
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,800
And so that's at the same time that other people are criticizing the policy for not being generous enough.

133
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:45,050
So it's kind of interesting to see that change in in thinking in this administration, at least.

134
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:59,240
So I going to think about today is is then and I think this is a really interesting case for a couple of reasons that I want to with you right now.

135
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:07,360
So from the perspective of just patients to start with, what are the key problem with surprise?

136
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,660
This is not a trick question. This is the easiest part. The easiest question.

137
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,910
Surprise, surprise. But tell me more.

138
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,809
So a lot of patients are insured through many different ways.

139
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:27,380
And you have to keep it up to the point where they are three stories and then they go in for a procedure.

140
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,459
Sometimes the procedure isn't covered. Sometimes doctors from the church doesn't cover it.

141
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,160
It's not for some insurance. They come in treatment, for example, in population.

142
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:53,480
Sometimes there's one thing with itemized billing versus like how they would build a person is not insured versus how it goes with insurance.

143
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:00,020
It's usually inflated. And so a lot of that can be a lot of stress and other financial instability.

144
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:09,290
Right. Exactly. So the you know, the with this topic, there's a lot of things you can see that you can get into.

145
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:16,030
I want to speak to the whole class when I say that not everybody needs to go into this topic in quite as much depth.

146
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:25,159
So if you're a particularly an international student or not really studied the U.S. health system before the pandemic, you don't get all the details.

147
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:34,880
The key issues are exactly as the parents said, you have some unexpected health expense that is going to be overwhelming to you.

148
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,740
And this is not necessarily a common thing in a lot of health systems.

149
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,750
Other kids have so many problems with how they charge patients.

150
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,240
But the U.S. system is quite bad in this regard because the system is quite complicated

151
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,460
and it's much more likely that someone here in America will get a surprise.

152
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,560
It's really not that common in other countries. So what have we done to get to this situation?

153
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,759
Well, it's a really important question. So that's a problem.

154
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:13,610
Is the surprise for patients? Well, I want to how that policy experts at the time we now have congressional legislation.

155
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:21,140
Surprise. Many people were surprised that it took so long to actually get to that point.

156
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:30,470
Now, I would hope policy experts are a bit surprised that it took a long time to agree on a legislative solution to surprise.

157
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,340
But. What is it about the politics of this issue?

158
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:41,030
Because it's generally positive, like perceived by for politicians to, you know,

159
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,700
legislate on behalf of the patient and address something that would affect a large part of their electorate.

160
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,950
Yeah, right. You would think that this would be something that a politician would want to address.

161
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,180
Yeah. I was going to add that there was a lot of bipartisan support. So I'm using the moment mostly for the record.

162
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,580
Sorry. Yeah. I was going to add that there was a lot of bipartisan support for action against surprise billing.

163
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,700
Yeah. Yeah. So the two of you are quite right.

164
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:17,870
We would think this would be an activity that politicians would want to defend patients prime credit for doing that.

165
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:26,930
And also it was a bipartisan issue. So we got to the point where there was a consensus in Congress that something should be done about this problem.

166
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,030
But there was still a lot of delay in coming to an agreement.

167
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:41,030
And so what's the problem here? If you're from an insurance provider perspective, what is the real problem that they're worried about?

168
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:49,460
Even now, there's a lot of litigation and other still wrangling around the surprise billing law that we do have.

169
00:18:51,500 --> 00:19:03,739
Okay. I was going to say largely, I think it's just a bunch of administrative costs and work on their end providers.

170
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,540
Having to bill people is a lot of extra work and insurers having to deal with how they're going to cover the costs or not cover the costs.

171
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,870
It's all so much more so. So where do we allocate the losses?

172
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,389
Right. Like this is why insurers and providers are somewhat loggerheads.

173
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:26,570
Right. There are different policy solutions here which are about allocating losses to different parts of the health system.

174
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:33,980
And this was really the political wrangling that went on underneath the original consensus that there was,

175
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,060
okay, we can do something about this but have to address this.

176
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,860
And in particular, how to allocate the losses across different health outcomes is system.

177
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,540
But that's not what it still is that. I have a political question.

178
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:54,500
Okay. So. This problem definition according to insurers and providers.

179
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,140
Does that create a problem? That is the leading question. Does that create a problem for patients and the public?

180
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,590
And if so, what is it? This is a governance and political problem here where patients in the public.

181
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,979
I'm going to go to Jonathan just because I've had your features and I could potentially create delays

182
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:24,600
in care due to needing to process the bill for services prior to the patient receiving services.

183
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:32,700
So the potential impact of delay of care for you need to work out like are you in network and how much is your insurer going to pay for these services

184
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:40,680
rather than just a specialty like in emergency situations rather than you just seeking care and then we'll deal with the insurance afterwards.

185
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:51,370
Yeah, I guess that. So I'm also going to come to tell you that I mean, some don't want to bring you into the national.

186
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:59,790
This would be no surprise that the onus is kind of on the patient to be able to recognize when they can surprise you.

187
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,880
And you may not always have that knowledge or even be able to comprehend the deal that they do.

188
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,220
And the providers are also able to identify it. Look, there's more of an incentive for them to do that, too.

189
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:19,440
Yeah. As a foreigner, even one that studies health policy, when I was first here,

190
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,580
I still have very vivid memories of not be able to understand the network that was sent on those statements,

191
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,070
knowing how our minutes experience in this person is a little different than studying it.

192
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,790
So it doesn't necessarily do a great deal to solve the complexity that patients face.

193
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:42,059
Like we're going to talk a bit about administrative burden in some later classes.

194
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:51,090
Administrative burden is what is the cost to the individual of trying to gain assistance in a government context.

195
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,530
So we can already talk about it in the context of trying to get benefits from the government.

196
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,730
But I think in any case where you have to try and you have to navigate a system like the health care system,

197
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,650
you think about administrative burden in that context.

198
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,530
All right.

199
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:16,259
And I was just going to say, I think that the thank you I think the challenges that it's it's comes down to who is going to be left paying the bill.

200
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:23,040
Right. And so you have physician groups, a lot of which I think you discussed in your podcast are private equity companies.

201
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,069
And I know that to be true, especially in physiology groups. And then you have on the other side big insurers,

202
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,240
all of whom have a lot of money and a lot of representation in Congress, whereas individual constituents,

203
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,410
which are US patients, right, are not well represented in Congress,

204
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,800
even though that's the job for Congress to do, it doesn't always work out that way.

205
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,690
And so, you know, they're they're kind of left holding the bag, whereas these other groups can lobby to say, hey,

206
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:59,159
we want these minimum rates or we want to be able to build a patient for the remainder of the balance after the insurance is paid,

207
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,910
regardless of whether it's in-network or out-of-network. Yeah.

208
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,950
And I think, David, you get that from my political science perspective,

209
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:16,499
this all speaks to lack of transparency because this political conflict between primary insurers and providers,

210
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,809
which is being held under the umbrella of this new law, is still going on.

211
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:29,100
Right. It's going on through litigation charges. It's going on through the through negotiations themselves.

212
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,999
It's going on bureaucratically within the health system because it's they've moved

213
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,650
from a more transparent political arena to this thing that might happening,

214
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:45,329
but it's much less transparent to pieces of the public. So you've got a situation where from a governance perspective, it makes no harm.

215
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,460
Okay, this is still being resolved, but it's being resolved in a less accessible way.

216
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,930
So it was previously.

217
00:23:51,930 --> 00:24:02,100
So I worry a bit that as this drags on, it becomes less and less apparent to the public exactly what the impact of the law actually is.

218
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,660
So it's kind of an example of a lot of policy making in that regard.

219
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:14,220
You move to the implementation phase and it's much harder to understand what is the impact of the law on me as a person living in America.

220
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:24,180
And so I think the interest groups representing those patients have that challenge to try and help patients navigate the system.

221
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,380
So I want you to take this energy around. Surprise.

222
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,490
Meaning we're going to do some exercise today, so a little bit more in depth.

223
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:42,230
We're looking at the simplest version of this, and this is very much in line with the readings.

224
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,480
So you'll be to reference them the.

225
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:55,889
Well, I'm happy that we were asked to evaluate the measurement way that we often make you think about measurement at the end of the tentatives,

226
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,910
we're just getting to put preventing surprise billing and deciding who covers the process who.

227
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,290
A cool problem when a patient contains out of network emergency care and or

228
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,180
gets post stabilization care after being transferred from the emergency room.

229
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:21,750
In this scenario, options include a provision that prevents patients from having to pay the surprise bill.

230
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,320
Well, you still have to have a thing about this political problem with to allocate the costs.

231
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,320
So which of these two should be adopted? Should you introduce a standard payment?

232
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,069
All surprise medical bills based on the health plans,

233
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:47,340
median in-network might require insurers and providers to negotiate on price and then back that up with a binding arbitration process.

234
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,159
If they can't agree. If you are really into this topic and you come up with a surprise third option,

235
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:05,160
I would not be upset but it's not going requires all right each to assess what extent the policy is likely to create outcomes that are equitable,

236
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:11,170
efficient and effective. Okay. You can kind of give it a great, if you like, complicated things.

237
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:19,530
I mean, based on this analysis, which option would you recommend and why should you have to recommend what you like?

238
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,519
I said, if you fancy imagine this. I'm coming up with a third option.

239
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:31,440
That's not a terrible thing. Well, how about you measure equity efficiency, effectiveness in this case?

240
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,210
We're not asking for technical details here, just some ideas.

241
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,360
All right. So. I'll put that back up in just a sec.

242
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,950
We want you in groups of 5 to 6.

243
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,450
It's good to you here. Sorry.

244
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,300
It's hard to hear with groups that big, but we want to do a smaller group. That's totally fine.

245
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:02,520
You can this a three or four kind of link, but everybody is doing the same exercise this time.

246
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,260
I remind myself we have a down home today, right?

247
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,590
Yes. Okay, great. The Champions League is all.

248
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,940
I want you to have a little float so you can fill in the polls and see which popular music.

249
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:24,830
Obviously, if you have a third option you got to tell me about. If you look in the past, this is like a template.

250
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,450
I'm going to leave this up. We're going to take most of the rest of the class do this.

251
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:39,420
I want us to convene back by 8:10 so forwards from pretty calendar group sizes.

252
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:45,520
Students, you can work together and we're going to come out and have some discussion and debate that

253
00:27:45,530 --> 00:28:08,600
I just want to be here because you said you're going to hear some of us had a great idea.

254
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:19,440
What I want to be, number one, is very important as an expert on entertainment for kids.

255
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,630
And she's also a to the profession.

256
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:32,520
Wow. You know, there's a lot of romance with a lot there's a lot of outside.

257
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,720
But it'll be interesting to see that in New York.

258
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,620
And it's okay, you know, but it's pretty cool. Yeah.

259
00:28:46,980 --> 00:29:00,810
Okay. I found that I would make you want to with you guys.

260
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:17,850
And here's the difference between two, two years.

261
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:36,540
I am so excited. This is systemic racism ideas.

262
00:29:37,290 --> 00:30:19,260
I don't think that's dangerous. We're not going to change the fact that there's a lot of things that going can be like working on this campaign,

263
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:27,000
but it's not a really emotional support group.

264
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,680
That means that it's going to be the audience.

265
00:30:35,540 --> 00:31:13,710
Yes, you have to try to keep those options at advantageous to get in the house and say, like, I'm writing for you and your husband.

266
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:39,800
And I think it's just like, so I guess you're usually like networks, like the network.

267
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:48,250
Technically, it's not even like this.

268
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,830
I'm not getting a chance. I'll be like, this is lose a lot of money on this.

269
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,010
I mean, I understand it's a lot of money. So.

270
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,800
So what is it like?

271
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:25,750
What kind of. Providers to sign up for our newsletter.

272
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:39,690
Standing out to India is one of the main U.S. companies,

273
00:32:39,730 --> 00:33:02,320
so you have to know that there's not much interest when obviously that's not an issue right now because it wasn't a surprise.

274
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:22,030
I remember when I was told, I really would like to do this up and I have the title and like I don't to worry about how I think about it.

275
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:37,120
And I think that it's somebody like I just started breaking it down in my life.

276
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,860
I don't know if I've seen benefit from this.

277
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,220
I think it's not Obama's either one group is benefiting from it.

278
00:33:51,400 --> 00:34:09,670
So we're not it's not a question of whether I would say it was of the have to do the health insurance should not be filling

279
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:29,250
out the information but this is a separate involved like but this is my comments I guess it's not the end actually.

280
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:49,450
I think that's right. This is kind of a long term based on the patient and I'm on the road now.

281
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:58,450
I mean that everything is going to be higher.

282
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah. So they know how to make that is what I was probably not going to not here with the patients and takes all this out.

283
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:53,720
Yeah. You know they're only looking at it but like, you know, figure out what the ones that are trying to do.

284
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,070
Like there's so many different factors that go with generalizing the way it works.

285
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:09,850
It's in health plans. I didn't I never grammar or I never thought that way.

286
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:19,730
All right. Yeah. You know, it's a superficial issue.

287
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:26,800
You know, I don't know if that's the case.

288
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:36,420
Just really appreciate you haven't seen anything like this.

289
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:44,640
This new start has.

290
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:50,110
ARCHBOLD seems to let us know the beauty of you.

291
00:36:50,460 --> 00:37:00,820
You don't think that I how to go on in case you want to do this?

292
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,590
It sounds like right now it's kind of like a super efficient.

293
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:23,630
Selfish and that type of person.

294
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:33,020
Sorry. I'll get another surprise for you.

295
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:48,950
All right. So let's talk about what is the main point of this is just so there's five ways and I'm not sure whether or not I mean,

296
00:37:48,950 --> 00:38:23,100
there's something that you said that this is not just your idea.

297
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:32,930
I think they have, baby. I think that's why it's like that.

298
00:38:33,080 --> 00:39:03,740
So many of you out there that are about how do you think I mean, some of the class that I was an administrator like me, like I don't have a job.

299
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:20,930
So I guess I don't really know how to treat them like they are.

300
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,570
Some things that are that's a great way to look at that.

301
00:39:33,230 --> 00:40:00,350
So I think I get that this false sense of purpose and true, I just like this is what we want to see.

302
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:14,260
What do you want to take all of this thing off this program to go across a PCL mechanism?

303
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:26,720
You know what I mean? That's really how I was like that.

304
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,870
We thought we got that right.

305
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:49,060
I think you're absolutely right.

306
00:40:50,330 --> 00:41:13,900
But it's not you know, it's not going to happen to us that are great,

307
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:37,520
that we didn't seem so surprised and not efficient inside of you have to take along the

308
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:53,630
final price but things like that you people that I wanted to say to that I felt most I mean,

309
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:09,190
yeah I guess I, I, I guess we should I just like.

310
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:21,610
We have a cheat sheet that you're going to ask for the equity in which he was the president chancellor about what happens there?

311
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,960
I'd say, well, what they're saying is even. Right.

312
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:46,390
So. So I want to put that in some sort of result you get.

313
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:58,940
For the pathologist to look back and see what they're saying.

314
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,710
You know, I asked my grandmother.

315
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:19,670
I'm not just looking for a loved one.

316
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:29,140
And it's not just look at that.

317
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,660
She's so beautiful. And I think that's.

318
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,390
Oh, so glad.

319
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:57,950
So. I think that it's very difficult.

320
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:06,310
Well, first of all, I hear you.

321
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:16,930
I mean, it's been it's not easy for me to say, like, you know, it's it's just that if you really think about it, it's about race.

322
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:45,050
And I think it like to it would be great to see exactly what it is.

323
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:53,840
I guess it does not all negative.

324
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:29,560
So I think that, you know, I think it's a good thing, you know, let's make it a good place to come out and see how we do thinking about all of us.

325
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,020
But, you know, I don't know why you would because.

326
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:41,320
No, no, it's not just, you know, like this.

327
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,680
Literally, you have to write it, you know.

328
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:53,830
And it's it's interesting because after five months, I was like, I think that's the way it is.

329
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:44,730
We think about some wonderful things about what is happening right now, but it's not something that we ended up we just don't know right now.

330
00:46:44,830 --> 00:47:12,440
Some narrative is they told Sky News and I'm sure it's still like, Yeah, that's all I want to do.

331
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:37,550
Because I was just saying option one, just like, you know, I thought.

332
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:49,550
You've got to realize that over time, providers like things get hurt when they don't make it right.

333
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:56,320
Yeah. I just want to ask you something about this.

334
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:18,050
Now, I have to say, it's always good to take the time to be around.

335
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:38,470
All right. I'm not even sure how I can segment really like in a case where the only way not to get into court filings,

336
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:41,810
instructed to get tested to see how this works out.

337
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:51,150
I mean, when I wrote my poems, of course, you had an overall rating.

338
00:48:51,810 --> 00:49:09,140
And that's just, you know, like I said, everything is everything.

339
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:30,300
But I think that's all I think it was just trying to be sorry.

340
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,750
I think this is bizarre. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,960
I worry about two points. Too much of this patient.

342
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:50,080
Oh, oh, oh.

343
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:58,070
They can't bring it up. It was passed out. So you're like, oh, yes.

344
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:08,370
Right now I'm surprised. But I was I was like, Yeah, yeah.

345
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:20,510
I guess now it's like my life.

346
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:42,000
Actually, I refuse to give money that it's like it's a horror movie or don't say horror, even though I don't know,

347
00:50:43,820 --> 00:51:07,920
I if I could survive dying knocking on your door and deciding that psychological because I, I mean I'm not a fan of anything but it's your idea.

348
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,040
What are you thinking about?

349
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:22,020
The tall grass about in India and China.

350
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:30,330
I have so many. Exactly. So myself.

351
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:49,730
I feel like I'm going to find to change your mind.

352
00:51:51,150 --> 00:52:00,530
I really want to feel that announcement.

353
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:14,940
Yeah. I mean, they're like literally.

354
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,410
No, real quick.

355
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:31,620
It's like 10 minutes and it's not like and so that's why it's my second.

356
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:48,070
I'm so excited to see like.

357
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,999
Yeah, exactly.

358
00:52:51,000 --> 00:53:17,040
So I don't have to worry about like my friends and I'm actually not, but I have to be like we typically also I don't like that it's got that.

359
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:43,800
I just want to take it out here. I just, I don't really understand that this is probably right around me and yeah, I'm totally opposite of it.

360
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,880
That's not what I mean.

361
00:53:51,580 --> 00:54:26,810
But I can tell you why I thought it was almost like I've got the money.

362
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,330
Been meaning to go on.

363
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:40,540
That's what this is about.

364
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,920
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

365
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:54,250
I think I've got it all out for you.

366
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:26,020
You know, as far as it goes, I feel like I've learned, like, you know anything about this.

367
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:33,230
Oh, that's good. I was.

368
00:55:34,760 --> 00:56:25,640
I was thinking when I got to the end of the last year, like, how do I know what it's like to be like, oh, yes.

369
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:31,000
I was like Bradley Cooper.

370
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:42,130
Yeah. It doesn't actually give you another example of this this kind of this kind of thing.

371
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:54,420
So there's an outside group for that one.

372
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:21,670
But it's kind of like, I don't know, it's like, how would you like to do that?

373
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:34,280
And I'm like, you know, I guess it was like I say, there was probably one, so everybody knows what it is.

374
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:48,580
But my brain was like, man, I the change, everything that there is going to be there, you know, there.

375
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,950
Now. Are you saying that?

376
00:57:54,670 --> 00:58:00,460
No, I'm just saying we should keep working on it.

377
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,660
When you get to the MNC part, the link doesn't work.

378
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:07,990
So if you follow the instructions on the fly that will be written.

379
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:19,000
And then when you get to the site, there'll be a little button that says that's not the part that just likes to slide but isn't next button.

380
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,420
Thank you. It's 5 minutes now.

381
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:39,370
We have to go because I have a lot of people, but.

382
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,950
Yeah, yeah. Why don't you say group guys?

383
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:52,370
Do you feel I am? Yeah, I did it.

384
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,470
Yeah, like I know. Got, you know.

385
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:19,410
The difference between efficiency and complex, you know and what your ads.

386
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:35,920
All are bound to have one of the lower bound.

387
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:42,730
Yeah, but nobody knows that he could be a star.

388
00:59:44,860 --> 01:00:00,460
I feel like you're not going to die.

389
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:08,710
I think I was better than doing what I do.

390
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:23,340
You know, like, I don't know, I.

391
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:47,320
That, you know. I mean, you're not like, well, I didn't want to be like, what's that like?

392
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:56,410
Well, yeah. All right.

393
01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:09,130
Yeah. There have been calls.

394
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:18,170
31 answers. I know.

395
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:26,830
I do want to talk. About what I can't work out for money.

396
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,910
That's not going to how I saw you do that.

397
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:39,430
Like, I don't know. Like, I mean, I just.

398
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:49,830
I mean, I always. Right.

399
01:01:51,350 --> 01:02:08,770
But they thought it was all just I doing their job.

400
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:21,140
So I'm good at it. I'm here for my homework just to hear, you know, it's on their side.

401
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:44,420
Even though our personal lives would be like, Yeah, my legs are always healthier than my hands.

402
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:53,400
We're working hard to actually.

403
01:02:53,420 --> 01:03:02,270
What is going on here?

404
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:14,180
I don't know. I don't know. I never had any idea how to get it.

405
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:19,920
I saw you 010.

406
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:47,130
What about that? Let's tell you what you thought it was.

407
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:59,040
And I was like, I heard.

408
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:07,100
I know, but I don't think that you would provide your backside in your movie big.

409
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:17,850
That is, you definitely want to get food on the.

410
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:29,240
But I like you guys.

411
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:35,570
I'll be rehearsing. I don't know. You don't want to do that.

412
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:42,230
So you're calling your doctor and whatever.

413
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:52,780
I mean, I don't know. I was on the back of the nurse or just.

414
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:59,750
This is politics, is it? No, that's my mom.

415
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:19,740
I don't know. There's another job, but I wanted to ask.

416
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:44,120
And he had shot ever, you know, just now, I think for all those companies to go to work.

417
01:05:44,120 --> 01:06:00,580
And I was like, oh, know, it's going to be like literally just like I said, you know,

418
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:08,660
and they're asking but I just picture that is one that is like the one you was talking about.

419
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:18,559
It was something that I learned that one.

420
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:24,880
Oh, yeah. It's a feeling like told to get it.

421
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:35,320
Yeah, it's good for the party.

422
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:40,309
We're going to have, like, 100 people where you know me personally.

423
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:51,750
No, I'm bringing my plus one. Well, you know, let's talk before I practice.

424
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:59,260
Oh, but I asked you this for me because you told me that.

425
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:06,900
Hey. All right. So would you like to share their decision?

426
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:14,700
We've got about 10 minutes. I'm not on the record, everybody, but I had some very interesting conversations with folks I'm kind of interested in.

427
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:21,060
How did you come to your decision? What was it? And especially like what did you great?

428
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:26,040
The different options on all three criteria. You got to volunteer to go first.

429
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:42,190
I'm honestly chatty today, so let me talk to a few thousand people so you won't have to keep reminding me to do this.

430
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,840
This is people watching the video and they can't hear you if you're not angry.

431
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:54,669
So we basically decided to look at equity, efficiency and effectiveness from the provider, payor and patient standpoint.

432
01:07:54,670 --> 01:08:03,790
So we gave them all a different rating, a letter grade rating, and then we calculated the overall grade for option one and option two,

433
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:06,870
and they ended with an overall grade of a B minus for option one,

434
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,130
even though option two was our gut instinct for what policy recommendation we would take.

435
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:20,469
So we had a really interesting so they tested three, three different stickies on the template.

436
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:23,080
They had three calls for patients, providers and payers.

437
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:28,240
And I think that is an actual really interesting distinction that I saw between different groups.

438
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:33,460
Somebody said, well, equity needs to be considered for the patient perspective.

439
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,470
Some groups said, Well,

440
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:45,640
we're going to think about equity between the two most significant political practice groups about to see who are the providers and the insurers.

441
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:53,380
And some people like you broke it down into how does this affect these three different groups, which I thought was pretty interesting.

442
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:58,240
Right. So which of these options was most efficient involving money?

443
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:07,080
My option one, why we had A's all across the board was having a standard payment rate for all medical bills.

444
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:13,630
It kind of eliminates that back and forth argument between the different groups.

445
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:17,830
So by setting a standard rate, it's very efficient. Everyone knows what they're going to pay up.

446
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:26,560
Some people could end up paying more than they would have otherwise, but it could be very effective and efficient for others.

447
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:36,250
Yeah, several groups brought up the fact that they thought that rates might be higher under option one, particularly a single person option,

448
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:42,430
which I thought could be really interesting if maybe providers would like that most might be initially.

449
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:47,530
What that is. This is a great question for the whole class.

450
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:54,340
What do we actually get in the legislation? What was the final point that legislators in Congress settled on?

451
01:09:54,390 --> 01:10:00,730
Was it closer to the first option on the second one? I think yeah, it it's closer to the second one.

452
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:08,090
Why is that? Why do you think that we ended up with something that looks a lot more like the second one with this.

453
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:16,910
I want to call on this group over here because you just answered my second question to you.

454
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:23,980
What was your answer? I mean, money and well-being and like you said, money at the exact same time that you said.

455
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:34,329
I'm just asking you to think politically here in the context of what actions were actually likely to see anything like this.

456
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:40,130
Actually, you saying, well, from the insurance perspective, tell me why you created this best option with your insurance.

457
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:47,980
So option one wearing black, even that is a religion.

458
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:53,470
So the East Coast of the US, we have learned something in the Harry Reid schools.

459
01:10:54,160 --> 01:11:01,930
So many of the options actually look like choice perspective which is there being less of these on the

460
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:08,589
median read was is an option do you have to walk through it because sometimes you don't get any discounts.

461
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:11,150
Sometimes you can get like 5% discount.

462
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:18,090
Most of the things that I would be that would be more of a disservice versus when you can take a look at my big time.

463
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:26,290
So that's how I, you know, just perspective, wisdom and being an observation within your community and and really those we

464
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:31,029
have done this is we do we like looking at this and we got indication that

465
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:35,349
when the patient gets involved in a lot of stress factors with them because

466
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:38,620
then they have to start negotiating and then they negotiate with the provider.

467
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:46,420
The negativity is 100 bucks for this. And so yeah, I think that's the insurance part of this option one that's better,

468
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:54,280
but I fear it's not because I was just explaining to them if they charge a hundred bucks,

469
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:59,800
this number is on a contracted rate, but the same service and possibly be the same region would be hundred and 50 bucks.

470
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,170
So you can't be 130 as a standard median read saying, you know,

471
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:10,960
this is the median age because who I was expecting one who is going to get two less so I was they're not happy with it.

472
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:19,810
That's something you're thinking about across just those who might have some serious concerns, right?

473
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,489
Yeah. So someone who would need help and I know.

474
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:35,620
And so maybe the 55 I think the interesting talk to me is what the costs that you

475
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:39,660
said you can externalize the costs onto the patient if this doesn't work right.

476
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:42,180
How does arbitration then work if you can't do that?

477
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:50,980
Because the very pieces that kind of ties in some other things that I saw being discussed with different groups.

478
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:58,209
How likely do you think the actors are to comply with the law in scenario one or two?

479
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:01,380
Which scenario did you didn't have you discussed this like.

480
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:09,300
All right. You've passed a law. You now have to monitor all of these actors to see all they can find.

481
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,370
And it how easy is it to do that? I thought it was kind of an interesting question.

482
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:21,020
All right. Who wants to also offer their decision on which option they picked more?

483
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:32,960
Thank you. Okay.

484
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:42,000
So perhaps stronger by asking too much about patients and after that is okay to ask them in fact option one.

485
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:50,700
But with the caveat that hospitals would be required to have a process of identifying when patients are going to be charged with these surprise bills.

486
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,679
As a personal anecdote, I had to get service out of state at one point,

487
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:05,729
and I got a bill like thousands and thousands of dollars before any of the life insurance of a hospital like negotiation or whatever happened.

488
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:10,080
And so had I not known any better, I might have bitten, I might have just paid this bill.

489
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,360
And so I'm thinking about option one.

490
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:18,730
I wanted to make sure that this process was happening before patients ever received some sort of bill in the mail.

491
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:23,910
And remember when we chose this because we thought that it was more of both more effort,

492
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:29,730
more ethical language, and more effective on all three counts from a patient, from the patients.

493
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:30,660
But that's okay.

494
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:38,729
Let's bring in your professional expertize, apparently, and especially like I had questions too about we talk about these options fairly generally,

495
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:43,260
but the rabbit holes are pretty deep on the detail of how they would be implemented.

496
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:50,100
And I had questions like, well, hang on a minute. What happens if you do recognize that you were surprised?

497
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,150
Bill, it was not in compliance with the law.

498
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,229
It's like maybe you have a right to legal redress, but how do you get redress?

499
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:01,590
How do you figure it out? Right. It doesn't necessarily empower patients in that.

500
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,680
Right. A lot would depend on the details of how this gets implemented and what the requirements are.

501
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:14,280
So yeah, so I was just going to say and it was like a complete nightmare to try and get it right.

502
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,969
Well, can I ask how many people in this room have been surprised?

503
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:25,830
You know, okay, we got a roomful of people taking a master's level class in health policy.

504
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:33,710
How much do you think it is for folks? That might be a bit less than you do about the health system to try the justice.

505
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,900
Right. So that's a lot more careful from.

506
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:43,350
Thank you for it's not me. I'm going to call one more group. So what for people to tell me about?

507
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:54,370
Well, actually, 22 minutes fast. I'm not going to do that. Then I have to say something to you.

508
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:06,480
So he and I had a surprise guest on Thursday that I was trying to show up in person, if you can, because the beginning of the segment.

509
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:12,830
Yeah, later we have him for half an hour. So I want to share that with you.

510
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:19,080
I made her announcement. If you didn't see it, it's not really big questions.

511
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,140
I think we have what we might want to thank for about 5 minutes.

512
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:36,479
So I'm going to go to you and I love it.

513
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:56,040
So I think it's better to oh, great to be here, but I don't really know what's going time.

514
01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:21,540
But not I didn't hear the sound so that's not a problem that I might be on the market is not any.

515
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:22,930
Yeah.

516
01:17:24,060 --> 01:18:24,410
Yeah I think it's gonna be well I think she's going to have to pay know I don't hear a lot like I got time so it's okay you take care of myself like,

517
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:39,880
you know. Yeah, I think so, yeah.

518
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:52,360
Oh so that was quite close at that time.

519
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:58,900
Yeah. It's not like not only it was not I'm not sorry.

520
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:14,170
I was, I felt that you what I would say I was always, always laughing.

521
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:20,970
So it was actually quite natural, particularly for me.

522
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:26,650
Like it was brilliant. Like you had to work like that.

523
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:34,370
And I'm like, Oh my God.

524
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:45,230
I just seems like I got my body on the ground and I woke up.

525
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:54,160
I did not want to, like, calibrate.

526
01:19:54,190 --> 01:20:01,240
I'm like, I don't have anything.

527
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:40,580
So don't that people are going to be like, Oh, I think that's 100% to what they went through Thursday almost every year.

528
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,850
I'm thinking of it. Yeah, exactly.

529
01:20:46,470 --> 01:21:00,760
I don't know. I felt like I needed to keep going to them.

530
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:19,770
So, like I did. Like how? Like everything is fine as long as it's not like, oh, wait, I'm just doing none of this.

531
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:42,650
So it is nothing like supporting it now that it was already so it was more like I like the focus works.

532
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:59,470
I on their set because yeah I think they're doing okay you're on the right track down this road.

533
01:21:59,710 --> 01:22:05,020
I'm always thinking about your computer screen.

534
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:13,470
Five smart people, more than $300.

535
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,640
So it's not just.

536
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:20,400
Yeah, I see. If they're out there. Okay.

537
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:31,470
They are very friendly. Well, did you see your career health services?

538
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:39,780
You're like, everyone's going to look at our age and we're all looking out for each other.

539
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:51,770
I just love you. I think you have to wonder if I get kicked out and say, Oh, you have no idea what that is.

540
01:22:51,850 --> 01:23:02,650
I'm not just like this one time and you know, you're asking for a nonprofit.

541
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:22,260
So do people look like. But I was totally heart and soul mate about surviving and not that.

542
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:29,100
Yeah, I was. I was totally.

543
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:58,230
Sinead O'Connor says something about the quality anxiety and I can't find any excuses.

544
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:09,150
I like the fact that something was interesting because I like how they write.

545
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:16,130
Yes, but you know.

547
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:36,000
Okay. So then I'm also thinking about the stakeholders tracks of different characters.

They make the mistake feedback.

549
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:51,230
Just like what? I just like the individuals are saying.

01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:56,150
But that's interesting. What about such a thing as aspect?
