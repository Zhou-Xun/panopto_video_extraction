1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,990
After watching this video,

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,420
you will be able to
use PROC LIFETEST to

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,690
run Kaplan-Meier curves
and a log-rank test.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,790
For this analysis, we're going to

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,500
use some modified dataset from

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,240
the Hosmer and Lemeshow book and

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,594
from the Stat Consulting
Group at UCLA.

8
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,590
Basically, we're going to model

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,140
time until return to drug use for

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,460
patients enrolled in

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,710
two different residential
treatment programs

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,690
that differ in length.

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,420
Note that this is not a
clinical trial because

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,655
patients are not randomized
to the programs,

15
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,260
but they choose whatever program

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,635
they want to participate.

17
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:43,835
Therefore, this is an
observational study,

18
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,230
a cohort study of people

19
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,180
participating in two
different treatments.

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,085
Treatment zero is a short program

21
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:51,415
and treatment one
is a long program.

22
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:55,115
Remember that the event
is return to drug use,

23
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:56,510
but what we're modeling is

24
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,990
the time to return to drug use.

25
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,830
The exposure is the
treatment program variable,

26
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,120
short versus long,

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,850
and the hypothesis is that

28
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,875
participants in the long program

29
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,540
will take longer to return to

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,095
drug use than participants
in the short program.

31
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:12,590
After all, giving up

32
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,915
drugs is a matter
of changing habits,

33
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:18,520
and we know that changing
habits may take a long time.

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,115
Let's look at the first
observations as we always do,

35
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,430
to get a sense of the
type of data we have.

36
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,990
From left to right, we have
the ID variable as usual,

37
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,425
we have age at enrollment,

38
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,929
we have the number of
previous drug treatments,

39
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,535
and we have the
treatment variable.

40
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:35,750
This is our main exposure,

41
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,335
remember, zero is
short, one is long.

42
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:40,575
Then we have site
for the treatment,

43
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:43,245
and although the first 10
observations only shows zeros,

44
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:44,340
we do have two sites.

45
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,050
Site a is zero and site b is one.

46
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,570
Now we have the two variables
that define our outcome.

47
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,790
On one hand, we have
the time variable,

48
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,455
that's the time in the study,

49
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,510
and on the other,
we have the event

50
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,405
variable that here it
was called censor.

51
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:01,730
This variable is
one if the patient

52
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,780
returned to drug use
and zero otherwise.

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,440
The observations
otherwise that is

54
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,935
zero are the censor observations,

55
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:12,125
either because they
were lost to follow up

56
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,450
and never had the event
while following up,

57
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,370
or likely because
the study finish

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,925
and they never had
the event either.

59
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:21,410
Finally, we have one
more covariant that is

60
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,945
heroin or cocaine use
in the past month,

61
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,130
coded as 1, 2,

62
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,850
3 because it's one or
the other or both.

63
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,130
The first thing
we're going to do in

64
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,635
survival bivariate
analysis is learning

65
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:35,950
about Kaplan-Meier
curves although

66
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,905
we already saw them in
the previous videos.

67
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,775
Kaplan-Meier curves are useful
for categorical variables,

68
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,160
two or more categories
because they

69
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,980
will plot the survival
function of each category.

70
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,380
The PROC that help us to get

71
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,385
Kaplan-Meier curves
is PROC LIFETEST.

72
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:53,275
Going back to the sample,

73
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,525
we want to test if return to
drug use, measured in days,

74
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:59,275
is different by the length
of the treatment program;

75
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:02,055
zero short, one long, remember.

76
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:03,920
Our hypothesis is that it will

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,170
take longer to return
to drug use for

78
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,090
people exposed to
the long treatment

79
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,110
compared to people exposed
to the short treatment.

80
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,710
PROC LIFETEST in its most
simple form has two estimates.

81
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,585
One, the time statement,

82
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,370
where you will
specify your outcome,

83
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,280
and remember that for
survival analysis you

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,590
need to specify two variables.

85
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,110
The time variable, because
we are modeling time,

86
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,330
but also the censoring variable.

87
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,130
Note that it does not

88
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,170
matter if our censoring
variable it's

89
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,580
an event variable as you

90
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,040
specified the code for censoring.

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,545
The code for censoring
now that l set is zero,

92
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:42,325
and that's why you put
that into parenthesis.

93
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,600
In other data sets,
it could happen that

94
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,730
the codes is one or two
or your own estimate,

95
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,110
it does not matter,
but you have to

96
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,815
specify the censor observations.

97
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,860
Then you have the
strata statement

98
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,890
where you put your
categorical variable.

99
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,310
In this example, we will
use the main exposure,

100
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,539
the treatment variable
that has two categories.

101
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,940
PROC LIFETEST will estimate

102
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,490
the survival functions
of each category.

103
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,170
Note that we can use this code

104
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,955
for any categorical variable,

105
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,565
and it can have more
than two categories.

106
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:14,690
The output of PROC LIFETEST
is super long because it

107
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,550
calculates the
survival and failure

108
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,265
probabilities of each
observation over time.

109
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:21,890
It will first do it for
the first category,

110
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,740
in this case, treatment zero,
or the short treatment.

111
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,155
Then it will do it for
the second category,

112
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:29,150
treatment one, or
the long treatment.

113
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,150
You can ignore all this
output in the future,

114
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,650
but I just want to
make sure that you

115
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,490
understand how this
is calculated,

116
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,145
which is actually not a big deal,

117
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,040
since those are
probabilities of surviving,

118
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,355
provided that you survive
until the time before that,

119
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:46,290
that is these are
conditional probabilities.

120
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,480
Note that at time 3:00,

121
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,165
you have two people who
returned to drug use,

122
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:55,245
so 318 remain still
free of drugs.

123
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,410
Note also that clearly
the probability

124
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,575
of failure and survival
are complimentary,

125
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,000
so once you calculate one,

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,180
the other is just
one minus the other.

127
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,170
Let's see with another
example in the next slide

128
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,405
how SAS calculate the
survival probabilities.

129
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:11,870
If you have 100 people at

130
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,865
risk at the beginning
of year one,

131
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,519
and five died and 95 survived,

132
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,680
the probability to
survive up to year

133
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,145
one is 95 over 100, that is 0.95.

134
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:25,710
The first one is easy. Now,
let's look at the second one.

135
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,300
You have 92 people at risk
because not only five died,

136
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,690
but you also lost three
people to follow up.

137
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,005
Those three are
considered censor.

138
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,710
So now your probability
denominator people at risk

139
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,635
is 92 and 10 died that year.

140
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:42,080
Now the probability of
surviving after year

141
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,515
two is the product of
two probabilities.

142
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:47,600
First, you have to survive year

143
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,910
one and that's 95 over a 100,

144
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,070
and then you have to
survive year two,

145
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,950
and that's 82 over 92 and so on.

146
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,770
You can see that every
probability needs to be

147
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,050
calculated condition on
surviving up to that year.

148
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,190
In our example in cells,

149
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,900
we can see that the
first one is easy,

150
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,740
you have 318 people who
survived up to time

151
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,610
3:00 over 320 who were
originally at risk,

152
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,460
and then the other
probabilities would be

153
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,715
the product of the previous
ones by the one at that time.

154
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:19,475
Note that I only told
you this so you can see

155
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,035
that it's not a big deal

156
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,760
how those probabilities
are calculated,

157
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,900
but, of course, you don't

158
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,505
have to calculate them manually,

159
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:27,640
that's what SAS is doing for you.

160
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,170
If you keep going to the
bottom of the table,

161
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,670
you will see that
towards the end,

162
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,935
just are having many
censor observations,

163
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,960
which in this case are
lost to follow up.

164
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,730
SAS marks those censor
observation with an asterisk.

165
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,110
Now at the end of
that long output,

166
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,560
you will finally see

167
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,590
the two survival
functions in a nice plot.

168
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,910
In this case, the blue curve

169
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,530
represents the survival function

170
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,880
of the short treatment and

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,895
the red curve the long treatment.

172
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:58,030
To better interpret these
two curves in our sample,

173
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,590
think as if your
participants were surviving

174
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,455
drugs and relapse is like dying.

175
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:04,820
That way you can see that

176
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,680
your hypothesis was true since it

177
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,145
takes longer for people in
the long program to relapse.

178
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,930
Now these are very nice curves,

179
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,060
but you don't have a way to say

180
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,260
those differences that you

181
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,150
see are statistically
significant.

182
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,690
That is, how much are the
curves actually overlapping.

183
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,260
For that, we have a test
also in the output.

184
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,410
This test is the log-rank test,

185
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,700
and it's basically testing

186
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,740
the null hypothesis that there is

187
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,720
no difference between
the groups in

188
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,615
the probability of an
event at any point.

189
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,830
Basically, what you're
trying to reject is

190
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,159
that the two curves
are overlapping.

191
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,380
Note that a usual
SAS will give you

192
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,595
more than one test and that
test of equality over strata.

193
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,980
Not that there is anything
wrong with the other two,

194
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,820
but for the purposes
of this class,

195
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,560
we will use the log-rank test.

196
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,400
Since in our sample we'll
get a p-value of 0.0091,

197
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,890
we can reject the
null hypothesis that

198
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,730
there are no differences in
survival between groups.

199
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,955
In summary, in this video,

200
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,640
we used PROC LIFETEST to run

201
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,710
Kaplan-Meier curves
and a log-rank test.

202
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,315
In the next video, we will use

203
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:12,224
PROC PHREG to run our
first Cox models.
