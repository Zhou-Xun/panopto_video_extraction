1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,320
Can you imagine waking up every day to the smell of mold or rotting garbage,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,840
or wondering if the air quality would be so bad today that you'll have to administer your child's inhaler?

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,250
And can you imagine having no control over whether or not these things happen?

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,350
My name is Lyric Kleber, and I'm here today to talk about a community on the north side of Kalamazoo, Michigan.

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:30,110
Zip code four nine zero zero seven is home to the graphic packaging paper mill, a factory that produces recycled paper for.

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:36,560
That zip code is also where a significant proportion of Kalamazoo's black residents live, work and play.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,420
Twenty twenty one, one year into heavy quarantines due to the COVID 19 pandemic,

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:50,720
Northside residents began complaining to reporters and city officials about unbearable smells seeping into homes and noticeably poor air quality.

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,110
Well, it turned out that the graphic packaging paper mill had been emitting large amounts of hydrogen sulfide for years.

10
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:03,960
The smell wasn't necessarily new to residents, but the isolation in their homes and neighborhoods had greatly increased their exposure.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,280
Hydrogen sulfide isn't harmful in small amounts under 10 parts per million.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,750
However, with chronic exposure and higher density up to 70 parts per million,

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,920
this chemical can cause eye irritation, dizziness and respiratory distress.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,260
Further investigation found that the paper mill had been cited eight times in the past decade for older violations.

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:30,490
The mill claimed that it had resolved each of these citations, stating that they were not at fault for all of the complaints,

16
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,720
but the evidence seems to suggest that there's been an impact on the health of Northside residents.

17
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,200
Zip code four nine zero zero seven was found to consistently suffer the worst

18
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,430
air quality out of all of the Kalamazoo zip codes by a substantial margin.

19
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,850
Asthma hospitalization rates in four nine zero zero seven are five times higher than in neighboring zip codes.

20
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,870
Life expectancy in this area is lower than anywhere else in the city. The north side is a red line district of Kalamazoo,

21
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,310
purposefully segregated decades ago with the knowledge that factories producing harmful

22
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,070
pollutants were impacting the quality of life of primarily black and immigrant residents.

23
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,910
So what can we do knowing about the problem is the first step.

24
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,990
Now we need to advocate for these communities to be listened to and protected. In 2020,

25
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,160
the Kalamazoo City Commission passed a tax incentive that allowed graphic packaging to

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,020
expand their plant under the condition that they found ways to get the odor under control.

27
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,750
Company says that they're making progress on the new bio filter that will reduce the odor and trap pollutants,

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,620
and they need to be held accountable to these promises.

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,540
The factory cannot be allowed to expand if they do not follow through on controlling these emissions,

30
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,140
environmental racism is a real thing and it's happening all around us.

31
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,480
We need to continue to listen to these communities and enforce policies that protect their quality of life.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,005
Thanks for listening.
