1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,383
Now, this was published in 2006 in the fall of 2006.

2
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:09,902
And it coincided with one of our big heart meetings, the American Heart Association.

3
00:00:09,902 --> 00:00:12,149
It was published in a really prominent place,

4
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:13,997
the New England Journal of Medicine.

5
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:16,198
For clinicians, this is the Holy Land,

6
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:19,193
I mean this is the place where you wanna send your work.

7
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:23,562
It has the broadest appeal and most widespread readership.

8
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:27,679
So we published this, but I think that one of the great things about both vaccine

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,796
Harlan was their insight and just saying, what, we're gonna publish this and

10
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:35,506
the only thing that's gonna happen is, our friends are gonna read it.

11
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,267
And we're just gonna move on and do the same old single.

12
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:42,345
And what they did was they said, well to be different with this, we're gonna

13
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:45,886
use this momentum this interest to to kind of push things forward.

14
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:49,076
And we're gonna create a quality improvement collab and

15
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:51,078
they call this adorable alliance.

16
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:54,606
They've got buy in from a number of different organisations.

17
00:00:54,606 --> 00:00:58,391
It was led by the American College of Cardiology, but there were,

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,795
a couple of dozen organisations at the end of the day and helped sponsor this.

19
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:05,390
It was really a large QI Initiative.

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,355
And the whole focus was very narrow.

21
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:11,069
He said, we're gonna improve the timely delivery of Primary PCI.

22
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:14,065
Again, that angioplasty to read heart attacks.

23
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:17,783
And we're gonna focus on really the use of these evidence based strategies.

24
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:22,909
How can we get this community hospitals to start, using these and measuring it.

25
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:27,522
And the overall goal was to say, what we wanna have 75% or

26
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:32,335
more of patients get that adorable time within 90 minutes.

27
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:33,281
That was the goal.

28
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:36,317
And what I like about this is, I think that there's a couple of things.

29
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:41,399
One is that, at the end of the day it's a very focused and simple goal.

30
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,572
Sometimes we get, windy and worry about like all the things we wanna accomplish.

31
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:50,603
I mean this wasn't trying to, save starving children, it was trying to

32
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:55,721
bring 75% or more patient with adorable in time or less than 90 mins.

33
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:59,322
So, over a series of a couple of years,

34
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:03,252
there was a time line it was very specific,

35
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:09,055
it was implemented and really just a really wonderful manner.

36
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:13,753
It ended up including almost practically every hospital that performs

37
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:16,188
the angioplasty PCI, it come true.

38
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:21,190
And what they did was wonderful about this was they made it one of these things

39
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,371
where if you didn't do it, people would look at you and you have to wonder why.

40
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,079
And that was a really important lesson as well to,

41
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,572
the community aspect of this initiative was really important.

42
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:38,613
So they get over 1000 hospitals, they put together this tool kit.

43
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:41,868
They have this community set up.

44
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:46,324
They actually have, recurring meetings, they highlight and

45
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:50,369
promote this work at the national cardiology meetings.

46
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,162
And it becomes a big deal.

47
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:53,950
And I think because of that,

48
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,656
we saw D2B to times really improve over a relatively short period of time.

49
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:02,553
We could look from 2005 up to 2010 in this craft.

50
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:07,519
It went from, below 40s up to the point in time where we're starting

51
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,721
to approach 90 of patients.

52
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:13,909
We're having horrible times in less than that.

53
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,462
All right, so that's great, right?

54
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:19,111
Everyone goes home, we all pat ourselves on the back and it's a happy ending.

55
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:23,515
And this is the side of the storey that's actually become more interesting to me

56
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:24,592
over time as well.

57
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,893
It's not gonna happen, right?

58
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:29,597
And this is the real world and life has to go on.

59
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:32,814
So, I think one of the things that I can kind of highlight here,

60
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:35,267
is what happens to these initiatives, right?

61
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:38,332
I mean, that's almost as interesting a storey at the beginning.

62
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:43,828
I will tell you that D2B time, even though, I've been very involved with it,

63
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:48,770
is a metric that I appreciate can be easily gained and misused, right?

64
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,280
So I'm an interventional cardiologist.

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,564
I get my own reports of, why did this case happened this way,

66
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:57,508
why didn't you happened in another way?

67
00:03:57,508 --> 00:04:02,145
And certainly, when it comes to gaming, like any performance measures,

68
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,026
there's always gonna be these outs, right?

69
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:09,552
These exclusion criteria and how different hospitals and healthcare systems thought

70
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:13,711
to use this, became a real controversial issue within the community, right?

71
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,855
Is your door to balloon time?

72
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:19,186
Great, because you just basically threw out all the bad ones or

73
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:23,854
is it really a measure of kind of improvement that your facilities?

74
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:28,005
Another issue is that very quickly, as I mentioned to you,

75
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:31,086
we've reached almost 90% by 2010.

76
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:36,505
And I can tell you right now, when we look at the publicly reported measure,

77
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:40,666
we're starting to get to that 95, 96 percent range.

78
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:44,662
Where suddenly, somebody's like, well, if the fourth quartile in

79
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:48,795
this distribution is like 90 minutes or 90% within 90 minutes and

80
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:52,944
the top quartile is 95%, have we really topped out the measurement?

81
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:57,163
I mean, this is a much different storey nowadays than it was a decade ago, right?

82
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,925
Where the variability was greater than that distribution was larger.

83
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,605
This is a really important concept that has come across for

84
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,697
a number of different, performance measures.

85
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:10,371
Another thing is, is the measure even complete and

86
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:13,181
this has been controversial within the cardiology.

87
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:17,783
I showed you in the beginning, patient has symptoms goes through this

88
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:22,001
entire process and then gets, the angioplasty at the very end.

89
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:26,223
And I focused on the very tail end but, sometimes cardiologists get

90
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:30,371
very frustrated especially if this is a measure on us when we're,

91
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,201
the patient stayed at home for 12, right?

92
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:36,745
And then they showed up and I'm supposed to, get up in the middle of the night,

93
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:38,048
rush over there and do this.

94
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,297
It's, what's that?

95
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:44,925
It does, really emphasise issues around, how a lot of these

96
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:49,938
measures the question of attribution and the complete measure.

97
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:54,454
And what we're trying to really focus on and and achieve as a goal,

98
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,530
becomes a core issue as we think about these.

99
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,854
Another issue is and this is really important stifling innovation, right?

100
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:04,079
When you start to measure something,

101
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,373
suddenly that becomes the preeminent part of whatever, they're trying to accomplish.

102
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:13,874
And some people would argue that, maybe there are some newer techniques or

103
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,661
tools that could actually improve the patient's mortality,

104
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:20,891
even if you sacrifice a little bit of time on the side.

105
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,355
But if all you're measuring is time,

106
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:27,518
if you're gonna be less likely to try some of those innovative.

107
00:06:27,518 --> 00:06:31,551
And this has become a very important consideration for us because I'm in

108
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:35,136
a speciality where innovation is kind of it's, part of its DNA.

109
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:38,711
I mean, there's constantly new devices and

110
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:43,044
drugs that are being tried in these types of patients.

111
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:46,537
When I say, these I usually kind of say, these are important and

112
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:49,010
they're really critical considerations.

113
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,783
But also kind of grouped them and not to be pejorative but

114
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:54,087
they're kind of the usual suspects, right?

115
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:57,930
You can't take a performance measure that's out there,

116
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,077
that we couldn't criticise for a lot of right?

117
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:06,312
And I do think that while they're real, I think that there are definitely

118
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:10,543
ways of and if you just you gonna imagine for those factors.

119
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:13,365
One of the issues, the stifling innovation, well,

120
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:15,132
that's an easy option, right?

121
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:18,995
So if you're gonna start doing the radial artery capitalism, which takes a little

122
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:22,545
bit longer but might have some more benefits rather than going through the.

123
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:26,904
What, maybe you make your door to balloon time, one 100 minutes as a whole.

124
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,118
And there are ways around those.

125
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:30,650
So those are, what I call the usual suspects.
