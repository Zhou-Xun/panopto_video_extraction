1
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,299
The just an anti-racist public health looks like a public health that really takes

2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:39,440
seriously the deeply embedded issues of structural racism and other forms of oppression,

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,680
not only in this country, but around the world.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,420
There's a critical kind of evaluation of how those racism really shapes health and shapes health inequities,

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,500
and then thinks about what is the role of public health in helping to dismantle,

6
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:13,580
disrupt those systems and structures, policies even that have such that create such harm for black communities and other communities of color.

7
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:25,220
And so public because as public health researchers and scholars and practitioners, we we have as our main mission, the people's health.

8
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:34,429
Right. And so our work should be advancing justice and advancing equity through the work that we do,

9
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,850
through our scholarship, through our research, and through our actions.

10
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:46,910
When we think about this country and other racialized societies, racism is really our original sin.

11
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:56,930
You don't understand the conditions that shape health in the present day without understanding the historical legacy of colonialism,

12
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:06,530
the extraction of Africans from the continent of Africa into centuries and generations of forced free labor,

13
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,830
the expulsion of indigenous peoples and the violent genocide of indigenous peoples at the very onset of the origins of this country.

14
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,319
Those are really the two fundamental pillars that are part of the origin story of this

15
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:29,209
country and those that origin story has continued to shapeshift right, find its way,

16
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:37,430
embed itself within the policies and the practices and the systems and the structures of our country, all of which really shape health.

17
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:46,249
Right. And so a fundamental understanding of of health and particularly racial health inequities for black,

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,180
Latinx, indigenous, and other marginalized racial groups

19
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,730
Has to deal very seriously and very critically with that history and with that legacy,

20
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,540
understand the harms that have been created so that we understand best how to undo those harms.

21
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,089
So all communities, all communities are able to be healthy and thriving.

22
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:20,780
So it is really fundamental to understand racism is fundamental to understanding these inequities and its and understanding how it has operated.

23
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:31,520
As Dr. Camara Jones says, to one disadvantage, certain individuals and communities advantage other individuals and communities.

24
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,680
And then the last thing that I think we don't pay enough attention to that I really like that Dr. Jones

25
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,710
talks about is how it saps the strength of the entire society through the waste of human resources.

26
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,340
So I think another thing that I would add to that is that we study racism not because it's just bad for certain groups,

27
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,819
it's actually bad for all of us, and it's doing harm to all of us.

28
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,260
And if we don't unpack that,

29
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:06,330
then we'll continue to have the inequities that we we see exist and just overall the poorer health that this country has in relation to other others,

30
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,670
other, you know, other societies.

31
00:04:09,671 --> 00:07:17,210
The definition of equity that former president of the American Public Health Association, Camara Phyllis Jones,

32
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:28,390
authored, defines equity as assurance of the conditions for optimal health for all people.

33
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:39,400
And Dr. Jones goes on to say that we cannot achieve equity if we do not recognize and rectify historical injustices.

34
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:49,660
So one reason why it's important to consider racism a part of public health work for me is that historically,

35
00:04:50,780 --> 00:05:04,080
public health has played a role in advancing racist narratives about populations and in legitimating racism for our broader society.

36
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:12,209
I believe there are at least three reasons why it's important to consider racism a public health issue,

37
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:21,540
and to think about it in the context of teaching, teaching public health and developing the next generation of public health professionals.

38
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:34,520
One is that as we think about equity and the need to recognize and rectify historical injustices.

39
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:43,940
The field of public health has itself played a role in creating some of these racism-related historical injustices.

40
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,380
For instance, public health played a big role

41
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:58,030
in the process of excluding some groups from even being able to immigrate into the United States.

42
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,350
And that exclusion was based on racializing groups.

43
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:11,739
So the field of public health helped the nation exclude populations by seeing some

44
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,910
groups and assigning some groups as more diseased populations versus less diseased.

45
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:25,750
And those those were very racialized. The field of public health, along with medicine and other sciences,

46
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:33,910
has also played a role in advancing racist understandings about difference tied to race and ethnicity.

47
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:42,549
So for these historical reasons, for these kinds of historical reasons, it's important that we, as a field,

48
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:51,070
rectify the ways in which we as a field have contributed to racism historically and in ongoing ways.

49
00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:02,620
A second reason why we must deal with racism as a public health issue is because the communities and the populations we serve experience racism.

50
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,400
And if we are to promote their optimal health, then we also have to deal with racism.

51
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:17,210
But I think that for the most part, you know, racism is embedded in everything that happens in the United States.

52
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:25,130
And so if we're going to do research, for example, on like air pollution and health and we're not going to talk about racism,

53
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,060
then we're not really talking about air pollution and health.

54
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:34,040
There's no possible way that you can do it, because we've seen the research, we've documented the inequalities that are based on things like segregation.

55
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,370
Right.

56
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:42,860
And so if we are trying to imagine an anti-racist public health future, we can't disentangle that from like addressing the racist public health past,

57
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,100
the racist past, and then structure of the policies that have influenced health opportunities across life courses.

58
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,629
Right. I think that's you know,

59
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,940
that's partly why we're at where we're at in terms of public health and not having anti-racist public health because we have been afraid to

60
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:03,500
explicitly name and center structural racism and intersecting forms of oppression as a fundamental aspect of what shapes health.

61
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:10,450
The funding, the targeted initiatives and all of these things that we've poured into our racialized health disparities,

62
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:16,450
they've only worsened and those gaps have only widened. And so at this point, we must ask ourselves, what are we missing here?

63
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:23,350
What - are we just still skimming the surface? How do we swim beyond that and get curious and ask about the whys and the hows?

64
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,530
I think we must connect the dots back to our root causes,

65
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:34,560
which means we have to go back to history and see how our historic timeline has contributed to the data and outcomes we see today.

66
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,760
And if we can't adequately address racial inequities that exist across all systems: education,

67
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,400
housing, employment and all of those things which in turn impact our health.

68
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,590
If we're not looking at that with an analysis complete with history that includes our social constructions, right.

69
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,860
Which were created and we uphold, we're missing so much to the story.

70
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,160
And so I think the time is now to to understand, like, hey, we're getting worse with these things.

71
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,410
COVID has shown us and highlighted these disparities that have been going on in communities for a long time.

72
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:11,680
What is wrong with our environment and our conditions where some people are thriving and others are are suffering and we're losing lives around it?

73
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,020
Since multiple declarations of racism as a public health crisis and threat have continued to

74
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,239
emerge across our country and jurisdictions and organizations and government entities since 2021.

75
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,600
I know there's over 200 at this point, and now we must be accountable as a discipline to address them or else

76
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,440
what does it say about us and our ethics?

77
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,889
I feel like it would be totally unethical and irresponsible of us not to prepare our workforce with the realities

78
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,750
of our racialization and socialization and how that influences the ways in which we work on every level,

79
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,200
from personal to interpersonal to institutional and even cultural.

80
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:52,030
Our mental, physical and emotional health is impacted by racism and other forms of oppression that uphold racism in very multilayered and complex,

81
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,570
sometimes very covert and less obvious ways.

82
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:03,010
It impacts public health, education and training in the same ways that it infiltrates every discipline invisibly, pretty much.

83
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,910
I often think about Jim Crow segregation signs. They may have come down and people say, Oh, well, history happened and it's over.

84
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:18,930
But that racial order and arrangement, if we pay attention and we really are honest about our data and even what caused it, especially in the U.S.,

85
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:26,919
so not even in a global context, this racial ordering arrangement has remained intact and it's very intelligently working as it was designed.

86
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,569
So we didn't design it or create it, but we've inherited it, so we didn't build this house,

87
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,390
but we have to take care of this house and maintain it.

88
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:46,110
How do I speak truth into these realities of of of oppression, of ongoing oppression, of ongoing impacts of settler colonialism?

89
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:56,790
The real truth that if our system of public health, the way we train our students, that workforce that we're building,

90
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:05,490
if we don't think about how public health is upholding systems of indigenous erasure and genocide,

91
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,900
then how are we ever really going to achieve equity?

92
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,470
How are we going to achieve the best conditions for all lives?

93
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:25,390
For me, part of the reason it's really important to address racism in public health is that if we don't, we are kind of missing the root cause.

94
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:32,890
We often talk about social determinants of health as the causes of the causes and the fundamental cause

95
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:43,420
from where I sit, oftentimes these social determinants of health are shaped and influenced, as I've already said, by racism.

96
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,560
And so if we don't talk about racism, then we're kind of missing the foundation of the problem.
