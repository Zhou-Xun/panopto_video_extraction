1
00:00:41,170 --> 00:01:07,210
I think. Your life.

2
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,500
Good morning. How were people's weekends?

3
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,890
Good. So. So we can.

4
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:57,680
I was with my my son took senior pictures last Thursday around campus and he noticed that there were parties kicking off.

5
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,080
I say, yeah, party party started on Thursday. This frat on State Street.

6
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:10,190
He was like, What? I was like, Yeah, in college. The party started on Thursday and he was like, I don't understand.

7
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,890
What about Friday? Like, people just avoid classes on Friday.

8
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
So I think his mind was blown. He was like, Oh.

9
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:28,340
Extra day. Yeah, I can choose my classes. So you might take that for granted, but.

10
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,300
My son was very excited that Thursday he could possibly not have classes on Fridays.

11
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,120
So welcome back.

12
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:48,980
We made it through describing the program and we've made it through for the most part, the logic of the assignment, how the people feel about that.

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,790
The logic models on. Yes. I had a question about with that wasn't my question that I was going to do.

14
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,190
Oh, well. Oh.

15
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay. Oh, that's probably the easy way.

16
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:22,990
It's something I can review, but I'm going to wait till Thursday for her because I can't remember what day I have, what time I have it closing.

17
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,630
Oh. So I might still be open. I can't remember if I have it closed at midnight.

18
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,760
It's due on is due on Thursday. This is the I don't memorize this stuff.

19
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,500
Okay. I'll talk about it. Maybe on Tuesday, bam, next Tuesday.

20
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm like, wait, I look at you, take you see my kids do the same thing.

21
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,800
I remember you tell me. You tell me it was you told me I had till Thursday and then they lie.

22
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,960
Now another question. So I have a question about the assignment.

23
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,470
Yes. The. Our.

24
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:13,290
Let's get to the other. The LIB review is similar programs.

25
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,820
If there is the case like and I won't dock you for this but say there's like a saying

26
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,390
we're doing trails or like some program that has like super duper evidence behind it.

27
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,470
It'd be in the future, I would say, can include that.

28
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,900
But really the focus for the review is anything that supports.

29
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,810
Supports or justifies the program as a structure.

30
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,010
It just so happens that some have a lot of research behind them.

31
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:59,300
You're welcome. Any other questions?

32
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,820
Right. So announcements, overview. Well, you know, they use, you know, the spiel.

33
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:14,800
This is what we're doing today. And so announcements have finally got around the reserving a room.

34
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:25,540
So now office hours will be from from myself at sp h one room 1625.

35
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,550
So I will stick around in general that answer a few questions.

36
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:38,830
But if people have longer conversations so that I can get out of the way of people who are usually coming in here to tell something.

37
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,780
I'll go over to 1625 and after answering a few questions.

38
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:57,370
And just a reminder that Hannah also has office hours, the GSI, she doesn't typically come to class just because of a conflict that we had already.

39
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:05,409
You know, discussed. But she holds office hours as well over the zone and those are on the calendar.

40
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,240
I think hers are on Thursday.

41
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:18,900
And then as for the quiz and announcement that it wouldn't be an ABC quiz if there wasn't something technologically wrong with it.

42
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,020
So in this case, there are a couple of questions that are matching questions that I did not delete the blank option.

43
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,910
If I try to change it right now, it's going to mess everything up.

44
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:41,450
So. My understanding is that you can work around it, but I will regrade it after the quiz closes.

45
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,390
Like you can. Do something. Yeah.

46
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,710
Watch. Match the blank to the blank. Thank you. And then I will.

47
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,640
I will fix it. So it will not affect your grade.

48
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,650
So my apologies. Like I said, I just assumed they would delete the blanks, but apparently it did not.

49
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,670
I have to do that manually. And that's it for announcements.

50
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,140
Making sure there's no questions before I go on. All right.

51
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:23,940
So today we're going to be talking about another step or going on to step three, which is focusing that evaluation.

52
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:33,020
So today we'll get into purpose, specifically the purpose statement that goes along with this section.

53
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,200
And we'll start off by just reviewing.

54
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:50,610
And I will actually, if I may not address the quiz question specifically, but I will throw in the discussion about short and long term outcomes.

55
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,350
So hopefully that will help address the quiz question.

56
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:07,140
So last week we talked about describing the program. On Thursday, we really focused our efforts on there is a change in logic models.

57
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,920
So I just want to give you another overview of a logic model,

58
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:20,340
which is an operational model of a program which differentiates it from a theory of change,

59
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,910
which is really about the conceptual framework for our program.

60
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:34,080
So components of a logic model, your inputs lash out or resources that are available activities,

61
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,940
what the program does with the inputs in alignment with its mission.

62
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,430
And then you have outputs.

63
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:52,020
These are products that link the activities with the to the outcomes of the program for the focal population or the focal audience.

64
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,790
One thing to remember, just to continually remind yourself, is that outputs are typically tangible.

65
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:07,360
They can be counted in some form or fashion, and then we have outcomes.

66
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,690
Outcomes are the measurable changes in program participants level of functioning.

67
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,020
Your short term outcomes in the framework that I present it to you, that is.

68
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,020
Short term outcomes.

69
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:34,480
Are your immediate changes in knowledge or attitudes, your midterm outcomes, changes in behavior, and then your long term outcomes.

70
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,690
Changes in condition. So I learn something.

71
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,180
I do something differently. I keep doing it. And then finally, impact.

72
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,000
Those are the fundamental intended or unintended change occurring over time.

73
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:55,510
So generally, if you are modeling impact, which you don't have to do for this class.

74
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:04,780
But if you're modeling impact, you're modeling something that is changing over time, typically in a given population.

75
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,520
So today we are going into step three, focusing the evaluation design.

76
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:26,069
So unlike describing the program where the focus is on what is the client telling me about the program or what can I learn about the program?

77
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,590
Doing a lit review as you did for this assignment?

78
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:41,310
Focusing on valuation design is the point in the evaluation where the technical knowledge of the evaluator starts to be applied.

79
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,960
So what we'll be talking about this week is, okay, how do we start to take.

80
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,129
And I know some of you have asked questions about like,

81
00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:00,120
if we have all these evaluation questions or we have all these learning interests, how do we start to narrow that down?

82
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:11,520
That's what happens in this step. So the goal of this step is really to identify the purpose and the scope of the evaluation.

83
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,830
This is where we're identifying how big is this project going to be.

84
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:27,010
Why is this stuff important? Well, for one, we can't do everything we want to do, but.

85
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:36,070
Technically it's important because it narrows the evaluation to what we can accomplish with the available resources.

86
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:50,350
So while I won't talk much about this aspect, budget plays a big part in narrowing scope or other resources you might have like staffing.

87
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,200
And then the step is also important because it helps identify priorities for the evaluation process.

88
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,820
Again, thinking about what we've talked about in terms of stakeholder analysis.

89
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,660
We've learned that, you know, while.

90
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:22,910
It would be great if we could consider what every potential stakeholder or investor party cares about and cover it in an evaluation.

91
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Realistically speaking, there are some whose interests that we have to prioritize.

92
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:44,150
You know, we have to prioritize our primary users because they're typically the ones who are commissioning evaluation or leading the evaluation.

93
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:57,890
In the case of an internal evaluator, we have to prioritize those whose interest is also accounted or accompanied by power.

94
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:06,650
But we can also kind of think about how can we challenge power dynamics and making sure that

95
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:15,950
we can account for priorities for those who may not have as much power in this situation.

96
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:26,300
So there's different ways that we really do go about prioritizing learning in an evaluation project and generally.

97
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,230
Generally it's about thinking about our primary users and thinking about.

98
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,000
Those who have the most interest in the valuation and most stake in it.

99
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,270
So when we talk about defining purpose, just like what I mean by purpose.

100
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:57,330
Purpose. Is really it should result in an evaluation that benefits participants or others

101
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,070
and serve to build the or serve to build the professional knowledge base.

102
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,560
So generally when we think about, okay, what's the purpose of an evaluation,

103
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:18,899
there's four general areas that you could kind of wrap into the this section one gaining insight.

104
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:28,980
So we are gaining insight into the program's processes, how the processes interact with context,

105
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:36,300
for example, or thinking gain insight into the outcomes of the evaluation.

106
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:47,940
Another general purpose is about changing practice blushing, which is another way of thinking about program improvement.

107
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,290
But it also counts for our practice.

108
00:14:53,410 --> 00:15:00,090
You know, for example, thinking about how do we as professionals implement this program?

109
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:11,549
Are we doing what is appropriate to best reach an audience or best connect and build rapport with an audience?

110
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:19,020
For example, we're also generally thinking about ways to assess the effects of our program,

111
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,510
and that's where we get into our outputs and outcomes and impact.

112
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,310
And then finally, that general purpose of affecting those who participate in the evaluation.

113
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,840
So through learning and program improvement,

114
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:49,320
how do we serve those who have participated as users but also as participants in the program and then by proxy, the evaluation?

115
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,500
There are some other general reasons for doing a valuation.

116
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,200
And to put a little bit more shape on those four that I just presented.

117
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,460
One, accountability. We have accountability to our stakeholders.

118
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:20,090
So our user, our evaluation users, our program participants, program implementers, for example, social justice.

119
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:25,280
Again, with that CRE lens, that culturally responsive and equitable lens,

120
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:33,440
we're thinking about ways that the program functions in an ecological context.

121
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,070
What's the impact that a program has on social change?

122
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,800
Is it advancing social justice or is it undermining that aim?

123
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:54,550
Other people when they're doing evaluation really come from the perspective of a program comparison.

124
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:05,680
So, for example, is one program versus another more appropriate or more effective in a given group?

125
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:17,520
Evaluation research, which applies not only to programs but also to evaluation process.

126
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,020
There's a huge world.

127
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,379
Wow. Okay. I'm I'm a little exaggerating.

128
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:35,130
It's not we're not that huge. But our profession our profession actually does do research into that.

129
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,790
The methods that we use, the perspectives that we use,

130
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:51,149
the lenses that we use that are obviously related to the program because we apply this work in program work,

131
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,630
but is really about how can we best do our work as an as evaluators.

132
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,830
So there is a dimension of doing evaluation that really is about, okay, let's test these methods.

133
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,310
That's probably where if I'm going to end up doing research, if I do research,

134
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:22,380
that's usually where I sit thinking about methods and how do we best do our work in an effective way, in a way that also advances social justice.

135
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,460
And then finally, program replication. How do we, you know?

136
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:40,209
Well, rather, there is a dimension or section of work and reasoning that's really about replication.

137
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:51,300
And how can we take program A that was implemented in Ann Arbor and what do we need to consider in order to implement it in Columbus, Ohio?

138
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:07,400
And when we're thinking about purpose. We also consider use as use is really a big part of evaluation standards.

139
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,250
Remember, our standards one of our standards is utility.

140
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,210
How usable is the work that we're doing?

141
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:27,010
So some potential uses of a valuation are shot aside before, you know, determining if a program is worth the cost in,

142
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:33,130
for example, an efficiency evaluation meeting, administrative requirements.

143
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:42,640
So what's required to the funder? In other words, assessing alternative approaches to addressing a health problem?

144
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,070
These are all examples of uses of an evaluation that would be fed into purpose.

145
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:05,320
And so ultimately the purpose this section should really reflect the basic goals and objectives of the evaluation.

146
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:16,890
And using goal. I'm actually I will I'm going to revise this, but I'm going to give you a definition.

147
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,300
A desire goal is a desire state of affairs that outlines the purpose.

148
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:32,420
Again, a goal, a desire, state of affairs that outlines the purpose.

149
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:41,710
In other words, you can think of it as your target and then your objectives with our indicators of the goal.

150
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:52,370
How do you know that you have met the goals? So some considerations that we make when we're thinking about narrowing purpose.

151
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:01,950
One information needs to stage three stakeholders and four equity.

152
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,490
So one consideration that we make when we're thinking about purpose is information needs.

153
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:23,880
So similarly. To similar to a process of identifying a research topic.

154
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:30,690
When you're thinking about identifying purpose for an evaluation study,

155
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:39,570
you're really taking what you know about the program to identify gaps in knowledge, just like you would again with a research topic.

156
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,680
And where do the that where does that information come from?

157
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:56,340
It comes from describing the program. So it's taking what you've learned in step two and applying it into step three or feeding it into step three.

158
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,650
So one, what do we know about the context of a given program?

159
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:08,180
What do we know about the stage of a program where what stage is that program in?

160
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:21,240
What do we know about the population specifically how issues that there are problems that the population is experiencing.

161
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,640
Assets that the population brings to the program.

162
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,140
And then we also think about what we we've learned through doing the logic model.

163
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:44,090
So what? What do we know about the connection between activities, outputs, outcomes, etc.?

164
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:50,120
So once we know what we know, the question is what don't we know?

165
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:58,000
And that don't know can be part of helping identify the purpose of an evaluation.

166
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:14,470
We also consider stage, you know, similar to when we're describing a program, we think about, okay, is this program in the planning stage?

167
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:22,180
Is it in the implementation stage or is it in this effect stage?

168
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:39,970
So if it's in the planning stage in its early in program development or it's in a in a state where it is changing or adjusting and being built,

169
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,720
you know, as it's moving some.

170
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:54,360
Potential some potential types of evaluation that you might engage in needs assessment and process evaluation.

171
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:06,360
And those types of evaluation, as I'll say in a minute, come with their there are associated rather with a general purpose.

172
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,290
If you're if you're working with a program that is currently being implemented,

173
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:24,870
process evaluation and outcome evaluation are appropriate types of evaluation to apply or to engage in.

174
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:33,450
And then finally, if you are working on an evaluation that of a program that's already been implemented,

175
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,310
it's, you know, and it's complete or near completion you'd consider outcome or efficiency evaluation.

176
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:49,780
As far as you can see, the stage of an evaluation is closely tied to type of evaluation.

177
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:58,790
I'm sorry, the stage of a program is closely tied to the type of evaluation or evaluations you would apply.

178
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:11,660
So types of evaluation generally have a, you know, associated purposes with them for process evaluation.

179
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,520
The general purpose is here to determine whether a program is being implemented

180
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,400
appropriately or the extent to which the program is being implemented as planned.

181
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:32,730
And what this purpose does is that it allows you to describe and assess your program's activities and link that to outcomes.

182
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:40,349
So one thing you can think about, especially when you're starting to craft evaluation questions,

183
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:47,310
is so what goals get you to this point of being able to describe and assess?

184
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:54,210
What questions can you ask that will help you describe and assess a program's activities?

185
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:06,360
Similarly, outcome evaluation has its own purpose associated with it in this case,

186
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:11,430
to determine the effect of the program in reaching its goals and objectives.

187
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,280
And again, think about, you know,

188
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:26,700
generally you would then ask questions or identify a goal that's going to help you ultimately document health and behavioral outcomes,

189
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:34,650
as well as identifying linkages between the intervention and its quantifiable effects.

190
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,810
Like I'm like I kind of slow it down, but you're about to get out early today.

191
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,420
So that is I can see there's not a lot to fill up, just this particular section, but we'll work through it.

192
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:03,580
Another consideration is stakeholders. You want to look to the learning interests of stakeholders.

193
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,830
You know, program participants, community organizations.

194
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,820
Researchers, government officials.

195
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:25,650
You know, as we reviewed in that week on stakeholder analysis, there's lots of potential stakeholders that would be engaged in an evaluation.

196
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:38,190
And so one question we want to ask, you know, they ask to identify a purpose is how do we think they will use evaluation results?

197
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,360
You know, as we learn, stakeholders are coming with different perspectives about what they want to learn.

198
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:54,790
Some want and and honestly, not just learn, but also come with different agendas.

199
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,520
Some stakeholders may want to learn or may want, you know,

200
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:10,630
want to see that a program's been successful so that they can continue to promote it or continue to support it.

201
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,210
You know, we don't let that sway, ah, our decision making as evaluators, but it's good to be aware of that type of agenda.

202
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:31,330
Similarly, we might have stakeholders that want to see flaws in the program or concerns with the program.

203
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:42,100
So, you know, regardless of what learning needs or agendas that stakeholders are bringing to the table,

204
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:48,280
we need to make space for people to be able to share their learning interests.

205
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,610
So some of the activities that I discussed.

206
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,790
In the stakeholder week.

207
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:07,090
So, for example, those interactive evaluation practices are helpful in being able to get those learning interests out on the table,

208
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,830
and then you use those to shape the evaluation purpose.

209
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:23,680
So as you can see, you're doing even before you kind of narrowed down the evaluation and you develop evaluation questions.

210
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:31,120
You're doing a lot of work prior to to be able to kind of focus the work that you're doing.

211
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:40,860
And sometimes it does go out of order. Sometimes you are doing this purpose before you're doing that, describing the program.

212
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:46,980
But ideally you're doing this step after you've described the program and done that work.

213
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:58,480
So here are some examples of ways that some of that different stakeholders might use evaluation results.

214
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,730
Maybe a funder wants to learn Is the program cost effective?

215
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:13,030
So they would no doubt use the evaluation to make decisions about whether to fund or continue funding a program.

216
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,850
So you have a community organization that is at your stakeholder table and they want

217
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:25,740
to learn what components of the program were participants satisfy satisfy it with.

218
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:35,670
And so in that case, what you're doing is guiding them in decisions about their own programs and where they are putting their efforts.

219
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:49,770
You might also have researchers at the table whose interest might be focused on

220
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:57,900
understanding if the program is causing improvements in the community's level of health.

221
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:08,340
And so in that case, one way that you might embed use is to think about how to identify conditions under which success may be reached.

222
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:21,970
And as you can see. These different types of use will also have implications for design and for type.

223
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:31,809
Whether you ultimately decide to do an economic evaluation in conjunction with an outcome evaluation,

224
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:38,470
for example, or do an economic outlook or economic process.

225
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:48,750
And an outcome evaluation. Or even impact evaluation.

226
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,330
And then finally we consider equity.

227
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:07,070
And, you know, how can the purpose of the evaluation help drive the project so that we're promoting equity?

228
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,050
And remember that when we think about equity from a CRE lens,

229
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:20,390
we're thinking about equity in reference to it being an outcome, but also how we apply an equity lens to process.

230
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:27,799
So not just achieving equity at the end of the train, if you will, but also how can,

231
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,620
as we're traveling down that, you know, rail if you want to stick with the metaphor,

232
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:49,970
how can that process reflect principles of equity, such as power sharing, shared leadership, challenging power dynamics, seeking representation?

233
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:59,370
So for example, if we're thinking about equity as an outcome of the evaluation,

234
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,290
the oh yeah, the components of the purpose are really going to advance equity.

235
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,780
So for example, reflecting community or cultural norms and assumptions.

236
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:21,700
We might make sure that in the purpose that we are accounting for community history and context.

237
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:32,840
We might also make sure that in the learning process that we're addressing the reality of structural inequities.

238
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,480
Perfect example.

239
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:47,200
You know, I gave an example before about how in public health we thought very straightforward about the use of built environment for exercise.

240
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:58,690
Before, there were considerations of how structural inequities have led to neighborhoods where using the built environment for walking,

241
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:07,450
for example, is not exactly the safest thing to do. So we don't have to write in the statement in a purpose statement.

242
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:17,350
This evaluation is going to promote equity, but it's actually in the learning process that we are promoting equity.

243
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:27,520
So the very fact of choosing to account for things such as structural inequities will help us promote equity.

244
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,490
And then we can also think about equity as a process, for example,

245
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:42,490
mitigating power differentials through co-creation and shared decision making power and making sure that,

246
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:50,530
for example, in crafting the purpose that that process is also being inclusive.

247
00:34:53,920 --> 00:35:00,220
So any questions about the considerations before I move on to writing purpose statements?

248
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:16,720
All right. So for the last bit of class, you are really I am not going to I am not going to stretch it out to match, I promise.

249
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,790
You are getting out early today. Like did I hear somebody say yes?

250
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,910
Yes. But don't tell. Don't tell the owl.

251
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,710
I just learned last night the owl watches me. You know, I'm talking about the owl.

252
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,690
I looked at the recording. My husband was like, Why are you doing that?

253
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,160
I'm like, Oh, my good. You could see the owl stares at me anyway.

254
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,970
So writing a purpose statement for.

255
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:54,440
So there's kind of basically like two sections of this section of the plan.

256
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:02,980
So when you write the evaluation plan, when you get to the step three section, you're going to have two basic.

257
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:11,460
Things that you need to address. One is writing the purpose statement for the evaluation, and the other is writing the questions.

258
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,470
You know, as I mentioned, we'll talk about the questions on Thursday.

259
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:23,250
But writing the purpose statement, it should summarize the basic goals and objectives of the evaluation.

260
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,850
It should be written in sentence form.

261
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:35,190
And what I mean by that is not that it has to be one sentence, but that it is narrative versus like bullet points.

262
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,660
And more should include information about what decision makers are being considered.

263
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:49,700
What information will be shared in the evaluation project overall.

264
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:57,550
What decisions will be made at the conclusion of the evaluation, and that's generally speaking.

265
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:10,050
And then what program is being evaluated? I like this basic template that I found from a I think you pronounce it no as the National Oceanic.

266
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,489
Atmospheric. Something that starts with a association.

267
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:22,850
I don't know. I don't know. I forgot. But I really like this basic sentence.

268
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:31,550
So this evaluation will provide a blank. So which decision makers with blank?

269
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:40,300
What information? In order to blank make what decisions about which program.

270
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:53,629
It's a nice, concise statement that you fill in and writing that is, you know, again,

271
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:08,720
accounting for the considerations of equity, of information needs, etc., stakeholders and is a very high level.

272
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,850
And I want to stress this.

273
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:19,430
It's a high level overview of the evaluation, so you don't have to try and wordsmith the statement that has every single decision maker,

274
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,860
every single piece of information and detail and etc.

275
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,170
It can be a really high level statement. So here's some examples.

276
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:40,000
And I'll kind of show you how those four elements are accounted for.

277
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:48,459
So on this first one, the purpose of this evaluation is to provide community groups an accounting of the community development associations,

278
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,780
activities and outcomes during the Community Grant Program period.

279
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,980
So you can hear what decision makers are being considered here.

280
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:09,460
Who might be the decision makers. I hear community groups say, yeah, community groups.

281
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:26,270
And then what information will be shared. Activities, the Community Development Association's activities and outcomes.

282
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,560
And then what decisions will be made? Well, it's a basic accounting.

283
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,409
So what what what did they do? So sometimes embedded.

284
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:42,229
And as you can see here, it's not necessarily like we will decide whether or not this program exists,

285
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,740
but sometimes it's just an issue of accountability as it is in this case.

286
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,120
And then what program will be evaluated? Well, it's the program.

287
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:54,450
That's embedded in this, the Community Development Association.

288
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:03,450
I mean, here's another one. The purpose of this evaluation is to provide an accountability report to the funder

289
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:09,090
about the budgetary expenditures for client services delivered at 22 program sites.

290
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,710
So which decision makers might be and are included in here?

291
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,280
Funder. And then what information will be shared.

292
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,050
Yeah. Budgetary expenditures for client services deliver to 202 program sites.

293
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,819
And then what decisions would be made? Again, this is accountability.

294
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:44,010
So. And then what program will be evaluated.

295
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,830
It's these client services delivered at 22 program sites.

296
00:40:50,860 --> 00:41:00,130
This evaluation will provide Agency A with a report about the implementation of Program A in order to improve program services.

297
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:07,790
So decision makers being consider in this case is agency A.

298
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,910
So they're the ones who are the main decision makers. Information that they're sharing.

299
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:21,040
Implementation of program a. And then what decisions will be made.

300
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:29,240
In order to improve program services. And then the program that's being evaluated.

301
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:43,650
Program A. And then finally, this evaluation project will provide Agency B with an evaluation process that will allow them to evaluate their services.

302
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:56,950
I should have wrote. In the future. So decision makers being consider in this case is agency be.

303
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,850
There in this one is about evaluation, capacity building.

304
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,790
So what information will be shared? It's an evaluation process.

305
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,860
So it's not necessarily it doesn't have to be program related information.

306
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:23,730
It could be information about how to deliver their services that are adjacent to program services.

307
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,530
So in this case, evaluation services, what decisions will be made?

308
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,580
They'll be deciding how to evaluate their own services in the future.

309
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,660
And then in this case. The program is their services.

310
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:48,920
So and this is similar to an evaluation capacity building project that I did recently.

311
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:56,360
So again, the purpose statement is essentially reflecting who is this for,

312
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:03,440
what kind of decisions will be made or actions will be taken if you want to make it even broader.

313
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:11,010
What? Information will be shared on what programs will be evaluated.

314
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:20,520
So these are brief examples. But you can also if you're you can also write to your heart's content.

315
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:27,660
So I found this example. This is an example from USDA or U.S. aid.

316
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,950
And so there's a lot of words here, a lot of summary.

317
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:45,820
But it still has a basic information. So what decision makers are being considered in this case WSU?

318
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,850
And implementing partners the IMO H.E and U.S. aid.

319
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:59,710
What information will be shared. Pertinent information, statistics and judgments.

320
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,200
What decisions will be made.

321
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:12,240
It will help us better understand the initial results and contributions of the project and help refocus, focus and strengthen it.

322
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,830
So quality improvement. And then what program will be evaluated?

323
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:24,160
The Afghan Equality Alliance. Alliances project.

324
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:33,420
So you can get detailed. But as the previous slide showed, you can keep it relatively simple.

325
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,910
Academics. We like to write long things, so we probably wrote this.

326
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,430
We don't know. We know how to say things. We're just like lawyers. We've got to say everything.

327
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:54,510
So, summary, the girl, you're like, what?

328
00:44:54,870 --> 00:45:00,540
45 minutes are like. It's crazy. I'm not gonna force it if it's not there.

329
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:07,590
So, summary, the goal is step three is to identify the purpose in the scope of the evaluation.

330
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,270
So this step is really, what are we doing? What's the focus?

331
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:22,590
The purpose of the evaluation is developed with considerations for information needs, stage stakeholders as well as equity.

332
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:29,680
And then finally, a purpose statement should include information about which decision makers are being considered.

333
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:34,060
What information will be shared? What decisions will be made?

334
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:43,010
And what program is being evaluated? So, Beth, don't just jump up after I ask four questions.

335
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:56,480
I still get you for 45 minutes, but any questions? Yes.

336
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,590
I'm in New York, I. Her.

337
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,870
So the question is for the assignment, is there a specific purpose you're shooting for?

338
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:18,960
No. You can use your imagination or you can.

339
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,920
It's not completely your. Yeah, it's not completely imagination, but it's using your.

340
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:36,530
Good judgment to identify what needs like what gaps in information might we not have?

341
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:48,580
So what you might end up making up is what a client might say is their most you know, what they prior what they're prioritizing.

342
00:46:51,130 --> 00:47:01,690
But anything else like information needs, equity stake holders not completely making that up or stage as well.

343
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,200
So that actually leads me to what I want to say before you all get up and leave.

344
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:22,430
So one. I would encourage you if you have a half hour meet with your groups.

345
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:30,470
We have and I will get the feedback to you form the logic model relatively quickly.

346
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:35,480
I need to convene with her about how long it's going to take us to finish the grading.

347
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:46,520
Once you know, now that we have the assignments and see what else and we're almost done with grading the email assignment.

348
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:52,040
So we'll have that to you as well. That's all I got for you.

349
00:47:52,050 --> 00:48:00,750
So if you want to meet with your groups, take the half hour, start talking about this purpose statement.

350
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:05,910
It's a good time to apply it. All right.

351
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:18,960
I'm done for the day. That's.

352
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,850
33.

353
00:48:42,680 --> 00:49:09,100
Yeah. Yeah. I recently.

354
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,400
Yes, I did it in the hallway.

355
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:30,960
But at least having a basic understanding of it will help you a file folder.

356
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,740
But yeah, that's important.

357
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:40,490
Yeah. The police have the program, right?

358
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:55,620
So what you're saying is that people. It's so important.

359
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:10,850
A lot of things. Individually.

360
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:33,290
I think I think if I understand the question, what you're saying you're asking is.

361
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,140
Right. Is it going have like a standardize. Yeah.

362
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:47,469
So that too. So it's more so that you would you you always wanted to have something,

363
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:51,790
but the what the something is will come from your conversations with your stakeholders.

364
00:50:52,450 --> 00:51:04,239
So because I mean, like it's about it's more about like what you prioritize.

365
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,280
Like if you just go through the process,

366
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:14,290
you're always gonna have some information about how you're going to recall large amounts of information about who you use the for your,

367
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,080
you know, different outcomes and what, what you choose to share in there.

368
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,890
It is dependent on what they have prior.

369
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:40,880
Yeah. So sometimes it even comes into play when you, when you get to use and sharing lessons because you know, like for example,

370
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:49,810
with the capacity of my family when I meet with them I talk about how they guy is not I mean

371
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:53,750
they care about the outcomes but they don't they didn't really need that wasn't their priority.

372
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,860
So I wonder you know how that will individual.

373
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:10,290
I will do that. Yeah. Yeah. So. So when I did pick out, I wrote a report for the agency and then a presentation for the board.

374
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,410
And so in the board presentation, I emphasize.

375
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:25,690
But when you create something for community members, they talked about how to gather as is accountable to account for.

376
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:51,290
Then I was. I. But there's also the tensions.

377
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:11,900
And. I'm just say if there is a curriculum that exists for.

378
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:20,510
Yeah. Yeah. And then if you. I mean, if. You could also go deeper into it.

379
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:31,150
You don't have to have a credit score. Maybe there's something in that curriculum that tells you that one out short term.

380
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:44,890
So, you know, you're taking pieces of whatever information you can find to clarify why you think it's fair to say that this program.

381
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:57,800
Okay. It's. I mean, not for those.

382
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:01,379
I guess I would, though, if I were doing it.

383
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:13,730
The whole idea of having. I.

384
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:53,220
I'm. Yeah, I know.

385
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:02,770
Hello. How are you doing? You know what?

386
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:14,050
And then I also wanted to contest, and I got into campaigns, and it took me pretty much an entire hour.

387
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:30,080
Just wanted to make sure I. I think it's a lot easier if I had to go get a pass last week and it was almost like the class integrity I know.

388
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,390
And that's the beginning of the semester was fine. I know, I know.

389
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:41,650
It's just like I was like I had a spy on me and now that's getting I'm from like,

390
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:48,000
okay, so it looks like I'm not going to be able to have a routine here. Because the campus is so crazy.

391
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,030
You know, and I used to like two years ago that was part of.

392
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:05,500
It has to. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:10,130
It's really just like, yeah, yeah. Especially it's not computer friendly.

394
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,880
I didn't realize that because last year we were fully remote. Pretty much.

395
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,440
So I think about that for a while here. Yeah.

396
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:23,540
You know, so now the neighborhood I have now.

397
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,510
So eventually. Okay.

398
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:31,910
So there is.

399
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:38,190
Sometimes you can find parking there. I just started.

400
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:49,500
He goes, I don't know where you come from, but if you become promotional, you're through just like all these side streets.

401
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,640
Okay? Like. But. Ron where the friends are.

402
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:59,200
So I wouldn't have the parking tickets. Yeah, yeah.

403
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,030
I mean, I was thinking.

404
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:14,160
Taking the bus around it's like it gets a forgot about that gets worse and then I'm sure the weather to like with the snow here.

405
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:18,510
So I wish we could have just one more year and I'm sure a lot of us.

406
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,290
So maybe not every night allowed to.

407
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,300
Thank you so much for your life. And we have to get you to the luck of the park.

408
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:19,600
And then. We have.

409
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:30,950
Yeah. There's not much.

410
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:59,850
Oh. Hi.

411
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,840
Okay? Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:29,130
Thank you for checking. Yes. To. I wrote this.

413
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:58,850
Yeah. Yeah. So.

414
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,200
So now it's not really a problem.

416
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:16,310
Yes. Yes. More.

417
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:31,750
One program with. So maybe this.

418
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,510
I would prefer that you do either process or outcome one's outcome.

419
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:57,260
But if you feel confident, you want to.

420
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:05,559
Great. But even that feels like a little different, right?

421
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:11,910
Like it's really about the state. So you can do a formative evaluation.

422
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,790
That is it. Yeah.

423
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:29,260
Yeah. If you could do that, would.

424
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:37,640
I would I would recommend sex and or Japanese of.

425
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,310
Yeah. Yeah.

426
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:51,260
Yeah. I don't really get too deep into. Methods of writing questions follow the rules.

427
01:01:52,250 --> 01:02:00,600
On Thursday, I'm in the process. Every time they have to walk.

428
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:14,530
But days. When it comes to getting.

429
01:02:19,350 --> 01:05:58,790
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

430
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:40,840
Happening here. Are we getting to the problem?

431
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:45,350
I mean. I outlined.

432
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:51,410
Like I feel like I could carry a lot of kids outside the.

433
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:57,060
The curriculum. This is for the. You have.

434
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:12,310
Yeah, I would say that, um. This.

435
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:31,410
If you think that that output is. Key, the basic key in terms of being therapeutic.

436
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:44,890
So on. So what I would suggest is to not take that out.

437
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:52,660
Perkins. We just saw.

438
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:06,610
But them. Yes. And it takes these outfits.

439
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:11,490
And. Let me. What needs to.

440
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:20,880
And then there might be ways that you can. What is it you can summarize?

441
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:30,170
Example the long. I don't know why you're finding.

442
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:38,360
What if they didn't want their findings, but they might achieve those outcomes?

443
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:44,490
So think about it. I am impressed that you got that much.

444
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:51,990
It's like 4.5. Oh, I'm how you do it?

445
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,790
Okay. But that's I was like, oh, no, you don't like. No.

446
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,790
You know, there's always one group that wants to break them out like that.

447
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:12,580
But it's still practice. But then, of course, you would think about. But the question you're asking is like, is it?

448
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:24,070
Do you want to describe what it looks like? Not so much that there's no room for any cost.

449
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:44,560
He also added. The struggling.

450
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:21,120
Some things are out there, but. Well, then would ask the question.

451
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:25,080
You're asking the question. It's kind of like a.

452
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,830
But then. What might you be missing?

453
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:56,480
It is perfect. Say. That's what I like that about.
