00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,668
In this video,

2
00:00:09,668 --> 00:00:13,420
we will consider moral hazard one of
the fundamental issues that insurers, and

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,229
policymakers will have to address, and
designing health insurance programs.

4
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:20,910
Because insurance, whether private or
through a public program,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,503
makes health care appear
artificially cheap.

6
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:26,165
Consumers have an incentive
to increase use,

7
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:29,859
which in turn increases the cost
of providing health benefits.

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:35,477
Today's learning objectives are to adapt
our general micro economic behavior model.

9
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:38,965
To account for particular features
of health and health care decisions.

10
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:42,551
And to apply our typology of sources
of market failure to healthcare,

11
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:44,996
to analyze why suboptimal
outcomes can occur.

12
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:53,629
Suppose health insurers could observe
the enrollees exact health situation, and

13
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,469
know the optimal level of care for
each situation,

14
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,721
the ideal structure of health
insurance would be simple.

15
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:04,595
if you come down with condition
X at a severity level of Y,

16
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,247
the insurer will send you $Z.

17
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:11,817
$Z would be set to allow the enrollee,
to purchase the ideal level of care.

18
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:15,521
But here's the important point,
the payment would be in cash,

19
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:19,440
allowing the enrollee to do whatever
they wanted to with the money.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,750
We're giving them the money they
need to afford the ideal care,

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,218
thereby protecting them
from financial risk.

22
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:30,705
But then they are spending their own
money, when they actually get care.

23
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:33,964
How would this hypothetical policy
affect the enrollees, incentives for

24
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:34,642
care seeking?

25
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:39,424
In most cases, we expect the person to
spend most or all of the money on health

26
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:43,790
care, but we aren't distorting
the prices they face at the margin.

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,891
Where they are considering whether to get
one more office visit, one more, test,

28
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,832
one more prescription or
stay in the hospital an extra day.

29
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:55,754
They are weighing the value of that
extra care, against its full cost.

30
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:57,285
That is there would be no moral hazard.

31
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:00,205
Enrollees would have
an incentive to shop around.

32
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:04,819
If they find a provider charging less
than $Z, they get to keep the difference.

33
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,225
And if they select a provider
charging more than $Z,

34
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:11,486
they're responsible for
paying the difference.

35
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:15,100
Similarly, they have a strong
incentive not to use low value care.

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,636
Enrollee is free to purchase more
than the optimal amount of care,

37
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:22,886
but they pay the full cost
of any care above $Z.

38
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:25,806
The ideal policy would also
need to observe the caretaking

39
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:29,988
efforts enrollees take, to avoid the bad
event from occurring in the first place.

40
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:33,374
And make payments contingent
on that level of care taking.

41
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:37,125
That would eliminate moral hazard and
prevention as well.

42
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,913
So why don't our health
insurers just send us checks?

43
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:45,136
If I totaled my car,
my auto insurer would send me a check.

44
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:49,501
I could use it to replace my car
with the exact same model and year.

45
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:53,638
Spend more to upgraded to a newer model,
buy a cheaper replacement,

46
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,218
use the difference to pay off my mortgage.

47
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,451
Or not buy a car at all, and
take a trip to Hawaii with the money.

48
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:04,790
The key is that my insurer can easily
inspect, and assess my car's damage and

49
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,877
its market value.

50
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:08,301
Observing the enrollee state of health,
and

51
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:11,375
knowing the ideal amount of
care isn't quite as simple.

52
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,213
Suppose the state of health we're
talking about his back pain, and

53
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:19,050
the insurer writes a contract that says,
we'll send you a check for

54
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,297
$1,000 for moderate back pain.

55
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:24,694
And we'll pay you $10,000 d for
severe back pain,

56
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:28,591
which level of symptoms do you
think most enrollees would report?

57
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:33,583
And even for those who truly have severe
back pain, the diagnostic workup,

58
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:37,406
treatment recommendations and
personal preferences for

59
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:41,239
care may vary substantially
around the average payment.

60
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,007
So how does health insurance payoff?

61
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:46,472
By reducing the price of care.

62
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:50,659
You can only be reimbursed for care you
actually get, mitigating the incentive to

63
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,946
overstate your level of illness,
to get a bigger cash payment.

64
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:56,577
But then we get moral hazard,
because reducing

65
00:03:56,577 --> 00:04:01,271
the price of care distorts incentives,
to account for cost when making decisions.

66
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:05,449
With full insurance coverage,
the enrollee will ignore price and

67
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:09,867
demand all care, they believed to
have positive marginal benefits.

68
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:13,369
If providers are paid at
a profitable fee for service rate,

69
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:16,179
their incentive is to
deliver all of this care.

70
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:20,625
And perhaps even encourage a poorly
informed enrollee to consume more.

71
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,387
And by decreasing the enrollees
cost of an adverse event,

72
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:28,706
insurance also decreases the incentive
to invest in prevention.

73
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:32,018
To summarize by causing
people to ignore costs,

74
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:35,508
moral hazard actually
increases the cost of care.

75
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:40,142
If prevention declines, adverse events
become more likely, and once they occur,

76
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:43,159
the increase in the use of
care makes them more costly.

77
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:47,135
If the insurer is unable to
effectively curb moral hazard,

78
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:51,668
they will need to account for
these costs and premiums they charge,

79
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:55,024
making everyone's
healthcare more expensive.

80
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:57,945
This results in the fundamental trade,
often insurance design.

81
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:00,139
We want to protect risk averse consumers,

82
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,533
from the financial risk associated
with random health events.

83
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:07,087
But we also want to preserve their
incentive, to prevent illness or

84
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,652
injury and use care efficiently,
if an adverse event does occur.

85
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:14,900
If we provide full coverage,
we would eliminate financial risk, but

86
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,931
also eliminate incentives
to be cost conscious.

87
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:22,996
An imperfect remedy is requiring some
cost sharing, or out of pocket costs.

88
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:26,807
Balancing the desire to protect
against most of the risk,

89
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:30,951
while maintaining at least some
incentive to consider costs.
