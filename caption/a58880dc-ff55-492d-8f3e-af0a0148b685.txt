1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,990
I think, you know, I don't know.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,960
I might be more like five this morning because you're only supposed to focus on.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,160
No, it's okay to be serious.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:29,960
Yeah, I mean. So what's the match at all? Because I'm sure it's not just me.

5
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,400
It's just that, you know, it's a lot easier. It's like what?

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,049
It's like.

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,170
It's like it's just doing everything. It's like.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:53,160
I don't know how I'm talking about.

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:03,690
I like the whole record, just like I always think of it as something serious, but.

10
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you are.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:24,720
I think it's going to give to do because you're trying to just like put any and all through the streets.

12
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,480
Okay. Right.

13
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:46,860
Right. So you can sort of this kind of brings you to your house, right.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:59,910
Have you seen like this discussion about, you know, if you're gonna help me out because you want to know.

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,130
I understand. So, you know, I.

16
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,910
Yeah. And my dad says it's hard to get very to talk about what's talk about.

17
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:29,800
Oh so. Or are you the secretary?

18
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:45,660
You know, like I said, I thought that was me, but I just had to get back to what you started.

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:59,460
I like announcements. My homework three is due on Wednesday and number four is going to be released today, actually.

20
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:13,649
Thank you. And it's gonna be 1205 and then I'm going to be out of town the week after Thanksgiving in Israel.

21
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:24,840
So you'll have two guys lectures. One on Monday is what's going to be your guest lecturer already you planning Mark Wilson as emeritus from here?

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,809
He actually taught this course many years before I took it over.

23
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,490
And he is an expert on the borne disease instead of malaria for quite a while.

24
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,520
So [INAUDIBLE] be talking to you on Monday.

25
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,560
And then my post-doc Jesse Contreras will be talking to you on Wednesday on fecal oral transmission.

26
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,110
So it's saying to topics that's that's we're scheduled for that week.

27
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:09,580
So today we're talking about respiratory disease, airborne transmission in our and these are the key topics that we'll be covering.

28
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:20,160
The main concept for this for this lecture is really about thinking about how much air

29
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,209
transmission goes through the airborne versus the droplet versus the contact transmission.

30
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,110
There's really three transmission pathways where we think that transmission is

31
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,390
occurring for airborne transmission or airborne or respiratory transmitted diseases.

32
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:45,520
And there's really been a question about what are the dominant modes of transmission.

33
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:53,679
And so we'll talk a little bit about that. It's been contested and has been going back and forth and COVID has brought this topic up again,

34
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,890
but it's been a topic that's been discussed and talked about for quite a while.

35
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,729
And so that's that's really the main topic or concept that we want to talk about in this lecture.

36
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,110
I want to talk about in this lecture.

37
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:22,210
So when we talk about respiratory disease, there are non-communicable and communicable diseases in this category.

38
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:33,700
The big ones in the non-communicable area are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is really a catchall for your idea of chronic diseases.

39
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:40,060
Asthma and lung cancer can also be big in this area.

40
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,330
And then there's the communicable diseases, which one big category is in acute respiratory infections.

41
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,510
We'll be talking a lot about that. And then tuberculosis as another category.

42
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:07,460
So this table provides a a list of what considered the five important respiratory conditions or lung are they call lung diseases in this area.

43
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,650
So you can see that it's a mixture of the chronic infectious diseases from

44
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:22,500
the previous slide and some of these are huge with respect to disease burden,

45
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,350
COPD and COPD, you can see is a fourth leading cause of death worldwide.

46
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:39,660
And you see acute respiratory infections caused a huge amount of mortality in the world today.

47
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:47,250
In fact, you put together an acute respiratory infection and diarrheal diseases, which you'll be hearing about next week.

48
00:06:47,580 --> 00:07:02,610
Those are very major causes of mortality worldwide nowadays, mostly in lower and middle income countries, but huge with respect to mortality.

49
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,499
And TB, as we'll talk about, is also for a single disease quite high.

50
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:22,180
And again, TB, like we talk about syphilis, often thought about a disease of the past, the disease that has been dealt with by it.

51
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:30,120
It's often considered disease of poverty. Where. It's been increasing in many areas of the world.

52
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,290
And we talked about in the antibiotic resistance, like, sure, antibiotic resistant TVs is a huge, huge concern.

53
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:50,280
So when we think about these diseases, there's many different environmental drivers of these diseases.

54
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,710
And each one of these contribute significantly to.

55
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:08,400
Disease burden in this areas. We have indoor air pollution, which is an area that hadn't been really recognized prior to the 1990 as a significant.

56
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:20,310
An important factor, but now is recognized as a huge factor with respect to exposure again in lower and middle

57
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:28,080
income countries where people are using wood to cook in kitchens and creates this huge,

58
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,420
intense exposure with respect to mainly women and children.

59
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:39,360
Ambient air pollution has been any huge issue in the U.S. we've.

60
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,370
Done a lot of work in addressing air pollution in the U.S., but still a huge issue globally.

61
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,620
Occupational exposures are big as well as tobacco use again.

62
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:58,440
We think of tobacco use as something of the past that we've dealt with, but it's increasing in many places in the world.

63
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:10,440
And so each of these contributes to a burden that the exposures with respect to the burden of these five diseases followed here.

64
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,560
Most of these are modifiable, modifiable drivers.

65
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,780
Most of these we understand how to deal with in many ways,

66
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:28,620
but what combination of lax regulations and economic pressures make it difficult to control these diseases?

67
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,889
So the non-communicable diseases listed here often involve social conditions

68
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:44,940
and often resulting in long term exposures that produces chronic symptoms.

69
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:56,909
And the daily disease adjusted life years that are lost or mostly are more important than than the death that is, the chronic symptoms.

70
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:03,060
And the issues that go on are are much higher than than the actual deaths.

71
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:13,139
But we also saw the respiratory diseases that are infectious etiology share some of these characteristics also.

72
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:21,090
And this that's what we're going to focus on in this lecture. So just I start off with some definitions.

73
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,510
And so we'll talk about respiratory infection.

74
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:31,740
We're talking about this site of the disease, the site of where that pathogen is colonizing the lungs,

75
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:45,990
usually in the lungs, but it can be also in different membranes from the eyes, nose and mouth.

76
00:10:48,300 --> 00:11:01,080
So we talk about airborne. We were talking about the dissemination of microbes that are in aerosolized particles that can enter the respiratory tract.

77
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,260
So airborne, meaning that these particles are going to be small.

78
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:15,600
And we talk about droplet nuclei, which are basically particles that are small enough, usually 1 to 5 microns,

79
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,199
and they can be sustained in the air for hours and they're small enough so that when

80
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:32,669
you inhale and they get all the way into the office and so droplet nuclei are are what

81
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,280
the what we're exposed to when we talk about airborne transmission dust is another

82
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:45,180
way it can be aerosolized and another way in which we can be exposed to pathogens.

83
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,479
And so when we talk about these aerosols, a lot of these infectious diseases,

84
00:11:51,480 --> 00:12:01,080
which we talk about as directly transmitted diseases in our way, in which we characterize early, early in the class we characterized in.

85
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,950
Groot Infectious diseases, when we talk about the aerosols, are time now.

86
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,250
We can think of a lot of these diseases as indirect transmission.

87
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:19,260
That is, the air is an environment or media in which this these pathogens can.

88
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:27,900
They can be reservoirs, basically, just like we think about water as reservoir, or we can think about aerosols as a form of indirect transmission.

89
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:37,340
So the airborne route is can be thought of as distinct from a drop of droplet spread.

90
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,370
And so the droplet spread is.

91
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:49,160
These are larger particles that are usually moved.

92
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:56,260
Then they can stay in the air as long. And they're usually the portal entry is usually air mucous.

93
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:05,590
So it's somebody sneezes in your face and it's either the eyes, nose or mouth that the passenger exposed.

94
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,250
You know, the pathogen enters in through these membranes.

95
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:19,280
And so the droplets spread. Larger particles, again, we travel is much less.

96
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,770
This is where we we came up with this the six foot rule in in COVID.

97
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:35,320
Because when people do experiments on droplet spread, that's on average the distance that you know that these particles can spread.

98
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,890
So the idea of having six foot distance would mean that those droplets would have fallen to the ground before they reached somebody.

99
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:53,990
So it's important to note that these two pathogens, a lot of these are viruses that we're talking about, but also some bacteria like TB.

100
00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:02,010
They adhere to droplet particles. They they are moving through the air in in a cell, but they adhere to a drop of particles.

101
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:12,240
And as the droplets, you know, as these particles evaporate, that the droplet size decreases.

102
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,430
But also, if they're exposed, if it's a high humidity environment, they can actually increase.

103
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,670
And so it's that. The property of the drop of the particle,

104
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:30,210
not the pathogen that determines how far they how long they last in the air, how far they go, where they drop to.

105
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,790
And it also speaks to the ability of the pathogens to survive.

106
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:44,790
So some pathogens can survive in smaller particles with less moisture, and their other pathogens can survive.

107
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,930
And that's why they're more droplet spread or contact spread.

108
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,920
So again, it's this interaction between the environment,

109
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:01,349
things like humidity and the pathogen and things like their ability to persist in the environment.

110
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:10,980
And the host of the port of entry is that determines the mode of transmission that's going to be most efficient for a given pathogen.

111
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,260
So people are you've probably seen this picture where somebody sneezes cos you're releasing a lot of particles.

112
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:28,630
Again, these particles are in different sizes. Evaporation over time decreases the particle size.

113
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,680
And so some particles then stay aerosolized.

114
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:41,880
The larger particles will drop. And again, speaking, you know,

115
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:52,430
this is the issue about how these how how pathogens adhere to different sized particles and persist on different sized particles,

116
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:03,540
determine the ability of this pathogen to expose people through airborne or death or droplet or contact.

117
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:21,400
We'll talk about next. Also again, though, the cough and sneeze moves the particle much further and the package is much further.

118
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,000
Even just talking and breathing can result in the release of particles.

119
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,120
Again, those are going to be pathogens and we'd better stick that in your mouth, you know, as we speak.

120
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,050
TB, which lodges all this side of infection is in the lungs,

121
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:43,630
is going to be transmitted through coughing and breathing less effectively than something like codeine or influenza.

122
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,580
And that's an costs that are actually a much more efficient way for TB to become aerosolized.

123
00:16:51,850 --> 00:17:02,140
So this diagram depicts the same concept and really illustrates again how airborne and droplet transmission are.

124
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:12,690
You can think of it as a continuum. So again, until you see these large particles, these blue particles here, which are greater than 100 microns,

125
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,710
fall pretty quickly within one or two meters to either the ground or they can fall to surfaces.

126
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:32,490
This is where keyboards, mouse and different different objects in which they can stay as long as they persist, can then be a point of exposure.

127
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,750
But these particles, it's important to note that they these are too large to be inhaled very deeply into your lungs.

128
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,930
And then we have larger aerosols, approximately 300 microns that can stay aerosolized for as long as a minute.

129
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,020
And so they are, you know,

130
00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:02,890
have have a little bit more distance with respect to their ability to infect these larger red dots representing the large aerosols.

131
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,729
And then we have the small aerosols that we talked about previously, five microns or less.

132
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,210
And here they can be aerosolized for as long as an hour.

133
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:24,570
And also these small. Smaller particles can penetrate lower into the respiratory tract where things like TB, the point of infection for TB.

134
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,770
That's important to note that these are things it's a lot more dilute here.

135
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,429
So though you have you know,

136
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:38,730
these can be aerosolized for as long as an hour or you can be on the other side of a restaurant and be exposed to somebody.

137
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:53,130
You know, dilution will make that the dose much, much smaller as opposed to this droplet spread in close contact.

138
00:18:53,490 --> 00:19:01,400
Where in that dose is much, much higher. So.

139
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,470
This diagram I like because it kind of just shows the shifting paradigm because again,

140
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:18,000
how people talk about disease is being droplet spread or airborne spread, and it depends on what area you're talking about.

141
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:31,530
And so it was often commonly thought that influenza is primarily droplet spread, for instance, whereas tuberculosis is primarily airborne.

142
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,730
In reality, as we're going to see in this rest of this lecture.

143
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:43,540
It's not a easy kind of dichotomy to be talking about is really the really rests along a continuum.

144
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:50,830
And it depends on the setting as much as the pathogen, what the primary or dominant mode of transmission is.

145
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,030
But in this diagram, we see that all the way to active properties.

146
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:03,760
The idea that air was the mode of transmission was was the primary or dominant thinking.

147
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:11,230
And that was true all the way into the 1850s where we started discovering that cholera was waterborne.

148
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:21,820
Malaria was a vector borne for this shift, that diseases were not completely explained through airborne transmission kind of developed.

149
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:29,500
And then in the 1920s, when this idea of droplet spread became much more prevalent,

150
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,990
there's really was this drop in thinking that Airborne was actually important for many diseases.

151
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:48,110
At some point, tuberculosis became it became clear that tuberculosis was being transmitted airborne and then measles and chickenpox and then in COVID.

152
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,780
And we witnessed this transition where everyone thought it was primarily droplet spread

153
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:01,280
to thinking that it was much more airborne during this pandemic and this this increase,

154
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:09,380
again, in thinking about airborne transmission. So we see this kind of view of the dominant mode.

155
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,430
But much of the discussion here is about, you know, being.

156
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,340
Isn't well, isn't nuanced in the sense that it's like, oh, it's airborne, it's droplet,

157
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:29,510
and as opposed to talking about it as being both in how contact and a pen can determine which is going to be the dominant mode of transmission.

158
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:46,670
So. This is a little bit getting into the kind of nuances with respect to the drama in the mode of transmission in this article by Brian Milton.

159
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:58,309
It nicely illustrates how. If we start with the sources, different sources generates particles with different characteristic sizes.

160
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:11,750
So the upper respiratory tract will release particles that are one micron between one and ten microns, primarily,

161
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:22,010
but as large as 100 microns, whereas the lower respiratory tract is going to be releasing much smaller particles.

162
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,050
The low one micron fomites, on the other hand,

163
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:37,170
are are if they get aerosolized will be much larger 10 to 100 and in sewage and water sources kind of range.

164
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,250
It is sort of in its intermediate size range.

165
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,870
So then once the particle is emitted,

166
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:53,549
it may it reaches to the environment and persistence will depend on the initial size of

167
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,740
the particle and composition and a variety of environmental factors that can actually,

168
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,570
as we mentioned, which I mentioned before, it can change the size of a particle such as humidity.

169
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:12,540
So temperature, humidity are big factors with respect to determining, you know, determining the size,

170
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:21,830
how the particles sizes will change, and also the persistence of the pathogen itself as well as ultraviolet radiation.

171
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,060
So there's a lot of environmental factors that go into determining the fate of a pathogen

172
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,970
and both with respect to its viability and its respect to how far it's going to travel.

173
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,090
And then we get to the contamination site, which is also a function of the particle size.

174
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:54,800
So here the Nasopharyngeal site is going to be mostly membrane transmitted, that is that the pathogen will be infect somebody through membranes.

175
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,380
And I'm talking about, on average, larger particle sizes.

176
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:09,650
And then as you move down the respiratory tract to the bronchial area, it's smaller and then to the pulmonary even smaller sizes.

177
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,820
With respect to. It's the infection site.

178
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,520
So particle size is. Is, is.

179
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:29,160
It's going to be determinative and is important to consider with respect to the different parts of from a source environment to examination.

180
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,550
So the same paper defines airborne transmission as.

181
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:49,260
Obligate transmission that is where Airborne is likely to be the main or only two way in which aerosol the only way in which transmission occurs.

182
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:59,730
So TB is the classic pathogen in that category of mainly because the site of infection is in the view VI in the lungs.

183
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,309
So it's only small particles that can get that far down in the lungs and actually do in actually infect.

184
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:12,840
So we've got obligate airborne transmission, then we got preferential airborne transmission where.

185
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:22,170
You can be infected through multiple routes of transmission, but the predominant route is viewed as airborne through aerosols.

186
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:29,310
And here, smallpox and measles are in that category and then opportunistic airborne transmission.

187
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:36,900
And we'll show an example of that with respect to the SA's outbreak are ones in which

188
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:43,710
the primary route is other routes of transmission such as droplet or contact that.

189
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:54,830
There are certain conditions. And this goes back to the settings, certain settings where you can get an airborne transmission to occur.

190
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:05,240
And again, with this size, a specific size outbreak in Hong Kong back in 2022.

191
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:15,740
Well, it is a classic example of how SA's transmitted via airborne transmission quite effectively caused a Superspreading event.

192
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,380
And just to emphasize again, this is a work in progress.

193
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,690
This is a very contested area of research and there's many views and this is going to

194
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:39,290
continue to evolve over time as we learn and do more experiments on transmission.

195
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:44,280
The problem is it's easy to do these kind of artificial experiments to see

196
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,090
how far particles move and whether or not viruses can can be persist in air.

197
00:26:51,330 --> 00:27:01,920
Much harder to show epidemiologically that cases were transmitted via airborne versus droplet versus contact.

198
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,070
So as we move now to thinking about how we define dominant modes of transmission.

199
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:25,780
We can see here is a pictorial again about ways in which an infected person releases or sheds pathogens.

200
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:33,700
There's many different potential transmission routes through close contact exposure.

201
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,780
We think about it as droplet spread airborne.

202
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:48,040
This is supposed to show us something that is a little bit further and and deposition.

203
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,150
So contact or contamination of fomites at the bottom here.

204
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,280
With respect to the third mode of transmission.

205
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:09,660
So. When we talk about different dominant modes of transmission models become very effective and and

206
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,810
important in helping us tease apart how to think about these dominant modes of transmission.

207
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,010
And I had a graduate student who worked on this modeling project a number of years ago with respect to influenza.

208
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:34,590
And this is a diagram in that paper that of highlighting how, again, shedding, which is comes from somebody sneezing,

209
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:42,270
coughing, talking, seeing occurs in which different sized particles are released from the mouth.

210
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,470
And depending on the size of the particle depends on its fate.

211
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,250
The smaller particles wind up having respiratory exposure.

212
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,900
Exposure, medium size. It's inspiratory.

213
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,310
Exposure is similar, it's inhalation. But if they're larger particles, they don't go as deep.

214
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:12,669
And then those sad, even larger particles that settle down and wind up contaminated surfaces and people touching the surface,

215
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:16,479
they can contact the surfaces and then the droplet exposure,

216
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,990
as we talked about it being close, you know, within six feet of somebody that's infectious.

217
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:30,760
So if you think about each one of these. Processes start with [INAUDIBLE].

218
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:40,940
There's there's a lot of different factors that go and are involved with respect to determining how much somebody shares, what their rate is,

219
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,870
what their magnitude of shedding is, and then what is the distribution of the shedding across different sized particles?

220
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:54,380
How many pathogens adhere to smaller particles, intermediate sized particles and larger particles?

221
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:04,889
Then there's the environment with respect to inactivation of those particles and their particles to

222
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:12,660
actually persist in different set or pathogens persist in different sized particles or on surfaces.

223
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:23,280
And then there's these host environment factors, like how often somebody touches different objects,

224
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,890
how often they touch their eyes, their nose, their mouth.

225
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:35,219
And there's a lot of videography work now being done in daycare centers, especially to figure out the rate in which kids touch their mouths,

226
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,730
tighten their nose, touch their eyes, because that's going to be a big factor with respect to exposure.

227
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:51,090
And then the last part with respect to breathing rate, how how, you know, again,

228
00:30:51,090 --> 00:31:01,140
how deep do these particles make it into the lung self inoculation rate and it transfers efficiencies when somebody when you touch them,

229
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:13,740
send an object like clothes or a table, how much actually adheres to your fingers and how much when you touch your eyes,

230
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,730
transfer it to your membranes, for instance. So all of these factors.

231
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:30,870
Are some better known and some more uncertain with respect to what these values are.

232
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,910
But all of these go into determining what the dominant mode of transmission is.

233
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,899
And some of these are inherent to the pathogen.

234
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:44,340
Some of these are behavioral, some of these are inherent to the setting.

235
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:55,350
And so a key thing here that is not as well appreciated is the infectivity, which is what the Slide 50 is,

236
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:02,150
is the dose in which 50% of the people that are exposed to that dose will get infected, too.

237
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,230
So it's a measure infectivity,

238
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:18,420
the infectivity when you inhale influenza is much different than the infectivity when you touch your eyes and you're exposed through membranes.

239
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:32,550
And so it turns out that pathogens are much more likely to infect when you inhale them than when you touch them and touch your membranes.

240
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:40,230
So there like an order of magnitude difference with respect to how infectious the pathogen is depending on the route of exposure.

241
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,340
But then the dose also is there's order to the magnitude differences.

242
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,940
Like I mentioned, when you inhale, once the pathogen gets aerosolized, it gets very dilute.

243
00:32:51,090 --> 00:33:01,020
So you're inhaling much slower, much lower concentration than you are when you're actually in in close contact

244
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,340
and there's droplet transmission occurring when somebody sneezes or coughs,

245
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,980
much higher concentrations and also contamination of surfaces, often much higher concentration.

246
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:18,420
So all of that and all of these factors go into determining what the dominant mode of transmission is.

247
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:29,910
And in this in the model analysis, the finding was that contacts didn't matter that under certain.

248
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:37,820
Parameter combinations that mimic certain venues.

249
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:47,030
Respiratory routes, for example, would dominate in a subway setting where there is high density and very it's an enclosed setting.

250
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:58,250
Droplet route transmission may be dominant in an outdoor setting where there is also high density,

251
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:09,050
but less likely for the airborne pathogens to actually be transmitted given the state so much pollution.

252
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:18,950
Given an open setting like this. And then situations like daycare centers where contact will likely dominate,

253
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:28,910
such as the situation where there's just lots of kids around touching each other and touching toys, touching their mouths and eyes and constantly.

254
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:37,330
So it's going to illustrate how what the dominant mode of transmission is this very context and.

255
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:56,870
So. There's been a lot of studies you know pre-COVID mostly a lot of it focused on TB someone influenza to try and.

256
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:07,510
Yet without data and and show that the mode of transmission is airborne versus droplet.

257
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:17,440
A lot of animal studies in the fifties showing that would you really switch that the fact that TB was mostly airborne.

258
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,630
But since then not a whole lot of studies that.

259
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:37,240
A lot of research after COVID to really help us distill and understand the difference between airborne and droplet borne transmission.

260
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:45,350
So this is showing you a little bit of the different types of studies that have been done, too.

261
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:51,000
And a lot of these studies is why people are, you know, people that.

262
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:00,090
Adhere to airborne versus droplet everything. The predominant mode of transmission often refer to different types of experiments.

263
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:08,190
And this is one classic experiment where we get a guinea pig model where they basically had infected

264
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:19,950
guinea pigs in a cage and they had this dotted line shows that there is no exposure to air flow,

265
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,290
whereas a solid light is is impervious to airflow.

266
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:33,479
And so they looked at they set up these experiments with respect to having infected guinea pigs in one cage and

267
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:40,830
exposed in another occasion and look to see the rate in which these exposed became infectious and had fine.

268
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:50,069
And I started to understand a little bit better about not just that airborne transmission was an effective way to transmit pathogen,

269
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:57,450
but also understanding how things like humidity and temperature were important

270
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,790
in determining how effective and how effective an airborne transmission was.

271
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:11,280
So here that rollout relative to the humidity produced by indoor heating and cold temperatures, favored influenza.

272
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,570
That viral spread in this particular study.

273
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:30,290
So. People also started developing different contraptions to measure the amount of pathogens released and shared by people.

274
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:38,480
This is the machine that measured virus spread by individuals.

275
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:47,840
There's also a vomiting machine that was able to simulate vomit and the way in which and the degree to which vomit,

276
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,889
aerosolized particles and the distance in which aerosolized particles.

277
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:03,410
So vomiting is a is a pretty intense way in which to spread lots of pathogens in a given area and contaminate the environment.

278
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:17,340
And this study, again, is one study that was done with masks to show that masks are much more effective here on the left,

279
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:26,850
preventing coarse particles from being released was greater than five microns than they were in much

280
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:35,370
more modest prevention of finer particles that are going to be aerosolized from being released.

281
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,490
And this is using surgical masks.

282
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:47,230
So a lot of these studies are also studies which people use to suggest droplet versus

283
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:52,870
droplet versus airborne and also the effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission.

284
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,849
And none of these are these are epidemiologic with respect to any kind of health outcomes.

285
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:06,370
But more just just showing and looking at the ways in which particles that pathogens adhere to,

286
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:13,810
move through the environment and are prevented from being moving from an infectious person to a settled person.

287
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:29,460
So. Now moving along to talk a little bit about tuberculosis, which is a huge disease.

288
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,590
It has been historically a huge burden globally and even in the U.S. It is

289
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,630
really considered a disease of poverty in the sense of very treatable disease.

290
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:54,640
And we can identify the disease, but it's still a disease that maintains transmission and increasing in many different areas.

291
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,720
And the issue of antibiotic resistance is a big problem with respect to TB.

292
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,490
Some of the unique features of TB.

293
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:13,220
TB is a bacteria as opposed to a lot of the other airborne pathogens that we've been talking about that are viruses.

294
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:25,100
One important aspect of TB is it's its ability to have a latent infection so somebody can be infected with TB for years,

295
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,860
decades before it becomes an active case.

296
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:34,520
And it's only when you're in the active stage of TB that you're actually infectious.

297
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:45,590
And so but it creates this reservoir of TB in people that are latently infected.

298
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,060
That makes control a lot more complicated.

299
00:40:53,530 --> 00:41:03,570
So this kind of depicts. Transmission of TB, which looks a lot like other respiratory pathogens, except for, again,

300
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:15,480
TB lodges itself in the deeper into the lung where the sources and again through coughing or sneezing you can release.

301
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,910
Pathogens that are aerosolized into the air,

302
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:28,399
and these pathogens can survive in the air readily and result in exposing others

303
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,690
that inhaled the contaminated air and then as an infection can be established.

304
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:47,480
So. So who is transmitting people who have active TB that generate these droplet nuclei?

305
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,290
So nuclei, the droplets that are small, less than five microns.

306
00:41:53,060 --> 00:42:00,290
Through coughing, sneezing, shouting, singing and some of the center.

307
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:08,810
And one aspect of TB that has been appreciated for a little while now is how historically?

308
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,839
We viewed household transmission as being a primary source of transmission,

309
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,400
but now realizing and appreciating the fact that transmission in public spaces,

310
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:28,940
schools, workplaces, health care facilities is a much more important site of transmission than the household.

311
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:38,230
Again, because a household in certain areas in the world, household sizes can be bigger.

312
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,280
It can be like, you know, ten, 12, 14, 15 people.

313
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,310
And so there's much more there. And household transmission becomes more important in other areas where household

314
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:57,080
sizes are smaller and there's all household transmission as the last impact.

315
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:08,420
And in fact, in areas where the transmission of household size has gone from ten or greater down to four or five,

316
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:16,640
there's a lot of modeling studies that have shown that as an explanation for the decrease in TB in certain certain regions.

317
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:30,500
So when we think about controlling for TV, one huge areas of mitigation is decreasing contacts or reducing crowding.

318
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:42,290
This is where a lot of urban, dense urban areas, these informal settlements, urban slums,

319
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:49,400
have had been seeing increases that just because of the amount of crowding that they have.

320
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:58,010
So crowding is an important trends in the transmission and risk factor for transmission,

321
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:03,990
and reducing crowding is important to mitigation, reducing this duration of infectiousness.

322
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,140
Again, another area to improve.

323
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:14,000
So we do this by improving case detections and improving the quality of our diagnostics and treatment services.

324
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:20,210
Be able to identify and treat latent cases is an important part of that.

325
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,639
But also quickly,

326
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:31,190
anybody that's symptomatic to be able to identify those cases and treat those cases can reverse and reduce that duration of infectiousness.

327
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:38,450
Reducing susceptibility, which really is all about addressing co-morbidities,

328
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:44,550
is one of the big reasons why we saw an increase in TB in the eighties and nineties was that

329
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:53,040
it was a leading cause of death in many areas in Africa of those that are HIV infected.

330
00:44:53,050 --> 00:45:02,640
So the again, the HIV infection caused immunosuppression and made individuals susceptible to infections like TB,

331
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:07,380
which happened quite a bit and is still happening quite a bit.

332
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,600
But so TB becomes more opportunistic in that sense.

333
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:20,190
When people are more susceptible, they're more likely to be going from a latent infection to an active infection,

334
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:29,959
decreasing exposure, which is improving ventilation, infrastructural improvements.

335
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:36,180
And also we see this link between indoor air quality and TB and susceptibility to TB.

336
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:44,880
Tobacco smoking is susceptible to be TB. So decreasing exposure is another main area of control and then improving.

337
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:52,990
I go through prognosis and and decreased severity of TB would be things like improving nutrition,

338
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:59,440
which is going to be important for most many different pathogens, including TB.

339
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:11,790
So one day and here we're just going over this one out size outbreak in Hong Kong,

340
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:19,290
in this one residential area that showed provided evidence for airborne transmission in this one particular outbreak.

341
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:30,680
There was 187 cases in this outbreak. The index case was semi that was infected with SA's virus, never symptomatic with diarrhea.

342
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,700
They visited a particular apartment building at a particular two two time points.

343
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:47,010
And then subsequent cases of size were clustered in areas that in different buildings and floors that were predictive.

344
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,260
Based on airflow dynamics of the residential complex.

345
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:02,750
And so this was this is a big pictorial of the different that it could be this

346
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:10,129
apartment or apartment complex where the index case occurred in this building,

347
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:18,210
even middle level. And the air, the plume of, you know,

348
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:31,830
the return of that particles that these viruses were here to basically was predicted to be moving up the building and then out the building,

349
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:35,190
exposing and building.

350
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,830
DC and being. So.

351
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,960
We look at this in this context and we look at that.

352
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:56,540
So these are the same buildings. A through G building is where the initial case was in the index case.

353
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:05,599
And we saw this and there was this wind that was moving that moved the air in the airflow from again,

354
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,310
it was a building E and then out to expose these other buildings here.

355
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,639
And we can see that there were the most number of cases,

356
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:22,340
99 cases were in building E they were all all those cases were above not below where the index case was.

357
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:29,780
And then buildings DC B had 20, 25 and 21 cases respectively.

358
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:44,660
So and then when you looked at the risk with respect to where you were living relative to building E,

359
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:51,140
so these these units that were a B and a D within building.

360
00:48:52,980 --> 00:49:06,810
E You know, compared to lower floors and building e again, AB was 14.5 times greater at greater risk and a D was 3.86 times at greater risk.

361
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:17,520
And then when we looked at comparing building. The risk in buildings B, C and D, we see that these areas.

362
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:32,220
Around Brighton. This area had also had a higher relative risk 7.86 and 5.65, all located in this area right here.

363
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:44,060
So it was a good a nice example of an outbreak where we really clearly saw airborne transmission as a primary mode of transmission,

364
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:57,559
where the index case was in its building. We saw that as opposed to two cases in a unique and apt that were not in that airflow direction,

365
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:04,430
had much, much fewer cases than those that were in that in that area, in that line of airflow.

366
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,950
And these are the epidemic curves that were consistent with it being a common source

367
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:21,830
outbreak so that the source was the individual that contaminated the air within it,

368
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:30,590
contaminated the toilet within the one site, and then the air was carrying that contamination out.

369
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,120
So that was a common source outbreak.

370
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:45,350
And this basically summarizes the outbreak conditions so that aerosol concentration decayed as the plume traveled.

371
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:55,100
So that much higher risk in building these and other buildings and the concentration of viruses

372
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:01,910
in the respiratory secretions or is much lower than the urine in the stool explaining why.

373
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:08,720
Again, in this particular case, the primary mode of transmission was this aerosolization.

374
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:21,830
And so people see this as an classified SaaS, as an opportunistic pathogen, where airborne transmission was opportunistic,

375
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:31,129
it was all the right conditions which caused this one person to really it's one person to cause a 187 cases.

376
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:36,710
So that's an example of a superspreading event, but a situation in which,

377
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:44,930
as it normally occur that is normally the view is stars is droplet spread or fomites spread.

378
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,420
But in this situation it was airborne spread.

379
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:54,640
So again, kind of highlighting the fact that what is, you know,

380
00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:01,520
what the dominant mode of transmission is very much dependent on a setting and not just on the pathogen.

381
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:09,130
So. With that.

382
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:16,600
I wanted to jump to the discussion questions for today.

383
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:25,749
The first is the transmission of respiratory infection can occur through multiple pathways.

384
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:34,270
Airborne droplet contact fomite. Each has its own set of environmental barriers, provide a setting where each pathway will be dominant.

385
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:41,920
Why might your answers be different for different respiratory transmitted pathogens like influenza rhinovirus COVID 19?

386
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,160
Second, the different transmission pathways suggest distinct mitigation strategies.

387
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:55,450
Discussion of social distancing, masking cleaning and vaccine may play a role in both controlling transmission,

388
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,220
indoor and directly protecting those at high risk of severe disease.

389
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:09,730
And the last question is to think about how both tuberculosis and influenza are pathogens that have proven difficult to control.

390
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,880
Compare and contrast the challenges of controlling both of these pathogens.

391
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,790
Any questions or. Okay.

392
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:35,550
Hey, you're 15 minutes ahead of us.

393
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,330
Expected to launch this. So if.

394
00:53:46,380 --> 00:54:34,080
1.5 years ago, we were talking about 2020 meetings and now they're just saying, oh, my God, that's right.

395
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:53,010
I know, but what are you going to do different for personal reasons, of course.

396
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,080
Of course. Given the experience that Americans.

397
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:09,750
Oh, like children's screens, like stickers.

398
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,560
Yeah. Yeah. They always. That's a big one.

399
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:26,610
It's like when you're just like, let me explain why I'm here.

400
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,350
Okay? I want to research on the that.

401
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:55,720
Well, a little. I always had an airborne 3000000.

402
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:13,590
Okay. So it's like you're setting like a sports team or a subway like airborne environment.

403
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,580
Is it safe in the air sports event?

404
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:25,140
You will be able to hear that.

405
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:34,360
But I think an open event, he would still say what we need to be.

406
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:40,470
We are not related right now as well.

407
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:53,090
If this becomes like like you said, the influenza, right?

408
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:57,089
Yeah. So do droplets football.

409
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:25,260
Same guy at least try to make sure you are something that's going to be a situation like making evaporation really easy to help these people.

410
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:30,120
How would you differentiate between two things?

411
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:44,550
That was like something because I was just like, you know, you're so dirty person.

412
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:58,050
And so part of me is just like, are you just going to thinking that since you just like to wash your hands?

413
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:08,760
Like it's always like what we're talking about?

414
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,800
Gebru kind of.

415
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:25,170
What is the one thing I wish I could say to Anti-maskers like I also like they always say they always say like, Oh no, we're not hosting.

416
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:30,210
It's like, well, they also recommended handwashing. Is that are you just like a dirty person?

417
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,330
Do you just, like, not be taking care of themselves?

418
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:44,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

419
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:52,560
Show me the race. No, Dad. Excuse me.

420
00:58:53,830 --> 00:59:00,270
Get ready for another reason. I feel bad about being dumped, like.

421
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:07,410
Oh, my God.

422
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:25,410
I learned that it was just like, all right.

423
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:47,660
Yeah. So that's why I was there was like, I'm just going to say something like, Oh, I feel like there's a reservoir.

424
00:59:48,500 --> 01:00:07,580
And I say, Well, originally, I guess I like, like there's just one total life size.

425
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:21,950
It's because you're also seeing this person on the other side.

426
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,480
This isn't easy. Want to come on somebody, right?

427
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,480
Yeah. All right. I'm not going to party.

428
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:38,190
Maybe not, like, really? Not that. It doesn't take too long.

429
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:42,370
Although, like when I was in Kenya, I still don't know the.

430
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:48,000
Like good genes and other places are things you see.

431
01:00:48,490 --> 01:01:03,270
And I didn't want to terrify people, but a lot of people are like, Oh, I know what to say.

432
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,980
But you're just here now with spoiler alert after going inside.

433
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:16,469
Oh, you know what? Yeah, exactly. Like you become immune to it because it's shockingly.

434
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:27,959
See, is it? It's it's better than I can't do anything else about it because I see myself get part of this sort of thing happening where I can just,

435
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,580
like, really have a very uncomfortable prevent, not a joke.

436
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:42,300
It's a serious, serious. It's amazing to see with mental health easier.

437
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,910
It's easier to commit. Yeah. So I was like, it's like, oh my God.

438
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:56,020
And so many times, you know, getting me.

439
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:04,260
Yeah. I mean, I still think it's like I don't,

440
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:28,980
I don't think I do like me to go like we don't because I wait until you find out that you are because that can be so it could be brought on the war.

441
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:39,780
And it's like I'm like I think it's just continually becoming disconnected.

442
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:53,260
I posted to the next level, so I just kind of like, you know, it's actually the prime minister makes it a bad thing to prevent it.

443
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,180
Yeah, I realize we're going to have to talk about that in recent years,

444
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:16,380
but I think that was because of sexual harassment with everybody there, or including for his part.

445
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:24,480
Oh, well, I didn't know that. I felt like I got, like you said about money.

446
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:44,190
And I was like, I decided to take decades to create my own life.

447
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:56,010
So I didn't like something like that, you know?

448
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:02,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, exactly.

449
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,579
I mean, I'm probably not.

450
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:15,930
But in particular, I was very concerned about things like how I always do this.

451
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,880
I don't know, I got let's little credit card.

452
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,900
I feel like a born again.

453
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,000
They just think of anything but you.

454
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:52,170
Yeah. So yeah it's funny because there's so many of now have just like everybody I mean is just like text, you know?

455
01:04:52,450 --> 01:05:06,060
I mean, think about what it's like to go through airport security.

456
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:27,450
Yeah. I mean, I think, like, they have to be really, you know, getting ready for that.

457
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:40,810
Because I was like, he has a serious issue on me.

458
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:57,240
I know. I was like, just like, this is another one. And he's thinking, oh, yeah, like, well, let's start reporting back and start with Group one.

459
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:04,530
You know, you just remember when you just want to say number one.

460
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:11,070
Yeah, start with one. Okay. So we said that first Airborne,

461
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:21,990
specifically an environmental barrier would be like having good ventilation outside and good, good ventilation in the area.

462
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:25,050
That would be a barrier to airborne transmission.

463
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:31,440
And then that airborne transmission would be dominant and and impact indoor areas that have good ventilation.

464
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:38,340
For droplet, we said a high humidity would be a barrier because it would make the respiratory droplets

465
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:45,180
fall out of the air more quickly and that older or less humid environments would.

466
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:54,140
The where it was dominant or like densely packed areas also and for contact me we said that it would be dominant in.

467
01:06:55,140 --> 01:07:02,280
Daycare settings are places where people aren't practicing good hygiene like children.

468
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:09,450
And then for why there might be different.

469
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,209
Transmitted pathogens.

470
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:21,930
We said that each, like those pathogens, would probably each have a different amount of viral load that's necessary to infect a person.

471
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:28,049
And then also those three, like for example, we knew that, for example,

472
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:32,700
rhinovirus is more like it's very commonly spread through like contact with fomites,

473
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:38,130
whereas influenza and COVID are less commonly through like fomite contact.

474
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:43,620
And also it would depend on how deeply into the lungs the virus needs to be able to travel to infect.

475
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:47,900
Mm hmm. Yeah.

476
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:54,740
So the persistence of these viruses in the environment can change is going to be radically different.

477
01:07:56,450 --> 01:08:05,180
So the reason why it rhinoviruses for context is because it actually persists longer in the environment.

478
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:11,600
But what makes like that? What makes this setting important with respect to whether or not.

479
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:19,010
Let's say an influenza somewhere between COVID and rhinovirus with respect, with persistence.

480
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:25,250
What makes the setting so important with respect to whether or not cleaning the surface is going to be?

481
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:37,120
Important as opposed to whether. That is a clear question.

482
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:42,910
When you kind of answer to that, Ben. But just to be clear on.

483
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,620
Like, what's it like? Setting influenza might be more important.

484
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,020
Contact might be more important given that it doesn't persist.

485
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:58,160
Hospitals. I don't know. I guess I don't know. Like, I'm not totally sure.

486
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,059
Well, sort of like it. So a daycare centers, you go.

487
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:08,510
Aren't you going to be more concerned about cleaning potentially than you are in a work setting?

488
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:13,400
Maybe because of just like you said, it is not the greatest.

489
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,719
Kids are touching surfaces all the time and touching their eyes.

490
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,740
And now it's much, much more so.

491
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:29,979
It's so. What if you've been investing resources in cleaning act turns out to be not and simple thing to

492
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:35,770
do cleaning often enough and even if you taught to take care centers about cleaning it just.

493
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:44,590
Not something they can always feel like they can do. So you definitely want to kind of with all of these kind of mitigations,

494
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:50,620
you want to prioritize what you think are the most important because it's it's it's very resource intensive.

495
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:58,600
And to have somebody continually do something, they have to be, you know, it has to be motivated is being a critical piece.

496
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:06,340
So I think that that's. Where understanding dominant mode of transmission is important not to.

497
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:20,339
Good group to anything to add to. We talked more about how airborne might be more dominant in enclosed settings where

498
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:26,490
deletion is less likely to occur for like airborne emitted or aerosolized particles.

499
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:37,139
And so like the subway example or like even like a smaller classroom with a lot of people and there's less likely to have for dilution to be a factor.

500
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:42,150
And like there's more, a greater chance of like having the higher dosage to be infected.

501
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:48,690
And also, like ventilation is a factor with that. Whereas droplet I think is like.

502
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:53,070
Less reliant on that dilution factor because it's like.

503
01:10:55,240 --> 01:11:00,860
What's necessary is to be close enough so any crowded setting would work, right?

504
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:11,860
You don't necessarily need to have like the enclosed aspect for droplet transmission to be dominant and then for contact.

505
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:20,500
And so that's where you have like. The higher rate of touching and the daycare setting example.

506
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:24,680
So that was kind of what we added to that. Yeah.

507
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:37,100
Kids daycare settings have a big increase in daycare, saying it's really created this very ecological niche for pathogens to be very successful.

508
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,839
And it's going to. Yeah.

509
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,950
I think a key part of all of this is dose.

510
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:54,760
I don't know the phrase it dose makes the poison like it is something that people forget about a lot because it's so it's really about.

511
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:01,969
Decreasing that dose is what's so critical with respect to mitigation.

512
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:12,710
And even if you don't get down again to zero risk scenario, you are over the dose to lower the outgoing and there's going to be transmission.

513
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:19,360
So question for Teresa. Question two with group three.

514
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,260
INTERVIEWER Yeah, so we have that.

515
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,980
Looking at things like masking, masking. It's usually better for, you know, airborne and droplet, though.

516
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:41,920
Certainly it's still going to prevent fomites because if you're not expelling something, people can't pick it up later.

517
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:49,270
Where something like sanitation and cleaning is more structured towards reducing fomite transmission.

518
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,079
Different isolations can have different effects.

519
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:02,930
So if you're like grouping all of your isolated cases together, it's going to be pretty effective at reducing like maybe like larger spread airborne.

520
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:07,560
But if your isolated cases are only staying in like rooms and shared housing.

521
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:11,870
They might not reduce airborne as much, but it could still definitely prevent droplet.

522
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:19,609
And so my social distancing is really like specialized towards like droplet, especially most of the year.

523
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:23,740
Airports are going to travel further though to help with that as well. And flights.

524
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:28,219
Well, and then different parts of PPE have different strategies, I suppose.

525
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:31,820
Like so your gowns and your gloves are going to prevent Fomite pick up,

526
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:38,480
whereas like mask and eye covers are probably going to be more droplet and airborne are targeted.

527
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:47,720
Those were the focus. But yeah, I think that clarity on what you know what these different mitigation.

528
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,659
Transitions are important and often women communicate well.

529
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:55,450
So we're thinking, like you mentioned, mask or shield,

530
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:04,930
the shield is only going to prevent direct droplet spraying not airborne because it's not really protecting.

531
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,280
And same with the masks.

532
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:17,129
I mean that what the data shows surgical mask, unless you're wearing an N95 surgical mask too much better with the larger particles.

533
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:21,370
So the droplets much not as effective with the finer particles.

534
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:30,460
So how one what kinds of mask people use is is critical with respect to what they're trying to accomplish.

535
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:35,080
With respect to both respect respect to preventing.

536
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:46,290
He was an infectious person, releasing infectious particles and also protecting you from getting.

537
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:55,510
Exposed to infectious particles. Good group for anything that.

538
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:09,020
Personal question, too, a question.

539
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:12,469
Do you do so again? No, we don't have anything more to add.

540
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:15,480
I think every other thing you guys have got the same stuff.

541
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,500
And you said. Yeah.

542
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:26,500
And I just say and with the fact that I think it's the communication part we talked about as being really critical with.

543
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,430
Ghana gaining trust with respect to these things.

544
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,420
But also you can appreciate it's very complicated.

545
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:44,540
So it's really I think there's a lot more work to be done to how to be very clear on the fact that.

546
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:58,230
BS. What makes for a good set of mitigation strategies can change over time, and our understanding of it changes over time.

547
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:07,040
And that's where I. The dilemma of being a good communicator is it's difficult to have any common sense,

548
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:14,090
like a well seasoned epidemiologist on like issues with communication within the health care profession.

549
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:26,680
I think that a lot of it to me communicating the uncertainty is important.

550
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:35,480
I think there's a lot of people who don't agree with that, that communicating uncertainty makes for a muddle message.

551
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:42,290
But the problem with communicating with a story about something that you don't

552
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:47,300
really understand is that then you wind up retracting it and changing your mind.

553
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,649
And it sounds like you're waffling where, in fact, you are.

554
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:58,900
And you just. Said something a little too strong with respect to what is known.

555
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:07,660
And I and there is a tension because policymakers don't necessarily like to hear about the uncertainty in there.

556
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:14,920
But I think we I think there are ways to talk about the uncertainty in a way that is clear.

557
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:21,449
The messaging is clear and it's all about messaging. And I do. I repeat this over and over again.

558
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:26,310
But I think that we need experts in communication and we need these experts in

559
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:32,850
how people respond to messages to be on the in the table and at the table.

560
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:37,950
And we don't we have physicians at the table. We have microbiologists at the table.

561
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:48,480
And the more, you know, I continually argue for that and as people know their head, but they just think that the communication part is trivial.

562
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:54,630
And where in my mind communication is everything. Like we don't do microbiology.

563
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:59,700
So I think we have more.

564
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:06,540
Work to do to get that message across. But again, and this is the other thing I keep repeating.

565
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:17,430
If we teach students the importance of and we teach them about these aspects of public health, like communication instead,

566
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:26,069
then they're when they become leaders, they're more comfortable with that being an important piece because a lot.

567
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:28,890
And then. Things can change.

568
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:38,520
But if we if we have physicians and microbiologists and people that were trained in a very technical field, and then they move up into management.

569
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:46,570
They're not going to necessarily appreciate. It'll be a rare incident where they appreciate the importance of it.

570
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:57,400
So that's I guess that's my take on it. And that's jumped the last few minutes to the last question, group five.

571
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:14,230
So for tuberculosis, we touched on dependency on temperature and humidity, the crowding aspect of it, and how it can be typically poverty driven.

572
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:20,080
We noticed that was treatable, but often undiagnosed because of latency.

573
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:29,670
And then for influenza, we touched on the mutations and changes between seasons.

574
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:36,120
It also transmits and comets, common spaces, often really crowded spaces.

575
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:42,510
You also notice that immunity doesn't last very long and usually doesn't cover across strains.

576
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:46,630
So. Right.

577
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,900
So, you know, we have a vaccine for influenza that, you know, it works if you.

578
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:59,800
It only works if you take it every year. And it doesn't. And the effectiveness is varies depending on how well they can guess what the strains are.
