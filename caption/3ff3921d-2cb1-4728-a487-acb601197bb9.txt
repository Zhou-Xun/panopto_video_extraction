1
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:12,675
In this module, we're going to
discuss active transportation.

2
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:16,271
But let me ask you, when was the last
time that you walked or ran or

3
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:17,677
biked to get somewhere?

4
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:20,421
Maybe school, maybe work, maybe an errand.

5
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:23,834
For many of us, it's not so
common to get around that way, but

6
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,946
it turns out active transportation.

7
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:31,024
In other words, getting places under your
own power by walking or running or biking

8
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:36,039
is a great potential tool for us to fight
the issue of obesity in the United States.

9
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,904
I'm actually standing here in Ann Arbor
by the border to bordered trail which

10
00:00:39,904 --> 00:00:43,531
is an under construction trail that
will eventually go all the way across

11
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,861
Washtenaw County and
is specifically restricted to walking, and

12
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,060
running, and biking.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,788
I thought this would be an excellent
location to talk about active

14
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:52,884
transportation.

15
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:56,734
So active transportation is you getting
somewhere under your own power and we know

16
00:00:56,734 --> 00:01:00,526
from a public health perspective that we
want to encourage people to do this, but

17
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,073
how is the government
actually encouraging that??

18
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:04,712
Right now, you're looking at two graphs.

19
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:09,864
On the left is a graph of the expenditures
from the federal government on highways.

20
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:12,966
In other words,
encouraging people to use automobiles and

21
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:16,639
you can see those expenditures have
been going up steadily over time.

22
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:21,145
On that same graph, the line at the bottom
is federal expenditures on mass transit

23
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:25,021
and you'll see there that Mine has
been absolutely static over time.

24
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,327
So it would appear that the government
has historically been steering us towards

25
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:30,158
automobiles.

26
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:33,684
On the right graphic, we're looking
at how people actually get around.

27
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:36,330
So this is the modes of
transport that they use.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,372
And here, again,

29
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:42,139
you'll see that automobile transportation
has been steadily increasing over time.

30
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:46,375
Whereas things like use of public
transit have been flat and walking, and

31
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,053
bicycling have been
relatively flat as well.

32
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:52,034
And again,
this is reflective of a relative lack

33
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:56,553
of government priority on these forms
of transportation historically.

34
00:01:56,553 --> 00:02:00,921
The graph you're looking at here is
going to show you over time, actually,

35
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:06,145
from a period of 1985 to 2008, the obesity
rates by state in the United States.

36
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:10,006
So this starts in 1985 and
you'll notice the earlier images

37
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,591
in the graphic tend to show a lot
of light blue and dark blue.

38
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,710
These are lower prevalence
rates of obesity.

39
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,515
But about the year 2000, we start to
see states pop-up that are red or

40
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:26,262
even dark red indicating that now over
one in five or perhaps even one in.

41
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:30,096
Three or more people in certain
states tend to be obese.

42
00:02:30,096 --> 00:02:33,126
So this is an epidemic that's
been observed around the world,

43
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:34,383
this growth of obesity and

44
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:38,114
this is something that we in public
health have a responsibility to counter.

45
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:40,797
And ideally, it reverse.

46
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:44,679
Here's a graphic drawn from a study that
was looking at the relationship between

47
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,802
obesity and asthma, and the environment.

48
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:49,654
We're going to focus in on
the obesity bit,specifically and

49
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,944
that's the right hand
upper side of the graph.

50
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:54,222
So if you start at the top of the graph,

51
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:58,869
it's probably not news to you that there
are genetic influences on obesity.

52
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:03,661
It may be news to you that being
obese can also in turn influence your

53
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:04,952
genetics again.

54
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:09,072
It's probably also not news to
you that physical activity or

55
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:13,130
specifically a sedentary
lifestyle is linked to obesity.

56
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,607
But if we get down to the bottom of
the graph, you'll see there's things

57
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:20,714
like the built environment and the social
environment that also influence obesity.

58
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:24,233
So what is it about the built environment
that might influence your likelihood of

59
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,018
becoming obese?

60
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:29,857
Well, it could be the safety and access
to places where you can be outside and

61
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:32,286
not have concerns about your safety.

62
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:36,998
It's things like how land use is
determined and how much access you have to

63
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:41,645
active transportation routes and
infrastructure like the trail here.

64
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:46,241
In terms of the social environment, we
also have things like cultural norms and

65
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,683
social expectations and

66
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:52,358
other social factors that can absolutely
put you more or less at risk of obesity.

67
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,010
So it's a complex situation here.

68
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,736
But there is again, a clear link
between the built environment and

69
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,609
your likelihood of being obese.

70
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:00,485
As a scientist,

71
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:04,615
I'm interested in approaches that we can
take to rate the built environment in

72
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,695
terms of how likely it is to
encourage physical activity.

73
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:12,169
So some of the factors we might look at
include things like population density,

74
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,103
the mixture of land use in an area,

75
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:17,941
access to recreational facilities
like the park were standing in.

76
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:22,814
Street patterns availability of sidewalk,
vehicular traffic, crime,

77
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:26,461
of course, public transit greenness and
vegetation.

78
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,011
In fact, there are many,

79
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:32,387
many things that we could look at that
could linked to physical activity.

80
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:36,507
Here's an example of a study that looked
at the relationship between obesity and

81
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:38,576
built environment for all 50 states.

82
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:41,703
And so these researchers looked
at built environment and

83
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:46,328
created an index basically than included
things like access to sidewalks or walking

84
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:51,084
paths, access to parks and playgrounds,
recreation centers, community centers,

85
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:55,080
libraries, other areas that people
might want to walk to and gather at.

86
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,727
So the graph on the left here is showing
the prevalence of obese children for

87
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:02,176
each of the 50 states shown in green.

88
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:06,128
And on the x-axis or the bottom of
the graph is a built environment index,

89
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:07,551
the lowest numbers here.

90
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:11,678
Meaning, it's not a very friendly built
environment in terms of walking or

91
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,656
other active transport
higher numbers being better.

92
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:18,776
So here, we see a very strong linear
relationship where the states with

93
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,760
the best built environment index
have the lowest prevalence rate for

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,765
obesity in children on the right.

95
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:26,785
We're looking at the same
format of graph here.

96
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,636
We're looking at overweight children.

97
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:31,716
And so in red here are again,
the 50 states and

98
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:36,567
we see the the same linear relationship
where states with the better or more

99
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:42,038
desirable built environment index have
lower prevalence of overweight children.

100
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,889
Here's a different example of a study
that looked at many different factors at

101
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,950
the national level.

102
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,088
So here, you'll see a pattern of six maps.

103
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:53,459
Each of which has counties outlined in
the counties are color coded according to

104
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,642
different factors.

105
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:59,251
So some of these maps shown here,
show things like racial heterogeneity and

106
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:00,196
poverty rate.

107
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:02,298
Both very interesting for public health.

108
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,841
But specific to the built environment,

109
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,758
some of these maps show
street connectivity or

110
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:11,870
the walk score at the county level or
the food environment which,

111
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,622
of course is a factor in obesity and
whether a county is more urban or rural.

112
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:19,754
So keeping at the national level here,
we could look at other examples.

113
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,546
The graph on the left here shows
the average walk score for

114
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:28,445
different types of areas where people
live from large central metro areas

115
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:31,701
all the way out to non-core or
more rural areas.

116
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:36,387
And so you can see here, there's a very
strong trend where large central m etro

117
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:40,942
areas have a much higher walk score
than areas that are slightly less dense.

118
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,574
And once we get out to the least density,
these non-core areas,

119
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:46,368
we have the lowest walk scores.

120
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:48,355
The graph on the right is showing for

121
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:51,545
those same types of areas
people live two colors of bars.

122
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,513
Yellow is the average
physical inactivity rate.

123
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:57,354
So we want this number to
be as low as possible and

124
00:06:57,354 --> 00:06:59,708
blues shows the average obesity rate.

125
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,790
So again,
focusing in on large central metro areas.

126
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,521
We see they have the lowest average
physical inactivity rate and

127
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,812
also the lowest average obesity rate.

128
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:12,445
And again, if we go out to the right
those non-core areas here,

129
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:17,172
we see the highest obesity rate and the
highest average physical inactivity rate.

130
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:20,520
So I do want to highlight the relationship
between the built environment and

131
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,624
active transport and
obesity is complicated.

132
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:25,988
There's many other factors at play,
but there is at this

133
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:30,265
point a rich body of evidence directly
linking the built environment and

134
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:33,225
opportunities for
active transport to obesity.

135
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:34,876
I'll give you a more local example here.

136
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:37,232
This is from the city of Portland, Oregon.

137
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:41,182
So Portland has invested
heavily in increasing access to

138
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:44,153
active transportation infrastructure.

139
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:48,334
And so the graph on the left here is
showing the number of bicycle lane miles

140
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,492
available for people to bicycle on and

141
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:54,957
then also the growth in the number of
people who are using those bicycle lanes.

142
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:58,505
And you'll see the two are highly
correlated here which is another way of

143
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:01,823
saying maybe if you build active
transportation infrastructure,

144
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:04,905
people will come and use it and
we can also look at other examples

145
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,437
of infrastructure changes
that Portland is made.

146
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:10,957
So the image on the right here shows
up before and after situation for

147
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:15,037
a particular intersection before this
is a very heavily focused on automobile

148
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,016
traffic intersection after though,

149
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:21,245
you can see they've done a number of
things they've signalized intersection.

150
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:24,774
So now, cars have to stop when
someone needs to cross the street.

151
00:08:24,774 --> 00:08:28,762
They've introduced a white lane for
pedestrians to cross and a green lane for

152
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:29,988
bicycles to cross, and

153
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:34,427
they've also introduced things like share
rows on the asphalt to indicate two cars.

154
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:35,622
Hey, you should expect that.

155
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:37,488
There will be bicycles here and

156
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:41,725
you'll also see that they've
introduced lights, specifically for

157
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:46,193
pedestrians and bicyclists independent
of the lights for automobiles.

158
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,385
So there are many ways that we can
encourage people to participate in

159
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,337
active transport.

160
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:53,802
We can make walking more accessible and
enjoyable.

161
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:56,939
We can introduce shared facilities
like shared bicycles and

162
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:59,346
we can make mass transit available,
as well.

163
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:03,724
Mass transit is especially nice because
it's good for getting longer distances,

164
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:07,350
but people still have to actively
move themselves to get to the stop to

165
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,621
catch the mass transit in the first place.

166
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:12,103
Finally, I want to highlight
that in many cases,

167
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,978
we've had good natural experiments
that give us opportunities to evaluate

168
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:19,443
the impacts of policy changes on
built environment and on obesity.

169
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:21,341
What do I mean by a natural experiment?

170
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:25,879
Well, let's say there's a particular area
that has quite poor active transportation

171
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,439
options.

172
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,963
But through redevelopment,
these options are reintroduced.

173
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:31,917
Now, we have sort of the control
period as the baseline.

174
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,706
And then after the options or
amenities are introduced,,

175
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:36,340
we can see what changes occurred.

176
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,282
We do have a pretty large body of
literature now that says, People will use

177
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:43,988
non automobile Transportation when
it's made accessible to them.

178
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:47,060
So again, if we build it they will use it.

179
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,722
We also know that infrastructure changes
things like building these trails tend

180
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:56,604
to have stronger impacts than policy or
more behaviorally focused interventions.

181
00:09:56,604 --> 00:10:00,863
Finally, we do need longer term studies
to better evaluate the impact of these

182
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:04,425
changes and understand exactly
what works and how well it works.

183
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:08,583
But I do want to highlight that amenities
like this, border to border trail have

184
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,859
been demonstrated to add to
improve people's likelihood and

185
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:15,240
their actual use of active
transportation to get around.

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,360
And again,
that can have huge implications for

187
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
improving public health
by reducing obesity.
