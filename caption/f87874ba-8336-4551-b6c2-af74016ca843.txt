1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,200
I know it somehow. I know.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,710
Okay. Why don't we go ahead and get started? I think I'm going to embarrass myself even one more time.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,180
So it's starting right at 330.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,960
Is that a problem? Okay.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,460
You're used to faculty doing that, starting out. All right.

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,370
So I want to mention a few things and tell you what I was planning to do during this session.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:48,540
First of all, last time I left about an hour ago, I think 40 out of the 50 people in the class had filled out the introduction discussion thread.

8
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,360
I, I read through all those.

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:01:04,660
I greatly appreciated it in doing that and I'm always amazed at the diversity and the experience that some of these classes have.

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:11,910
So that was helpful to me. And there's ten or less of you that didn't do this.

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,260
It would be helpful if you could do the introduction discussion credits.

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,580
It's not, um, it doesn't have to do with your grade.

13
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,620
It just has to do with, I think, my better understanding of who's in the class and what things you're most interested in.

14
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:36,900
Okay. So what I thought we would do is in a minute is to start talking about the case study.

15
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:45,390
Um, because I prefer to devote a lot of time to give and take discussion among us.

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,570
I wanted to point out a couple of things, though.

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,060
One is, as you're probably aware,

18
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:08,070
I didn't do my the beginning of my introduction to occupational and environmental diseases as previous the previous time we met.

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,410
I don't know if anyone looked at this,

20
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:20,430
but you see where it says causation part one here and it says that 2515 to the end to see the lecture you missed,

21
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,010
which I don't think we're going to have time to do today.

22
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:35,520
If you start at the beginning of that, up to 2515 is what you might have expected to hear me talk about in terms of sort of background.

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,440
So you actually you actually should look at that because on the quiz that I'll come to an amount in a moment,

24
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:54,120
there's probably at least a couple of questions that are about what happens in the first 25 minutes of causation.

25
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:07,530
Part one, causation. Part two, I think we're going to end up covering that in person after we talk a bit more about the EPA studies.

26
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,639
And if we don't get to it, I'll come back to that.

27
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:23,580
So that's that's sort of what the plan is, is number one has is going to be available at exactly 5:00 this afternoon.

28
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,420
And so you can you can go ahead and look at that as soon as class is over.

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,780
And it does include questions that have to do with the introductory lecture and what we're going to talk about here and causality as well.

30
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,100
Now, I guess I don't know if I should go over this again.

31
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,290
I think I already did. Just remember with these quizzes, I'll say it again.

32
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:00,750
I may have said it last time. So the idea behind those quizzes is to help you make sure that you understood the information

33
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,510
that was in in the whatever the presentations were in this case today and the first class.

34
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,510
And and just to go over this again.

35
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:27,870
So you take the quiz and then you get to look and see if there's any of the quiz questions that it's saying, you know, you gave the wrong answer.

36
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,250
I think many of you may have none of those. If you see that,

37
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:43,380
you have the opportunity then to take the quiz a second time and change your answer where it says no answers below and just trying to make it easy.

38
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,120
Let's try to make it easy for you to know whether you paid attention to the right things during presentations or lectures,

39
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,000
but to make sure most people are able to do a good grade at it and everything.

40
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,720
And if you when you look at it, you'll. See, it says when you're given a fair amount of time and it says when you need to send the cookies back,

41
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,620
and if you don't send it back in that time, you'll lose half of your your measure.

42
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,830
And if you go farther than that, you won't be able to turn the quiz.

43
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,580
So please take a look at that. I think it's I'm forgetting already.

44
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,320
I think it's like a week from Thursday is when it's due.

45
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,850
That's sort of what typically I try to do is give it a little bit more than a week.

46
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:47,880
All right. So. And then the other thing you could do for session three is you could watch the film.

47
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,150
Island is as fast as silicon and cold, and that might save us some time when we when we get to that.

48
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:08,170
In the next session. All right. So having said all that, what I'd like to do is talk about the EPA discussion activities.

49
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:18,130
And first of all, I would before we get to the content, I regret any problems people had with the software.

50
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,270
I am new to the software, but I know most of you are.

51
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,020
Any issues that came up. Are. You're all fine. Okay, great.

52
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:41,230
I'm wondering if somebody would be willing to start a discussion about what they had to say about that.

53
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,880
I guess question number one. Right. Which was.

54
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:03,570
Mitch was looking at what you thought about the situation at the EPA after reading the New Yorker article,

55
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,510
some are willing to say what they thought after they finished the New Yorker article.

56
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,600
Anyone? Nobody wants to touch that.

57
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:28,660
Okay. Well, I guess I could ask questions, but you answered most of these questions already.

58
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:35,560
So that was. Hello.

59
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,170
Yeah, go ahead. Thank you. When I read The New Yorker on, I mean,

60
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:48,500
it seemed like it started out by showing us the dangers and then moving into saying some things about the counterpoints from the industry.

61
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,579
In a sense, the end, the kind of left with her kind of feeling like I mean, in my mind I feel like, okay, there's health problems.

62
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,280
That seems pretty clear. But then they're just like, how do we do? And we go forward because we need flame retardants and things.

63
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,669
I mean, I personally kind of felt like, did we need some of the stuff that we produced necessarily?

64
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,909
Like, I don't know. Sure. Like what the process was that brought it into being per se.

65
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:17,299
Like it just kind of made it sound like some people in industry were saying like it's necessary for job growth or things like that.

66
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:25,070
And you know, I kind of wondered like if some of the means by which we produce these were that necessary in the first place, but how they got used.

67
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,100
But, you know, in the end, it kind of gave me a feeling of like, well, we don't have to do this.

68
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,230
We can't really stop people from making this stuff. Okay.

69
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:40,320
That's kind of how I felt. I guess it sounds like a reasonable reaction.

70
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:49,060
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I think they were also wondering more about like why we need to have the things that use these like chemicals in them.

71
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:55,360
And one of the things I thought back to is I know a few of us were in exposure to science last year, 601,

72
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,639
which in that class we talked about flame retardants and the chemical that they use

73
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,210
for a lot of flame retardants only like make something burn like 2 seconds left.

74
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,100
Like it takes like 2 seconds longer for it to burn than other things.

75
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,579
So that there's a question also like how valuable even are the flame retardants when

76
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,709
they're causing all these other issues like maybe that 10 seconds and slightly helpful,

77
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,630
but how much is that actually helpful for us? So okay.

78
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,610
Are there other reactions or thoughts about the New Yorker article?

79
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:41,180
So I think now I'm forgetting what's in which one.

80
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,880
But I think the New Yorker article did talk a fair amount about that.

81
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:55,400
BPA is a big industry, right? There's a huge amount of money involved with the use of BPA and all these plastics and so on.

82
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:10,190
And and I know in a couple of places, people have mentioned that they don't consider studies that have been done by the industry.

83
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,300
They may not. They may not essentially believe them.

84
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,830
So, you know, they always said, hey, there's not much of a problem.

85
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:25,819
And then there's all these other studies where the strong majority that are being done, you know, maybe by the government,

86
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:35,480
but probably mostly by people at different universities and so on, saying that we found a number of different problems to be concerned about.

87
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:45,040
And I'm wondering if anyone thought about that or want to comment on that or if it sort of fits in with the question you were raising about,

88
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:52,580
well, let. What is what is reasonable to do and what isn't reasonable to do.

89
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:01,040
And in this case, you're in a situation where there's we know that there's a huge amount of money involved with it,

90
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,460
which often makes it more difficult to come to answers on these.

91
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,400
Maybe you wouldn't want to pick up on that.

92
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,510
But you thought about that. Yeah.

93
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,930
Chris, I can't remember which article this was from,

94
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:25,979
but it was talking about how the industries that I think is the Newsweek article actually talking about how the

95
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:34,290
industries that fund the studies to show how BPA is safe for use are the ones that benefit the most from it.

96
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:43,199
So they're trying to make it so that BPA is safe for use, but or they would try to use vapes,

97
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,899
I think, or the other type of mRNA as an alternative, but it's like equally toxic.

98
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,680
So there's not much room for alternative, at least in these options.

99
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,470
Right. Okay.

100
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:11,500
So. It's interesting because you know that industry groups tend to be very organized about these issues.

101
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:19,900
And if they want something to be able to be used, continue to be used, they will fund studies.

102
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:25,749
And lo and behold, without making any pejorative statements.

103
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:33,100
But lo and behold, somehow those studies into almost always come out with the result of we didn't see any

104
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,580
really important or meaningful adverse effects of using this right in the product.

105
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,860
And I guess I mentioned this before, but I forget what the number was, but it wasn't it.

106
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,110
There was a count somewhere else, I think, in the second one that said,

107
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:57,910
like over 90% of the studies that were done that were not funded by industry found problems of one kind or another.

108
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,210
Right. Does anyone have anyone have a brilliant idea of how to deal with this situation?

109
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,460
You have to be really brilliant because it's not easy to figure out how to deal with it.

110
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:21,709
Yeah. That's like kind of one of the fundamental issues with like science communication is like, rarely does everyone agree on anything,

111
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,030
but the industry is able to present this like united front where something is definitely safe.

112
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:32,900
Whereas researchers often take a much more nuanced take on who would say for when it's safe and what doses.

113
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,070
Right. It makes sense, to be sure.

114
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,370
I feel too like there's so much complexity to it that it does benefit whoever just keeps making this stuff.

115
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:50,680
Because like in the article, it said Who was the director of the National Toxicology Program says,

116
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,480
I know very little science where you will get 100% certainty.

117
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,450
So it's almost like because things are so complicated and there's so many people involved and there's just so many

118
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:07,190
factors that it almost it almost benefits the industry because your average person's going to be lost or confused,

119
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,430
or even people trying to do research can say, well, if these research maybe you don't trust us or do we trust any research?

120
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,710
And so then you probably just left the status quo.

121
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:23,690
So it just seems like there's since there's so much ability to make doubt or confusion, it kind of helps industry in the sense.

122
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,650
Right. Okay.

123
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:40,559
So, you know, the the people that are in the best position to look at this and say, well, overall, I look at the epidemiologic literature.

124
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:50,830
If I look at the animal studies and so on, what would I say are the problems we've been seeing repeatedly or that haven't been addressed adequately?

125
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:02,800
I think us in this room are the people that need to look at studies and have the, you know,

126
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:08,259
know how to look at studies very carefully and how to decide whether study was done

127
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:14,260
well or not and whether you actually can believe what the outcomes were and so on.

128
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,319
I'm saying I agree 100% that average person could be able to do anything like that.

129
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,350
But I think a lot of us in this room,

130
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,340
many of us may already feel like we know how to do that quite well or pretty well for most studies they would look at.

131
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:38,170
And I'm guessing by the time you finish up all your time at the university,

132
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,890
you'll feel that much more strongly like I'm I'm one of the people that knows how to read the literature and decide,

133
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,720
you know, come to a reasonable decision about is this outcome believable?

134
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,040
Does it fit? Well, you're going to know all my biases anyway.

135
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:05,290
I don't know if they're biases, but yeah, the approach that you see from industry very much,

136
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:12,009
obviously there's a lot of money involved and large industries are going to

137
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,080
have a lot of money they can spend on this and they can hire good scientists.

138
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,600
But the question is someone agrees to do that.

139
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,720
Are they going to be feeling a lot of pressure of one way or another, you know?

140
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,020
The person is paying me to do this. I know what what result they want.

141
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,300
I'm talking about industry, right?

142
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:53,350
And, yeah, I mean, so my bias or whatever is, in fact, industry is, is who sponsored a study and it says that there isn't a problem.

143
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:59,380
I personally am telling you, from all my experience these years, I tend to be completely dismissive.

144
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,590
I'm saying it was funded by industry.

145
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:09,140
You've got you don't know sort of what's going on behind the doors and how it got to sit there and.

146
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,290
And when I when I look at the literature, I'm not the only one that does something.

147
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,370
A lot of these committees that look at this kind of literature.

148
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:29,340
And, you know, as I look at what maybe NIH came out with or nice came out with, you know, look at that kind of thing and look at,

149
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:38,460
you know, people that are typically, you know, at universities are professors or other people like that.

150
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:48,060
And they're carrying out these studies and, you know, the quality of studies that they do and explanations tend to be much stronger.

151
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,540
But what is really I mean, it's obvious, but what's really interesting here is, you know,

152
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:03,840
the amount of data about this saying here's all these paper studies, a whole series of them that have been funded by industries using BPA.

153
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:13,650
And, you know, maybe it's one or 2% say that they find a problem and the other 98 or 99 don't seem to find such a problem.

154
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:21,600
Whereas, you know, if you look at studies are done, funded other ways for this particular case,

155
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:28,320
you know, it's probably least 80% are finding problems, maybe closer to 90% of the time.

156
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,090
And the question is, you know, who are you going to believe and why do you believe them?

157
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,870
Right. Other comments about this.

158
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,810
Yeah. So our industry is industry research published and academic journals.

159
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,420
And if so, are they required to disclose conflicts of interest?

160
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,420
Yeah, they frequently are in in journals like that and yeah,

161
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:02,610
they have to they have they're supposed to have a few sentences in there explaining where the funding came from to do this,

162
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:06,950
because that's potentially they're probably not going to describe it as a conflict of interest.

163
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,770
But most journals are going to require that you explain where the funding comes from,

164
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:21,990
because the editors of those journals for what we're dealing with now that this is particularly this is a big issue.

165
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:29,110
It's like. I mean, you hear me saying that you might not agree with me, but what I'm saying, you're saying,

166
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:37,450
I guess several times is that if you before you even looked at a study carefully,

167
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:46,629
if you see that it was funded by an industry that is using whatever the agent is, the agent in question,

168
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:55,990
whether it's causing adverse effects in humans and maybe wildlife, other places as well, that if that is the finding is from those industries.

169
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:03,640
You know, most people look at that and say, well, that may be what they say, but I don't know what to believe it.

170
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:10,030
And I don't even know whether to believe their description of exactly what they did is actually accurate.

171
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:16,389
The, you know, the kind of thing where, okay, we did this, this and this and we saw a problem.

172
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,080
But look, we did a fourth way and it all looks good now.

173
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,220
It doesn't look like BP is causing any problem. Guess which one?

174
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,540
The people that are funding you would like to see it publish. It's that kind of issue, right?

175
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,550
Okay? Yeah. Please give me some kind of problem with.

176
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,620
Government agencies is choosing to not use any research that's funded by industry.

177
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,170
Is there a problem with that? So I think.

178
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:04,630
I think it usually doesn't happen is because, you know, industry isn't just funding studies if it's going to involve a lot of money.

179
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:16,030
They're also trying to put pressure on. Yeah, whichever whichever governmental agency is responsible for the product they're talking about.

180
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:31,600
Right. And. So I think in practice what happens is things do get published and you know, some interesting I forget an exact title of the book,

181
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:39,430
but it's so interesting books that talk about industry say what is the title?

182
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,749
This is terrible.

183
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:49,150
I should remember it, especially because it's somebody I look like personally forgetting that I'm forgetting the title at the moment.

184
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:57,970
But it's essentially saying and causing doubt because that's that's what we're trying to do.

185
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:05,649
That's that's our business coming from industry side, you know, raising raising questions.

186
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,870
So you're not sure that there's really a problem here or trying to make an argument that there is no problem.

187
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,080
Right. And. I admit I don't have any.

188
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:24,270
This is the opposite of disclosure. I admit I don't think I have any stocks in chemical companies.

189
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,500
Not that I carefully planned it that way, but I don't think I have any.

190
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:37,410
So I just wanted to warn you about that. I do have some stocks, but I don't think I think none of them are far from capital properties.

191
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:44,429
The best of my knowledge, and I understand the issues obviously with industry funding things,

192
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,889
but then there's also kind of this like idea that the burden should be on them to prove that something is safe.

193
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,760
Like I look at the EU regulations that it's like right now,

194
00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:02,420
they have to prove that a chemical is safe and can be used in a safe manner in order to be unsafe for the EU.

195
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,959
So on one hand, it makes sense that the money and everything should it should be coming from that

196
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,040
company to prove that it is safe instead of like asking taxpayers to fund that.

197
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:21,030
But I think also the EU has that piece of it's not available on the market until they can prove it's safe sort of thing.

198
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:27,900
But I'm also wondering how that works in actual practice. I like the idea of the policy is great, but I'm not sure.

199
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,790
But it's great that you brought this up.

200
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:43,530
I think that's a good point. So, you know, with that, I guess it's even now, but with the BPA, you know, you have the US FDA saying,

201
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,220
well, there's been all these studies, but we think it's okay, you can go ahead and do this.

202
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,549
And I think they may have changed a little bit,

203
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:58,740
but certainly at the time the the EU was saying we've looked at all this literature and we don't think it's safe.

204
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:04,320
So they were not agreeing with each other, which I think is part of what you're pointing out.

205
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:15,690
And there's always I mean. There's always issues, political issues, I think, for all of these things.

206
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:22,860
And, you know, I don't probably we shouldn't get into politics with a capital T here, but, you know,

207
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:29,730
there's tends to be a pretty big difference in the two major parties in the United States about how they look at this as well.

208
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:38,250
I mean, it's not universal or anything, but it's, you know, how much sway is industry going to have in this?

209
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,330
So it depends on. You know what?

210
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,130
All these people that have been elected are pushing for or not pushing for.

211
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,270
You know, which at the FDA rules say something need to change or not.

212
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,170
I think those are all good points.

213
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:10,660
And the other thing, I don't know how many of you bothered to look at this, but I just I just want to add that maybe stating the obvious that it's.

214
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:29,410
To do this is. So this is a very nicely written study and thoughtful and so on from us to to people from University of Washington.

215
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:38,820
But what. The part I was most interested in was this where you got here's the Farghalli

216
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,340
for BPA and these are some of the substitutes that have been put forward.

217
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:54,930
And of course, you'll notice that, yes, there's differences, but there's a lot of similarities in in the molecules.

218
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:04,710
And so the other thing that I guess there's been a lot, but it's hard to know what can be done about it.

219
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,160
I mean, you've all seen the things that say BPA free or something like that on it.

220
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:19,230
You know that there's no BPA in it, but you know, you still have this plastic that's very flexible and easier to see through and everything.

221
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,380
That's part of the reasons that people are using it.

222
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:29,610
And so what happens is, you know, you've got to think there's more than this, but you've got,

223
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:35,940
you know, five different agents that are different that look pretty similar to BPA.

224
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:48,030
And I think I understand what happened here is like I know it's telling that people are making you can't put theirs in BPA on it.

225
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,910
It's true. There isn't if they know if they didn't use any.

226
00:26:51,570 --> 00:27:02,670
But it's actually, I think, very problematic and they touch on this a little bit because there's disagreement.

227
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:08,909
But there's a long track record of lots of different studies, both epidemiologic studies of people,

228
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:17,940
as well as animal studies saying some of these studies are many of these studies saying there may be a lot of concerning issues with BPA.

229
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:27,900
And so so if you still want to sell your product, you say, okay, I'll take the BPA out of it and say it's BPA free.

230
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,940
And but you had to put something else that has a similar structure in it to get the the qualities that you got from the BPA.

231
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,260
And now you have an agent that there's no data on or almost no data.

232
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,120
And it may be much more potentially more toxic than BPA.

233
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:53,670
I don't know either. It's like this. Digby Hey, all those bromides on there make me nervous just looking at it, right?

234
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:07,590
So of course you can't you can't tell people that manufacturing things, you take out the BPA, but don't don't say that you took it out.

235
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,010
Of course, you can put it's BPA free if it is that.

236
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:19,740
Yeah, I think it's it's put us in a much more difficult situation because we don't have we don't have as much data on all of these.

237
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,560
And it was it would take quite a while to have as much issue as we have on BPA at this point.

238
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:32,490
So that's a that's another problematic aspect of it, that it's hard to know what to do with it.

239
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,050
But I. All right.

240
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,980
So. I don't know.

241
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,700
There are other. Well, there's a lot of issues people brought up, I know, from having fun material things.

242
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:56,690
But there are other issues we haven't talked about in the last 20 or 30 minutes that anyone else would like to bring up or say.

243
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,760
But I also think this is important. What other ideas? Yeah.

244
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:10,490
Chris, thank. It's unfortunate that a lot of this falls back onto the consumer and it's like

245
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,889
something that becomes the consumer's responsibility because of higher duties,

246
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:23,299
a lot more complicated and art being being done right or ethically.

247
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:29,450
But I think this is why it's so important to inform people about labeling.

248
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,419
This goes like more so for nutrition.

249
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:40,070
I think that's where it started out is like telling people that just because something says it's like like the word natural doesn't mean anything.

250
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,170
And just because something says like non fat doesn't mean it's better for you.

251
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:56,990
I think basically saying it, it would be at least helpful for people to understand it just because something says it's BPA free.

252
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,370
If it's plastic, that doesn't mean a whole lot, you know?

253
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,560
And so if you're. And making an effort to avoid plastics.

254
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,420
You should probably just avoid plastic, you know, taking care of it,

255
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:27,920
especially because industry will come up with these labels and advertise this way and then charge you more like you're getting the same product,

256
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,290
you be exposed to the same things or the same toxic elements as anyone else.

257
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,580
And then, you know, that makes me extra upset because now I'm missing out on money.

258
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:45,880
So I really think it's important to empower consumers by educating them and.

259
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:54,050
I mean, that that makes a lot of sense for sure what you're saying.

260
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,860
On the other hand, your average consumer, you know,

261
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:08,060
they're not going to have the educational background and interest and understanding of this to draw their own conclusions,

262
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,840
which is why I mean, that's that's part of why we have things like NAFTA.

263
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:21,680
But I guess we're talking or at least you're hearing me talk about, well, we have it, but do they do they?

264
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,340
And about the science. It's a lot of pressure.

265
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,030
It's put on by industry. Yeah, please.

266
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:36,060
I think even if you are are able to educate people about the risks of BPA, um, that's not really going to change your behavior.

267
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,350
I mean, we've known for a long time now that cigarets are bad for you, right?

268
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:45,200
That there is a risk of lung cancer and things of that nature, but people still smoke cigarets so I wonder,

269
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,630
even if you could educate people, if they would be willing to give up those products that contain BPA.

270
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:57,090
She's. Yeah. Well, well, at least they don't have something that is.

271
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:04,250
Granted. Yeah. Tobacco's full of things that will make you want to smoke it again.

272
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,520
Right. That's. But yeah, I would.

273
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:13,200
Water bottles, you know. Yeah. Plastic water bottles are handy, I think.

274
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:25,190
So as you're not worried about this kind of thing. Actually, I took I took my a half and half, which I shouldn't be as it began with right for coffee.

275
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,960
And I put it into a plastic bottle because it would pour more easily.

276
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,750
Okay. Here I sat up here talking about this.

277
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:38,120
That's what I just did, that I did look carefully to see whether it was BPA free.

278
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,390
But of course, I also knew that that would mean anything.

279
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,490
I mean, it is something else, but as it's.

280
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,680
These are difficult problems, for sure. Other thoughts about this.

281
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,730
Here's a question for you. You may have already known a lot about this before you read these two articles.

282
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:09,330
But is there anybody in the room, he says, who decided, you know what,

283
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:14,309
I'm going to work much harder on staying away, doing the opposite of what I just said.

284
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:19,740
Stay away from plastics because there's a lot of chemicals in me.

285
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:25,350
And then these chemicals might end up in the fluid that's in there, what you're drinking and so on.

286
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:33,480
Was there anyone who said, after you read this, I think I'm going to, you know, use other containers, that plastic.

287
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,500
It may have that kind of reaction. No, it's too convenient.

288
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,370
I mean, I clearly didn't, but my older sister just had a baby.

289
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,430
And when she was pregnant, she, like, threw away all her plastic stuff.

290
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:52,650
She did. I don't. That's good.

291
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,569
Yeah, I thought about that. But then, you know, you think about it, it's very pervasive.

292
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,860
So, I mean, if if you want to switch, like, what are your other options, practically speaking, something.

293
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,810
Yeah, well, you've had a medal and have a medal like cater for make sure there's no lead, arsenic, etc.

294
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,150
Is there a way that. Yeah, you could do that?

295
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:25,530
I can do glass. I mean, with most types of glass, you know, things won't leak out of the glass the way it leaks out of the plastic.

296
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:35,010
So you're like much less likely to run into this because you might cut yourself when you drop it or something, but.

297
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,500
Yeah, I mean, I. Despite what I just told you.

298
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:48,800
Yeah, well, no, that is true. And I just told you, I put the half and half in a in a plastic container and poured in the coffee.

299
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,370
I drank the coffee and I feel good because, you know, the coffee's a ceramic.

300
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:59,940
They don't tend to do what I just did. But yeah, right.

301
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,270
The things don't make out a ceramic very easily either.

302
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,870
I don't know. Yeah.

303
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,270
And I'm kind of back to that. What's up on the screen here?

304
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:22,010
This is like. It's it's very hard to say.

305
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:28,150
It's you know, if you can't substitute one chemical for another.

306
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:32,740
When we're telling you that the one you're trying to get rid of, it's causing all kinds of problems.

307
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,549
And as I said before, I'm sitting here thinking, well,

308
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:43,270
now you had no idea what effects to expect because because now you have all these similar similar agents,

309
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:49,720
but not BPA, where there's very little of any data about health effects.

310
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:59,620
And you don't know whether you're like, I was I was only semi joking about like others bromance on there that can't be good that kind of thing.

311
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,780
You know, it's like, no, this is going to be worse than what you started with and.

312
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,800
We don't have the data to answer it, at least not right now.

313
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:21,870
All right. So don't follow my leadership any anyone swear off plastics today.

314
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:27,770
After reading these things I read in the last week. Now story is it?

315
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,540
They're convenient, aren't they? Yeah.

316
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:39,110
And glass breaks. And that's a big issue. That got sort of expensive and you can't see what's in there.

317
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,870
So on and on. Right. Okay?

318
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,479
Yeah. I feel like when I was reading this,

319
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:57,100
it reminded me of the sustainability concept that the answer to more being more sustainable isn't necessarily producing something that decomposes,

320
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,530
or we can reuse over time, but it's just using less.

321
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:08,590
And so, like with this, the answer may not be like, we can use a new product that says it's BPA free,

322
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,059
but we still get the same effect of how easy it is to use.

323
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,440
But maybe also our answer is also just trying to use less at the same time.

324
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,460
So it's just kind of reminded me of that. Yeah.

325
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:32,390
But there's a I mean it's a very reasonable thing to argue for that that the consuming so much but it's really you know that BPA free

326
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:44,000
stuff is it's really slippery because you can't really if it's true surely surely whoever made it has the right to put out a statement.

327
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,300
That's true. I don't they just don't go into all the details of what did we use instead.

328
00:37:50,690 --> 00:38:00,920
Right. Yeah. When I think about all the things like in my own household, they come in plastic containers.

329
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,690
So I don't have and I use like plastic Tupperware.

330
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:14,840
But that's less because of the science and more I think because I'm busy right now.

331
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,049
So I have that right. But there are things that I buy.

332
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,430
They only come in plastic so I could make them.

333
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,700
And I did do that for a little bit, but I had time to do that.

334
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,200
One thing that most people don't, they're trying to make their own laundry detergent to make their own lotion to it, like all of these things.

335
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:42,110
Um, and so I think that's part of the problem, is it, it's become a way of life for everyone.

336
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:51,740
And so people's lives are not set up anymore to be able to do these things on their own.

337
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,830
And I don't know, that's just come with the progression of like all kinds of technology.

338
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,580
And I like the idea of a washing machine.

339
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:09,410
People wash their clothes for thousands of years without washing machines and without detergent and without being in plastic.

340
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:17,990
But nobody does that now, and nobody has time to do that, cause the more that we innovate, the more responsibility we put on ourselves.

341
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:27,020
And so the more of our lives we spend working in, it's a whole that was about to be attained that, you know, and.

342
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:40,760
So. They're the answers to how to avoid these things are pretty straightforward, except when you consider the way that we live.

343
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:46,150
So you would have to kind of and I know people I know people who live who like homes,

344
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,429
that they live in the middle of nowhere and everything that they have is in glass.

345
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,510
And you make their own clothes and things, but it's not.

346
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,600
And most people and most people are going to do something like that.

347
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,330
Yeah. It's also like if we're not going to like completely change the system of regulation to like make,

348
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:12,380
put the onus on the industry to make sure things there are like safe for use before they're produced.

349
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Like kind of there's like some almost like harm reduction principles as well that can be used like sure,

350
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:23,689
limiting your use, but also like if it's an issue of like more BPA,

351
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,860
which is when it's hot,

352
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:34,400
like having microwave signs on things or like kind of like how can we use an unsafe product in a more safe way if we have to use it?

353
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,730
Because it'd be great to completely change the system, but kind of working within the framework that we have.

354
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,010
Right. I mean, it's very worthwhile to do that.

355
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:55,890
But it's it's. It's hard work, it's hard hassle, and there's lots and lots and lots of people that are never going to do that.

356
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:04,320
Pretty much, yeah. I mean, I'll give you my vision, I guess I read have sentence more or less.

357
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:11,250
Yeah. What I would like is an FTA with teeth in the US.

358
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,630
That's good. That's good to do exactly the kinds of things you were just talking about,

359
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,300
saying that, you know, you want to introduce some new products, some new chemical.

360
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,460
You first have to do that. I'm talking about you being industry.

361
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:33,150
You have to do the studies to prove that it's that it's actually safe to use.

362
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:41,460
And of course, if you don't do that now, if we did do such a thing, which I think politically we're a long way from it,

363
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:48,569
but if it if you were doing such a thing, you would have to have all these rules,

364
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:54,570
like from the FDA or somewhere like that, saying this is how these studies have to be done, because there's you know,

365
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,200
there's lots of ways to try to short circuit or, you know, get get the result you want to get.

366
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:07,080
So it's like, yeah, you have to pay for it, but you can't just say, okay, we're.

367
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,490
You're an employee or you're a scientist, and we're paying you to do this and we want to do it this way.

368
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:23,180
You would need all kinds of rules about how the studies are supposed to be organized and looked over, I think, to to actually feels.

369
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:30,610
Like. I know the products that are being used are actually safe because they went through all this.

370
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,850
I mean, this is pie in the sky, I admit.

371
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:42,220
But I'm just sort of pointing out, even if you had the even if there was like strong political will, it's still not going to be very easy to change.

372
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,549
But the whole system is like and how how it's organized.

373
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:50,070
Right. Yeah, I was going to add.

374
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:55,799
And then you have states like California with like Prop 65 where everything says this may cause cancer.

375
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,850
And so then the label is absolutely meaningless because everything has that label on it and you just start ignoring it.

376
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,930
When I moved to California, I was like shocked every time I thought of the line, like a few weak then I just didn't care anymore.

377
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:21,360
Right. And you see a lot of products these days that made somewhere else, that sold somewhere else, where they'll say everything.

378
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:29,010
They'll actually say on them that the state of California says that, you know, this this is problematic.

379
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:35,040
But you're right, I think the companies don't worry that much about it because people don't pay attention after a while.

380
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:42,929
Yeah, I thought the same thing. It's like you can't you know, you can't pick out every single possible carcinogen or something like that.

381
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:43,640
You have to pick that.

382
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:53,220
You should pick out maybe half a dozen where there's really a big issue and there's really a lot of people being exposed because like you said,

383
00:43:53,850 --> 00:44:01,410
if if you see some 50, 60, 100 different things, you you don't you don't really pay attention to it, even if it may be true.

384
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:13,050
Yeah. Okay. And. Any any last thoughts anyone wants on PTI before we can move on.

385
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:23,700
If you'll like the next line, by the way, it's going to be about land and the Supreme Court and.

386
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,410
Our men and women were treated differently. It's quite an interesting story.

387
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:34,190
That's that's what we have coming for next week to talk about together.

388
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:43,569
It doesn't involve any plastics yet, so I'm canvas the next page as its access is denied.

389
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:49,600
Does that open up at a certain time? Uh, the next issue I need to look.

390
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:59,750
Okay. So it says you as a student can't bear section three from the home page.

391
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,530
Okay, that's that's my overlooking things.

392
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:07,820
I think I'll change that this afternoon.

393
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,850
I my plan was to have it, which clearly and fairly,

394
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:19,670
but my plan was to have at least a two week lead on everything summit that

395
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,170
anything you're supposed to do is you see it all at least two weeks at a time.

396
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:31,080
Thank you. Okay. Sorry about that. I didn't realize, but I said make excuses for myself.

397
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,730
It's because two of us were doing it.

398
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:41,750
I didn't realize that she published all these things, but I didn't realize that she had released them to students.

399
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:49,010
That's what happened. Okay. All right, so let's do something different here.

400
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,780
Now. Let's talk about this.

401
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:49,040
So I want to focus on causation here, which is going to be which is very important and we'll talk about a lot in this course anyway.

402
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:58,220
And these are three things I don't expect people to read them didn't don't really have to or need to at this moment.

403
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:07,220
And so what's what's in this slide show is some history of theories about causation.

404
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:12,410
But how do you decide what is an association or what is an actual cause?

405
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,980
So, you know, an exposure to certain chemicals in certain health outcomes, adverse health outcomes,

406
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:28,400
and talk about general causation versus specific causation, which talking about that will include this.

407
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:39,740
You'll be interested in this part because when we have these student groups where you're either supposed

408
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:49,190
to be anti or pro an environmental or occupational cause of the main disease process that you will.

409
00:47:52,860 --> 00:48:04,220
You do have to argue that specific in the case of that specific individual did whatever that exposure has caused the main disease outcome.

410
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:12,480
So that's specific causation, whereas general causation is saying it's capable that this agent could cause this problem,

411
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:19,050
which is a different argument than having to focus on a particular person in their previous situation.

412
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:25,970
Okay. And. Yeah.

413
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,690
So I want to go over some.

414
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:37,529
There's been some changes in the way people talk about causation or think about it that probably many of you in the room are aware of.

415
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:40,050
But I've talked about that as well.

416
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:52,230
So people like us are particularly likely to be asked to make a determination of some study or something that's been done and saying,

417
00:48:53,620 --> 00:49:05,490
was this a causal relationship or was it just happened that the exposure, the disease were associated with each other and state that is there?

418
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:12,320
And determining causation is really a first step to prevention because you're like,

419
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,490
you're only interested in preventing things that actually cause the adverse outcome.

420
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,480
Right? So it's a cornerstone. All right.

421
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:30,300
So you have to determine which exposures need to be reduced or eliminated and which are where weren't in action on them.

422
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,930
And so what do we know about health effects?

423
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:39,690
Well, now we know we know a lot about cigaret smoking and adverse health effects.

424
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:45,930
We'll talk about some more another time. We also know that there's exposure.

425
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:51,000
Loud noise can cause hearing loss. There's this one's more controversial.

426
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,680
We know that Mercury has a number of potential adverse effects.

427
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,500
Central nervous system, etc., etc.

428
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:08,430
But the question of dental amalgams that include mercury, whether they're really a risk to people or not, is, I think, somewhat still up in the air.

429
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:16,770
There's still you still can get arguments on both sides about that. Yeah, I'm old enough.

430
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:24,660
I have like a fair amount of gold in the back of my teeth, so I guess that's a little bit safer mouth exposure.

431
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:33,209
Another example like that, and this is supposed to be, you know, comic relief relief because I think for the average person, it's true.

432
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:40,440
It's like you hear about some study that this exposure caused this outcome in this group of people.

433
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,219
And that's what this is saying. Oh, it's just there's just been the dials.

434
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:51,600
And whatever comes out will say in this case, it's going to be coffee can cause depression in twins.

435
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,240
So that's what that was. Okay. Okay.

436
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:11,670
So let's talk about how over time, we as humans interested in this have been trying to determine causation and what sort of new tools exist.

437
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,540
So probably everyone in this room is familiar with the idea that a randomized

438
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:26,880
clinical trial is often considered like the strongest possible type of study to do.

439
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,600
Where you've got evidence. It's mostly used. It's usually not used for occupational environmental exposures.

440
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:40,049
It's usually used when you have maybe an existing treatment for a disease outcome and someone comes up

441
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:44,970
with a new treatment and they want to figure out whether the new treatment actually works better or not,

442
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,710
that kind of thing. Right.

443
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:58,140
And the whole thing about a randomized clinical trial is that you you randomly assign people to get one treatment or the other.

444
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,129
And so that means it's very unlikely.

445
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:09,360
There's confounders, there's other things that are associated both with the exposure, which is the treatment in this case,

446
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,610
and the disease outcome simultaneously that change that relationship between the two.

447
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,860
And if you do a well-designed randomized clinical trial,

448
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:30,180
even though there may be a lot of other things we don't know about that could potentially affect the disease outcome of interest.

449
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:42,210
It's very unlikely if you did a randomized controlled trial, it's very unlikely that in your study that that that third agent, whatever it is,

450
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:50,370
is going to be associated at the same time with the exposure with which exposure in this case being you're

451
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:58,200
getting the old treatment or the new treatment because you set the study up where it's it's a roll of dice.

452
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,890
Right. And so there's no as long as you have enough people in the study,

453
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,430
it's very unlikely that you're going to have you're going to have a confounder that you're not aware of.

454
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:16,889
Right. So that's that's a big part of why people like these kinds of studies and I think I can't reference in this

455
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:25,000
talk or maybe a different one I get to later and I'll talk more about this at some point about thinking about.

456
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,800
This. Okay. And, you know, it's it's in one sense, it's not very old, right?

457
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:38,410
I mean, it's not even close to a century old. And this is what it was used for first was streptomycin for tuberculosis.

458
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,960
And to state what maybe is obvious is for ethical reasons.

459
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:54,160
You can't do a randomized clinical trial when you're concerned about occupational or environmental agents causing an adverse outcome.

460
00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:02,949
You can't purposely have people being exposed to something that you think maybe the whole reason you're doing the study is to figure out,

461
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,170
are you right that it's causing adverse outcomes?

462
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:13,150
So you can't you can't have people that weren't otherwise going to be exposed you to volunteer them and say, Oh, we're going to expose you.

463
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,960
We don't know if you'll get exposed or not. It depends on this conflict.

464
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:29,500
When it's your turn. And so we don't do randomized clinical trials because you can't do them for that ethical reason.

465
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:40,840
You may wish you could, but you can't. Now, this is on the other hand, if you want to see whether an intervention so changing something,

466
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,590
say, in a workplace, we think that this agent is probably causing this outcome.

467
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,170
Maybe it's asthma, people developing asthma in a certain department.

468
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:58,420
And so you can obviously do a study where you say, okay,

469
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:06,190
we're going to have all the people in this area that are exposed to it the same as they've been doing.

470
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,200
But over here, we're going to do something to remove that agent.

471
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:19,300
It won't be in that atmosphere. And then if it turns out that that prevented disease, made it much less likely, people develop asthma.

472
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:26,790
Then you have a finding. And of course, at that point, you want to make sure that everybody is being protected.

473
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,690
So you're going to change something as well.

474
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:38,980
But the point is that you can do that kind of intervention, but it's only an intervention where you try to change something for the better.

475
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,030
Get rid of the agent that is causing problems.

476
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:51,190
Okay. So. But we'll come back to large scale studies.

477
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:56,580
So we're interested in.

478
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:05,870
So you may have a statistical association and a study between an exposure and a disease outcome,

479
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,059
but that doesn't necessarily mean that there's a causal association.

480
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:24,330
Right. And. I guess so for things like this, like coal miners developing respiratory disease,

481
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:33,920
which we'll talk about a lot more detail soon in this class and also smoking and dusty work environments.

482
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,990
Are they adding to the problem? That is something.

483
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:44,460
Where you are. You're you know, the coal miners are working in dusty environments,

484
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:48,900
but you want to know whether that actually explains their development of lung disease.

485
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:56,860
Okay. Is. And this is being compared to every time I've been to Salt Lake City, it's been rainy.

486
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,700
You probably wouldn't think that's causal. I think.

487
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:16,570
Okay, so associations in numerical statistical features of the data, but they could just be associations and correlations.

488
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,130
They may not be causal.

489
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:27,730
And there's there's a lot of reasons that there could be associations to exist within a particular data set without there being a causal relationship.

490
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:39,800
I think probably don't know that. An example would be various types of bias where I was just talking a few minutes ago about confounding.

491
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,870
You have a you've got a disease outcome and exposure, but in your study,

492
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:56,860
there's there's another agent maybe you haven't measured and that is associated with both of outcomes and that's causing the apparent effect.

493
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,670
All right. So how do we actually figure this out?

494
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:08,330
So this is another comic relief about facts, but I'm going to go through that one.

495
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:13,370
So just remember, if it's something, it's truly causal.

496
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,460
You're saying it's a feature of the material world, right?

497
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:26,030
It's it connects the exposures to the diseases in a way that therefore is potentially amenable to preventive interventions.

498
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,320
I mean, that's pretty obvious, but keep that in mind. Okay.

499
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:39,200
So one one part of this is to say, can you scientifically test this?

500
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,620
And that is a potentially refutable concept.

501
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:47,220
Sure. And then just.

502
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:53,629
Hill was the person who we're going to go through this in more detail in a couple of minutes,

503
00:58:53,630 --> 00:59:02,270
but came up with two ways to look at whether there is likely to be a causal relationship between an exposure and a disease outcome.

504
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,340
And I'm not going to read through all that. So it's interesting to see how he thinks about it.

505
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:13,309
But he says the decisive question is whether the frequency of the undesirable

506
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:18,260
event be will be influenced by a change in environment environmental feature.

507
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,810
So that's like talking about the study.

508
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:28,820
We're saying do a study where you remove an agent that you think is causing an adverse effect to see what it what the impact is.

509
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:40,960
Okay. So there's been a lot of lot of discussion about how to determine whether it's statistical associations are truly causal.

510
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:51,340
And that started back in the fifties and sixties, going back a while with the Hill article and also the U.S. surgeon general.

511
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,520
And this is just showing you where they are. I'm trying to get the. MARTIN Interesting part.

512
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:04,580
And the surgeon general report pretty much overlaps with Hill's.

513
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:12,190
So these are some of the criteria for deciding that you think there may be a true causal relationship.

514
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:18,580
I want readers to focus on the health ones, which are very similar and.

515
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,100
So at that time, you know, you had the tobacco industry,

516
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:37,600
which is very upset that the science some science some studies were saying that smoking cigarets is increasing the risk of lung cancer.

517
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:41,230
And so that was something that was being looked at very carefully.

518
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:45,280
And of course, there were studies that did show that strong association.

519
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:58,660
Right. So if it's causal, one component is going to be utilized to predict the occurrence of the other and so on.

520
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,550
Now what I want to get to,

521
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:13,630
because this is too many pages is and so I was surprised and glad for TIL and a little bit earlier was kind of the same things and.

522
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,910
Right.

523
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:25,780
The question is what aspects of the association should we especially consider before deciding that the most likely interpretation of it is causation?

524
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,800
And probably most of you are familiar with this.

525
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:38,110
So the strength of the relationship between exposure and adverse disease outcome is important.

526
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:44,410
Consistency. Meaning do you find the same effect in different places with different people doing the studies?

527
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:48,490
Specificity come back to that. That's probably not important.

528
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:53,340
Temporality, of course, is the exposure come before the disease process.

529
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:56,500
If you don't have that, you definitely don't have a causation, right?

530
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:07,810
Biological gradient, that's where you see the risk goes higher as you have greater exposure to individuals.

531
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:18,880
And then there's questions about is it plausible and coherent experiments analogy is these ones on the right tend to be a little bit weaker.

532
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:25,240
Sometimes they're not as important to look at and I'm going to sort of blast through these as well.

533
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:35,310
So there's the strength of association, which is so it's hard to state the obvious.

534
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:41,889
If you do a study and you find that people who have a cigaret smoke risk compared to

535
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:48,280
people who have never been cigaret smokers are ten times as likely to die of lung cancer.

536
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,970
That's a very strong association, right? Ten times as likely.

537
01:02:53,350 --> 01:03:02,530
And so when you see that, you think it's probably going to be causal because there's probably not going to be clear.

538
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:09,310
Example, a hidden variable that you didn't know to look for that's associated with both smoking and so on.

539
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:18,740
So it's strength of associations, quite important and consistent is do people get the same results in different places?

540
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:24,660
So very important specificity, temporality.

541
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:29,810
We talked about these phrases. So this has a lot of these details.

542
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:38,350
If you want to go through them. Okay. And a lot of agencies use these criteria like the whole criteria,

543
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:46,400
including like the US Environmental Protection Agency, like the International Agency for Research on Cancer and so on.

544
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:52,960
And. There. These are the ways people usually look at it.

545
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:01,090
Okay. And then this is going to be important when you get to your in your groups or your entire approach of a true actual individual.

546
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:11,319
So you want to understand the difference between general causation, which means a persons with greater exposure and X at greater risk of disease.

547
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:18,670
Y because in a causal fashion versus a specific in the case of Mr. Jones as the disease,

548
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:23,920
why didn't chemical X cause or increase his risk of developing disease?

549
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,649
So therefore, this is where I think I have a list on the next next slide.

550
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:38,590
But for example, you're going to be very interested in how much was was Mr. Jones exposed to this agent?

551
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:44,770
You know, if it's that will be important, whether you believe it's causal in his case as an example.

552
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:55,240
Okay. So here's a here's something you'll probably want to use when you get around to

553
01:04:55,350 --> 01:05:05,150
doing these is presentations and from Kuznets and Hutchinson from 1979 and.

554
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:16,569
This is some background. So these. You see all these women sitting here saying,

555
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:24,550
I know what what what your it's a for doing work but you know when that was from and what kind of work they're doing.

556
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,810
So they're this is when they want to.

557
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:33,340
Yeah, go ahead. I'm just going to try a little shirt factory in New York.

558
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:39,429
Actually, no, although that would be that'd be a good one as a good.

559
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:43,450
Yes. So great.

560
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,820
Radioactive substances. Yeah. Some of them glow in the dark.

561
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:54,670
Right. And so these were had just been sort of discovered and understood a little better.

562
01:05:55,210 --> 01:06:00,340
And in the early part of the 1980s and early part of the 20th century.

563
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,929
And so you've got all these watches.

564
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:12,550
And they said, hey, if we take a little bit of this with fine brush and we could put, you know, all the different times at 12 different times,

565
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:20,310
then people can wear a watch and they'll be able to see, even if it's pitch black, with what time it is.

566
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:33,430
Okay. So what they're doing here, they're all women and they've got like brushes they could use like sewing brushes for painting something.

567
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:40,450
And they're and they're doing this with this radioactive substance and have a good point on it.

568
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:46,630
Lots of them are looking don't tell them to do it, but to get the job done and have it look right,

569
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:51,760
they're like licking getting the tip to make sure it's going to make a very fine line.

570
01:06:52,630 --> 01:07:03,880
And so there was an outbreak of bone cancers affecting the jaw and and the rest of the face as well among these women.

571
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,020
For this one, probably nobody knew what they were doing yet.

572
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,320
They were they were the very unfortunate guinea pigs, probably,

573
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:18,700
probably no one in the world quite understood what a problem this was at the time they were doing this.

574
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:28,440
So that's what that's a picture of. And I think it's from, you know, like right around 1920, somewhere around there.

575
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,430
Another one. Definitely work related. Okay.

576
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:45,139
And so these are the questions that you'll probably want to go through if you're trying to make make an argument,

577
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:53,720
pro or con, about whether someone's exposure at work or an exposure in the environment is responsible for their disease.

578
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:59,460
So first thing is that is a disease condition clearly established.

579
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:03,680
That's quite important. Sometimes there's a dispute about the diagnosis.

580
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:10,250
And has it been shown that the disease can result from the suspected agent or agents?

581
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,120
So is there data from well-done studies that suggest this?

582
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,690
And then for the individual, has the exposure agent been demonstrated?

583
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:29,300
And does it seem and does it seem to be of sufficient degree or duration that it could cause this disease condition?

584
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:35,330
And is there some non occupational exposure that the person is getting exposed to the

585
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:41,600
agent somewhere else and are they doing something in their house or something and so on.

586
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,860
Hobbies. And you have to think about all kinds of special circumstances that are going into that.

587
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,930
And so from those six questions being asked,

588
01:08:54,080 --> 01:09:03,740
so has the burden of proof in that for whether this individual developed this disease process because of this specific exposure.

589
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:11,330
And so that's something you're going to come back to those questions, certainly.

590
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:19,540
Okay. So. Now I want to talk about a couple other things that have to do with the definition of a cause.

591
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:31,360
So here's a here's a cause where it says a cause of the disease of an event is an event,

592
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:37,209
condition or characteristic that preceded the disease event without which the disease

593
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:42,970
or that either would not have occurred at all or would have occurred sometime later.

594
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:49,030
So that would be a sufficient cause. Okay. That prolongs that long thing I just read.

595
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:55,750
Well, actually, I'm going to go back on. That's okay.

596
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:09,850
We'll go. So this is from a I guess it's now been several, several decades that this came out, but it's been in Greenland cause of diagram.

597
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:14,500
And so this says this that explain how this works.

598
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:27,400
So your 2.1 here is saying that that there's three different pathways by which any person could

599
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:32,530
possibly develop some disease process and identify a disease process you're interested in.

600
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:43,659
Okay. And either there has you A and B, which might be, you know, exposure as it might be.

601
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:53,630
Other things have to have all happened at one time. And that's one way people get the disease or you and E or you K and E.

602
01:10:54,250 --> 01:11:02,310
So so this is saying suppose these are sufficient causes, meaning of all three things inside of a circle happen to this person.

603
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:07,570
They will develop the disease and the same thing is true.

604
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:13,510
So for the circle Roman numeral one and it's separately from a number of two and Roman numeral three.

605
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,870
These are the three ways you can get this disease.

606
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:23,650
And not just I mean, I must say this real life is. But think of this as the only three ways you can get the disease.

607
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,010
Okay. So.

608
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:32,920
Try this on the next page. Yeah, that one's more complicated.

609
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,640
Let's go through this.

610
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:48,640
Okay. So, for example, if if I say to you B, it turns out B doesn't actually really exist.

611
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:52,719
You know, we thought it existed, but it's never happens.

612
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,790
It's never going to happen. What would that mean?

613
01:11:55,810 --> 01:12:00,880
That would mean that the only people that get this disease are the people exposed to you and E.

614
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:05,910
Right. Because this one and this one require a B as well.

615
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:13,750
So if it turns out B doesn't actually exist, that would leave you with only one or one causal circle.

616
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:20,229
All right. So making sense. So here's a somewhat more complicated one.

617
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,460
That's pretty interesting.

618
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:31,550
So this is the same idea where you got there's only three different ways that a person can end up with this disease process, whatever it is.

619
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,420
And we're not specify what these things are.

620
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:42,920
But there is, you know, one way is A, B, C, D and E all happen.

621
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:50,060
Okay. And then the individual can get this disease or a, B, G and H,

622
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:57,080
I'll happen that because the person they get the disease or a C, F, I and J have a third way.

623
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:02,030
All right. So now here's what's interesting about this is what's at the top of the screen.

624
01:13:03,530 --> 01:13:07,490
So imagine that she didn't actually exist.

625
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,850
And while you're paying attention, these three. Okay.

626
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:23,570
And then the question is, would be A, B and F would always sometimes or never biologically interact in the causation of disease.

627
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:29,060
Basically, when you see biologically interact, that's essentially the same.

628
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:36,400
They are in the same circle with each other and they both have to happen in order for that circle to cause a disease process.

629
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:45,410
So it should wake you up a little bit. Anybody willing to give an answer to that, if that actually exists,

630
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:52,220
would be an F always sometimes are never biologically interact in the causation of this disease.

631
01:13:53,060 --> 01:14:02,080
Any takers on that? No one wants to jump on that.

632
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:09,060
Okay. Well, going to be is in one. I mean in separate those areas of being that have to be in.

633
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,060
Because until you've got the energy together, but in one you just have to be but no cheap.

634
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:25,570
So you could have. I guess that's why my question is, okay, you have all three of them there, but you obviously have one where you just have one.

635
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:29,080
So. Okay.

636
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:40,120
So maybe I'm the reason the G doesn't exist in so like in number one, there's no G and you have B, but we have to be enough to go.

637
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,090
But there's also no G and in Roman a Roman numeral two because I just told you,

638
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,170
even though it turns out it doesn't exist, that's what you're supposed to.

639
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:56,770
So it does not exist. So then the question if I want to take a crack at this.

640
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:05,950
Okay, yeah. So the question then does to then become a BFD or does it just completely cease to exist?

641
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:11,980
It's it's basically saying that it's not a pathway because it turns out G doesn't exist.

642
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:22,150
So then that means that only pathway is one and three are sufficient causes or B is never interact and nothing.

643
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:33,670
Right. That's what I wanted you to say. So you know, this has been F, but since G doesn't exist, you can't get the disease that way.

644
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:40,600
You and this one has B, but it doesn't have F,

645
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:50,170
so it's not possible that you have biological interaction in the causation of disease by this process and this one has F,

646
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:53,290
but it doesn't have B, and so therefore,

647
01:15:53,440 --> 01:16:03,040
as you just said, you would say that it's that the and F never biologically interact in the causation of disease

648
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:09,520
because the only circle where they could have interacted with each other g had to exist as well.

649
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,430
And I just said, suppose G doesn't exist that that makes sense to people.

650
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:26,830
But I just went there. All right. So if G were present but C did not actually exist, what would you say that being F would always,

651
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,550
sometimes or never biologically interact in the causation of disease?

652
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:35,000
Anybody. Always.

653
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:40,000
Always. Sorry. Always. Always.

654
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:43,500
Okay. I wasn't hearing you too well.

655
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:47,970
And you want to explain why you say that? I agree with you.

656
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:55,200
If C is not existing, then. Roman numerals one and three are not sufficient pathways.

657
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,530
So B enough are always going to exist together.

658
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:03,659
Yeah. So look. Right. So C doesn't really exist.

659
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:08,820
So that means you. This cannot be the pathway. This cannot be the pathway conceived doesn't exist.

660
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:15,090
And so it has to be this requires all five things that happened.

661
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:20,670
So that means that being F or always interacting in some way to it, just which you said.

662
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:30,570
Absolutely. So it's of interesting to think about this because, you know, usually you think about, oh, biological interaction.

663
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:40,680
It's you know, it has that or it does and that this using diagrams like this raises the question about, well,

664
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:48,969
whether there's going to be an interaction actually depends on other things as well, is basically what's what you're taking away from this.

665
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:51,560
So that's sort of interesting. All right.

666
01:17:54,540 --> 01:18:03,569
And so the other thing I want to point out, which maybe you cover, I don't know how much people have covered this in their epidemiology classes,

667
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:11,940
but the purest definition, of course, is based on the concept of counterfactuals.

668
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,120
Counterfactuals means things that never actually happened.

669
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:16,860
That's a counterfactual.

670
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:27,270
Okay, so it says you've got at a certain moment in time, there's a person, a that receives an exposure X and then later divides disease day.

671
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:33,270
And we define X as a cause of the person at that moment,

672
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:42,810
if and only have the following counterfactual is true is that if that same moment person did not receive the exposure X,

673
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:53,820
he or she would not have developed the disease. It sort of does that makes sense to people that that would be a good definition

674
01:18:54,660 --> 01:19:01,830
of what's meant by causal because there's a saying in that exact situation,

675
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:08,250
as long as the person is exposed to X, they will develop the disease.

676
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:15,510
But if they're not exposed to X, even though everything else is the same, they've never developed the disease, does it?

677
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:24,420
So yeah, go ahead. If the person is exposed to the exposure x, can you say with certainty that they would develop?

678
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:27,880
Like do you have to say with certainty that they would develop the disease?

679
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:33,400
D Now, so you're not saying with certainty that they would do.

680
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:39,460
It's not like 100%, as you're asking. You're not required it to be 100%.

681
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:47,130
It's well, it gets more complicated. We'll talk about it. But so.

682
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:54,020
You're using a counterfactual to say you're not requiring 100%.

683
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:57,470
You're basically you're basically saying.
