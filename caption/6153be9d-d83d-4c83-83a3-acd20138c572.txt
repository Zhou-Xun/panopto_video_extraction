Hey, this is Matt Zawastowski in this lecture, we'll learn how to use descriptive statistics to summarize the longitudinal data set.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,180
As we complete those descriptive statistics, let's keep in mind what we're trying to accomplish during longitudinal data analysis.

3
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:37,040
We want to determine if reading test scores are changing over time and inspect variables that might explain differences in scores between students,

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,380
let's see how we can use descriptive statistics to accomplish those goals.

5
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,140
Our first step in analyzing the data was a graphical analysis, for example,

6
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,720
this spaghetti plot which allowed us to visualize all the outcome data at once.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:02,660
This plot is incredibly helpful for understanding the data, but it is very busy and we'd like to capture the key patterns contained in the figure.

8
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,290
We'll use descriptive statistics to do exactly that.

9
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,670
In particular, we'll quantify the distribution of test scores at each grade and summarize them in tabular format.

10
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:23,620
This will provide a good summary of what we see in the plot and can even identify some information that is obscured in the figure itself.

11
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:32,170
For each time point, we can compute and report the sample size, the mean test score and the standard deviation of scores,

12
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:41,590
we can now see that we have scores for all 22 students in grades five through seven, but are missing the eighth grade score for eight students.

13
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,060
The table shows that the mean test score increases by approximately three to

14
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,000
six points per year with relatively consistent standard deviation over time.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,520
This simple table of descriptive statistics has already helped to confirm the pattern of increasing test scores.

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,240
What about between student differences that affect test scores,

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:15,340
we already saw in the graphical analysis that students risk group being advantage or disadvantage seem to have an impact on their reading test scores.

18
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:23,020
Remember that coloring the lines in the spaghetti plot by risk group showed the pattern of lower scores for disadvantaged students.

19
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:30,830
This pattern is concisely summarized in the table, shown with group specific descriptive statistics.

20
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:39,050
We can easily learn the sample sizes for both risk groups and examine missing data in each group in our Toy Data set.

21
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,810
There are similar numbers of advantaged and disadvantaged students, with each group missing.

22
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,120
Eighth grade test scores for four students demean test scores higher and the advantage

23
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,030
group at all time points and variation in scores is larger for the disadvantaged students,

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,310
a pattern that is not as clear in the figure.

25
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:07,600
And the graphical analysis, we use the scatterplot matrix to visualize the dependency of scores on the same student.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,220
Now we'll use covariance and correlation to quantify that dependency.

27
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:23,270
Not surprisingly, we observed that test scores were positively correlated and the corresponding correlation values computed here confirm that.

28
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:33,260
For example, the correlation between test scores in the 5th and 6th grades is zero point nine six five, a very strong, positive relationship.

29
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Another pattern that we noticed in the scatter plots was that the correlation seemed to decline over time,

30
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,950
so that fifth grade reading scores were less predictive of scores and future grades as time went on.

31
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:54,360
We see this pattern quantified by the correlation getting smaller as we consider test scores from grades that are further apart.

32
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,570
The correlation between fifth grade and eighth grade scores has dropped to zero point eight eight three.

33
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,750
Still a strong positive relationship, but a clear drop from scores only one year apart.

34
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,250
This is a relatively common phenomenon to observe and longitudinal data.

35
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,320
If correlation were to approach near zero, it would imply that distant measurements,

36
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,890
although measured on the same individual, are virtually independent.

37
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:28,880
Recall that the full picture of dependency over time is reported using the variance covariance matrix.

38
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,190
Here we see the variance covariance matrix with statistics computed from the data.

39
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:43,340
And since the matrix is symmetric, we really only need to consider the upper triangular portion of the Matrix.

40
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,960
Covariance is, of course, a scale is quantity that is difficult to interpret.

41
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,860
Instead,

42
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:57,990
the correlation matrix is often reported because it is more easily interpreted with values of correlation constrained between negative one and one.

43
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,900
Comparison of test scores between groups is not limited to just the mean over time.

44
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,230
We can also consider the dependency of measurements between groups.

45
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:17,600
This scatterplot matrix allows comparison of within subject correlation of test scores by risk group initially,

46
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,990
correlation is high in both groups, but drops off much quicker for the advantaged students.

47
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,850
The correlation of fifth grade scores to eighth grade scores is zero point nine for

48
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,650
and disadvantaged students and zero point three eight and the advantaged students.

49
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,250
We need to be careful about reading too much into this toy data set,

50
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,890
but this pattern implies that fifth grade reading scores are less predictive of future scores for advantaged students than disadvantaged students.

51
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,920
These types of observations can influence important policy decisions.

52
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,270
That concludes our exploratory analysis of the complex data set,

53
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:05,190
we now have a real good idea about several patterns in the data based on our graphical analysis and the corresponding descriptive statistics.

54
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:13,890
Descriptive statistics are admittedly simple, but when organized properly, they can efficiently transmit critical ideas and patterns in the data.

55
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:21,270
This is particularly important for research papers where you might not have the room for all the figures you've created in terms

56
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:29,730
of NPLs or tables of descriptive statistics efficiently demonstrate that mean test scores increase over time for all students.

57
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,320
But there are clear differences between advantaged and disadvantaged students.

58
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:42,435
Our next step for employees will be to apply a formal statistical test for change in test scores over time.
