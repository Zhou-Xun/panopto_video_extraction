1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,040
Oh. Okay. Before I forget with you all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,290
So we had talked about the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,360
I started highlighting the cannabis version. I did not mean to do that.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:26,620
You have a quiz do. On Sunday.

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:40,290
Yes, yes. Yes. Okay. So the day in question was the 22nd where the day in question was this 22nd where you were like, can we please chat?

6
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:58,480
Yes, you can. So I will I will essentially move to move this discussion up to here.

7
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,200
Okay. So you you don't have to come on the 20 seconds.

8
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,640
Cool. Beautiful. Yes. Yes. Final question there.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,550
Yes. Is it okay if we do a topic that's already been like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,460
You don't have to reinvent the wheel. Just make sure it's like something you're interested in.

11
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:33,430
All right. I'm not going to upload. I'm not going to delete this and upload this to canvas because other people have access to canvas.

12
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,370
But if you show up on Tuesday, the 22nd, just know that I will.

13
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,370
I mean, I'll be here, but I'll be upstairs in my office. Where's Aurora's?

14
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:52,810
Like, We don't have class. Okay. But I probably am making my morning class come because they are done by ten,

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,850
so they have plenty of time to go catch their flight, whatever the heck they want to do.

16
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:11,350
All right. So today we are continuing our discussion on one health and psychosocial factors and specifically the human animal bond.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,399
I found an appropriate short TED ad.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,680
I think someone who can explain it really a lot better than I can, and it's also only 10 minutes.

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,180
So I did put the link to this Ted in the canvas. I'm going to actually turn off the light.

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,170
Don't fall asleep. Is this, or do you want to call it?

21
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,480
What do we think? I like that. You like this? Yeah. Okay. All right.

22
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:11,150
Right. Pets make our pets make us happier, healthier, more content.

23
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,730
It's amazing to hear that that being with dogs and cats has been shown to reduce anxiety,

24
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,590
depression, decreased blood pressure, even allergy and asthma.

25
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:34,040
Pets are good for us. And what's amazing to me is that we are so incredibly close with our pets in society today.

26
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:42,890
Recent surveys show that the majority of pet owners, dog and cat owners in the United States sleep with their pet in the bed with them.

27
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,350
Over half of dog owners and three quarters of cat owners allow the pet to sleep in their bed.

28
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:57,620
That's a close relationship. Now, as a veterinarian and a very enthusiastic dog and cat owner, I think this is a great thing.

29
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,390
I know we're better off because of it, because of all the benefits that we get from that relationship with pets.

30
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,310
But I'm also struck by what a dramatic change this is in our society.

31
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:15,170
You know, 30, 40 years ago, just a generation or two ago, we didn't have this close relationship with our dog and cat pets.

32
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,850
We loved them dearly. We spent a lot of time and energy and effort on them.

33
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,040
But really, many people, most pets, dogs and cats who live outside,

34
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,000
they would come in the house sometimes, but they certainly didn't come in our beds.

35
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,110
Dogs would have their own house in the backyard where they spent most of their time.

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,610
So if you think about Snoopy from the old Peanuts comic strip, right, he spent most of his time on his doghouse.

37
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,769
That was sort of that from the 1970s. I apologize for this that reference, but I can appreciate that sort of Snoopy lifestyle.

38
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,580
You see, I grew up in rural Kentucky in the 1970s and I absolutely loved all things animal.

39
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,989
I was passionate about animals. I love dogs from a very early age.

40
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,230
I found them magical, incredible, just fascinating to me.

41
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,920
And yet dogs and cats weren't allowed in my house when I was a child.

42
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,830
Growing up out in the country, I didn't know anybody who had dogs and how dogs and cats in their home.

43
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,430
It was transformational for me. The first time my family would visit family and a dog walked into the living room.

44
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,360
I was just blown away. I was like, There is a dog in the house, this is awesome.

45
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,620
And so I can't help but wonder as a veterinarian, you know, what's changed?

46
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,429
How have we come to this place where we are so close with our pets?

47
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,909
I know it's a good thing, but I kind of want to know how we got there.

48
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,760
And one thing that has changed that I've watched change in my career as a veterinarian is parasite control.

49
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:49,650
So it's interesting that parasites are animals that live in or on other animals and things like fleas and ticks and intestinal worms,

50
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,780
really gross things. I understand that you don't often think about parasites when we think about our pets,

51
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:03,390
and that's because the veterinary profession has made such incredible advances in recent years in being able to control parasites on pets.

52
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:10,950
And so removing parasites from pets has allowed us to bond more closely with them because it's much more

53
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,760
appealing to hug your pet or share a bed with a dog or a cat that's not covered with these attacks.

54
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:23,879
So it's taken that out of equation, allowed us to be closer with our pets, and that closeness definitely benefits us.

55
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,690
That's been documented. But I would argue and my cats would say I was protected here, but I would argue that closeness also benefits our pets.

56
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,190
I think our pets are better off because of their elevated status in our family.

57
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,720
And so what our parasites, parasites like fleas and ticks, there are animals that live in and on other animals,

58
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,300
the free living species, every organism in nature has a cohort of parasites that colonize it.

59
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,110
So it's true of every animal, every plant, every organism, including humans.

60
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,439
We have parasites of our own. And so parasitologist.

61
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,510
I'm a veterinary parasitologist. We don't struggle with that existential question of why we are here.

62
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,400
We know why we are here. Ecologically speaking, we're here to host parasites.

63
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,660
And and that's why that's why our pets are here as well.

64
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,570
They're here to host parasites. That's their kind of ecological role in the larger system.

65
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:25,860
But when parasite control is not practiced on pets, when they're infested with fleas and ticks, it's incredibly sad.

66
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:34,170
And so dogs that are not protected from parasites become infested and they really suffer from that infestation.

67
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,160
And it doesn't have to happen. You don't have to allow these infestations to occur because we have great strategies to prevent it.

68
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:48,930
But pleas and tips are common on dogs and cats and dogs and cats that don't benefit from parasite control will vomit intestinal worms.

69
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,320
Sometimes they'll know. And that's not appealing in your home, right?

70
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
Dogs and cats with tapeworms and this is where it gets kind of gross.

71
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,870
But the provided middle stage of the tapeworm that's the reproductive unit will actually

72
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,069
migrate out of the anus of the dog or the cat looking to complete its lifecycle.

73
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,500
Right. Go out to the environment, get back into another host.

74
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:16,170
And if that happens on your couch cushions or on the rug where the pet's resting, you know, that takes an indoor academy from an outdoor cat, right.

75
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:23,430
Parasites are gross. If you go into a home that's infested with fleas and you run your hand over the carpet, you can make the fleas jump up.

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,830
And some of us, a very small percentage of us think that's really cool, but the rest of us don't want that in our homes.

77
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:37,079
Right. So the great thing is that in the last 20 years or so, while I've been a veterinarian,

78
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,300
I've watched this evolution as we've implemented effective parasite control strategies for pets.

79
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,870
We've become closer to our pets than ever before.

80
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,769
They're now in the home, and it's because we've taken parasites out of the equation.

81
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,180
We're able to have that close relationship with them. So here's the idea.

82
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:03,320
That parasite control and the advances the veterinary profession has made in achieving parasite control for pets has done more to support the human

83
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:12,380
animal bond to really change at a fundamental level the way we interact with our pets than anything else I've ever known professionally done before.

84
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:20,489
Since rabies vaccination. Now, that's a pretty bold statement to say controlling police in Texas is akin to rabies vaccination.

85
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,060
Right. That's a fatal neurologic disease of animals and people.

86
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,100
And yet to consider that concept, I need to ask you to think in terms of one health,

87
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:39,390
one house or one medicine is a term that encapsulates the fact that humans, other animals and the environment, their health is completely intertwined.

88
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,890
We can't separate one from another. And so when a veterinarian, vaccinates dogs and cats for rabies, they're putting one health into practice.

89
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,530
They're protecting dogs and cats so that they're not able to transfer that neurologic disease,

90
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,700
that virus from wildlife reservoirs in the environment to people in the community.

91
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,010
And a veterinarian who's advising that you use parasite control, take control,

92
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,240
and your pet isn't just thinking about the health and comfort of the pet.

93
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,100
She's also trying to block transmission of severe, debilitating,

94
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,749
potentially fatal infectious diseases that are transmitted by fleas and ticks for

95
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,940
parasite control is about so much more and not making a difference and not making them,

96
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:27,330
you know, not having a hygiene problem in their home. It's actually about protecting health, veterinary health and human health.

97
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,740
There's a number of infections that are transmitted by fleas and everything from cats.

98
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:40,469
That disease to analysis of typhus, plague, tapeworms and the tick borne disease list goes on for quite a while.

99
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,850
But we're familiar with things like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

100
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,850
Is this disease, this tularemia?

101
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:57,780
It's amazing the number of diseases. But please, to extend that in my lab, we focus on understanding the risk of infection to dogs,

102
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:05,790
and we map the geographic risk of infection to dogs nationwide using data that's gathered by veterinarians and practice.

103
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:14,820
And we can use that then to predict human infection rates because many of these infections, there's a lot of shared by animals and people.

104
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,090
So by understanding where and when Lyme disease infection occurs in dogs, we can predict Lyme disease.

105
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,590
And the same for the business and a host of other tickborne infections.

106
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,970
And this is really important because we can not only see where infection is occurring now,

107
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,520
but we can actually predict where infection risk is likely to increase in the future.

108
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,160
That's very powerful strategy. And it's important, too, because the attacks are spreading in North America.

109
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,499
So we need to know more about what's happening. The other great thing about working in parasitology as a veterinarian, though,

110
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,000
is because a lot of us that are really passionate about parasites are not the only crazy parasite veterinarians.

111
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,280
And in fact, here at Oklahoma State,

112
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,339
we found in the National Center for Veterinary Herpetology to support this one health initiative and really work with

113
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:09,390
veterinarians and physicians and other scientists to implement one health strategies that will achieve effective control,

114
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,020
promoting both veterinary health and human health. And we partner with groups like the Companion Animal Parasite Council,

115
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,780
which writes recommendations and guidelines for parasite control veterinarians into practice.

116
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,290
And so it's really exciting to be part of this process.

117
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,400
And I think it's incredible that we have parasite control,

118
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:36,780
flea and tick control work job for pets because it makes such a difference, not just in their health and in our health,

119
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,170
but in our overall ability to communicate with our pets, to enjoy their companionship,

120
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,430
their affection, all the entertainment that they provide in our homes.

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,030
And so I think it's just amazing that thanks to the advances in the veterinary profession in the last couple of decades,

122
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,340
that old adage about way down of dogs no longer has to be fed up with fleas.

123
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:05,410
Thank you. Okay.

124
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,510
So just a little recap of things we talked about on Tuesday in order to watch this video.

125
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,130
Have any of you had any personal experiences of getting fleas from your pets?

126
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:24,780
No. Okay. Did you have a. Have you seen online TikTok or like this thing going around or people are taking like in regard

127
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,570
to like get rid of like intestinal worms for some reason it's been coming up online a lot.

128
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,960
No, it's like people are using medicines to get rid of the.

129
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,710
Oh, no, I saw the NyQuil chicken challenge.

130
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,210
It wasn't that. Oh, okay. Is that related to all of the hydroxychloroquine being used as COVID stuff?

131
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:53,909
It doesn't seem like the same people. Okay. They're like intestinal parasites are associated with all these symptoms that I have.

132
00:13:53,910 --> 00:14:03,240
And then they take the paranoia, which, like, gets rid of weed parasites and they're like, yeah, it's worth know a little bit.

133
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:15,459
Yeah. There's some wild stuff on TikTok. I mean, we also have very good gut bacteria, probiotics, flora and fauna that you need in there.

134
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:23,460
I'm like, I'm not so sure that everyone know because that's how people cause Cibo which is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,

135
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:32,010
where most of your good bacteria lives in your large intestine because that's where like it connects to your colon and it helps break down,

136
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:38,730
you know, food so you can like, you know, take what you need from it and the rest goes out, right?

137
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,250
But when it overgrow is in your small intestine, that's when it starts to cause a lot of digestive issues.

138
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:52,020
But frequently, like people who are on a ton of antibiotics, the antibiotics don't know to target good bacteria or bad bacteria.

139
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:59,370
They just take on bacteria. So usually when you get antibiotics, they'll be like, eat yogurt with this or drink coffee or like, you know,

140
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,220
like, you know, some kind of something else with probiotics like eat kimchi or something like that.

141
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:10,050
So you can not essentially shred your entire gut lining.

142
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,980
But people are doing all kinds of things today, apparently.

143
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,620
I will say not me personally, but my sister ended up getting tapeworm.

144
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,860
But that was when she was living in Vietnam.

145
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:31,540
That was just from. She was a vegetarian at the time and eating.

146
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:38,620
What we found out later was vegetables. Vegetables that were not fully cooked and there was a cholera outbreak there.

147
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,720
But she was like, This is amazing. I'm eating all the fried food I want and I'm losing weight.

148
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,160
And I was like, You literally have a parasite living inside of you.

149
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,960
So these people take over. Like, I think I have a tapeworm only I think you should know, you should go to a doctor.

150
00:15:52,990 --> 00:16:00,940
Deliver tapeworm. Well, in order to verify it, not to get into the nitty gritty, but in order to verify it, you have a tapeworm.

151
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,230
You have to provide a stool sample. A lot of people won't do that.

152
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,110
Yeah. Yeah, they refuse to provide the stool sample because to like, you know, how are people sniffling?

153
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,050
So I thought, I mean, I'd be going all the doctors in the world first.

154
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,110
Yeah.

155
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,170
It's interesting, though, because, you know, she talks about parasite control and this like blurring of the one health and all that kind of stuff.

156
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,620
So when my sister was living in Vietnam, the reason she was there,

157
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:35,350
she's a Princeton and Asia fellow working for the World Wildlife Fund in northern Vietnam and on the border of southern China,

158
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:44,120
because there were a lot of endangered species that people were still killing because they believed they had medicinal properties.

159
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:53,649
So particular in particular tigers, which they would decapitate and use various parts of the tigers because they believe,

160
00:16:53,650 --> 00:17:00,430
like some of it like provides virility or different treatments or people would bottle snakes and stuff like that.

161
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,259
So, you know, not just in not treating parasites, but, you know,

162
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:10,540
the butchering of these animals to use like every culture has different practices, right?

163
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,499
But there's like if you're going to do it, there's a way to be safe about it,

164
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:21,130
which a lot of people don't necessarily wear personal protective equipment when they're doing so,

165
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:28,020
in particular for the psychosocial factors therapy, animals, stress and trauma.

166
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:34,360
Now, therapy animals have widely been used to address psychosocial factors such as stress,

167
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,219
anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and various traumas.

168
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:50,260
So you can see I remember the Oxford shooting at Oxford High School here just a few seems like forever ago, but it was just in January.

169
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,420
It seems like a lifetime ago was earlier this year.

170
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,770
So there you see some therapy dogs deployed to those students who were coming back to the classroom.

171
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:08,920
They did the same thing in Uvalde in Texas. That center picture is a service dog for Army veteran.

172
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:17,860
And then the dogs below are retired dogs who were working at Ground Zero after 911.

173
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:26,050
So they deploy them, you know, not only to, like, search people for drugs and like do search and rescue, but also provide that comfort.

174
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:37,809
So therapy dogs and stress management during disasters, this picture in particular, this paper in particular, this is not a new concept at all.

175
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,959
But we finally have the words to verbalize what it is and the research to connect between the

176
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,210
two in terms of like that affects the therapeutic effects of animals and psychosocial factors.

177
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:57,640
So they have traced back the use of animals for therapeutic use all the way to the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans.

178
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,680
But over the centuries,

179
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:09,489
people slowly abandoned the therapeutic use of animals due to various religious and cultural movements where they believe for some reason,

180
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,930
like the animals were unclean or their presence didn't belong in there.

181
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:22,959
So this picture at the bottom here, you can see a girl getting she's not in a full iron lung chamber, but she's getting a lung treatment.

182
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,990
And they have a little like retention, like a little bathtub there with some ducks for her to look at.

183
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,830
Yeah. Freud.

184
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,690
It's always Freud.

185
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:45,190
He was known to bring his chow chow during analysis sessions during with patients, and he was one of the first people to document that.

186
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,790
When he brought his dog into the office with his clients,

187
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:59,140
it seemed like the the patients were more willing to be open and it facilitated feelings of security acceptance

188
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,280
and actually facilitated in their like personal introspection and analysis during the therapy sessions.

189
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:17,200
And then the second accidental use as that there as as animals as a therapeutic adjunct tool was this guy named Levinson and his.

190
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,270
Dog Named Jingles where he brought he brought the dog into the office and he noticed that

191
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:31,620
people are patients in particular were less anxious when jingles was just running around.

192
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:38,459
So that was an accidental thing, right? So they started looking into this more.

193
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:48,840
But really, they say that the first U.S. documented use in a crisis response of therapy animals was for the Murrah Building bombing in Oklahoma City.

194
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,049
That was the Unabomber in 1995.

195
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:58,390
And then they've been deployed to other major events such as ground zero, like I mentioned, Hurricane Katrina.

196
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:06,390
They're, you know, busy rescuing animals right now for Hurricane Ian, but they also have therapy animals deployed there.

197
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,260
Motz has bear pet animals. Sometimes they have therapies here.

198
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:19,350
And I've been asking the school, please bring therapy so we can have, you know, therapy dogs.

199
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,290
But they were like, we get booked up really fast. So the therapy dogs for dogs.

200
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:32,310
Yes. That's just adorable. They have you know, they have some stress or anxiety and then other dog comes them down.

201
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,580
And this is a good friend. Yeah, well, that's why you get your dog a dog.

202
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,110
But it's interesting because some dogs actually are prone to anxiety as well,

203
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:47,280
and they think that it has a lot to do with the environment that they're in and their owner in particular.

204
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,510
So if you're a dog that is pleased with that anxious family, you might become an anxious dog.

205
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,530
And epigenetics or epigenetics. That's right.

206
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:06,450
So we're just going to watch a short news clip here that was kills me and my dog.

207
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:14,550
My family's dog like at one point was prescribed like dog different antidepressant eat how you feel your yeah you've got to try to

208
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:24,450
travel a good job on race dog family dog and I think the same medicine way different dose that I mean it's not it's not uncommon.

209
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,710
No no no no no. Okay.

210
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,690
I thin and Emma are a mixed breed of poodle and wheaten terrier.

211
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,310
Yet when it comes to helping people in distress, their pedigree is pure.

212
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,290
Their therapy dogs tell you relatives they were in Boston to help those grieving for the bombing victims.

213
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,720
He goes out of work and they were there.

214
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,790
In the aftermath of superstorm sandy,

215
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:58,109
dogs have been proven to lower blood pressure and lower stress and decrease anxiety just by offering unconditional love and support.

216
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,100
And then a number are part of the Good Dog Foundation of New York.

217
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,510
They live with their owners, Michelle and Jeremy Coffee in Greenwich Village.

218
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:12,630
They love the work and they get so excited just to comfort people and to be able to to have lots of attention from people.

219
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,890
It's not just disaster victims. Number four, we got more for everybody.

220
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:24,120
It's also the second I didn't really notice anything until I got this swelling here and a lump here.

221
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,290
Actor Darren Kelly has been receiving chemotherapy for a cancerous growth.

222
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,329
I've lost my taste buds and it's some of my taste.

223
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,760
So my palate is like fried. Ah, right now I've gone to the doctor.

224
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,990
That's medicine. That is medicine. Is that how you see it? Yeah, it's medicine.

225
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,620
It's therapy, it's distraction. It's. It's something that you want.

226
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,630
You want that energy. It helps you through.

227
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:56,940
So do dogs lower stress for cancer victims? The results of a three year study are expected to be published later this year.

228
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,750
Nurse practitioner Catherine Concert was part of that study.

229
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,950
What do you think it's going to reveal? I think you're going to show positive results.

230
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:13,380
The patients come in, they're anxious, a dog barks and their anxiety level goes down.

231
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,730
And these dogs are working dogs. But it doesn't seem to be a chore to them.

232
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:26,940
You know, they're they're they're proud of what they're doing. And many cancer patients and disaster victims are grateful for that sense of pride.

233
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:30,600
Magalie Laguerre Wilkinson, CBS News, New York.

234
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,600
As an aside, there's a I think it's on Disney plus now, but there is a short show called Pick of the Litter.

235
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:50,940
And you watch this. These Labradors go through training to essentially become guide dogs and then some of them fail.

236
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:56,700
But then, you know, we're like if they're too friendly, too friendly to be like a TSA dog, for example.

237
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:09,300
Actually, in Texas, if you if you want a really well-trained dog that was too friendly to work in the TSA or in the police and in the government,

238
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:16,860
they all go to this one military base in San Antonio and then you can apply to adopt them, which I think is great.

239
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:25,020
But as I mentioned, you mentioned broadly in the video that dogs reduce stress or animals in particular, the dogs are most common.

240
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:32,730
But this is there are also like therapy cats, therapy birds.

241
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,020
I've seen some birds. I'm freaked out by birds, not not into that.

242
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:44,459
But like, you know, rabbits are like emotional support. Emotional support animals are different because they're not trained as rigorously.

243
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:53,070
But, you know, with the dogs in particular, they signal or animals signal a lot of neurotransmitter release that's positive.

244
00:25:53,070 --> 00:26:01,710
So oxytocin, which is considered like the cuddling neurotransmitter that gets released when you see and or interact with animals.

245
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,980
It also releases dopamine as well, which is, you know, the neurotransmitter that makes you feel happy.

246
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,190
And then also some serotonin which stops like prevents you from being depressed.

247
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,380
So there are a lot of positive effects in interactions with animals.

248
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:27,090
I was very bummed to find out that you are not allowed to bring them here to this school of public health unless they are a service animal.

249
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,579
Oh, so emotional for animals. No service animals. Yes, yes and no.

250
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,680
People just like randomly bringing their dog.

251
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:44,760
Because at my previous school of public health that I worked at, like we had one of the faculty, her corgi would always be in on Tuesday and Thursday.

252
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,380
People were pit baby. Well, it was also a different kind of school environment where people would actually like leave their office doors open.

253
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,010
So they put baby gates in front of their office door.

254
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,829
So there was a corgi named Dash. There was like a brown pit bull named Ghirardelli.

255
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:10,770
There was a really big golden retriever, and then there was a giant Doberman bean pincher actually named Minnie.

256
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,759
And I thought that was fantastic that people brought their animals, because I thought that was like a very nice, welcoming environment.

257
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,680
The students really enjoyed it.

258
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:29,849
But people here, like, I pose the question on the on Twitter, like, why can't people bring animals here to this building?

259
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:37,020
And somebody said mice. And I thought that was hilarious because a person who replied is a post-doc who works

260
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:45,450
on the seventh floor where there is an entire mice lab colony on the seventh floor.

261
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,769
So I was like, All right, if you just would just hate animals, just say it.

262
00:27:49,770 --> 00:28:01,980
Okay. But looking at I mean, I'm a do I have any experience in some particular where your animal was able to provide you stress relief?

263
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,390
Oh, absolutely. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,209
My next door neighbor, she had a little terrier that she loved.

265
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,040
He had no teeth. His name is Jimmy Carter, who was named after her favorite president.

266
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:27,990
He sadly passed away. But after he he died, her health has noticeably declined as well, just because she lives by herself.

267
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,729
And then when I see her, you know, I try to like chat with her and stuff like that.

268
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:38,580
But like that was her, you know, her motive for like getting out, trying to be mobile.

269
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:45,300
She had a companion. And since then she's like declined very, very, very rapidly.

270
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:59,130
So, yeah, it's a bummer. In this study here, randomized trial of therapy dogs versus deliberative coloring or art therapy, you know, nowadays.

271
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,700
Have any of you tried to partake in adult coloring books?

272
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,080
I just found. Oh, did you find it stress relieving?

273
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:15,560
I did not either, because it takes so long. If anything, it aggravated my carpal tunnel because I had been coloring in such detail.

274
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:24,000
But some people really like it. So essentially in this randomized trial, they targeted emergency medicine providers of physicians and nurses.

275
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:34,890
And their hypothesis was that if they interact with dogs for at least 5 minutes during their shift, their perceived and manifested stress.

276
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:41,630
Will decrease. Okay. So this study in particular did have a theoretical construct to it.

277
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,389
They used the Biophilia hypothesis,

278
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:52,850
which essentially is humans have an innate desire to focus and be with things in nature or things that are natural.

279
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:02,659
A lot of studies in like leisure behavior in parks and recreation use this Biophilia hypothesis, but this was just a single center.

280
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,970
So they only looked at one hospital facility and it was a prospective randomized controlled trial.

281
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:16,700
So the self-reported stress was done with the Q9 and they collected saliva samples as what they call the manifested

282
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,329
stress at the start of the shift in the middle of the shift and the end of the shift to look at cortisol levels.

283
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:30,520
So cortisol is a of as a hormone that essentially shows like physiologically how stress you are.

284
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:37,520
So the more cortisol you release, the more stress you are, the more likely you are to retain belly fat and those kinds of things.

285
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:47,330
So in this study, they had 39 people in the control group, meaning nobody collared, nobody interacted with a dog,

286
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:54,830
40 people who colored, and then 43 people who interacted with a dog for at least 5 minutes.

287
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:06,050
So they found that regardless of what group the person was in, their salivary cortisol levels were highest at the beginning of the shift.

288
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,490
Why do you think that is? Thinking about your day going in.

289
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,510
I do all this. Get all this done. Yeah. Stressing about maybe.

290
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,350
Maybe commuting. Commuting? Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,490
The anticipation, perhaps, is like family stuff to see, like, going in that kids aren't being good or whatever that morning.

292
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:33,910
Yeah. Yeah. Or I try to do this last, but I catastrophize a lot of things.

293
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,750
So I often think about like the worst case scenario. And then as the day goes on, it's not as bad as you actually thought it would be.

294
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,690
Right. So they found that salivary cortisol levels were the highest at the beginning of the shift.

295
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:58,840
But what the people who colored or interacted with dogs, the salivary cortisol levels significantly decreased compared to the control group.

296
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,170
But so you can see here the three coloring options that the coloring group had,

297
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:13,540
and there was a significant reduction in self-reported stress, but not visible visual analog stress.

298
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:19,060
So what does that mean? Stress decreased on their self-reported questionnaire measures.

299
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,740
But when you look at their eye movements, it didn't actually indicate any reductions.

300
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,180
Were those options that were used for the coloring?

301
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:38,790
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I just so often one. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

302
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,639
Like, did they think that or are they just like,

303
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:50,350
wow what an interesting they you can you can buy a whole adult coloring book just full of curse words on Amazon.

304
00:32:51,400 --> 00:33:01,240
I've only done the ones gifted to me. So someone give to me like a Harry Potter one, a Puccini one and like a like a flowers one.

305
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:08,230
I donated them. I, I just I don't I don't find it relaxing.

306
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,970
And I'm, I'm a completist. So people.

307
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,870
Refused to do puzzles with me because puzzles are supposed to be relaxing.

308
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,770
And once we start, we have to finish that day.

309
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,850
None of this. We're coming back tomorrow. Business.

310
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:34,810
All right. So this is not for me. But to each their own for this one here.

311
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:41,580
The effect of therapy dogs. This study. The effect of therapy dogs on exam stress and memory.

312
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,080
So we know that therapy dogs in particular reduce stress, but improve outcomes.

313
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,870
But the effects specifically on academic performance are unknown.

314
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:02,100
So they did recruit 218 people from a variety of classes at Pepperdine University.

315
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:11,460
That's like a fancy private college in Southern California, and they got 127 people to participate.

316
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,860
They had seven different breeds, seven therapy dogs of different breeds and sizes.

317
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,060
So they came to the, you know, the main plaza during exam.

318
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,979
And they this was called the Paws to Relax program,

319
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:34,650
where they included a questionnaire for before the people took their final exam and then after the people took their final exam.

320
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:43,249
So the first study was participants who chose to interact with therapy dogs.

321
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,800
So these are people who willingly interacted with therapy dogs in particular.

322
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:56,690
So stress management measurement in condition one pre and post interaction stress did not differ,

323
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:02,330
but the decrease in stress was larger for those who visited therapy dogs.

324
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,190
Okay. So you can see for this one here, no no interaction with dogs.

325
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:20,269
They still experienced a decrease in stress after the exam, but the slope is much more shallow compared to those who interacted with the therapy dogs.

326
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:27,020
I mean, naturally, you would expect this to decrease, right? Because once the exam is over, you feel a little bit relieved about it.

327
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:31,560
I'm always stress after exams. Oh, why the anxiety of how I did?

328
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,270
And so are you one of those people that looks at looks up at the answers to see if you got it right or wrong?

329
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,109
One No, you need to stop that that immediately. Post stress migraines.

330
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,839
Yeah. Really like the day after stressful day.

331
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,210
I don't have a migraine. That's horrible. Wow, he just got it.

332
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,760
You just got to stop it. That's torturing yourself, so nothing is going to do it.

333
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,549
But afterwards, I used to look up all the answers that I thought I got wrong, and then I was like, Why do I do that?

334
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,580
I can't change anything. I'm not going to take the exam again, so it doesn't matter.

335
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:11,989
Yeah, yeah. I used to do that a lot when I was pre-med and but after a while, you're like, Yeah, you can't.

336
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,230
You can't change the outcome. Maybe you can, like, you know,

337
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:23,000
manifest some some generous grading if it's short answer is something that is definitely not happening on an organic chemistry exam, for example.

338
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:33,469
Right study too, though rather than participants being willingly choosing to interact with the therapy dogs,

339
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:43,580
they were assigned to therapy dogs, but they showed marginally less stress reduction but no actual difference in their exam score.

340
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:50,930
So people who chose to interact with therapy dogs had not only significant stress decreased,

341
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,490
but also scored an average of 5.5 points higher on their exam.

342
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:02,930
People were assigned to the therapy. Dogs had stress reduction, but no difference in their exam score.

343
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:06,460
Isn't that interesting? What?

344
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:15,829
Why? So I guess was it a choice to choose or was it a result assigned to a alone two assigned group?

345
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,840
And then they sort of like selected a group because I guess maybe confounder and

346
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,580
people would be more invested in the experiment or they might be better students.

347
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,799
Yeah. Self-selecting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,790
And next week, on Tuesday, your guest lecturer will talk a lot about different confounding and biases.

349
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,430
Do you think there is inherently different?

350
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:46,729
So for these people this also what here in study two, what was a little bit different is you can see stress as a function.

351
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:58,280
So some people after the exam, you know, were assigned to interact with the dogs and some people after the exam went to go watch a movie.

352
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:05,240
They were assigned to go watch a movie. So the therapy dogs obviously showed a greater effect than watching the movie.

353
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,980
Do you think there's something inherently different from people who would choose to

354
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:15,710
interact with a dog and those who don't and their intellect or ability to take exams?

355
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:31,100
Say, What do you think that people who choose willingly to interact with dogs versus people who don't like they're assigned to?

356
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:40,550
Is there something inherently different about these two groups where one has got higher exam scores and the other didn't?

357
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,059
Is there like something related to their test taking ability or their intellect?

358
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:52,790
They think. I perceive stress and things I how they go into an exam.

359
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,849
So if they don't have much of an ego, no difference.

360
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:00,650
I would think that people now this is assuming stereotyping that people that

361
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,490
stress about exams are going to spend studying will last until the last second.

362
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:12,470
And then people that don't quite maybe that stress about it but not here as much will go see a dog to feel better going into the exam right now.

363
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,410
Yeah. Okay.

364
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:22,940
Kind of socioeconomic factors almost potentially of I'm not sure if this actually tracks by imagine people who are wealthier and more likely to have

365
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:31,759
a dog for people who don't have resources and potentially maybe they view dogs more positively than if you grew up in another low income area.

366
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,110
Dogs are scary or worrying about a dog. We're most mostly an outdoor dog, right?

367
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,190
Yeah. That's a great point. That's a potential confounding factor as well.

368
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:50,150
Yes. Yes. Plus, you know, frame of mind, people being told they have to do something versus willingly doing something.

369
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,519
Also, we don't necessarily know traditionally like for these participants what their pre exam routine is.

370
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,830
How many of you have a pre exam routine? Have a good breakfast.

371
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,420
Oh, yeah. Show up on time.

372
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,890
Show up on time. Oh. Pencil. If it's written.

373
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,410
If I can't find a pencil, I just go. Oh, okay.

374
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,519
I didn't write my notes. Ready? Have all your notes. Yeah.

375
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,990
An undergrad, I or I would. No one talked to me before the exam.

376
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:31,160
Like, no one, like, don't talk to me. And I was like that person that was still looking through their notes, like, up until the final minute.

377
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:39,350
And I was always, listen, I have to listen to my my hip hop music to get me, you know, hyped up with low fi or like, no, like little Wayne.

378
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:46,969
So this dates me about when I was in college, you know, so or I think he's canceled now and he was came out as a Trump supporter.

379
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:58,190
It was very disappointing. But but now, you know, I just you know, I have to make sure I don't eat anything unusual the day before the day of,

380
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,480
you know, you get older, you tell me those things. So this third group in study three,

381
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:15,860
they were assigned to interact with therapy dogs or watch a movie immediately after and then to look at the effect on memory retrieval.

382
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:22,460
So the relationship between stress and performance and study three, that does indicate differences in stress,

383
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:31,470
but therapy dogs in particular had no particular effect on memory retrieval, which I guess makes sense, right?

384
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:40,399
Because memory retrieval is in a different part of your brain than the center, like the hyper like hyper pituitary axis,

385
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:49,730
which like releases your your hormones and your, you know, various neurotransmitters versus like your memory is more in your hippocampus.

386
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,729
So I'm curious, have there been any studies comparing this to the effect of like vegetation or plants?

387
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,030
Because I have seen studies that show that plants like if you take a test for doing

388
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:06,380
some kind of productive test or like like like like seeing like your work performance,

389
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:13,670
it seems to show that does increase if you have like a firm in the room or something versus like a room that's completely empty or something.

390
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:18,740
That's a great question. So comparing therapy animals to like the presence of nature.

391
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,540
Yeah, I don't know. But that would be a good thing to look into potentially.

392
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:29,419
Yeah. A stance on it. I mean, obviously the brain is an incredible thing.

393
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,350
So what you do can habituate you.

394
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:40,129
So if you're studying for an exam and you've only ever studied in the exam in

395
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:45,740
like but when listening to music or with TV in the background or whatever,

396
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:53,210
and then the day you take the exam, it's absolute silence. And you have to be like in a cubicle, like with headphones on or something like that.

397
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,419
Your performance is going to be different than when you studied.

398
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:05,720
So when you study, you want to try to study under the same conditions that are as similar as possible to your testing environment.

399
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:11,870
So like as you all records a cognitive science major in college.

400
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:20,989
So one of my cognitive science professors, she was telling us an anecdote about, you know, how the brain habituated self to the environment.

401
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:27,889
And she says she used to have a classmate who would just like do a bunch of cocaine,

402
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:36,800
like a friend who just do a bunch of cocaine before they took calculus exams and just like ace them just crushed them.

403
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:42,320
My friend with Adderall, I was always so mad at them. Yeah, but popped it and was a genius.

404
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:52,280
But finally, like when the person wasn't using cocaine and they tried to take his test, it wasn't because the brain had said your friend needed.

405
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,220
Oh no. Well, probably he wasn't diagnosed or anything, but I did help them.

406
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,750
But yeah it wasn't from doctor prescribed. Oh I see.

407
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,829
Because I was like it is a highly controlled prescription drug that is very

408
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,840
difficult to get a prescription for an undergrad or not and not in college.

409
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,379
I mean, really? Oh, my God. Because it is like candy.

410
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:21,870
Oh, yeah. And now it was I never I was like, everybody's just like, yeah, the cocaine was also from the study.

411
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:27,290
I mean that are always easier have I just never really felt really alive.

412
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:35,120
Wow. Because my friend Sheila, who has ADHD and lives in Oklahoma, she has to go jump through hoops with her to get.

413
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:42,440
Yeah. Legal yeah that's why I mean a lot of a lot of people who I think came from privileged backgrounds, at least in my case, from what I know,

414
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:49,360
they would have had the resources to get a diagnosis, but then they just sold whatever they didn't use or the need to have it.

415
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,780
People that did that to go, Wow. Sorry.

416
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,620
I mean, I knew I knew people. I knew people didn't like it.

417
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,110
Maybe this decrease in over time.

418
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:08,819
But I know at least when I to 2016 was for undergrad I still think for undergrads but I don't know I just have this perception.

419
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,870
These are my perceptions, right?

420
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:16,500
It's always like people from Harvard are like, you know, in the business school or like something like that, like why would you need in public health?

421
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,460
Oh, I get. Oh, I was. I was. Oh, yeah. I mean, I just like people I know.

422
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,809
Oh, I see. An architect. Yeah, I know some people in public health, but that would be like, yeah, I couldn't say.

423
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,879
So I took it out around like that.

424
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,990
I was prescribed, um, like a substance abuse.

425
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:39,470
Like, mild or not, me. You. I just get a nitro cold brew.

426
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,110
Yeah, I don't know. Okay, interesting. Interesting.

427
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:49,320
So, yeah, just looping this all back to one health in particular.

428
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:55,650
Again, this is a more comprehensive model than what we've seen.

429
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:02,309
So the and and the animal environment, human interface, again, with the shared environment,

430
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:07,620
we have animals as companions, but also wildlife and agriculture itself.

431
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:14,700
Then you have the interface of the same food systems and shared medicines and interventions.

432
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:24,780
So essentially the goal is to integrate all of these to curb antimicrobial resistance, noncommunicable diseases, as well as infectious diseases.

433
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,639
Have you found anything?

434
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:36,890
Sam Limited evidence, but there is a growing body of research going into it, but so far it's kind of limited positive impacts.

435
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,400
I'm the in general, one was like in high school teachers that had plants.

436
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:47,549
And now there's a lot of variables that show that that the teachers that have more plants in nature and

437
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:54,510
the real led to increased concentration and just I feel like there's a lot else going on there with that,

438
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:58,110
but limited evidence supporting it. Yeah, okay.

439
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:02,290
I like the fact that as much as I've seen individual studies and obviously a meta analysis.

440
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:08,370
Yeah, yeah. I could see some confounding factors for that too though as actually like I have

441
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,120
some friends that are K-through-12 teachers and the extent to which these teachers,

442
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:20,580
they're paid very little. But how how much they deck out their classroom like before school starts to make it look beautiful.

443
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:26,100
If you're the kind of teacher that's going to take the effort to make your classroom look like a rainforest,

444
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,390
you're probably also a really good teacher. Yeah, right. I mean, regardless of.

445
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:37,919
Yes, I've had some I went to some bad schools, but I had some really good teachers I've seen over at the undergrad science building.

446
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:45,600
Sometimes they'll hold class outside on the lawn. I've never been had a class where they've held it in the lawn.

447
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,890
It's not like a nice idea. Like I had to be in a gondola.

448
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:56,160
Yeah. Oh, really? Where do you go? Because it's so like hilly benches or.

449
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,660
I mean, I was going around grass. Okay, maybe we could do that.

450
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:09,120
Although, don't know, I kind of miss my window for it, but bundle up.

451
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,560
Yeah, I mean, today. Today, like, the high is like 80.

452
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,610
It's warmth is all over that. Yeah, yeah.

453
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,300
I was going to be 50. That's tomorrow anyway.

454
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:32,040
I mean, that was all I had to say for this lecture, but I wanted to reserve some time not only only to discuss a little bit more about your survey,

455
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:39,690
but also at the end of the semester that just reminds you that you have a research poster and a presentation.

456
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:49,530
So your research poster is a little bit different of a flavor than your work or, or your survey questionnaire.

457
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,280
So your survey questionnaire is you trying to assess something, right?

458
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,700
Or it's some gap you're trying to fill or some information that you're trying to seek where the research poster and presentation is.

459
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:08,760
Obviously, I guess it could be within the same vein, but like another topic or area that you're particularly interested in exploring and highlighting.

460
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,620
So what this will consist of, because this class is a lot smaller than I thought it would be,

461
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:20,160
I scheduled two days for it, but realistically probably take one day, another day than just have a but.

462
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,459
You'll develop a poster that's kind of like a conference poster, more or less on your topic.

463
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,810
But what's different is that you won't necessarily have a methods section, right?

464
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:35,310
Because you're not conducting a study, so you'll have an abstract in your content.

465
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,750
And then what's different is you'll have a what I learned this semester section.

466
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:48,630
And then some people will choose to have sections on like interventions they decided to pose or whatever, but you'll present your poster.

467
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:53,100
And like I said, it will be an actual presentation. So you'll.

468
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,440
To make an accompanying PowerPoint for us.

469
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:04,030
And we'll also look at your poster. You don't have to print out your poster because that costs money, will just show it on the screen.

470
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:11,960
But within the module here, I do have the examples for you.

471
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:21,550
So like I showed earlier in the semester, this student two psychosocial factors of work shaping dual perspectives on drug testing.

472
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:28,690
So she did a little bit of a different flavor where on one side she was like for or against drug testing.

473
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:34,600
And then you can see she does implications or recommendations and kind of puts her lessons learned for the semester.

474
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,590
At the end of the class. At the end of the poster.

475
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:51,670
And these girls, girls girl, this person did a lot of work, family conflicts as in LGB employees.

476
00:50:51,670 --> 00:51:00,920
And then, you know, if you have a framework you want to include in there to jazz up your poster and not make it so text heavy.

477
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:06,730
You can do that as well. It's not super restrictive, but there is a rubric in there for it.

478
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,169
The expected the expected sections that you'll have in there.

479
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:14,480
Right. And then this third one, if it will load.

480
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,570
This one did opioid misuse in the workforce.

481
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:23,510
And she kind of did it more like as a like a like a legal briefing.

482
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:30,670
She did do a methods section, which is nice, I guess, but you don't necessarily have to do that.

483
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:39,850
And then she put in some of her own figures. So again, just getting that on your radar because looking forward through your assignments, right.

484
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:44,440
You have the quiz due on Sunday, the week after you have a second perusal assignment.

485
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:51,309
And then essentially it's just another one more quiz your pilot and your final questionnaire.

486
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:55,600
And, um, and then now gosh, what do you mean?

487
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,570
It's like it's. We're on the second half almost. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:08,430
Time flies, time flies. Have we started things? Well, thought about them.

489
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:12,220
I have some work that's necessary. The archive of words on paper.

490
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,180
Okay. That's all you need to start. I think I'm to read just about mine.

491
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,230
I'm built environment more. That'll be easier. Okay. Okay.

492
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:26,290
Yeah. I guess that I'm kind of agonizing about with the survey at least is like, um, I do like some kind of work safety thing,

493
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:32,619
but also like with the realization that it'd be difficult to find actual, like, workers.

494
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,970
That's mine. You don't, you don't bring it up right. Or ask people.

495
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:42,340
Yeah. So like you won't be having a handicap by just like asking students or something.

496
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,749
Yeah. Or like you can ask the staff who work over to help you.

497
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:54,579
I would prefer if you like, you know, just say you want to ask like construction workers, but you don't know three construction workers.

498
00:52:54,580 --> 00:53:00,280
Oh, I would prefer you ask staff rather than like your peers.

499
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:10,810
Right. Because they because your peers are also in classes taking AP and bias stats and have this like public health perspective.

500
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:18,429
Whereas if you ask staff, they're more going to be like the average layperson who might take it.

501
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:22,209
Or you can ask like family, friends or something like that.

502
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:28,300
Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah. I just want someone coming out that doesn't have a lens going into this.

503
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,060
Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

504
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,920
Um. Okay, so sorry. Going back to the syllabus again.

505
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:44,980
So let's see. Let's see. So. Where are we?

506
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,390
Okay.

507
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:59,370
All right, so on Tuesday, I'll talk like the first 20 minutes, and then Dr. Ford will join us virtually via Zoom, you know, to give a guest lecturer.

508
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:04,530
And you all said you are going to be here anyway. So we'll just meet in the class, then we'll talk.

509
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,129
I'll talk more about economic conditions and environmental factors.

510
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:14,610
We really talked about fines and fees so we can skip that physiological mechanisms related to stress and then a mid-semester

511
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:22,350
evaluation which I'll conduct since the class is small enough so I don't have anyone from zero t coming file break no class.

512
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:28,770
Yay. Then we have Dr. PEREIRA doing an epigenetics and psychosocial factors lecture.

513
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:34,650
She'll be taking the whole time, but she's here in this building, so she'll be coming into the classroom physically.

514
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:38,940
Then we'll talk about psychological distress primary.

515
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:43,560
I had to flip the schedule a little bit. Primary prevention and secondary interventions.

516
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,700
I had to flip this week with cardiovascular because Dr. Rosenberg still technically is on FMLA,

517
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:55,320
but she's going to give a guest lecture on cardiovascular risk factors.

518
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:03,240
She will be taking the whole time. And this she will be over Zoom so we can talk about that day if we want to just do Zoom,

519
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:10,260
you guys want to come here again and then we'll do ergonomics and then I'll shove this in here.

520
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:17,820
And then you can see this week, you know, you have a whole week for your poster presentations, but we'll likely wrap it up on that.

521
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:24,680
So you have this day probably no class and then you have finals week to work on your questionnaire.

522
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:31,800
So we're kind of like the there I can't believe how much we've barreled through, but hey, here we are.

523
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:37,440
Any questions or comments from me?

524
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,560
So how do we feel like it's going?

525
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:49,780
Are you all bored? No, I wasn't expecting a survey, but I'm glad we're doing it.

526
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:55,239
Okay. Yeah, that. That's how you can learn. So now it's like learning that stuff, too.

527
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,630
So it was a surprise, and I'm glad we're learning that skill too.

528
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:06,820
Okay, that's good. I my goal for all my classes is always some form of application, so like, yay knowledge.

529
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,260
But like, you're probably going to forget a lot of this stuff.

530
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:15,129
That's why I say that's why you save the slides, right?

531
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:19,990
That's why you take the notes. But I mean, actual skills that you have a chance to practice, right?

532
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:29,410
Because when I was in my master's program, I had a chance to write a small grant as a master's student, which I thought was super helpful.

533
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:31,660
And then doing.

534
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:41,469
I also did my own, my other classes doing a career interview, but like doing career interviews and just more like hands on experiences.

535
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:47,600
Regardless if you're like in academia or you work at a local public health department or you end up working for a nonprofit,

536
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:55,270
there are some things that people just kind of are commonplace and expect you to do, but a lot of it's not done well.

537
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:00,190
So trying to get the the foundation right I think is important.

538
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,710
And I'm glad that you haven't really learned it in other classes because I don't know who else would really teach it.

539
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,270
Well, there's somebody in epi and biostatistics that to disobey stuff, but I don't think they teach.

540
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,460
So. Okay.
