1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,010
Hi, I'm Shannon Prudhomme, and I'm your lecturer for this global health session.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:15,490
The focus of this session is on global health challenges, key stakeholders, and career opportunity.

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:22,960
What I'd like for you to get out of this lecture is to have a broad understanding of the global health sector and key issues,

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,320
an overview of the significance of local context to global health systems, and

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,490
understanding of the key stakeholders and their roles in the global health sector,

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:42,930
and then fourth, an overview of global health career opportunities, as well as ways to address diversity, equity, inclusion and global health roles.

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:49,390
Let's get started. The first session focuses on global health challenges and contexts.

8
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,950
The key takeaways I want you to take away from this session are, one,

9
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,940
to gain an understanding of the global health sector and key issues, as I mentioned previously.

10
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,470
But I really,

11
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:07,590
really also want you to understand how the significance of local context to global health systems and interventions, and how just understanding the

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,790
frameworks without having an understanding of context and what makes this,

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:21,290
what will make the application of those frameworks different isn't very helpful. So I really want you to also ground yourself in context.

14
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:29,590
To get down to the root of it, a common definition of global health, I want to share this definition of global health.

15
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,800
Global health is an area for study, research and practice

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,210
that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide.

17
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,100
Global health emphasizes this transnational health issues, determinants and solutions.

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,870
It involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration;

19
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,770
and it is a synthesis of population based in prevention with individual-level clinical care.

20
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,380
This is a definition that was quoted in an article in The Lancet in 2009.

21
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,170
The title of the article is Towards a Common Definition of Global Health.

22
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,650
It's important to recognize that global health is supported by country governments and it's a crucial component of foreign policy.

23
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,430
And it's become a major, if not the largest philanthropic target.

24
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:32,500
And global health is also derived from public health and international health, which in turn actually evolved from hygiene and tropical medicine.

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,200
So you'll see a lot of schools of hygiene and tropical medicine that sort of represents the early,

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,540
early thinking and early language around global health. While the definition varies greatly,

27
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,980
the common definition of public health or politically updating of the international health sector still needs to kind of be defined.

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,300
So for the purpose of this lecture, let's stay grounded, and let's stay rooted in this definition.

29
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,240
I want you to notice also the three areas in that first sentence, study, research and practice.

30
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,620
As you're navigating your studies and figuring out, and navigating your careers,

31
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,920
decide whether or not you want to be on the research side,

32
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,800
which tends to be a lot of either local or international research institutions or academic institutions.

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,930
And we'll talk about different partners and stakeholders later on in this whole lecture.

34
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:30,100
But also, if you want to be a practitioner, so start thinking through that as you're kind of navigating career options and also finishing up your study.

35
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:42,580
Some key disease priority areas in global health are: global health security, immunization, HIV and tuberculosis, malaria and parasitic diseases,

36
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,410
other multiple disease threats, food and water, and travelers' health.

37
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,540
And we'll delve a little bit into a few of these,

38
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,680
but I just want you to know just what the key priorities are in terms of global health when it comes to disease priorities.

39
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,950
I want to first touch on these three pictures, and we'll get more into this as we talk about content.

40
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:11,470
What you'll see in the first image, that's actually a picture from my organization, CARE USA distributing food and water resources in Atlanta,

41
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:18,850
Georgia, as part of a domestic COVID-19 emergency response initiatives to provide emergency food to families in Atlanta, Georgia.

42
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:26,110
More recently in Houston, Texas, CARE was also involved in partnering with the local faith based organization to deliver emergency

43
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,450
food or to have an emergency food pickups for families that needed emergency food resources.

44
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,080
So it's important,

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,620
I want to emphasize, when you think of global health, think again of public health and international health, that the US is part of that.

46
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,480
Historically, there has been a tendency to lean towards focusing global health on international locations, but

47
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,990
we are part of the global health sort of landscape and ecosystem,

48
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:58,180
and I think this pandemic has demonstrated that. The picture on the right is of an adult woman getting a shot, an immunization specifically, in Brazil.

49
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:05,680
And finally, on the right hand side, the lower right hand side, this is a child receiving a polio immunization in India.

50
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,270
I wanted to touch a little bit on global health security, touch a little bit on immunization,

51
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,640
HIV, tuberculosis, but also that significance of food and water and traveler's health.

52
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,180
And I feel like it's more apparent now with COVID-19, but I also want to kind of provide some elaboration on that.

53
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,600
Global health security, I'll define it for you. Global health security, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

54
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,910
is the existence of strong and resilient public health systems that can prevent,

55
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,950
detect and respond to infectious disease threats wherever they occur in the world.

56
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,160
So global collaboration, global landscape, global focus, including in the U.S.

57
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,740
The Centers for Disease Control, of course, works 24/7 to protect health, safety and security, not only of American people,

58
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,270
but of global threats worldwide, because that's their impact, they want part of the global landscape.

59
00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:00,130
Some of today's top global health security concerns are global

60
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,560
health risks including, the emergence and spread of new infectious diseases, new infectious diseases,

61
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,150
not polio, not some other diseases that we didn't previously know about, but the new ones that we're tackling

62
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:16,830
and we're going to have to learn about how to treat. Ever increasing globalization of travel and trade,

63
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:28,230
enabling disease to spread. Third, the rise of drug resistant disease causing pathogens. And fourth, the potential for accidental release,

64
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:35,370
that or illicit use of dangerous pathogens. The CDC also has a global health security agenda.

65
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,850
The GHSA. This agenda has been agreed upon by 67 countries.

66
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,960
They signed on to the GHSA  framework, agreed that these are the top risks.

67
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,390
They will collaborate around them, develop surveillance systems, share information and pretty much foster

68
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:58,490
pretty much a shared knowledge base in terms of managing, detecting and responding to these emerging global health diseases

69
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,560
and outbreaks. Immunization. I'll touch on immunizations.

70
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,640
Global health, the global health immunization division at the CDC, is actually one of the most effective of all the global health division.

71
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,610
And they focus, of course, on vaccinations.

72
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,880
The Global Health Immunizations Division is also dedicated to ensuring everyone shares the benefits of immunization.

73
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,130
They do this through scientific and public health expertize, so you see that research part coming up,

74
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:31,690
but then also the practice part, of planning in communities for how the vaccines will be delivered for partnering with organizations.

75
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,570
So there is the research and development, but also the practice.

76
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,610
And you'll see that consistent in global health, the career options, but also kind of figuring out where you fit,

77
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,440
where your expertize fits, where kind of you feel you can make the best contribution.

78
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,160
I also want to touch on global HIV and tuberculosis. This was really my passion early in my career,

79
00:07:50,160 --> 00:08:00,160
and even today. You see HIV and tuberculosis often funded in terms of programmatically together and treated, because they're interconnected.

80
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,510
People who are living with HIV are highly susceptible to tuberculosis or TB and people who acquire TB,

81
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,940
this is who are living with HIV, they die most often and more frequently from TB.

82
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:21,390
So you'll see both together, HIV and TB, often presented together, funded together, treated together in different settings.

83
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:28,240
And I'll touch on one, on the last two, food and water. I mentioned that the picture at the top is CARE USA.

84
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,900
My organization focuses on delivering emergency food to families. But that's also relevant to the disease prevention of disease treatment.

85
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:43,600
If you don't have access to food and water, your treatment regimen for HIV, for polio, for any other disease won't be effective.

86
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,950
A lot of medicines and treatment regimens require access to food and water.

87
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,900
So it makes sense that this would be part of the key, not disease priorities,

88
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,250
but key priorities among the disease priorities, making sure people have access to food and water.

89
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,680
But also thinking about treatment of food and water and water borne diseases and food borne diseases.

90
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,820
Those are also priorities for the CDC and also ensuring more health in the

91
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,530
global health landscape, that people have access to those resources they need. Traveler's health.

92
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:19,780
You'll find that a lot of organizations in the global health sector often ask their staff to reference the CDC guidelines before traveling.

93
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,410
Are they themselves have a travel department if they're large enough? And those travel

94
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,260
departments provide information directly from the CDC on what vaccinations are needed.

95
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,100
What are some health threats and what to be aware of, health wise, when you're in countries

96
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,190
so that you can recognize the signs of different infections early and where to go for treatment.

97
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:46,290
So those are key disease priorities in global health, global security, immunizations, HIV and TB, malaria and parasitic diseases.

98
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:53,770
Of course, other multiple disease threats, food and water are travelers' heatlth. So all of them significant as a whole to global health.

99
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,340
I also want to touch on more expansive global health challenges.

100
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,980
When you think of the interplay of these challenges with those disease areas that I mentioned,

101
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,100
you have a lot of issues that people encounter. COVID-19 has also exacerbated these issues, and global health

102
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,570
providers continue to create and work through options to address them. We don't use the word struggle,

103
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,100
we use the word identify, create, work through and share that information.

104
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:25,450
So three key areas that present expansive global health challenges or global health access challenges, are access to health services more broadly,

105
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,390
and we'll delve a little bit into that, livelihoods and humanitarian crises.

106
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,420
In terms of access to health services, a couple that I'll touch on, they're expansive, but are social and health system issues.

107
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,740
So you're looking at systemic issues. In terms of social,

108
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:48,940
you'll see gender bias in some countries among health providers or even individually in certain regions, in areas, rural,

109
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,170
even in the U.S., you'll see some maybe some gender bias even in certain cities and states.

110
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:59,120
You'll also, misinformation is a new and emerging threat to global health challenges.

111
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,990
And social stigma around global health issues presents a challenge to people accessing in the health services they need.

112
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,690
Also, negative influence on health access among family members. If there are mother-in-laws, if there are in-laws broadly,

113
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,340
if there are spouses or partners that restrict family members from accessing health services,

114
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,250
that's a global health challenge, that could end up stressing the system

115
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,990
if someone gets sick, really, really sick later and it'll stress maybe an already really stressed health system.

116
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,720
So we consider that to be one of the global health,

117
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,710
one of the more expansive global health challenges. I also want to share gender based violence has increased in the midst of COVID-19,

118
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,900
and that's something that a lot of organizations are working through and working with case managers domestically

119
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,980
and internationally to identify and provide support to people who are experiencing gender based violence. And it

120
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,960
particularly is imperative to address sexual and reproductive health access for women.

121
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:01,370
Health system issues. In some context, there's an insufficient number of providers available to serve the patient demand.

122
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,120
There may be also a lack of providers within a reasonable proximity. There may be,

123
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,260
there may be several in country, but perhaps not within a reasonable proximity in rural communities.

124
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,310
You see this in the U.S. as well. There's also a lack of mental health providers.

125
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,720
I think it's an emerging issue and it's being addressed more globally within the international context,

126
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,280
specifically, the need to address mental health and ensure that service providers are available.

127
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,890
And then infrastructure challenges, degraded health facilities, lack of sufficient or appropriate supplies,

128
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,410
that presents a significant health care challenge. I'll quickly delve into livelihoods and humanitarian crises.

129
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,000
This is how intersectional global health and, more broadly, public health is.

130
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,100
Livelihood. Lack of job opportunities, especially for youth, can prevent access to critical health services.

131
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,370
A lack of sufficient income to pay for health and medicine. So livelihoods again, and a lack of sufficient income to pay for food and housing

132
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,970
needed to maintain your health if you're on a treatment regimen for any health issue,

133
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,430
but also to prevent the sudden onset or acquiring of certain diseases or transmission of them.

134
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,870
You need good food, quality food, healthy food,

135
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:13,150
but also access to the food that's not tainted and adequate housing to prevent disease transmission and also to support medical treatment regimen,

136
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:20,760
as I mentioned before. And finally, the fourth expansive global health challenge is humanitarian crises or a humanitarian crisis.

137
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,080
This either sudden onset, or protracted. Threats to existing,

138
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,720
crises presents threats to existing health care facilities and providers depending on what the threat is.

139
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:39,760
Be it political, be it something that's related to environmental or climate related threats to the health system,

140
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,870
and they can stress the health system. But also, they inhibit the lack of ability to protect the spread of disease in certain contexts.

141
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:54,060
And we'll talk about contexts in different spheres and standards and a little bit.

142
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,020
Actually, we'll talk about it now. So context for global health.

143
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,200
They're three key different context than you should think about.

144
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,860
So as you're learning frameworks and approaches and thinking about global health disease areas and global health priorities,

145
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,820
what does that mean in a context, in different contexts? So in a crisis in conflict slash humanitarian context,

146
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,470
how are you going to share the provision of water? A tsunami just hit a certain country or a certain region.

147
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,120
How are you going to ensure the provision of healthy water, their income to Spear humanitartian standards?

148
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,350
And we'll talk about that in a little bit, and I'll share some resources for you to continue your studies.

149
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:37,370
There's also what we call development context. And then third, we also have Nexus/ Humanitarian Development-Peace context.

150
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:44,910
And in those context, those are communities that are coming out of crisis and really need a different approach by collaborators,

151
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:52,470
by global health practitioners and researchers in making sure that what's being implemented really is helping to build resilience

152
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:58,560
and ensuring that, that community can transition to a development context as they're transitioning out of a conflict one.

153
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:06,690
Two pictures, I'll put you touch on these pictures and then we'll talk about these three context and that'll take us next to frameworks.

154
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,840
But one context,

155
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:16,970
I put here is in Bangladesh, a humanitarian response of Rohingya, of the Rohingya refugee crisis, and you'll see the reference to that picture.

156
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:24,420
This is from 2019 in Bangladesh. And then what we call a more development context, where it's a little bit more stable,

157
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,060
you aren't facing sort of some instability or maybe some violent outbreak, so to speak.

158
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:41,100
This is in Uganda and it's a blood transfusion service or blood bank that was newly reopened with the U.S. mission in Uganda.

159
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,960
So just showing you another healthy initiative that was funded by the Global Health Initiative,

160
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,960
essentially a global health stakeholder in a different context. I want to touch back on intercrisis context.

161
00:15:51,960 --> 00:16:00,690
These are concepts that are experiencing sudden onset or protracted crises due to natural disasters, political unrest and or social unrest.

162
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,670
So it can be climate related, or can be political, or it can be social.

163
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,610
You'll learn it, one of really the most critical areas

164
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,820
to prevent against violent extremism in some countries is really ensuring that you have jobs or that people are

165
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:23,460
incentivized and have access to jobs so they don't have to transition into violent extremism to survive for a livelihood.

166
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,690
So there are many ways beyond health, when we talk about the definition of global health, there are many ways to prevent global health issues.

167
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:37,680
Some of them are more social and political and related to citizen engagement. Going back to the crisis and conflict humanitarian settings,

168
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:47,430
one of the resources and really the industry standard in ensuring access to human right services are the Sphere humanitarian standards,

169
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,090
and we'll talk about that in a little bit. The development context,

170
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,340
it's pretty much the context, or a region or country that's not in the midst of a crisis

171
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,570
or conflict and the resources or infrastructure are relatively stable.

172
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,290
And finally, the Nexus context reflects to communities that again,

173
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,080
that are transitioned out of crises, and they require an adapted multinational support response.

174
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,850
I want to point out that within the same country, you can have both humanitarian and development contexts.

175
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,960
More recently we saw in Houston, Texas, there was more of a humanitarian context where there was a crisis in environmental

176
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,440
crises related to lot loss of energy and loss of resources among a lot of people.

177
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:35,250
So within the United States, we had a different state or different area or region that required crisis or humanitarian response,

178
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:43,680
while other areas required your usual community development response or community development implementation of global health,

179
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,570
of global health initiative. So I want to give you just pretty much some context.

180
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,270
When you think about global health, also think about how context can influence,

181
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:57,720
can affect how those initiatives are implemented. I'll quickly review two resources and two standards

182
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,730
and then we'll close out this session. I recommend, I highly recommend you study the sustainable development goals.

183
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:13,620
The sustainable development goals consist of 17 distinct goals that were agreed upon in 2015.

184
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:22,530
And I believe there are 169 indicators that are affiliated with all of these 17 sustainable development goals.

185
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:31,850
And it's been signed on by, I believe,193 of what we call country partners, or state partners with the United Nations.

186
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:39,840
But the United Nations convened a meeting, or a summit, in 2015 in New York at its headquarters and developed these sustainable development goals,

187
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,490
and these are part of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals agenda.

188
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,280
But, when you look at them, look at the indicators for no poverty,

189
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,320
look at the indicators for zero hunger in 2030, you'll see that they're very interdisciplinary.

190
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,750
In a way that the previous what we call Millennium Development Goals are not, they are very much interdependent, so

191
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,470
there's an understanding that

192
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:09,710
hunger is related to crises, that hunger is related to environmental degradation and loss of crops in some agricultural communities.

193
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:16,430
You'll see, though, they're very intersectional. So I encourage you to read through all 17 of those sustainable development goals.

194
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:21,290
And look at the indicators and all of those associated frameworks with them.

195
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:27,170
You'll also note, that a lot of corporate social responsibility reports, report against sustainable development goals.

196
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,490
So there's been really sort of a collaboration among the NGO sector,

197
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:37,760
the private sector and other sectors to really align, and report against the sustainable development goals.

198
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,140
Next, talking about humanitarian context.

199
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:50,330
This is a very last framework we'll talk about, or resource. With the Sphere humanitarian standards relates to humanitarian context.

200
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:56,690
So when you think about the sustainable development goals, the humanitarian aid sector also got together and said,

201
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,380
you know what, we have to have this makes sense for us because these indicators and these goals,

202
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,420
these 17 sustainable development goals haven't necessarily been fully tailored to development context that are severely resource drained,

203
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:15,350
especially with sudden onset crises. So you'll see. I shared a link here to the Sphere humanitarian standards.

204
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:21,160
You can review the humanitarian standard guide online. You can click through the website and really see that information.

205
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:29,930
But I'll share that the standard, the Sphere standards were developed by humanitarian professionals, really around four key technical areas: water supply,

206
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:36,820
sanitation and hygiene promotion, food security and nutrition, shelter and settlement, and health.

207
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,230
But what does that mean in humanitarian context? If you know,

208
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,640
what meant bottled water in Houston, Texas, and in the midst of a loss of electricity resources,

209
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,060
in another context, where a tsunami just hit, it might mean finding water that's not near a toxic site,

210
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,080
that you can take and then sanitize so that it's safe to drink and you can set up a water station.

211
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,620
So it's important to kind of have this framework, and these Sphere humanitarian standards, to help ground everyone.

212
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,030
And what sort of development standards mean in the humanitarian context. Really quickly,

213
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,250
again, looking at those these technical chapters: wash, food, shelter and health.

214
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:20,000
You know, when you sort of unpack wash, it means hygiene promotion, making sure there's a water supply,

215
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,380
making sure there is excretion management, making sure there's vector control of diseases.

216
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,690
Remember, we were talking about how to control diseases and, you know, humanitarian setting or a different setting.

217
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:35,930
It's vector control, solid waste management and watching disease outbreaks in health care settings.

218
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,120
You can read through the others in terms of food, shelter and health. I want to talk about the foundation chapters.

219
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:49,610
These are what humanitarian organizations have agreed are the right to life with dignity principles that should be maintained in humanitarian settings.

220
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,850
The humanitarian charter talks about the right to life with dignity,

221
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,840
the right to receive humanitarian assistance and the right to protection and security.

222
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,540
How are you going to set up schools when schools have been demolished

223
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,650
in a country? What is going to happen for people who are displaced, families who are displaced?

224
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:10,130
What happens when there's job loss or loss of crops and livelihoods? How do you then help communities that are in that much of a crisis?

225
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,310
How do you set up shelter and education centers?

226
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:22,910
So these standards really kind of set up minimum standards that everyone can agree on and adhere to, that protects the rights of dignity for everyone.

227
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:28,390
There's also the pure core humanitarian standards that talk about appropriate is relevance of interventions,

228
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:34,820
that also talks about coordination and complementarity and what is offered, but also in strengthening local capacity.

229
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:42,710
So when they are transitioning out of crisis, they are building resilience and transitioning into ideally long term, a development context.

230
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,470
So really supporting local capacity. So, yes, food aid may need to be shipped externally from other countries.

231
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,900
But then how are you also supporting the growing of agriculture, the resurgence of growing their, of communities

232
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,340
developing their own food sources and being able to sustain themselves through livelihood?

233
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,970
And then there some protection principles, avoiding exposure to other people, a system recovery from violations and help people to claim their rights.

234
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:10,550
So setting a grievance system in ways for people to be protected.

235
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,430
And that's it for this session. Thank you. I hope we met the objectives that we discussed.

236
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,440
And I'm looking forward to delving into the next session.
