1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,580
Recording is on. So from set one to this evening.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,080
Today we're talking about aerosols.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,990
So you recall we during our occupational unit here, we talked about the fundamentals of gas and vapors.

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,810
And last time we talked about sampling gas is sort of built on those principles and we talked about fundamentals of aerosol.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:39,290
So today we're going to talk about sampling for aerosols, building on those principles that we talked about a couple classes ago.

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,600
So. Here we go. Air sampling first ourselves.

7
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,860
So we're going to talk about our general approach rationale.

8
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,730
So a quick review of what we had talked about early in the semester about how the respiratory system works.

9
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,860
It interacts with particular matter in our songs.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,610
And then the CGA linkage has a detail, much more detail approach than that.

11
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:15,670
Oh, sure. So we're going to talk primarily about HGH, which will get you what you need to know for the current ecosystem regulations on this as well.

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,770
Talk about the different sampling methods and a bit of detail, kind of like we did last time with the gases and vapors.

13
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:34,450
We'll review. I forgot about my show and tell again if anybody wasn't here last time I am, that won't work.

14
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,470
But you can see what anybody wants to do.

15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,879
The same number of people are here and we're going to talk a lot more about filters.

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,410
So that's brought couple extras. All right.

17
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:57,610
So if you recall those, those are the same ones. A period of time, it's no big deal, some sort of pump tubing and then a collector.

18
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:05,800
And last time we talked, a lot of times gas and vapors, it's that, you know, most popular is those glass tubes that have sort of material in them.

19
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,290
Now we're moving to aerosol. So our most common way of collecting is with a filter.

20
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,020
And you pull the air through the pump, pass the filter,

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
and then you can measure what's on the filter and divide by the volume of air that you've collected.

22
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,040
So last time we talked about the three different types of collection mechanisms for gas and vapors, now we're moving back into aerosols,

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:39,910
which we have our five collection mechanisms diffusion, impaction, settling, interception and electrostatic or thermal precipitation.

24
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,140
So this is going to help us in our collection.

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:56,480
So those top three, the sedimentation, inertia and diffusion are much the most important for one deposition, as we talked about before.

26
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,830
We're also going to touch on electrostatic and thermal just briefly here.

27
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:07,700
Those don't play as much of a role in airways, but they are methods that can be used for sampling aerosols.

28
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:19,430
So that's where these kind of converge. So the way they behave in the environment and respiratory tract, we also use those and how we sample it.

29
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,600
When it comes to sampling, inertia and diffusion are the most important factors there.

30
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,399
They're more important than sedimentation. Sedimentation, as we talked about earlier in the semester,

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,890
it can be important for deposition of certain regions, but we usually don't use segmentation for sampling.

32
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:48,570
I will touch on a couple of examples, just so you know that they're they were out there historically, but they're not typically used much in practice.

33
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:59,370
And if you recall, in general, our inertial and sedimentation forces increase as our particle diameter increase increases.

34
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,970
So the diameter or aerodynamic dynamic diameter is that goes up inertial segmentation.

35
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:12,720
And much more important, as that particle size goes down, the fusion forces become more important.

36
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,490
And that'll come into play as we'll see as you collect these.

37
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:32,340
So Russ from over versus told us. So this came about quite a while ago and the purpose to make this differentiation was the effects

38
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,649
in the lung are thought to be much different depending on where things deposit within the airways.

39
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,530
So something that is impacting the lungs, you know, that gas exchange region,

40
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,130
if that's particularly important for the lung itself, is the target organ.

41
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,180
A lot of times we are talking about something called respirable dust.

42
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,420
It's rust provoking all the way into the deep parts of the lung.

43
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:04,290
Historically, for things that could be irritating throughout the airways or could be absorbed through upper airways as well,

44
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,890
that might wish you might tell you to to measure for total dust.

45
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,610
And that's how ACG, HGH, had done it for a while back in the distant past.

46
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,690
They've gotten a little bit more refined more recently,

47
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,250
but I thought it was worth touching on because some of the standards may still talk about rust versus total dust.

48
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:36,599
Some examples are crystal and silica. A lot of times we're going to go for that rust, propulsive rust purple port portion of the dust rust.

49
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,900
Things like Portland cement can create reactive airways.

50
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,640
You're going to look at more total total dust historically.

51
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,110
And we'll talk about how that's been refined here in a little bit.

52
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:02,630
So the main way we use the main thing we collect aerosols with is filters and there's several different types.

53
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,740
And we'll talk a little bit about these. There's cellulose fiber.

54
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,900
We just introduced the concept. We don't I've never used these kind.

55
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,100
You mean I've never encountered these. Just want to include on the list of the comprehensive glass fiber polymer membrane.

56
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:27,740
Those are the two more more common types. Then we also have something called clear for membrane and polyurethane foam that we'll touch on later.

57
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,230
So how do filters work? It's based on their their physical structure.

58
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,100
So what they're made out of and how they're shaped and oriented.

59
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,160
So here's the membrane filter.

60
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,900
This is a top view and this has branched polymer strands.

61
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:55,780
So I mentioned there's PVC in some other types. So it's these branch polymer strands layered on top of each other and form a pattern

62
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,540
where they form with what are called pores that the air can travel through.

63
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,940
This is what a cross-section would look like.

64
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:15,100
And there's going to be channels that the air can get through, through through the multiple layers, glass, fiber filter, same sort of concept.

65
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,520
It just doesn't really form these poor sizes.

66
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,510
It's fiberglass strands, like layers and layers and layers.

67
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,990
So you can actually under a microscope, you don't see those poor signs.

68
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:37,630
So it's a more torturous path for the air to get through, but it can collect a lot more stuff effectively within the embedded structure.

69
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,880
So they're kind of different principles.

70
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,580
You get a lot of surface collection with the membrane filters, whereas it gets much more embedded in the glass fiber filters.

71
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:53,560
And that becomes important with what you might want to be measuring can be related to what your desired properties are there.

72
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,260
Let's bomb. Here is the nuclear power filter.

73
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:04,090
This is much more manufactured, much more, you know, straight through, and that would be more of a specialized application.

74
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,990
So the top two are much more common in practice.

75
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,140
So again, I'm just listing cellulose, fiber filters, filter paper.

76
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,430
We're not going to talk about it. Glass, fiber filters.

77
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,860
These are usually primarily implemented in high volume sampling.

78
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:37,640
And we'll come back to why that is. So the most common we encounter in industrial hygiene type of applications is the polymer membrane filters.

79
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,630
So they come with names like MCE, PVC, P2P.

80
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,790
Those all stand for different types of of synthetics.

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,100
So you have mixed cellulose ester some key PVC as polyvinyl chloride, of course.

82
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,150
And then P2P is is a tough one. So interesting.

83
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:05,090
You know, I study phthalates and PE fast and basically you know it's bound to or implicated in those chemicals.

84
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,320
But kind of like we talked about even with one four dioxane.

85
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,150
The whole dioxane, however, actually started from environmental sampling filters,

86
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,480
the chemicals used that are so just that's an aside sort of an ironic aside that all the

87
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,660
stuff that we're concerned about might actually be used in how we go about measuring.

88
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,780
Pollution and things. Okay.

89
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,500
So some microscope pictures.

90
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:43,240
So here's a glass fiber filter against these layered bits of fiber fiberglass that their house path pass through and find its way.

91
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:49,250
And it's going to trap a lot of contaminants of interest. She put a lot of air through it.

92
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,700
This is the MCP filter mix, cellulose, ester filter.

93
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,450
So these polymer filters will come with something called it for size.

94
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,230
And that's see these, these holes, that's what they refer to.

95
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,040
It's the pores that can kind of go through the filter.

96
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:18,260
So this if I had to guess, I'd say this one probably comes with a two microbe micrometer pore size for that filter.

97
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,820
On the left is a PVC filter.

98
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:34,770
This one's labeled as having will have a key with the sizes, but it says it's got five micrometer pore size and that's what these are.

99
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,550
Same as what I did back then, but it's relative relative to what we're talking about.

100
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,590
You can take those caps off from back on. I'm not going to use these. They're old.

101
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,390
So this one left. That's what that is. What I'm passing on now is the PDC filter.

102
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,010
And on the right is the PTF to filter this one slip.

103
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,040
It was having a one meter process. So again, different filters for different applications.

104
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,550
We talked about, for example, Nilesh methods.

105
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,020
It will tell you what types of filters are applicable to a specific method.

106
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,950
So back to the glass fiber filters. Some advantages of those are they're not microscopic.

107
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,520
Anybody remember you know what that means?

108
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,770
It doesn't like absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Yeah, right.

109
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,330
So kind of like what we talked about last time we compared like charcoal versus silica gel.

110
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:41,480
Silica gel comes in, you know, you order something off Amazon or your multivitamin bottle of that, it soaks up water very, very well.

111
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,900
So it's very high risk of it. Glass fiber filters are not.

112
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,410
So, you know, this might come into play if you have a high humidity environment.

113
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:56,270
Again, you're going to want to we're typically going to reference the published validated methods that we have access to to guide us.

114
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:03,560
But it's good to know some of this background, to explain some of these decisions and other things that has low pressure drop,

115
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,930
meaning the pump doesn't have to work extra hard to pull air through the filter and also high capacity.

116
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,250
So remember back I said these are primarily used in high volume sampling that that

117
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,220
a piece to blue highlighted ones are really why that is a low pressure drop.

118
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,719
You know, you don't have to have the most powerful people doing, you know, pulling a lot of hair.

119
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,050
You have to have good capacity. So these tend to be used more in ambient air applications.

120
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:53,080
You also know high efficiency collection or heaven, which will come back to a little bit here, disadvantages for mechanical strength.

121
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:00,850
So even though it's used for high volume samplers, it's not something that's going to hold up to very extreme environments.

122
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,299
Might have impurities in it, not digestible.

123
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,170
So if you have chemicals used in within the mixture of of air, you may not be able to determine what it is.

124
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:17,440
So this, again, probably more more useful for ambient air sampling for particulate matter,

125
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,970
something that you can measure through which is weighing and filter and also is not good for microscopic analysis either.

126
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:34,990
So has its own usefulness but doesn't cover a very wide range for what we might be interested in in occupational settings.

127
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,270
Back to our polymer membrane filters. Again, these are the most common in these industrial hygiene occupational settings.

128
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:52,340
A lot of advantages here, controlled for size. So we show those microscopic photos kind of getting out what that means.

129
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,470
High purity. So this helps if you want to analyze it later. You don't have to worry as much about background contamination.

130
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,510
They just will. Again, you can take these back to the lab and extract chemicals of interest and measure them.

131
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,340
They can also be used for microscopic analysis, which, as we'll see,

132
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:21,410
is what the primary methods are for things like asbestos fibers and things like that and collection efficiency.

133
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,050
Not as good as the, you know, the high volume, but it does collect efficiently.

134
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,860
There are many different types for different settings, and it's much more durable.

135
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:41,000
Disadvantage is low capacity. So this is where, you know, we talk about flow rates of 2 to 4, 1 to 4 liters per minute here,

136
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,560
whereas, you know, your environmental ambient sampling might be 30 to 300 liters per minute.

137
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,279
So, you know, you got to keep that for these types of filters.

138
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:57,560
And it's more effective at those for flow rates because it does maxed out with that surface collection based on the properties of the filter,

139
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,170
high pressure drop, you know, the pump has to be able to withstand that.

140
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:13,190
And you might have varying levels of microscopic city where, you know, very tiny, very humid environments.

141
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,210
You just want to make sure it's not above a certain limit with your.

142
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:24,040
Validated methods. And that only comes to play if you're taking it back to the lab and analyzing it anyway.

143
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,679
What's the chemical interest? Is interacting with the water?

144
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:36,430
It shouldn't make as much of a difference that comes into play when you're using a weight basis or you're analyzing the mass collected.

145
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,480
So just a bit more on what we mean by gravimetric.

146
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,230
So once you collect that sample, there's two main ways we get that mass for our numerator on our concentration.

147
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:53,490
The first one is called gravimetric. That's this is basically just a fancy word for for weighing the filter before and after.

148
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:59,100
Right. So you have a filter. So these. All these guys.

149
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,790
These all have this this code number. This is because the lab, we ordered them from three ways.

150
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,780
Every single one in a very environmentally controlled environment through very precise scales.

151
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,100
So they know exactly the pre weight of each of these before they send them out.

152
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:22,230
And then you collect your sample and you send it back to them and they can post with which to say what the mass of.

153
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,400
Particulate matter is on a filter. So with that, of course, you'd have to know what you were collecting.

154
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,760
It makes you make sense of it if it's just nuisance dust. So that's that's one way to do it.

155
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,770
But again, it has to be very environmentally controlled.

156
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,450
If you've collected my water vapor, that's going to impact your measured.

157
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:55,120
That difference. One way to get around that water vapor concern is something called the matched weight filters approach,

158
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,920
where they actually would include two filters because one collects the sample,

159
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,979
the other one remains clean, and that can help control for any environmental factors that might happen

160
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,059
between the lab and the field and back that could throw off your measurements.

161
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:16,510
So that's that's another approach. It's trying to correct some of those some of those factors.

162
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,690
I was my volume. I cannot hear out of his ear because it's a small room, so that helps.

163
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,890
Okay, so that's the gravimetric approach.

164
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:36,570
So again, something like nuisance dust or if you know exactly what the air assault is, this might be how you do it.

165
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,650
It has to be cheaper than chemically analyzing it.

166
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:51,690
Sometimes we do both. We'll have the filter prepaid and postpaid and then sent to the lab to be digested, extracted and analyzed.

167
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,160
So an analytical method. After you collect your sample, you send it.

168
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,660
You use laboratory techniques so you know, it could be solvent extraction,

169
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,010
all kinds of different things to be used depending on what the target chemicals of interest are.

170
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,730
And you measure it that way. Right.

171
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:18,839
So you might solvent to absorb it, you know how much mass of solvent there is and you can measure the mass of the chemical

172
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,160
of interest in that solvent mixture and then carefully to get your concentration.

173
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:32,100
So two different approaches and depending on what your interest is, you might be more likely to use one or the other or both.

174
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,800
Questions on that. So the goal here is to get that mass of the contaminant for a greater.

175
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:55,640
So here's some example applications. So the glass fiber filter, there's there are certain methods that call for that.

176
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,780
Again, it might be more likely to be your your home high volume ambient type of work.

177
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,160
You'll notice asbestos. That means it might be good for microscope usage.

178
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,810
There's some others. Privacy is very common. Again, that's the one I have here.

179
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,740
You can click a wide range of things. We use these for all three of these.

180
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:30,950
In the past, PNAS that's going to be a gravimetric method, um, silica that's going to be,

181
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,240
there's a few different ways like require X-ray diffraction and some other things.

182
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,870
Metals typically have two disorder disordered use, either atomic absorption or ICP in this sequence.

183
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,410
So not that you have to remember these methods. It's just some are gravimetric and some are going to be analytical.

184
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,070
And then the Teflon filters also might have some some applications as well.

185
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,860
So a bit more on our capture mechanisms. So A, B and C here.

186
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:13,320
So the air is flowing this way. The zero solution is quite confusing pointing that way.

187
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:23,610
But so our air flow is going this way. A is a particle that do not miss this flow line and it's being intercepted by the filter cross-section.

188
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,310
So it's just kind of coming in, barely coming into contact and it's intercepted.

189
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,210
Whereas B, that's a, you know, it's slamming into it as an impaction.

190
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:39,250
It can't the particles big enough, it can follow that flow line around this barrier, whereas A, it might it almost gets there.

191
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,360
B, it can't make that corner. And then C is our diffusion.

192
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:50,560
That random movement sometimes will result in it contacting the filter material.

193
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:02,000
This is just another picture illustrating these mechanisms a little more professionally drawn,

194
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,620
but the text is hard to read, so that type one is interception.

195
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,529
Again, it's getting around the barrier, but it's still being intercepted on the side or impaction.

196
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,250
It's not able to make the turn because the part was too big and dense.

197
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:26,179
And then our diffusion there on the bottom and this is just kind of theoretical cross-section of a fish that is super zoomed in.

198
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,210
Right? That's. The three main ones.

199
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,130
So again, the top two are going to be most important for our larger particles down here.

200
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:48,590
More important for the small particles. So when I talk about a poor size, so I think there's one that passed around a little, say five micrometers.

201
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,890
This has a five micrometer poor size. So, I mean, any particle less than five micrometers is just going to pass right through this pores.

202
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,170
I hope not, because a lot of times that's what we're interested in. Right.

203
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:08,370
So, you know, that confused that confused. A lot of people, even professionals in the field, have asked me this question.

204
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,480
But that diffusion is what really ranks at the smaller particle that can collect those.

205
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,890
So here's a graph showing a HEPA filter.

206
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:26,400
So this yellow line is diffusion. You see, the collection efficiency is very, very high for the small particles.

207
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:32,340
And that's why, you know, even though the poor size is larger than the size of some of the particles of interest,

208
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:39,090
it's still able to collect a high proportion of those those particles.

209
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:47,880
The blue is our interception. Again, the question efficiency gets better as the particle size gets larger and the same with compaction.

210
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:57,110
Yeah. To follow effective is relying on diffusion when you're kind of predicting random Brownian motion.

211
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:05,450
That's a good question. And I guess it's good because they've proven time and again that it works.

212
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,360
But yeah, that's a good question.

213
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:13,340
So it's it's I guess it's reliable enough that, you know, it's going to move enough to hit something on its way through.

214
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:22,460
So this is a generic figure, but yet it's applicable pretty much universally.

215
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,140
So, you know, the flow rate can change that.

216
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,910
You can have a graph like this for any filter and it's going to change based on flow rate.

217
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,440
But you always see the lowest efficiency at 0.3 micrometers.

218
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,630
So A, you know, this comes into play when people talk about HEPA filters because you know how you define a HEPA filter.

219
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:54,020
HEPA filter is rated as at least 99.97% efficient at 0.3 micrometers.

220
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:01,790
And the reason they rate it that way is because that's always going to be the lowest spot of efficiency because of these different mechanisms.

221
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,870
That's kind of where that the trough occurs. So that's a little trivia factoid for you.

222
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,190
So you can change filters, you can change velocities.

223
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:22,340
The curve is going to look, you know, from the details of the curve regarding efficiency and the shape of the curve might be different,

224
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:30,530
but you're always going to see this dip at point three micrometers. And they've tested this time and again and it's shown the same thing.

225
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,890
And again with the particles, it's more diffusion. And then as you get larger, it's more the interception and the.

226
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,580
And again, this is applicable to. Also things.

227
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,750
Any questions on that deficiency?

228
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:01,540
We don't get much more into the filtration quality that take control of hazards and ventilation to get more into that.

229
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,610
Things like, you know, HEPA and Merv ratings got a lot of attention last few years with the pandemic.

230
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,260
Okay. So this is a little bit more on facets.

231
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:27,700
So when I talk about cassette, this is what I'm talking about. So this is again a PVC five micrometer and I believe this is a.

232
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:36,640
So five is the poor size. And it's a 37 millimeter cassette, meaning that's the diameter of the cross-section here.

233
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,960
So that's what this is. And this one happens to be a closed space concert.

234
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,710
Versus open faced wouldn't have this top plastic part.

235
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,660
It would just be the filter with nothing else. So.

236
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:03,170
For Asbestos use. A special cassette has a conductive cowl.

237
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,550
They call it in an open face. Anybody.

238
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,010
You're right here with that asbestos experience. Yeah.

239
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,340
Did you sample it or. Yeah, I did. In the field or in the lab with the microscope or both?

240
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:26,010
Yeah. It was underground in the mine. Okay. So when I followed the consultant around, basically nothing.

241
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,900
Change of purposes. Okay. Do you remember what the filter cassettes looked like?

242
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,280
Um, there's no longer any special insight on it.

243
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,630
Yeah. Do you remember what color they were or anything that was from the start?

244
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:46,220
Yeah. Yeah. So they used the open phase and something called the conductive cowl.

245
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:53,000
The conductive part is to keep the static electricity from attracting the fibers to the walls

246
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:02,840
and then open face because it gives you a better distribution on the filter for microscope work.

247
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,360
So here's a picture showing some different ones.

248
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,740
So again, this is the 37 millimeter might get passed around.

249
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:20,900
You have the closed face versus the open base. These black ones are the conductive powder you see there longer.

250
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:27,290
And that cowl helps give a streamlined flow before it hits the filter.

251
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:39,050
So the reason it's dark and color is explained here, carbon black, which is to reduce static charge,

252
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,730
and then the cowl is the full strainer, so you get a straight flow again,

253
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:51,080
the goal being to get a good distribution of those fibers on the filter because you have to use a microscope if you're just using weight,

254
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,290
you know, or other chemical means, that wouldn't be as important.

255
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,280
But for things that use a microscope,

256
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:05,930
you want that nice distribution because the way you measure it is you're looking at just a small portion of the filter,

257
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,760
counting the fibers and then extrapolating that to a larger area. And if you don't have a.

258
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,729
A consistent distribution across it is going to bias here your whole investment and

259
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,990
it's not really feasible to discount the whole filter because it's too is too much.

260
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,400
So that's why they have a special collector with a flow regulator.

261
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,650
But the flow straightener and the whole thing fits.

262
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,520
Yeah. So why would you use the microscope instead of just using the bait?

263
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,780
Because it could be mixed in with non. Asbestos non fiber material in there.

264
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:55,490
So that's to get at the specific make up of fibers and they look at the aspect ratio as well because that's important that 3 to 1 aspect ratio.

265
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,310
To to verify that. Yeah, good question. Yeah.

266
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:09,190
Seems like a lot of work, right? But yeah, if you knew it was all asbestos within a certain size range, then yeah,

267
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,290
you could use a different method, probably just waiting, but they usually want you to be more specific.

268
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,159
A little bit more an open versus closed face.

269
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:30,190
So the open face again is used for microscope, for regular analysis that you're just using pre and post way for chemical means.

270
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:36,130
A lot of times you'll see that that caused face because that can prevent things from other stuff from getting on your filter.

271
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:43,540
One thing you have to worry about is if your flow rate is too high on this close face,

272
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,390
you can start bringing air in from the sides and the big particles won't be able to make that turn.

273
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,230
So you might actually get an under sampling of the larger particles.

274
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:59,770
So you just want to keep that in mind. So hopefully any method you're using that's validated and published will take that into account.

275
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,200
But if you're if you're ramping up your flow rate, that's one risk that you have to.

276
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:12,800
I have a bias for smaller particles because larger ones don't fit inside that inlet.

277
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,370
With the change in air direction as it approaches.

278
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,100
And then, as we said it, the microscopic microscopic methods don't use that open space.

279
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:39,390
I just covered this. Inertial effects from high school rates on the whole space are possible, something you won't pay attention to.

280
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:47,730
And then you can have sedimentation effects. If your floor rates too slow or your particles are too big, you could get some sort of sedimentation.

281
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:52,800
But usually we would aim of this upside down.

282
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,510
So you're pulling up there, up.

283
00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:02,489
So, you know, you could have some particles that are big enough to get in, but not quite enough to get their sediment sedimentation out.

284
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:12,150
Again, these are probably small effects, but in certain conditions they might be important if you're interested in larger particles or like I said,

285
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:18,810
if for some reason you're trying to increase your flow rate above what the method says, so you're trying to reach that limit of detection.

286
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:29,219
One way to do that is to increase Florida. But if it's above the the published range, this these types of things might happen on the open face.

287
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:38,220
You tend to want to position it horizontally. And again, in some circumstance, you could have some some losses based on these mechanisms as well.

288
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,390
Any questions on open space versus closed space? Perhaps something you thought you'd be thinking about today.

289
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,920
But it is important, too, when it comes to the details of aerosol sampling.

290
00:31:53,350 --> 00:32:01,220
Okay. So back to the comparison of samplers versus the airway or the respiratory tract.

291
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,370
So I showed this slide early in the semester. We talked about particle diameter.

292
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:12,790
So in this case, we're talking about aerodynamic diameter, which is something we all know about now and then,

293
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,450
what region they tend to deposit in and through which mechanism.

294
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:23,950
So you have the nasal pharyngeal region during the ten days of pharyngeal and trickle, bronchial 5 to 10 micrometers.

295
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:35,110
Then you get gas exchange region five and below tends to dominate impaction and sedimentation again up here and then sedimentation.

296
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,190
Once you get into the gas exchange reason,

297
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:47,450
the smaller particles and the airflow is so low that it gives them a chance to just settle out through sedimentation.

298
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:55,060
And then the very small ones is through diffusion. So again, the same mechanisms we're talking about with sampling are important and.

299
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:01,130
The respiratory system. Segmentation plays a bigger role in the body than it does in our samplers.

300
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:13,580
Okay. So we talked about total total particular total dust and reasonable dust in the 1990s East Smooth moved to make it a little more specific.

301
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,760
So now they talk about inhalable particulate mass thoracic particle mass and rest verbal particulate matter.

302
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:26,930
So the rest is the same. But they they broke up the larger particles a bit more to accommodate things that

303
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,730
might be more important in the middle airway region or total airway region.

304
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:39,620
Um, yeah, that's related to different things having different toxic effects depending on where they end up.

305
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:48,650
So again, you have your airway jet airways appear, the trachea bronchial and then the gas exchange region.

306
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:55,130
And, you know, this might relate to what is impacted most for specific chemical agent.

307
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:02,720
Some things may really irritate the upper airways. Something with that might be less soluble, as we talked about,

308
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:11,300
might get a little bit further before it has warming properties and then you have your wonders of lung toxins.

309
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:18,980
So the takeaway for these next couple of slides is just to show that you have very inhalable particulate matter, thoracic and reasonable.

310
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:28,790
They're not mutually exclusive. So your inhalable includes big particles and everything smaller than your thoracic per particular mask.

311
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,500
It's the mid ones and the small ones. And then the rest of all is just the small.

312
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,430
And this is just overlaying that on a figure of the airways.

313
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:48,630
We have our inhalable thoracic rest burble. And again, inhaled actually contains all three of those.

314
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:54,660
Thoracic contains the thoracic and the respiratory. When we talk about rest of the world, it's all the rest of it.

315
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:01,080
And so that's going to be relevant to how we go about sampling these these regions as well.

316
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,200
So that's it. So that's just reiterating the fact.

317
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:20,340
Zooming in on these collection curves. So the top one goes from 0 to 100 micrometer particle diameter.

318
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,780
This one goes to 50. This one goes to 20 micrometers.

319
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,330
You can see the the collection efficiency of the various ranges.

320
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,320
And we'll talk about that a little bit more here in the.

321
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:44,300
So this is just again, reiterating. What we're talking about and that there's there's some sense.

322
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,720
Okay. Let's talk a little bit more about this collection curves.

323
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,899
So here's here in animal procurement and there's more detail in the booklet for anybody

324
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,610
that has it where you can look at the one I posted from last year on the canvas.

325
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,460
So this is where we talk about our median in diameters and things like that.

326
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,500
So on the left here we have our aerodynamic diameter and it goes up to 100.

327
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:16,390
So this says that for inhalable particles, if you're if you're sampling and have a particle mass to compare with a tube,

328
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:26,169
you want a sample that's going to give you a median cut point of your sample at 100 micrometers, which is actually a pretty large particle.

329
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:32,790
We're talking about inflation. So that's based on kind of similar to the curves we did in previous lectures on the problem.

330
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:42,020
So this is where some of that comes into play. So I was a little more open ended when we get to, okay, first, how do we collect that?

331
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,310
So you have an image with your pump.

332
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:57,420
So Jim Vincent was a professor here when I when I started and he had previously worked over in England as he was a physicist.

333
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,470
He designed a lot of these samplers and unfortunately passed away earlier this year.

334
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,180
But he did a ton of work on, you know, how best to collect this,

335
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:14,020
how to best emulate what the what's going on in the respiratory system with how we collect the sample.

336
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:18,940
So you can get the most representative thing that's going to be relevant to your health event.

337
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:28,540
So what they came up with was a sampler of 15 millimeters diameter and operates at two liters per minute

338
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:37,959
and this one is called the Open Sampler that I guess is working in Scotland at the time when samples were

339
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,920
very widely used comes with a specific flow rate again because you want to get that 50% collection at

340
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:52,810
100 micrometers and that tells you what's inside there and you can pre and post with the entire thing,

341
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,930
you know, the filter itself in this case and that gives you your gravimetric results.

342
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:10,209
It's going to tell you. So yeah, this would connect to your tubing and then a pump and the air goes through there and this is inhalable.

343
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:19,450
So you're trying to get the big particles with. That cut point of that 50% cut point had 100 meter diameter.

344
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,400
So that's going to look different than what we want to do for thoracic.

345
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,959
So it is inhalable when you get to the mid airways, we're talking about thoracic.

346
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,600
This is the kind of cut point or collection efficiency we're looking for with that.

347
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:43,690
So here's our aerodynamic diameter. You can see 50%, about ten micrometers.

348
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:49,000
We want that 50% to be around ten as we talked about. That's what's kind of deposited in that region.

349
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,260
So that's actually how it's defined.

350
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:02,110
So from the recipe, you want your geometric mean or your medium size to be ten with within a certain standard deviation.

351
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,820
So that's things that are going to get to the thoracic or the gas exchange region.

352
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,850
And with that, to do this, we have a pre selector that's going to use the mechanism that we've talked about,

353
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,139
the inertia impaction to separate out the larger particles.

354
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,910
So only the smaller ones get through. And collect it on a filter.

355
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,420
So this we have a company in town.

356
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:34,370
And then we get it. It's going to collect, you know, 2% of particles.

357
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,679
Still at 25. So it doesn't it's not a perfect cup point.

358
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,660
And that's by design because that's not how the body works as well.

359
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:48,080
Right. So the body will let some water particles in. It's just a much smaller fraction.

360
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,380
The higher you get and you don't, everything understands, but it's more than half.

361
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:59,240
And that 50%, that medium point is at ten.

362
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,250
So what does a thoracic one look like?

363
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,510
This one we're using a lot of times impactor plates, that's what it's called,

364
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:20,510
or an impactor particle preselected that the air passes through before it gets to the filter.

365
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:30,410
There's some details here that we need to harp on, but, you know, the particles can bounce around and things like that.

366
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:37,220
So there's ways in the lab to account for that before it gets to the filter to make sure you're collecting what you think you're collecting.

367
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,680
But with these impactors, they'll come with something called the heat card 50.

368
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,970
The EKG 50 is the effective cut off of aerodynamic diameter.

369
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:55,430
So that's the the medium particle diameter by aerodynamics that it's going to collect.

370
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,390
And it will have a huge impact that they sell will come with the full curve.

371
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,020
For that cup point.

372
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:10,970
So it's going to let your smaller particles go through for the most part and trap the larger particles on an impactor so they can't get to the.

373
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,320
Here's a drawing of the impactor.

374
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,260
So again, your smaller particles will be able to have a jet of air coming through.

375
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:34,120
You know, because you're down here somewhere pulling air, you have this impaction plate right in the path of the air path.

376
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,069
The smaller particles can go around the impaction plate, the larger ones, their momentum.

377
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:45,370
We're not able to make the turn and stuff. They're collected on the filter to be measured.

378
00:41:47,170 --> 00:42:03,160
And you can manipulate how how big of particles get collected through the the flow rate and the similar before you can you can adjust that jet size.

379
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,290
So for a given full rate, if you make that jet smaller, it's going to increase that velocity through that rate.

380
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,169
If you make that jet bigger, it's going to decrease the velocity so that higher velocity,

381
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,050
the harder it's going to be for those particles to make that turn.

382
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,020
You can also change this w factor getting that that impactor quick plate closer to that opening.

383
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,910
Again, the closer you get, the harder it's going to be for smaller particles to make the turn.

384
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,300
So that's that's how they do that to get the.

385
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:41,770
The cut point they want and that that curve that they that they want that most reflect what happens in the body.

386
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,950
So, again, you can't 50 is the diameter of aerodynamic diameter, which has a 50% probability of being collected.

387
00:42:52,300 --> 00:43:00,720
The rest goes to the culture. There's just more pictures of the air Airstream.

388
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:07,320
Again, if you make this jet smaller opening, it'll be faster, closer.

389
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,420
Things like that. And then once it gets to the filter, you can then do your gravimetric analysis.

390
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,630
You can do microscopic analysis or chemical analysis.

391
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,730
That's a microscope. Microscopic. It's microscopic, right?

392
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:32,200
And then this is just an example curve showing what how you find that medium which we've done.

393
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:41,460
So how do we do this for thoracic? What do these look like? Here's what's called a PAM Personal Exposure monitor trademarked.

394
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:49,410
It's getting close to the curve that Eastern Edge says is ideal, but not not not perfectly.

395
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,600
And these you can manipulate. So they have these four different points.

396
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,840
They do sell them with a cap of ten micrometers.

397
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,380
So this is it's getting you close to. What you want for that dress.

398
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:07,780
We got to use these. When I was a Christian, I worked in an air pollution lab.

399
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:13,570
We used these to measure personal exposure to ambient air PM10 safety.

400
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,770
But the flow rate is important. Therefore, it will determine what's collected and what's not.

401
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,180
With that, that's Casey again. They just keep coming out with a great product.

402
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:39,780
I don't know. Again, I'm joking. I know I'm not here to advertise for them, but they do have these these samplers that do mimic the HGH thoracic curl.

403
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:46,260
So if thoracic is called for for a particular agent or chemical, just know they do.

404
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:52,709
So things like this. Okay.

405
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:56,760
Let's move to receivable. So again, you have this criteria curve.

406
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,940
This is the old one that the 50% used to be three and a half micrometers.

407
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,730
They've since changed it in the nineties to two four.

408
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,770
So the criterion now is a median point of four years, and that's standard deviation of 1.5.

409
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,450
And that, again, is to sample what can make it to the gas exchange region.

410
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:30,240
So you need a pre selector in your sampling train to separate out the large particles larger than four, not all of them.

411
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:36,000
You want it to follow the distribution, but this is this cut distribution.

412
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:42,030
So here we have our our meeting at four micrometers and collect 1% up to ten micrometers.

413
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,970
But at 50. What are these look like?

414
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:58,190
One of the bigger, more common technologies used in the field for industrial hygiene is the cyclone.

415
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,929
So there's there's different ones. This one happens to be called the door.

416
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:09,140
All cyclone. It's made up nylon runs at about 1.7 meters per minute.

417
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:16,250
So that's close to the two. This works with a little bit different theory.

418
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,800
Instead of an impact, simply. It uses centrifugal force to separate the larger particles.

419
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,500
And then those large particles separate out. And you get your smaller ones on it on a filter.

420
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,780
And this has been tested to. Closely.

421
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,650
Relate to what's what's what's breathed by the body.

422
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,640
So here's another poorly drawn figure we have.

423
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,080
You're coming in here, you come over here pulling air through.

424
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:53,750
Here's the opening to the collector. It comes in as this opening spins around.

425
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:59,210
The larger particles hit the side and either stick on the side or fall to the bottom.

426
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,870
And the larger particles are able to go out this way into the filter.

427
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:15,050
So these are used again for progress report sides particles, different cyclones have different flow rate.

428
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,110
Extremely important to have that flow rate correct here. You're not going to know.

429
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,320
With what you what your cut point was.

430
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:33,290
Oh, and again, if they come with different materials, you know, if you have static at certain things like that, any questions on the site?

431
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:41,370
Well. Here's some different types.

432
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,880
They might look a little differently. It takes a little getting used to because they look a little weird.

433
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:52,890
You know, these are pretty simple, pretty straightforward how you connect them to what these you have to know.

434
00:47:53,190 --> 00:48:00,390
I've seen people hook up the wrong end before, have them all or all sorts of messed up.

435
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,010
That's not going to give you what you want. So it does take a little bit of orientation.

436
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:13,610
Here is again, as Casey has warned, this is how their cut point curve compares to the convention,

437
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,430
like HGH, what they're looking for, but they see the body.

438
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:22,170
So it's a little sharper in that case. But that media is the same.

439
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:28,700
So it's pretty close. This little plastic cactus is where those large purpose collect.

440
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,120
So you can clean that out between sampling. Put it back on.

441
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,250
Some more. They all have different names.

442
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:49,229
Higgins dual tor Oliver PGI has one as KC Wilson for four condiments, different styles, a little bit different shapes.

443
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:59,250
Again, a different shape means you might come with a different flow rate to get that for microliter, you get another thing.

444
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:04,350
People sometimes learn the hard way in the fields to get out there. We talked about calibration last time.

445
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,290
You know, again, with a filter like this, you always want to calibrate your pump collection media in line.

446
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:16,230
So you know this. It's easy to have your pump, your filter.

447
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,460
It won't be the filter you use in the field. You want the same as it.

448
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:30,660
And another tube comes out this end to your calibrator with the cycle, you don't have the way to connect it on the other side.

449
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:38,100
So you actually have to use something like this, a sampling jar or some sort of container that can put the whole cycle in.

450
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,140
So you can get that air flow representative air flow. So you know what the pumps pull.

451
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:51,120
So that's I've seen people do that incorrectly as well. So I just a little side side note sometimes the details are.

452
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,520
Really important. Any questions on cyclones?

453
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,810
Anybody use the cyclone? Yeah. Okay.

454
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:06,050
What else? Those of you taking a lab class get a chance.

455
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:21,020
Okay. Back. An alternative to the cyclone is to use Impactors to get 54 micrometers.

456
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:30,040
So there's different products out there for that as well. So it's using the kind of like we talked about with the thoracic.

457
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:37,209
Same thing, different flow rates. Again, if you have low code, if you're concerned about being low limit detection,

458
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:42,820
you might try to seek out something that uses a kind of comedy, a larger flow rate for that same cut point.

459
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:49,880
Versus something that if you don't consider about overloading your filter, you might opt for something of a lower for it.

460
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,010
Some of these are reusable. Some they say are disposable.

461
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,570
It seems wasteful. But, you know, there's options out there.

462
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:11,959
Know these terms. Again, the point is not perfect because a lot of these these ESXi ones were designed for workplace applications.

463
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,310
I believe these pens down here were designed for a premium 2.5.

464
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:22,910
So that would be maybe something to consider, a reason not to use them in the occupation site.

465
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,020
If you wanted to if you really wanted to get that 4.0 micrometer cut point.

466
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,230
But similar similar design and similar principle.

467
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:44,230
Okay. So that's our three main regions again to go with these and.

468
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:51,520
So if you look at the I don't have it in my pocket today unfortunately you go to your the booklet,

469
00:51:52,030 --> 00:52:02,580
you look up your aerosol of interest in the list, it'll have a little notation on you'll see I the uh, you'll have a little notation.

470
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:09,950
I'll tell you which region you want to collect. Some will be inhalable, so we'll have a T for thoracic and a lot of them will have R for arrestable.

471
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:16,530
So. Okay. The next thing that I just want to introduce is something called a cascade impactor.

472
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,190
So there are times where, you know, you maybe want a little more information.

473
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:27,720
Maybe it's not just about comparing with your own your operations cause you want to maybe you want to know what's the particle size distribution,

474
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,520
because that can help you think about, you know, are we concerned about resveratrol?

475
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:39,660
Should we be concerned about inhalable? Also can be useful for are the particles the size that might settle on the skin.

476
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:47,820
Person knowing the distribution can also be helpful for how to control at best ventilation or other approaches.

477
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:54,120
So one way you can do that? Previously we talked about, you know, collecting them, looking in a microscope to size them.

478
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,000
An alternative way to do get particle size distribution is something called a cascade impactor.

479
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:09,899
And this will do it by mass instead of by count. So we have this uses basically a series of impactors that have different jets,

480
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,220
sizes and distances for impactor plate to give you different components.

481
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,530
And then at the end, it has a filter that gets all the smallest particles.

482
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:26,280
And then you can actually pre and post weigh the impactor plates as well as the filter to get the mass at each stage.

483
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,850
And then you can do some of the plotting that we've done already.

484
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,490
And that will give you by mass and aerodynamic diameter.

485
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:44,050
So some popular ones are called the Anderson Impactors or the marble personal impactor.

486
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,600
And this is a drawing of what it looks like.

487
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,120
You see different impact plates,

488
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:59,810
but you can see the dimensions of that jet and the distance of that plate from the jet change to collect smaller and smaller particles.

489
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:10,410
I can't give you those different stages. And then once you get it, you can plot the different stages.

490
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,960
And more times than not, it will likely look like a normal distribution.

491
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,990
Every time I've used a cascade impactor, it's not been equal.

492
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,220
But since we talked about this, it's figure might be a little misleading.

493
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,840
But but again, you can do a lot of stuff with this type of data.

494
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:41,310
Not going to be called for for compliance. You're not going to see it in the ECJ or OSHA, but I can give you a lot more information.

495
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,840
Here's an example of the interest in each state, each stage in wasting one of these.

496
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:53,340
These are actually more used in indoor air quality assessments for mold fungi.

497
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,890
You can put out repeats at each stage.

498
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:01,950
And again, not just size and distance from our plate will be different, give you different part of the sizes for it.

499
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,880
You can see what grows. GROSS But let's see.

500
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,870
This is the first one that can be used for the air assaults.

501
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:20,540
And this is what it looks like when you take the part. The different stages are getting a pre and post ready to go stages.

502
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,440
We've also done a chemical analysis on multiple stages as well.

503
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:34,780
Chemical of interest. Again, just another way of visualizing this.

504
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:46,060
Each impactor will its own cut point, and then you'll collect a certain amount of mass, and then you can do a bunch of stuff.

505
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:54,820
So once you have all your information from a cascade impactor, you can you can plot it like we did with count data.

506
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:06,100
So the key here, again, each each impact plate will have its own cut point curve like that.

507
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:12,850
But then you can make a table like we did in the problems that we have your range of.

508
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:23,800
Particle sizes, your diameters, and then how much mass is made up cumulatively in each of those stages or bands.

509
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:29,980
So you want to start with the filter. You get the mass on the filter for that range less than whatever micrometers.

510
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,729
Then for the next range, you know, can be 4 to 8 micrometers.

511
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:40,780
You add what's on that filter plus the impactor over your total and so on and so forth to get that the overall total.

512
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:50,380
And then you can go to your probability paper and plot it and come up with the median aerodynamic diameter and other things.

513
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:59,800
Everyone fall late on a Thursday. Everyone's super pumped until super pumped.

514
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,700
And this might look familiar. As I recall,

515
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:14,919
it was brought to my attention that the notation on the hash equation on my slides was a little misleading because I had a natural log squared,

516
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,700
which is not really a thing. So hopefully people are able to figure that out.

517
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:27,370
If not, let me know after class. But again, you can go between mass media diameter and count medium diameter.

518
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,290
So with that, so again, just another way to get that information.

519
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:39,970
Once you have that, it might be informed in theory for a number of things. Okay.

520
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:50,250
So I'm not going to spend much time on a luxury item. Again, I just want to introduce the concept to you as the pre selector.

521
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,120
These are using segmentation. So these are old, old school approaches.

522
00:57:54,150 --> 00:58:00,070
This is for cotton dust only. So, you know, back in the day with cotton, this was a big concern.

523
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:04,180
And they didn't have other technologies. They used something called vertical route creator.

524
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,450
Like this is just an interesting way to visualize some of the mechanisms we've been talking about.

525
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:15,720
And it was actually used in practice at one time. I doubt you'd see these much these days.

526
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,430
But again, I just wanted to to introduce the the concept.

527
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:31,570
There's also one called a horizontal route creator. The UK, he sees a lot, but again, not as much any longer.

528
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:37,660
So this one would operate vertically. I think sediment sedimentation would have things settle out.

529
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:41,890
Or you could do a horizontal. Different. Different layers.

530
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:52,360
But like I said, I'm not going to talk much about that. Just introducing the concept and the other type of horizontal nutrient nutrient or here.

531
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:59,770
That brings us to precipitation. So we have electrostatic or thermal precipitated.

532
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:06,160
Again, you don't you're not going to see these a lot. These aren't called for in nice methods and things like that.

533
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:07,809
But, you know,

534
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:15,670
they might be useful in specialized settings if you have to use certain type of microscopy and collect particles that are kind of pristine.

535
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,960
That's where you might want to use some of this type of technology.

536
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:28,080
So let's keep that in mind. Here's just a couple of examples.

537
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,970
You know, it's the.

538
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:42,520
Electrostatic charge and can attract small, small particles and can have them collect in a way that sets up water for micro microscopy.

539
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:50,920
There's also thermal precipitation.

540
00:59:51,790 --> 01:00:03,640
Similarly uses temperature gradients again to collect certain size range for purposes of being nondestructive or being able to look a certain way.

541
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:13,890
I feel really comfortable. Okay, so let's do it again. The blue traitors and the precipitate ers.

542
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:18,030
You're not going to see much, I'm guessing, but I did want to introduce you to the concepts.

543
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:22,470
So that brings us to what if you have a chemical that's a semi volatile.

544
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,890
Right. So this is something that could be an aerosol, could be a vapor.

545
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:35,819
What do we want to do? Well, one way would be to, like we talked about last time,

546
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:44,790
that the imprinting filter would be one way in a slow flow rate to try to collect both the aerosol and the vapor on the same filter.

547
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:52,649
Typically a more common method for a lot of agents because you might not have the correct reagent for

548
01:00:52,650 --> 01:01:00,110
for the impregnated filter is what maybe more commonly for a lot of things would be multi-stage.

549
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:07,410
So basically in series you have it passed, the air is going this way, have it go through a filter first,

550
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:14,730
maybe a pre-select or maybe have an impact or a cyclone and then you have your filter to collect the aerosol portion.

551
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:21,350
But anything that vaporizes from the agent of interest, it's going to get past that filter.

552
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:27,510
So then you might have absorbent tube on the other side of it like we talked about last time to get the vapor face.

553
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:35,470
And that way you can get both of those. We've used this for something Web pages.

554
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:45,760
Again, if you can not only to collect it all, but then you can see what phase it was more commonly and tied to different work tasks.

555
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:51,040
And that can help us determine how best to collect it and how best to protect against.

556
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,890
There's one in the field.

557
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:05,340
They've made things that can accommodate this one.

558
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:10,370
OSHA has something called the tool sampler that uses that similar principle that I just described.

559
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:15,200
I'll show a picture of this next. But they they designed this for things like pesticides.

560
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,070
And as I mentioned, peaches. There's also something called an annular neuter,

561
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:30,320
has concentric cylinders sometimes made out of glass like glass rods that will have a very low flow rate of air pass through.

562
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:36,950
And those are coated with a reagent, and that reagent will react with chemical interest.

563
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:41,030
And then you can resorption and, you know, there's four that come from the lab.

564
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:46,820
So those are a couple of technologies used for similar volatiles.

565
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:56,470
So here's a picture of that. Oh, sure. Sampler tube is similar instead of what I just talked about, where you could have both in series.

566
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:02,710
This is just a contraption that includes both DNA. So you have the filter here.

567
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,100
And on the other side, the filter you have, you're sort of in collection material for the vapor phase.

568
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,999
You can also connect to some of these.

569
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:19,310
I've seen it also have a selector on them as well, if you want to just things less than ten micrometers or two and a half whatever,

570
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:27,020
and then you send that to a lab and you can get to work pre and post where the filter and then dissolve the

571
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:34,790
filter and the sorbent to get the total mass of the chemical that could be aerosol water vapor filters.

572
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:47,300
Similar concept with the tutor instead of the source material, it's using the reagent treated glass surfaces to collect the paper face.

573
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:56,420
Okay. So that was a lot. Any questions?

574
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,930
Comments, concerns, advice?

575
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:12,890
It's a Chatty Cathy. Question over here.

576
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:23,290
Yeah. All right. Well, early on when we're talking about this filter of water or not being good for small, small, small particles.

577
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:42,020
Thought of possibly as just wondering if they cared for like very small particles, if they could release a this is like an imperfect world,

578
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:53,870
a molecule that binds to the aerosol already for that paper or whatever that will increase that molecule size.

579
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:03,620
So it gets caught by that filter, but that same additive has to be saved correctly, you know, crucified, right?

580
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:13,280
That way you can kind of modify the aerosol such that it will be captured by that filter and would otherwise not be able to give it its small size.

581
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,810
Yeah, I mean, maybe not with filters.

582
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:20,990
Did you call the really small size will get picked up by the diffusion.

583
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:25,490
What they do use when we talk about direct reading instruments,

584
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:33,260
they will use some of that idea to pre-treat the aerosol in order to measure it better with a sensor.

585
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,620
Yeah, but yeah, I think you're on the right track there.

586
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:40,639
I haven't seen it much with with kind of the filter methods we're talking about.

587
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,140
But yeah, we talk about sensors next week. That comes into play.

588
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:49,410
Question. Any others?

589
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:56,600
How does problems have to compare to popes? In what way?

590
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:03,030
Length. The complexity is the length of time to consider and commitment time.

591
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:08,220
Again, if you if you chip away, I mean. So I'll make it visible.

592
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,840
And there will be a couple that you could do with what we've already talked about last weekend.

593
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,410
Today, and see what happens.

594
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:21,180
I apologize if it took a long time. But again, you can work together.

595
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,530
That's okay. As long as you understand return.

596
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:29,750
And that's the goal. All right.
