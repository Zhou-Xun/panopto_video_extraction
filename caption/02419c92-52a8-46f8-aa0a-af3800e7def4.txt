1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,350
Okay. Thanks for bearing with me on that and your for your help.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,300
Um, I wanted to talk about the paper real quick before jumping into kidney toxicity toxicology.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,719
Does anyone have any concerns or questions about that project so far?

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,940
Have you had a chance to look it over and maybe think about what topic you want to take?

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,870
No, no, not hearing anything one way or the other.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,059
So no big problems. So there's a couple of things.

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,129
You know, I'm assuming you've looked at this.

8
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:45,210
So at this point, so the things we want to sort of review in the paper are how are people exposed to the toxicant,

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,130
go over how it's metabolized and distributed throughout the body.

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:59,850
The mechanism of action that the cut, or at least a hypothesized mechanism of action that links the exposure to some kind of health outcome.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,520
Right. And so that kind of brings up a topic I wanted to sort of touch on,

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,290
is that for the purposes of this paper, you know, there's a good amount of flexibility.

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:20,600
But just as a word of advice, you may want to choose a topic for which there's fairly strong evidence of exposure of causing this particular health.

14
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,909
Right. You may not want to pick something that's really hypothetical at this point.

15
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,040
Like maybe there there's some type of just pulling something out of thin air as an example.

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,160
And it is some type of type of hypothesized link between the specific exposure and high blood pressure.

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,380
But there's really not much we know about the mechanisms that are yet or the data are very sort of just in early stages of being collected.

18
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,760
There's not that many epidemiology studies on that linkage.

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,120
That might be one, you know, unless you really want to attack that one.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,810
And we can kind of maybe talk about how you might approach that paper that might be what you want to sort of avoid.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,210
So that's just kind of a general I'm not saying, you know, it's 100% you can't,

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,750
you know, do anything that's sort of still sort of a hypothesized linkage.

23
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,390
But, you know, just there will be more there for some types of associations versus others, if that makes sense.

24
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,950
So if you have any questions about that, just come and talk to me and we'll work it out.

25
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:31,230
And I can maybe direct you to certain areas, certain resources that might help you sort of in terms of how to approach those linkages.

26
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,210
Yeah. So just kind of want to throw that out there. Might help you out a little bit.

27
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,250
And then there's a little bit of sort of like risk assessment we're asking you to do.

28
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,540
So, like, are there individuals in the population at increased risk of disease relative to the exposure?

29
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,280
How would you recommend preventing adverse outcomes like relative to the exposure,

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,560
particularly like in a sensitive population, is something you want to address here.

31
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,920
So depending on your background, you may be more or less comfortable talking about that kind of stuff.

32
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,200
You know how like risk assessments are done or like what type of language is used when like,

33
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,100
say, people in EPA conduct a risk assessment and sort of the order of operations there.

34
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,190
And if you are feeling uncomfortable about that part of it or anything else, like maybe it's the opposite, maybe you're very comfortable in that.

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,960
But talking about like say cell models or animal models and toxicology studies,

36
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,580
you're a little bit less like comfortable talking about that or writing about that.

37
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,790
Again, I can try to, you know, just come to office hours or we can plan a meeting and we can talk through,

38
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,180
you know, the areas that you want to talk about in that regard.

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,939
So it's a little bit of like a a multi-disciplinary project.

40
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,810
So I want to be here to help you feel okay writing about something that you might not have a ton of background in, if that makes sense.

41
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,670
Some good. Cool.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,780
We'll just double check our recording. So today.

43
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,780
And as always, like I've said this many, many times, but if there's any issues, just email me.

44
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,930
I have I can move things around my schedule and set up a meeting with students.

45
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:28,270
If you can't make it to one of those office hour times. So today we're going to talk about kidney toxicity or natural toxicology.

46
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,150
So they just kind of set the stakes here and talk about why this is important.

47
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:46,860
Here's some stats. This is a few years old from 2013, but these stats are talking about amount of cases of chronic kidney disease worldwide.

48
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,200
Right. So you have like this estimate like a million deaths directly related to chronic kidney disease.

49
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,530
One in 57 deaths worldwide. You know, and that's getting to be pretty high numbers there, right?

50
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,480
It's among one of the growing causes of mortality.

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,340
So you can see here. Not sure what this unit is in the 1% change.

52
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:18,820
Yeah. So anyway, you get the idea. It's ranks behind things like HIV, aids and drug use disorders, etc.

53
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,980
Um, and yeah, so again, like things like cardiovascular disease could be attributed to chronic kidney disease as well.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,440
So this is just, you know, a few numbers to throw out there to sort of set the stakes for why this is important,

55
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:40,300
like kidney disease, kidney toxicology and kidney health are really important issues in terms of public health.

56
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,980
This is an interesting graph from a paper from The Lancet back in 2017.

57
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,860
That type that shows the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in multiple countries

58
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,209
with the darker blue being like sort of hotspots for chronic kidney disease.

59
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:05,390
Right. Obviously, you can see a couple of areas of the world have relatively high levels of chronic kidney disease.

60
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:13,580
But yeah, it's fairly high. You know, you're looking at like five, 10% of the population, up to 15 to 20% in some, some places.

61
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,960
What is something that maybe jumps out at you from this graph?

62
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,660
Uh. Yeah. Anything.

63
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:31,460
Just anything about this is kind of striking to you from this graph or not graph this map about the statistics, how little data is lacking.

64
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,250
Exactly. You see a lot of white here, right?

65
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,200
Meaning that there's no data available there. So there's a lot of work to be done in collecting these data, apparently.

66
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:50,810
So who knows how that's going to adjust the numbers. You know, how many of these areas, if we drill down and start to compile the data,

67
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,290
start to publish the data, I'm assuming there's data collected somewhere.

68
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,830
It just hasn't been pulled in for some of these like big data analysis.

69
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,899
So that might change the global picture of chronic kidney disease worldwide once we

70
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,850
start to hopefully collect some of those data and understand better what's going on.

71
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,000
So we're going to talk about kidney anatomy.

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,879
And as always, we're not going to have time to go over all the gritty details of kidney anatomy and function.

73
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,920
But we'll hit the main functions of the kidney, right? So the kidneys have this sort of kidney bean like shape.

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,390
So they basically serve. And what we're going to talk about a lot in this lecture is they serve as big filters,

75
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,290
like it's their two main jobs are one as they're filtering that we want to really

76
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,650
absorb certain things that are being filtered out in the initial filtration step,

77
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,420
if you will. So there's stuff that we don't want to that we want to recoup.

78
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,340
So there's a lot of reabsorption going on, which we'll talk about and then excrete the bad stuff.

79
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,080
So that's the main job of the filter, is to just filter out stuff that we don't want waste, etc. in the form of urine.

80
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,470
And so the fill the kidneys get a blood supply.

81
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,079
You know, the blood gets sent to the kidneys and there's a renal vein or renal and a renal artery.

82
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,720
So you're getting blood that's sent to the kidneys. Um, yeah.

83
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,990
And so what if we were to take a cross-section of the kidney?

84
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,800
Some of the main parts we're going to talk about here are the cortex, just like this, like top layer here.

85
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,230
As we go down, we're looking at the medulla, the middle layer.

86
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,110
And then finally we're at the what's called the pillar here.

87
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,360
And really a lot of the work in terms of this filtration is going to be done out of cortex.

88
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,670
So that's receiving, as you can see stated here, a much higher proportion of the blood flow,

89
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:59,900
like 90% of the blood flow is going to the cortex and then less of it is found in the body and popular.

90
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:12,450
Right. So the cortex receives the majority of the blood. So the kidneys excrete metabolic waste.

91
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,000
They also have other functions as well beyond this filtration and like waste excretion function.

92
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,990
So they also have they synthesize and excrete certain enzymes and hormones that play important roles in the body.

93
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,470
So, for example, you have an enzyme sometimes called a hormone.

94
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:42,010
It's a little bit murky in terms of the definition here, but renin is an enzyme for sure that is important for regulating blood pressure.

95
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:49,180
And then you have something that is a hormone called a erythropoietin, which regulates the production of red blood cells.

96
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,320
So these are important functions as well, in addition to this filtration.

97
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,640
They also play a role in regulating like fluid volume in the body.

98
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,780
So we want to keep a balance in terms of the amount of extracellular fluid in our body.

99
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,770
If you start to get a buildup of fluid that's called edema, that's that can be very bad.

100
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,780
They balance things like electrolyte composition and our acid base balance within the body.

101
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:22,630
So it's really important for like homeostasis, right, for keeping our bodies in balance on a number of fronts.

102
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,220
They also play a role in vitamin D metabolism and bone metabolism.

103
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,430
So the bone I think we mentioned this briefly in one of the earlier lectures like the bones are actually kind of a dynamic structure.

104
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,159
And there's like building up and breaking down a bone over time that occurs and that needs to be regulated.

105
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,590
And if that gets out of whack, you can have problems.

106
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,390
So this is just to give you an example of some of the chemicals that are initially filtered by the kidneys,

107
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,600
and then some of them are reabsorbed back into the body.

108
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:11,480
So glucose bicarbonate, sodium chloride, urea creatinine, it's a protein that is a product of muscle breakdown and sort of normal muscle metabolism.

109
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,230
And you can see here, so these are the compounds. This is still getting hung up on these units.

110
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:24,740
These are these like, um, below equivalent units which are sort of special unit they used for things that are like ionic.

111
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:32,480
So I wouldn't get too caught up in these units here. But essentially you're seeing how many Miller equivalents per day are filtered.

112
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,640
And then in this column, you're seeing how much of these chemicals are reabsorbed.

113
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,330
So like glucose, 100% of that is reabsorbed back into the body after the initial filtration.

114
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:49,770
Um, whereas something like urea, only 50% is reabsorbed and then creatinine, none of that 0% is reabsorbed.

115
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,690
Right. So some things are filtered and then quickly reabsorbed.

116
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,320
Some things are just excreted. So we have both of these processes going on at the same time.

117
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,890
And when you look at how much stuff the kidneys are dealing with every day, it's like a ton of stuff.

118
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,120
Like 180 liters of filtrate are of, you know, processed by the kidneys every day.

119
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,860
And then we excrete a kind of a really small fraction of that, between a half and two and a half liters of urine a day.

120
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,420
So these are like really powerful or against dealing with a lot of material.

121
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,579
For those that might be interested in exposure studies, you may see data.

122
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,560
Sometimes when we look at like urinary levels of certain chemicals in the environment,

123
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:47,110
we want to often normalize that to levels of creatinine that are found in a in a in a urine sample.

124
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:58,530
Right. And the idea there is that creatinine is excreted at a fairly regular level, but urine can kind of fluctuate day to day.

125
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,819
If one is drinking a lot of water that day, it may dilute the sample.

126
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:08,410
And so you may underestimate the amount of exposure that individual has to a particular chemical if you're measuring it in urine.

127
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:18,070
And so it's creatinine is a way of like you standardize your sample by like mg milligrams per liter per gram of creatinine, for example.

128
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:24,940
So that's just a way to standardize. So if you look in two exposure studies, you'll often see these data normalized by creatinine.

129
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,980
So a lot of this lecture, most of this lecture is going to be talking through various parts of what's called the nephron.

130
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,890
So the nephron is the functional unit of the kidneys, and it's got this really interesting structure.

131
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,910
It's much more complicated than what we saw with the liver.

132
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,020
As you can see here, it's like very interesting.

133
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,760
Lots of there's let's see, a lot of tubules and we're going to talk through each of those.

134
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,700
So there's like a million of these guys per kidney. So this whole thing would be called the nephron.

135
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:11,540
So you have your blood supply here and we have the what's called the collecting doctor, the collecting tubule here.

136
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,640
And this is where urine is going to basically emerge and then be sent to the bladder.

137
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,210
Right.

138
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:26,389
And then a lot of stuff is going to happen as this blood is filtered into this tubule and it moves along first what's called the proximal tubule,

139
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,730
then the distal tubule. The material also works on Lewis.

140
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:40,400
There's something called the loop of Hadley, which we'll talk about through this tubule all the way down into this collecting duct to the urine,

141
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,270
right, or to the bladder, the tube that goes to the plasma.

142
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,160
And you can see where the nephrons sit in like the kidney. So the cortex would be here.

143
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,550
And as I said, this is why the cortex is so important, because, you know,

144
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,610
this is where like the the main sort of like blood, urine, waste interface kind of happens.

145
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:06,620
So that's why we're really interested in the cortex. And then you can see where the loop apparently kind of drips, dips down into the medulla and etc.

146
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:12,890
So that's kind of our basic structure. Any questions so far makes sense.

147
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,250
Okay. So again, we'll hit on this many times in this lecture.

148
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,320
So the main idea is that we want to filter out blood. We want to reabsorb the good stuff.

149
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,889
The stuff that we want on things like water and things like certain nutrients.

150
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,540
You want to reabsorb that after that initial filtration stuff. And then the rest of the stuff we want to excrete in the air.

151
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,910
Right. And so this is kind of a very kind of simplified version of what that looks like.

152
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:50,230
You have your blood coming through and your blood the blood will go enter into the structure called the glomerulus,

153
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,040
which is a sort of a this intricate network of capillaries that are that have this

154
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,180
really kind of interesting structure where it's almost like a globe kind of structure.

155
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:10,270
The glomerulus is encased in this structure called the Bowman capsule, and you're going to get material filtered from the blood and you're going to.

156
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:17,110
And what's going to result from that filtration is called glomerular global ular filtrate.

157
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:26,290
And as this filtrate moves through the tubules, some of this material is going to be reabsorbed back into the blood and some stuff is

158
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,849
actually going to actually be secreted out of this and different areas of these tubules.

159
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:39,819
So all of this is in the service of essentially excreting urine and the waste that we don't want to keep into.

160
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,070
This makes sense, right? Yeah.

161
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,820
So let's go. Mary Liz, is the small network of blood vessels or capillaries?

162
00:16:51,610 --> 00:17:05,730
It's a question. So when we, for example, drink a lot of water, the urine that we scraped is clear.

163
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:22,800
And so the the kidneys are detect where we drank a lot of water and just take it from the system and to excrete and no reason.

164
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,730
It doesn't. It's not going to be reabsorbed.

165
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:39,830
Just secreted. So. Well, everything that we we drink or eat, we that becomes too into their into their blobs.

166
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:48,240
Everything is going to go to their kidneys to be selected there, to be reabsorbed or excreted, right?

167
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,930
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah.

168
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,259
So was there a quite. Sorry. I don't think I missed the question.

169
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,909
Was there just. Are you just. I don't know, maybe. Maybe it's more than more than a question.

170
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:07,520
Something that there was thinking that everything that we that goes into our blah the stream than the kidneys

171
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:15,509
is so important to to select what is going to be reabsorbed and what is going to be excrete excreted,

172
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,319
right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, not everything is going to end up in the kidney.

173
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,400
There's going to be some metabolism and absorption that occurs along the way.

174
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,150
But anything that makes it that far through the bloodstream. Yes, certainly.

175
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:33,600
Yeah. So. Um, yeah.

176
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:40,210
So one of the main sort of points in terms of this filtration is that you're wanting to keep big things out of the urine,

177
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,709
like things we're thinking about things like cells for detecting cells in the urine.

178
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,640
That's typically a bad sign in terms of kidney function.

179
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,650
Other things like big proteins, like albumin or other plasma proteins that are in the blood.

180
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,040
We essentially we basically want to keep a lot of that bigger stuff out.

181
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:08,440
So a little bit more about the global. Again, this is the interface between the vascular and then the tubular parts of the kidney.

182
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,589
It looks like this.

183
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:20,520
So one sort of so this is like this network, this glomerulus, this like network of capillaries, kind of all bunched together, looking up.

184
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:28,689
But it's a specialized cell type called portal sites that sort of sit on top of the the blood vessels, the capillaries,

185
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,090
and they sort of form this other, like, filtration network in a way, because they have these sort of.

186
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:42,750
What do they call them? These like one of the one where there's a couple of different types.

187
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:50,930
But one of them is called foot processing. So these kind of like structures that branch off of the cell and sort of, you know,

188
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:58,380
you get this sort of not quite 100% covering of the capillaries, but kind of this.

189
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,809
But enter digit tated sort of structure going on.

190
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:11,760
And I'll show another slide that show that that shows this better. But these are important for another layer of this sort of filtration process.

191
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,770
And then the let's see. Right.

192
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,130
And then so the capillaries themselves, they, the,

193
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,550
the cells that make up the capillaries have what are called fenestration ah

194
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:31,260
openings which again serve as this like physical filter part of the glomerulus.

195
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,719
So these are shown here. So if you were to zoom in on this part of the glomerulus, it's going to look something like this.

196
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:44,460
So you're going to have these like protease sites that are kind of like attached to the cell, but also leaving some areas that are open.

197
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,620
And you're going to have things like these slit pores where things can leak through.

198
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,220
Um, yeah. And then you're going to have your basement membranes.

199
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,270
The capillary would be here with these fenestration. So these openings, right.

200
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,940
So again, we're excluding things like proteins and red blood cells.

201
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,170
Um, yeah. Fat estrogen, cytoplasm polar sites.

202
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,510
Yeah. And you have this glomerular basement membrane, which has these openings within it.

203
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:23,810
So charge plays a role here as well. So cationic or positive or neutral molecules get filtered more readily.

204
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:29,630
So those are going to make it through and get filtered out of the blood than negatively charged or anionic molecules.

205
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,740
So you have a size and a charge sort of barrier here.

206
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,270
And that's due to the overall charge of the basement membrane.

207
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:43,900
It has like an overall, like negative charge to that basement membrane.

208
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,879
And so that's going to play a role that we'll talk about later in terms of how certain toxicants

209
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:57,050
act of the charge is going to play a role in terms of like how much of a barrier that is.

210
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:05,100
The primary process and interdigital and foot processes. Those are the terms I was struggling for here.

211
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,910
So this is just another view of these polar sites.

212
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,490
I feel like sometimes I don't find good visuals of them.

213
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:21,100
So this is just another visual of these polar sites sitting on top of these glare globe, irregular capillaries with these like processes.

214
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,220
So you can see like certain things can leak through,

215
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,760
but certain things of a certain size are not going to make you have like multiple kind of layers of filtration that can kind of happen.

216
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,280
So that's the glomerulus. And then so so again,

217
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,540
you have this initial filtration step that occurs at the site of the glomerulus and the filtrate

218
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:51,149
is going to move through the tubules so that you're eventually going to be leaving the cortex,

219
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:58,139
part of the kidney and entering into the medulla. You're going to go through again what this is this is called the loop of length,

220
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,959
which contains certain ion transporters and nutrient transporters that are going to recapture

221
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,530
and recoup certain things that are in that filtrate that the body actually does want.

222
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:17,770
Right. And then eventually, after the loop of Hadley, you'll be moving through the tubule and then down into this collecting duct.

223
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,980
So. Again, we call this whole structure the nephron.

224
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,770
So it's like functional unit of the kidney.

225
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:40,140
And so different parts of the nephron are involved in the either the reabsorption or secretion of different types of nutrients or molecules.

226
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:49,160
There's a little bit of similarity here to the liver, where certain zones of the liver kind of have different functions as you kind of move

227
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,430
through as the blood moves through the different zones towards the central veins.

228
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,070
Right. So as you move through these tubules,

229
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:04,160
you have like different sort of compositions to the cells and different slightly different functions as you move through the the tubule.

230
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,780
So for example, the proximal tubule is reabsorbed in things like sodium chloride ions, glucose amino acids,

231
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,900
and then things are going to be secreted from the blood like hydrogen ions or organic acids and bases.

232
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:26,150
This descending area going towards the loop or the descending region of the loop apparently is where we're going to reabsorb water.

233
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,160
Right. So water is going to be one of the things that gets filtered out initially, but we want to recoup that.

234
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,240
Because, you know, water is very important. Yeah.

235
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,710
And so you can see various parts of it.

236
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:45,250
So we have the ascending loop of Henley, which again is going to be reabsorb absorbing certain ions and nutrients.

237
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,510
This region is called the distal tubule. And that will help the late distal tubule.

238
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,040
Right. So we have proximal tubule here and then distal here.

239
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,750
Simple as anything I want to hit on. So all throughout.

240
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,540
You see how there's, like, different regions of these tubes that are specialized towards different types of molecules.

241
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:19,300
So again, we're forming like this filtrate, you know, kind of constantly, you know, fairly rapidly.

242
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,670
The actual urine that we excrete is from, you know, like I said, 0.5 to 2.5 liters a day or say 1.5 liter today.

243
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,750
Of most of this re absorbing is done in that proximal tubule part the early part.

244
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,600
Um so this is re absorbing like 60% of the nutrients and stuff that we want to recoup.

245
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,059
And so there's specialized cells that are like designed or like built to recoup.

246
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:52,870
I mean, we'll talk a little bit about that. Certain types of molecules back into the back into the body or into the blood supply.

247
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,760
Um, there's, you know, so this is just kind of, there is like a maximum amount that they can like bring back into the body.

248
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,979
So that kind of speaks to what you're saying about drinking more water.

249
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:09,310
You know, after a certain point, we're not able to we hit like a maximum amount of transport that we can take up out of this filtrate.

250
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,830
And anything not reabsorbed is going to pass out in the urine.

251
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,390
So you may have heard about, you know, when you're taking certain like nutritional supplements,

252
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,009
sometimes people say, oh, you're spending this money on nutritional supplements,

253
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:32,000
you're paying for expensive urine because like, you know, if you're not going to be using a certain vitamin or nutrient,

254
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,210
it ends up excreted in the urine if the body is not able to absorb it.

255
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,840
I don't know if anyone's ever heard someone say that they're taking nutritional supplements.

256
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:47,780
But that's what the idea is there. Um, so, so as some of these sites move.

257
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,930
So another sort of action related to like taking up solids is that the water is going to follow the solids, right?

258
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,290
So the water goes to the areas of higher osmolarity. Right.

259
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,519
So that's, that's another sort of benefit to re absorbing certain types of ions is the water is going to

260
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,820
move with the ions or tend to move with the ions as they're uptake in out of this filtrate.

261
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:20,819
And there is a hormone called anti diuretic hormone, which helps to make these collecting ducts more permeable to water.

262
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,210
So water is going to be reabsorbed more efficiently.

263
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,680
So there's this basically allows us allows for more water to be reabsorbed from the urine or the filtrate back into the blood.

264
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,680
And this overall is going to decrease urine output because we're not going to be excreting

265
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,800
as much as much water in the urine because it's going to be reabsorbed into the body.

266
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,480
So you may have heard the term diuretics or this is anti diuretic, you're going to be excreting less urine.

267
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:02,960
Okay. So that's kind of the basic functions of the kidney. We're going to go back to various components of that in more detail,

268
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:10,490
but we'll talk a little bit about kidney toxicity and the mechanisms and assessment of kidney function now.

269
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:22,110
So similar to the liver. The kidneys are kind of susceptible to toxic input because they relative to their mass,

270
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,800
they're receiving a lot of the like the blood, a lot of the cardiac output.

271
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,659
And you can imagine that that means they're going to be receiving a lot of the drugs and

272
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,840
chemicals that the body is taking in that are being processed and ending up in in the blood.

273
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:44,970
So anything in systemic circulation is potentially like found going to be found in the kidneys at relatively high amounts.

274
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,279
So we get this concentration process.

275
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:57,209
So, you know, as we're concentrating things, this means that toxicants can sometimes be concentrated as well or filtering things out.

276
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:03,960
And, you know, this this region where like a lot of the blood is flowing through, you have this propensity for like a buildup of toxicants.

277
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:15,440
Right. And kidneys do play a role in metabolism and transport of toxicants, accumulation, etc. So they're just kind of, like I said,

278
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:23,329
similar to the liver because of the the really kind of high workload they have and their positioning within the circulatory system,

279
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:26,390
they're kind of a prime target for certain types of toxicants.

280
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:37,120
In terms of kidney damage during kidney disease or, you know, exposure to a toxicant.

281
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,770
One of the main readouts we have is called the glomerular filtration rate,

282
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,280
which is kind of intuitive in terms of its name or GFR as the other term for it.

283
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:58,120
So it's basically a. An assess, a number that allows you to assess how sort of efficiently the glomeruli are filtering things out of the blood.

284
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:07,120
And so it's given by this equation where you get like the clearance, which we'll talk about in a minute, or the GFR is equal to the clearance,

285
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,950
which is equal to the urinary concentration of a chemical times,

286
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:19,690
the volume over the plasma concentration and the gold standard to get this is to use a chemical called insulin.

287
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:26,050
You infuse that into the bloodstream. And it's filtered by the glomeruli, but not absorbed.

288
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:32,080
So it's kind of based on this characteristic is a good chemical to use for these purposes.

289
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:39,490
And so you can see here, you know, in terms of your GFR number, you're wanting like 90 or higher.

290
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:47,170
Generally that's we're thinking that is equivalent to like 90 to 100% of kidney function is working.

291
00:30:47,170 --> 00:31:00,670
Right. And then you can see as kidney disease progresses from stage one, we get our GFR goes down 82, 60, 50, 59 to 45, etc., all the way up to like.

292
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:07,690
So what by the time you're at stage four, you're talking about severe loss of kidney function, 29 to 50% of kidney function.

293
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,140
So a kidney failure would be stage five.

294
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,730
So less than 15%. So very.

295
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,410
A very important parameter.

296
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:28,560
I think this is an important good time to talk about an important issue that we're dealing with right now in terms of a potential race,

297
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,000
racial bias in assessing the severity of kidney function and disease.

298
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,170
So the reason I bring this up now is that GFR goes into some of these algorithms that

299
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,090
clinicians sometimes use to assess how severe the kidney disease or kidney damage is.

300
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:51,990
And some of these algorithms that are used include and so I pulled out a couple articles that talked about this.

301
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,810
They used what's called this, what they call a controversial race based correction factor.

302
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,800
And as you'll see, I'm going to link to these articles. But as you'll see.

303
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,160
People that are critical of this are saying that this is based in basically flawed this

304
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:15,180
correction factor is based on flawed data about supposed differences between the races.

305
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:21,450
And what you're seeing is that you potentially are telling certain, like, for instance,

306
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:30,150
black patients that their kidneys are actually not as damaged as they would be if you didn't use this correction factor.

307
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:38,220
So there's this real potential for like race based bias where you're prioritizing certain patients using this algorithm.

308
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:44,519
And so it's a real, you know, so I'm just going to link to these two articles to talk about this because is obviously

309
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,020
a really important topic in terms of health equity and how we deliver care to people.

310
00:32:50,520 --> 00:33:02,100
Yeah. So in terms of misclassification of cases of kidney, uh, kidney function and kidney disease, any questions so far or comments, thoughts?

311
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,739
That makes sense. A similar example is such as COVID Pulse.

312
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,360
Oximeters actually don't work as well on nonwhite skin several times during COVID.

313
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:18,740
There's people who are getting delayed care because they can't see their pulse dropping as quickly as white people.

314
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,630
Right. So it's a real, real issue with like health justice and health equity.

315
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,330
So, yeah.

316
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:35,390
It's kind of that garbage in, garbage out thing in terms of like these algorithms, like what data are you using to like generate that algorithm?

317
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,270
But yeah, you can read the articles if you're interested. So I wanted to pull that in because the GFR is part of that algorithm.

318
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,540
So the okay, so now we're going to walk through each part of the nephron.

319
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,900
We're going to start here with little Mary Alice Slash like sort of interface.

320
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,299
We talked about this is some of the same but some of the same figures.

321
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:09,830
But I want to talk about a couple of different points here. Again, the globalists access this filter to create a protein free filtrate.

322
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,670
Right. And cell free filtrate. Again, the primary barrier is particle size.

323
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:22,310
It's going to be like the main thing that is filtered out is things that are bigger are not going to end up in that filtrate.

324
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,350
The secondary barrier is the charge because remember, the basement membrane has this negative charge.

325
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:35,630
And so that's going to mean that certain negatively charged molecules are essentially repelled from this negatively charged basement membrane.

326
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,600
In terms of toxicants, there are positively charged toxicants.

327
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,990
I'm thinking about things like cadmium or mercury that can be in a positive ionic form or positive ionic form.

328
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,690
They can bind to these negatively charged areas of the basement membrane.

329
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,890
And what that does is sort of like masks the overall negative charge.

330
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:07,040
And this makes basically getting rid of that negative charge allows like negatively charged components to then flow through that.

331
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,089
Okay. So you're masking one of the main barriers there. You still have the size barrier there, but if you're masking that charge,

332
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:21,320
then that's like one less layer of, you know, filter, if you will, that is going to keep things out.

333
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:27,110
And so exposure to these can then allow things to end up in the air in the year that would not normally be there.

334
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:37,850
So we could also decrease GFR physically, basically by physically altering this.

335
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:45,590
Um. This like the openings, like the filter like structure of the glomerulus, right?

336
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:54,110
So this is pretty cool. It's a scanning electron microscope micrograph of the surface of a glomerular capillary interact.

337
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,940
And you can see it's physically looks like a filter that you use to like filter water from your pasta or something.

338
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:04,120
Right. And so this is like a normal control.

339
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:12,020
And so you can see these like openings here. And then in this case, they were looking at this antibiotic called tobramycin.

340
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,209
And this at a high enough dose,

341
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:21,800
this antibiotic could actually cause kidney toxicity and it causes glomerular cells to like over proliferate, essentially.

342
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,630
And you get this because they're over proliferating,

343
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,780
you're getting the openings sort of decrease in size and you're getting some of this like overgrowth here of certain cells.

344
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,520
And you get these structures that basically compared to here. I mean, which of these do you think is going to, you know,

345
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,710
allow the right things to pass through and which is going to kind of have disrupted function?

346
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,780
You can just kind of physically see that this filter is going to be a lot different than this filter.

347
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,090
Right. So you're blocking up the filtration capacity and decreasing the GFR.

348
00:36:53,750 --> 00:37:01,810
Makes sense. Imagine trying to, like, strain your water and, like, blocking out all the holes in your.

349
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:08,500
In your strainer. So that's one way.

350
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:17,140
You can also see decreased GFR when we have like constricting basically the blood flow to the glomerulus.

351
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:22,750
So we have what's called the afferent arterial with glomerular plasma blood flow and

352
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:29,170
then you're going to move through the glomerulus and then out this effort arterial.

353
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,950
And then here, under normal circumstances, you're getting the blood is filtered and your filtrate is going to come down here, right?

354
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:46,800
If we constrict the blood flow, basically, you know, you're not essentially as efficiently filtering things through.

355
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,550
Things are moving through that filter process as efficiently.

356
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,600
So you're going to decrease the GFR that way.

357
00:37:53,770 --> 00:38:01,750
Essentially like cinching up the tube or, you know, would you like take a water hose and restrict the ability of the water to flow through?

358
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,990
We'll talk about this on a little bit later in greater detail.

359
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,800
But you can get obstructions in the tube, the tubular movement or the opening of the tubule.

360
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,770
So the obstruction could be after the filtrate is passed through the glomerulus in the actual tube.

361
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,450
There's a structure that can form called a cast. And so the filter, it's not moving through the tube.

362
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,800
And so that's another way that GFR could be decreased.

363
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:37,210
Another thing that can happen is we can have leaking of the filtrate back into the blood supply basically.

364
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,450
So you get your filtrate coming in.

365
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:47,350
And then if this if these tubules are basically like leaking, you're getting stuff leaking back in that wouldn't normally be doing that, right?

366
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:56,550
So there's multiple ways that we can impact GFR and essentially decrease GFR or, you know, as a measure of like kidney function.

367
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,850
Right. How are we doing?

368
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:05,170
Making sense of our. Cool.

369
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:14,360
So moving through the nephron. So we've moved past the glomerulus into the proximal tubule now.

370
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:24,390
An important thing to bring up is that the proximal tubule, like the liver,

371
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,910
has different zones that have slightly different biology as we move through these salts.

372
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:38,910
And so they have different names as convoluted or as one transition region as to the part of director or as three.

373
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,930
And so you can see where those are found, kind of.

374
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,110
Uh, along here as one, as two, as three.

375
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,590
Again, as I mentioned, the proximal tubule is doing like the bulk of this reabsorption work.

376
00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:01,340
It's like 60 to 80% of the soluble water is taken back up into the body at this part of the nephron.

377
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,360
So there's this interesting structure in the one region.

378
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:20,150
So in this proximal tubule, they have what's called a brush border and you can see a scanning electron micrograph of this in rat proximal tubules.

379
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:29,860
So they have this like, yeah, this like brush border, which is kind of one of the purposes that serves us to increase the surface area.

380
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:37,639
So a lot of like there's a lot of potential for the filtrate to interact with the cells that make up the the the two to you.

381
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:41,959
All right. And so there's like these figure like projections of these visualize that,

382
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:49,340
like there's just tons of them making this sort of giving it this sort of like brush, like it's this brush like appearance.

383
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,890
Yeah. So you have these like rows of microvilli and these help to reabsorb nutrients.

384
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:04,159
So you could see here, um, like these, like, really here.

385
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,870
And then they become like dreams orbiting things from that are like in the little bit of the tube.

386
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:15,279
One of the processes that. By which the cells do this is through.

387
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,660
And I say ptosis are basically just like swallowing up stuff that's in the filtrate will just

388
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:26,020
like they'll be at the formation of a like a vesicle will bring stuff outside into the cell.

389
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:33,159
And this is like an active process. It requires like ATP in the cells to expend energy.

390
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,830
It's not one of these passive processes that we've talked about before.

391
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:42,880
And for that reason, any time you're talking about a tissue or a cell that uses a lot of energy,

392
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,050
there's going to be a lot of mitochondria because the mitochondria supply energy to the cell.

393
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,450
So these cells have a lot of mitochondria.

394
00:41:51,820 --> 00:42:02,200
We work with a metabolite of trichloroethylene in our lab that trichloroethylene is a kidney toxicant and we work

395
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:09,759
with a particular metabolite of trichloroethylene and have found that it really severely impacts mitochondria.

396
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:18,050
In our case, in placental cells, I'm less familiar with whether trichloroethylene has direct impacts on the mitochondria in the proximal tubule.

397
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,760
So it's something I want to look into too. To follow up on that.

398
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,930
But you know, mitochondria are one of these things that are found in all types of cells.

399
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:34,600
And so impacting if we know that a chemical is impacting mitochondrial function, it could have a wide array of effects across the body.

400
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,569
Right. So sorry for that divergence there. But so yeah.

401
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:47,230
So this part of the s one reason is capturing things like amino acids and glucose, right?

402
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:56,140
So then we have the actual region. So we've kind of gone through this like really active region of the proximal tubule.

403
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,550
The city region is less complex. There's like fewer mitochondria.

404
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,270
The shorter, shorter brush border. And this is capturing things.

405
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:09,999
This is capturing water. So you can see the stuff that we're capturing is like not as varied.

406
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,310
And, you know, we're not to spend spending as much energy to recoup these materials.

407
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:25,660
So the S3 region also had this is so now we're in the medulla part of the kidney.

408
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,670
It does have these like Micro VII structures and these little like finger like projections.

409
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,320
We're not seeing as many mitochondria here and not as much endo psychosis.

410
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:43,989
So as we go through these regions, we're kind of having like less of this, like really active these really active processes that we're seeing.

411
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:54,760
And that's one. Oh, and just just in case, like, I wanted to make sure to orient us so, like,

412
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,559
this would be the this would be like the filtrate area and this would be like the tubular area.

413
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,340
I didn't know if that was super obvious just from that picture. So this would be the tubules, like absorbing things from the filtrate.

414
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:20,880
So it's like a cross section that makes sense through that region. So the proximal tubule of yours common site of toxicity.

415
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,240
You can get an accumulation of by a xeno biotics.

416
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:30,450
Does anyone want to just real quick tell me why they think the proximal tubule is a common site of toxicity?

417
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,620
It's the primary site for reabsorption. Exactly.

418
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,219
Yeah. So it's like this active area of like re absorbing things.

419
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,470
So, you know, there's a lot of uptake of that.

420
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,459
Whatever is in the system like, you know what, it's whatever's in that filtrate.

421
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,450
So anything that makes it in there that might be toxic could be taken up by this.

422
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,810
There's more likely to be uptake in by the presence of your.

423
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,160
Yeah. So the cells kind of global is this like leaky epithelium of the cells in the tubule.

424
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,240
And this means that, you know, the antibiotics can be can enter the proximal tubules.

425
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:21,590
Yeah. So again, this is basically what you just said, like the transport of certain things like organic anions cations,

426
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,000
proteins, etc., it's going to be highest in the proximal tubule compared to the rest of the nephron.

427
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,870
And so one thing we'll talk about is across these different zones.

428
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:38,090
S1 As to a three, there's going to be differences in expression of metabolic enzymes.

429
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:50,100
And so we talked about in one of the earlier classes or the earlier sessions are set P450 is right like one of the

430
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:59,850
main phase one metabolic enzymes and we see in terms of the expression of CYP p450 is in these different regions.

431
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:09,300
This is like the glomerulus you see not expressing very much sip for 50 years but different segments like the S1, S2 and S3,

432
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,959
relatively high levels of expression of B 7450s compared and then compared to like the distal

433
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,190
tubule and that collecting duct where everything's kind of flowing into to generate urine,

434
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:29,009
you're not seeing very much there either. Right. So this is where like a lot of detoxification is actually occurring and potentially toxic fixation.

435
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:38,940
Right. So this is that p450 is can catalyze the formation of a toxic metabolite or a toxic toxic side metabolite depending on the chemical.

436
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:51,000
So just a quick question. So for for toxicants, there's, you know, biotics that are activated to a toxic metabolite like,

437
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,410
say, acetaminophen that are activated to a toxic metabolite by p450.

438
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:02,430
Where would you most likely see damage across these structures?

439
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:15,460
So the p450 are metabolizing acetaminophen to be a toxic metabolite.

440
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,580
Do you think you need more support for fifteens to cause it to happen or less?

441
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:36,250
More. More right. So more sappy four fifties are going to be metabolizing this acetaminophen to more of this toxic metabolite.

442
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,400
So the idea here is that as to just based on what, you know,

443
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:46,300
the information I just gave you as to is going to be the region where you're going to be most likely to see kidney damage given,

444
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,880
you know, looking across these levels of P450 is that these different regions within the kidney.

445
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:08,610
Okay. So we can talk about an example of how a metal can cause damage in proximal tubule cells and just kind of walk through the steps here.

446
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,310
And so we'll take the example of cadmium.

447
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:23,200
So we can be exposed to cadmium through a number of different ways, like inhalation smoking, cigaret smoke contains cadmium.

448
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:32,020
We can also be exposed through ingestion of crops that have been closed and soil contaminated with cadmium ingested that way.

449
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,950
So cadmium is. Well, let me start here.

450
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:44,590
Cadmium is complex to a protein called metallicity, which is an important, uh,

451
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:52,490
protein in the body that helps to basically consolidate like metals within the body.

452
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:58,630
We don't want metals just over just floating around in the body because they're very reactive and can cause a lot of damage.

453
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:05,470
So these proteins called metal filings that basically bind up metals and sequester them in the body.

454
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:11,290
And cadmium is one of the chemicals that can be complex or sequestered by metallicity.

455
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:20,330
And so if we're exposed to cadmium in the blood, it's going to be bound to albumin.

456
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:26,280
But because of humans, this protein in the body that binds up a lot of different chemicals.

457
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:35,550
It can be overtaken by the liver, a liver cell and acted on by a organelle within the liver cell called the lysosome.

458
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:45,329
And the lysosome is sort of a digestive organelle that sort of like breaks things down, like materials that the cell doesn't need to use.

459
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:52,380
And in a certain form it'll like break it down to its component parts and kind of recycle them or expel them as waste or something to that effect.

460
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:03,630
So this cadmium bound albumin might be kind of essentially degraded or separated, and you get the formation of the cadmium ion again.

461
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:11,389
And what can happen when that after that happens is the good pathway is that cadmium might

462
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:19,220
be conjugated to glue to file in this phase to detoxification of metabolic reaction.

463
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:26,750
So this final conjugation is one of the main phase two metabolic processes that occurs, particularly in the liver.

464
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:34,580
So if it's bound to this glutathione molecule, it can be excreted in the bile, which is we want to excrete cadmium out of the body.

465
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:41,729
Right. But the presence of cadmium within the cell is going to cause the cell to essentially,

466
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:46,970
like recognize that there's a metal around and we don't want a lot of that metal around.

467
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,320
And the cell in response is going to start to upregulate expression of metal fighting.

468
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:59,989
So you get this upregulation of metal assigning and metal finding and cadmium are going to bind the tell time.

469
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:04,760
It's going to start to sequester and buying these cadmium atoms to itself.

470
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:10,979
That could be degraded by the lysosome again. In the same manner that it did before.

471
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:18,840
And you might be stuck in kind of this. A cycle here of like degradation bound to metal thiamin degradation,

472
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:26,970
etc. and that that's not good for the liver itself in this case because you're getting this is cadmium ions are like sticking around for a long time.

473
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:36,500
This Vitello thiamin cadmium complex can also be excreted from the liver cell and maybe excreted in urine.

474
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,570
That's that's a good taste, too.

475
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:48,770
But it can also be taken by a liver, proximal tubule cell, and then degraded again by lysosome back into this ionic form of cadmium.

476
00:51:51,060 --> 00:52:02,300
Same thing we're going to get an upregulation of metal assigning binding to of cadmium to Mattel binding and then degradation again by the lysosome.

477
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:05,010
And so again, we have this like vicious cycle.

478
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:10,380
And so essentially this cadmium ions are going to be around quite a bit and causing damage within the cell.

479
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:24,220
And all of this means that the half life of cadmium in the liver is like 4 to 19 years, and the half life in the kidney is like 6 to 38 years.

480
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,410
So you're talking about decades long half life for this metal in the body.

481
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:37,980
And cadmium can trigger all types of we won't have time to go into all the different ways, but things like apoptosis can damage the membrane.

482
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:47,100
It's, you know, it's a toxic metal. So it's not good to have, you know, these toxic metals sticking around for decades in the body.

483
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:53,620
Right. So. But that gives you an example of how like how pernicious these chemicals can sometimes

484
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:58,090
be in terms of how our bodies try to deal with them and try to excrete them.

485
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:02,650
Like you want these processes to be active, but sometimes they sort of get hijacked, if you will,

486
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:08,170
about these toxicants, and it can kind of cause them to stick around for quite a while.

487
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,590
Any questions there? Making sense.

488
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,910
Okay. So we talked about.

489
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,870
This formation of the cast, which is like this blockage in the tubule.

490
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,550
I'm going to talk through a couple of the key events that lead to that happening.

491
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,820
So this is what it looks like with an intact an intact kidney tubule.

492
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:47,980
You'll have like the the cells lining the tubule with like their brush border type of phenotype,

493
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:52,360
and they'll be held together by something called like type junctions or these like

494
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,690
proteins that like hold them together kind of keeping the structure in place.

495
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,660
And you'll have your filtrate passing through here.

496
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:09,040
And so a couple of things that can happen when you start to damage these tubules is there's something called like the loss of polarity.

497
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,740
So certain types of cells kind of know where their orientation is in space.

498
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:20,290
They know that like I'm attached to endothelial cells here and I'm facing the filtrate on this side.

499
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,940
And so they have certain functions that are going to be active, like depending on their orientation.

500
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:29,800
And cells can lose that idea of polarity. So they don't know which ends up, so to speak.

501
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,810
You can have disruptions of these junctions between the cells that are holding the cells together.

502
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:42,010
And overall, just like impacts on this like brush border, you start to lose that phenotype of that structure.

503
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:57,600
If damage continues, you're going to start to see things like apoptosis cells might detach from this vs the epithelium and end up, you know,

504
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:05,249
just basically detaching from their neighbors and floating into the little bit of the tubule and then getting the sloughing off of,

505
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,850
you know, in some cases you might have done cells, in some cases you might have live cells,

506
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,690
but they're sloughing off and end up within the lumen of the tubule.

507
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:22,740
Um, and you can start to see sort of this formation of this blockage within the tubules, like damaged cells, dead live cells.

508
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:31,200
They start to just basically clog up the tubule and you might get the infiltration of certain immune cells that are coming in to try to repair this,

509
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,890
like disruptive such a disruptive situation.

510
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,610
And those are the blocking of the area. Once you get to this point,

511
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:46,140
like there's not really much that any particular like immune cell type is going to be able to repair, but they're going to try.

512
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:53,970
And so it's just so this is the formation of that task that's like blocking the flow through that tubule.

513
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:04,810
So so we've talked to the proximal tubule and we're going to talk about this loop of Henley.

514
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,750
So this is going to concentrate the jury.

515
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:21,330
You're going to be removing like some ions, like sodium and chlorine from this filtrate as it moves through the solute, thus the structure of.

516
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:37,340
So as these ions are removed from the filtrate, the water is going to go with them or be drawn out of the tube into the towards these like ions,

517
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:43,370
like towards the greater osmolarity that's formed from these ions getting removed out of the filtrate.

518
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:51,260
Right. So this is a way to pull more water out of the filtrate because we don't want to lose water if we don't have to, basically.

519
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:57,180
So you start to concentrate the urine. You know, if there's more water there, it's going to be more dilute.

520
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,440
But you're going to concentrate it by like removing the water out of that filtrate.

521
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:12,610
And sort of an interesting evolutionary thing to note is that we see a lot of desert animals have like really long loops of handling on average,

522
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:18,790
which allows for greater amount of water reabsorption as one might need in a desert situation.

523
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:30,999
Hit on all the points there. Oh, yeah.

524
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,959
So. Yeah, I should mention these are like active transport of chloride and sodium ions.

525
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,580
So this is part of this, like, way the body's really wanting to, like, recoup some of this water, right?

526
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,960
So we're like actively pumping these solutes solutes across.

527
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:51,450
And the which is going to make like in an overall like salty environment, which is going to draw water out of the loop, apparently.

528
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:03,930
So now we are at the distal tubule. So this is near to this.

529
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:10,410
It's actually like kind of proximate to this Alfred Arterial, which is like bringing the blood in in the first place.

530
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,850
Of. Yeah.

531
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:20,920
So this is like, where are you getting your final regulation of the urinary like volume and composition?

532
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:26,140
You're still getting some of this, like, transporter activity and those side ptosis function.

533
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:30,969
Um, it's quite a bit different. Yeah.

534
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,440
So it's like, you know, kind of quite different than the proximal tubule systems.

535
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,520
Again, we're continuing to reabsorb water and salts and things.

536
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:47,680
Um, if you have a dysfunction in the convoluted tubule, this is typically going to manifest as an inability to concentrate that urine.

537
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,180
You have like water diluted urine because the water is not going to be taken out.

538
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,730
Okay. So that's a real quick like speed run through the various parts of the nephron and the functions of the kidney.

539
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:12,659
So I can talk about some examples of chemicals that cause different types of impacts within the kidney.

540
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:17,219
In different areas. You can have like pre renal impacts.

541
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:27,380
So impacts of like the blood supply to the glomerulus by certain types of chemicals you can have like impacts on the composition of the urine.

542
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:32,080
So like crystal urine, the formation of like crystals in the urine, this gets really severe.

543
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,960
And you're talking about things like kidney stones.

544
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:43,620
So are certain types of chemicals like ethylene glycol or methotrexate, which is a chemotherapeutic chemical, can cause these types of effects.

545
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:47,870
You can have direct impacts on the tubules, which as we talked about, like with cadmium,

546
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:55,920
you get this like uptake of certain chemicals and causing like maybe even like cell death or a ptosis within these within the tubules.

547
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:00,570
So tubular toxicity, right? Like heavy metals can cause this.

548
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:06,360
You can impact the endothelial cells like in the glomerulus.

549
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:13,409
So the glomerulus is made up of blood vessels impacting endothelial cells as aerialist.

550
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:20,950
That's going to impact potentially like your GFR, your ability to filter chemicals or things that just, you know,

551
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:29,250
basically cause various impacts to the glomerular or as it's glomerulus or as it's called here glomerular opacity.

552
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:37,170
So these are just some examples. Anything else I want to hit on there?

553
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,850
Yeah. So these these columns just show the different types of toxicity we're talking about.

554
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:58,559
This is a kind of a helpful. Figure that goes through chemicals that impact different parts of the nephron.

555
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:05,370
So it has a couple examples of like some chemicals that we use for certain like diagnostic procedures,

556
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:16,620
like radio contrast agents or like other, like therapeutics, like, um, diuretics or NSAIDs can impact the.

557
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:24,139
The afferent arterial, for example, and or the glomerulus.

558
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:28,200
And so and any of these are different chemicals.

559
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:32,030
You can just see a list here, different types of chemicals impacting various parts of the nephron,

560
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:37,760
and then it has listed as well certain markers like molecular markers.

561
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:45,660
So if you're interested in molecular epidemiology, there's a list of like markers of damage to the proximal tubule shown here.

562
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:52,820
So like if you see a spike in this, like the urine or the blood, that might be an indication of damage to the proximal tubule,

563
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:59,059
some collecting markers, glomerular markers, and just go to markers.

564
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:07,820
So that's kind of a cool resource for anyone interested in again, like molecular epidemiology of kidney damage or kidney health.

565
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:15,980
So if you have a group of family markers, so if something's damaging the family or there's a disruption of the loop of handling function,

566
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,729
you can find a marker for that and potentially measure that in.

567
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:25,310
I don't know if these are all in blood or urine, but yeah, so pretty interesting.

568
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:34,730
It's always nice to have these, you know, like relatively noninvasive markers that we can look for in the blood or the urine.

569
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:51,050
Any questions there? Pfister Some toxic debt provokes in a couple of days.

570
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,700
I mean in the short time of period. Complete failure of give me.

571
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:01,410
Oh. In a couple of days.

572
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:14,490
Yes. Is that a toxicant that we should be or the workers that we work with should be very aware to to not to get to that toxic.

573
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:21,090
A couple of things like at a high enough dose, there's probably a lot of chemicals that would,

574
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,889
you know, at a high enough dose of cadmium, although you might see something else affected first.

575
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:35,330
Like you may actually just think of lethality before you get to like very swift kidney impacts, but it's got to be toxic.

576
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:43,470
It's that's going to be like sort of toxic and specific. I'm not aware of just offhand any chemicals that within like within a reasonable amount

577
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,810
of exposure that we might expect to see that would cause kidney damage within days.

578
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:56,890
I think you're normally thinking about months or years, but I'd have to look into it.

579
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:01,799
There may be again, it's good to highly dose is going to really play into that.

580
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:07,050
So if we're talking about someone who works around a chemical and is like potentially

581
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:10,800
exposed to like pretty high levels of like some kind of solvent or something,

582
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:21,210
I think theoretically you might see pretty swift impacts on the kidney, but that's pretty fast to see like total kidney failure within that.

583
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:29,810
Or maybe it's going to affect first the liver, for example, and then the kidneys or.

584
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:36,930
Right. Yeah. So the order of which things are going to happen is going to you know, we're not necessarily going to know that, you know.

585
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,430
Off the bat. But, you know. So, yeah, you'd have to take and take that into account.

586
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:46,180
Hard to say, but yeah, not. I'm not. I'm not.

587
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:47,980
Like I said, there may be one.

588
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:54,610
I'm just not particularly like there's not nothing coming to mind like offhand that would cause that dramatic of an effect that quickly.

589
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,430
Yeah. Any other questions or comments?

590
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:06,230
I would. Is the kidney able to heal itself? Yeah.

591
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:11,710
I'm going to talk about that a little bit. Yeah. It's not just like, oh, you trigger this damage and that it's all done for.

592
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:15,750
Yeah. Yeah. It seems like we're exposed to things, like, every day. It's like, yeah, you know?

593
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,390
Yeah, the body is able to, you know, we're able to compensate for things.

594
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:22,060
Yeah, that's actually the next slide.

595
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:33,549
So, um, so if you have never toxic insult, you know, to like, you know, some type of impact, any of the various impacts that I talked about, you know,

596
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,690
in so far the cells that are like functioning normally,

597
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:43,000
you might see compensatory like they'll grow a lot to sort of like account for something that's not functioning properly.

598
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,620
The cells might adapt in some way. You could see them proliferating.

599
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,569
You know, you could get what's called like reactive epithelial ization.

600
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:59,469
So like restoring function that might be impacted by by a certain chemical or like differentiation.

601
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:05,530
So cells, you know, they go on these like we actually might talk about that in the next class about like these specialized

602
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:12,129
pathways of differentiation that cells can go down just to perform certain types of functions.

603
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,970
And so you might get like differentiation of a particular population of cells to kind

604
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:22,480
of account for damage that was caused by a chemical cells that are injured also

605
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,530
have ways to potentially like repair themselves or undergo that like programed

606
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:32,260
apoptosis programing where they just die and then are replaced by healthy cells.

607
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:36,730
Yeah, there's other types of various adaptation pathways.

608
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,700
And so essentially, you know, if you remove like the important thing is if you are exposed to something that's causing toxic

609
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:49,089
damage is remove exposure like as soon as possible and then given a long enough time period,

610
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:54,670
you can recover, right? As long as the kidney damage isn't like down to that like stage five or whatever, you know,

611
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,400
it's similar to the liver in that way where you the liver is really good,

612
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:04,750
like regenerating itself and like restoring function if you, you know, remove exposure.

613
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:16,670
So the consequences of kidney injury include things like we're not removing waste out of the body as efficiently.

614
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:20,990
More waste is going to end up in the blood. We do not want waste in the blood.

615
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:27,979
It's going to impact the ability to regulate fluids within the body, electrolytes or balance in the body.

616
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:33,080
Right. So this is linked to what I said before. These are all these are all things that the kidney does in the body.

617
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:41,390
We in particular, we could get a buildup of nitrogenous compounds or chemicals containing nitrogen in the blood.

618
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:51,290
And we looked at things like there's a parameter like butane or blood, urea, nitrogen that is a signal for kidney damage and then creatinine as well.

619
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,440
We have a lot of creatinine that could mean that the kidney is not functioning as efficiently.

620
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:06,970
So a little bit building on an earlier slide so we can think about the pre renal impacts on the kidney.

621
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,120
So basically impacting the blood supply to the kidney.

622
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:19,910
And so we might see things like if we're impacting like decreasing the blood flow into the kidney, we might still see things like shock, dehydration.

623
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:29,680
We could have post renal. So this is after things have been filtered through the kidney impacts like after that event, right?

624
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:34,310
So like things like kidney stones or tumors or impacts on the prostate and then.

625
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:42,300
Within the kidney, what we would call that intrinsic and this is mostly thinking about things like impacts on the kidney tubules.

626
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:51,500
So, you know xeno biotics, as I showed you with cadmium impacting the tubule cells or obstruction within the kidney tubules in the nephron.

627
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,990
So. Yeah. I think we talked about that.

628
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:59,380
I'm trying to remember we talked about that was liver was there a pre.

629
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:06,690
There's something we're talking about impacts early and that after the like the Oregon did its job I think that was in the liver lecture.

630
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:16,860
But in any event, you can have impacts that affect the kidney early, before filtration, after filtration or as part of the filtration process.

631
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:29,790
And then we can go into this is just a little bit more of the consequences of chronic kidney injury if the damage gets bad enough.

632
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,950
So, you know, you're looking at things like impacts on the balance between sodium and water in the body,

633
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:38,580
which can lead to things like hypertension or impacts on the heart.

634
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:45,960
Um, just, you know, you just go across this list all kinds of, uh, bad things here.

635
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:51,880
Impacted elimination of nitrogenous waste can lead to things like your urine mia,

636
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:57,660
which can lead to, like, um, pericarditis or the swelling of the tissues around the heart.

637
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:03,150
Impaired immune function skin disorders.

638
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:08,219
Although I didn't talk about this, but like impacts of the sodium water balance could lead to things like edema.

639
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:11,640
So that's like building up a fluid in parts of the body that we don't want.

640
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:16,860
So a lot of this goes back to like this homeostasis of this balance of fluids.

641
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:23,399
And I two things in the body. I mentioned how the kidneys play a role in blood red blood cell production.

642
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:28,980
So if we're impacting the urethra erythropoietin production, that could lead to anemia.

643
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:34,830
Vitamin D activation of vitamin D could have impacts on bone metabolism and bone health.

644
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,630
So all types of things can stem from these impacts on the kidneys.

645
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,560
So let's say we get a new toxicant.

646
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:53,830
That was, you know, we want to put it on the market or a lot of a new toxicant, a new chemical that we want to put on the market.

647
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:58,000
Like, say, I talked about an antibiotic that ended up showing some kind of kidney toxicity.

648
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,959
We have a new antibiotic and knowing that some antibiotic chemicals at high enough levels can cause kidney disease.

649
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,410
We want to test for impacts on kidney health.

650
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:16,960
There's a lot of available toxicology models we can use to assess chemical impacts on various aspects of kidney biology.

651
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:27,960
So we often will use an in-vivo model. So animal models we can even like with rats or mice, and we can even set up, uh,

652
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:34,930
like real time like monitoring of blood perfusion into the animal and measure the

653
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:40,630
filtration efficiency that way through certain devices that we can attach to the animals,

654
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:50,290
use various types of microscopy to look, as I showed you in those earlier slides of like what is the actual physical filtration surface,

655
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:54,310
if you will, on the pulmonary liver capillaries look like?

656
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:02,680
Are we seeing this like overgrowth of cells and so impacting the ability of the Kepler's to like filter stuff out of the blood.

657
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:09,400
And so there's a lot of cool microscopic techniques we can use for that.

658
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:17,590
People also use what's called ex vivo, where we might take from an animal their actual their kidney and grow it.

659
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:24,310
In culture, like in a tissue culture, for example, there's some models that use like the whole organ,

660
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:34,479
or we can also generate what we call slice cultures where we're slicing the kidney into slices and then we can actually like culture that in addition,

661
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,790
add a chemical and see what the slices are doing to the chemical or what the chemical is doing to the tissue.

662
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:48,999
We can also go to the level of purifying, like digesting essentially a lot of the tissue away and leaving a particular structure intact,

663
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:57,550
like the glomerular or the tubules, and kind of just growing those in vitro and seeing what happens when we add certain chemicals.

664
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:07,480
If you purify certain types of cells from like animals, for example, like if we're only interested in the tubular epithelial cells, we,

665
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,989
there's processes by which we can just isolate those particular cells and then grow those in vitro or

666
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:19,840
glomerular cells or the fibroblasts that are the particular fibroblasts that help make up the kidney structure.

667
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:24,219
And there's various cell lines which we typically use in the lab.

668
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:30,310
So the cell lines are usually derived from individuals that had like kidney cancer.

669
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:37,390
And we were able to take some of their cells and because they grow in perpetuity, we can keep culturing these over time.

670
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:41,799
And they're kind of these cell lines can be a nice first pass of just seeing is a

671
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:47,650
chemical determining if a chemical is just like overtly toxic to kill yourself.

672
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:52,809
For example, do we put like a small doses chemical in and it's just like killing all these could be

673
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:58,900
solvents probably don't want to pursue that chemical for like kidney therapy for example.

674
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:07,780
So that's kind of how, you know, what we would use to address potential nephrol toxic toxicity in a new chemical.

675
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:11,659
And we're still trying to understand how chemicals, even chemicals like cadmium,

676
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:19,360
we understand a lot, but there's still stuff that we don't understand about kidney toxicity.

677
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,200
So we continue to try to understand these mechanisms. So.

678
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:30,120
That's all I have for today, I think. Thank you for being here.

679
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:38,580
Any questions, comments, thoughts about anything doesn't have to be about this lecture, but other than that, I am done.

680
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:45,090
So obviously on Wednesday we'll have a guest lecturer talking about developmental toxicology.
