1
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:07,482
Now I'd like you to practice looking for

2
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:12,143
the narrative structure that we've been
talking about in scientific abstracts.

3
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:16,570
Randy Olsen describes three types
of abstracts that we often see.

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,170
He described AAA abstracts.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,150
These are and, and, and.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,470
They just keep throwing fact
after fact after fact after fact.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,360
There's no narrative structure.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,620
There's also no takeaway point.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,570
And as a result,
these are often pretty boring.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,900
There's the ABT abstracts,
which are what I'm hoping you're gonna be

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,930
starting to write in your own life,
or read more, or recognize more.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,367
These have that and, but,
therefore, a clear narrative arc.

13
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:49,230
And they make one core point that
comes straight out of that therefore.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,300
Therefore, the implications.

15
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,440
And the third type of abstract
that you might see, Dr.

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,240
Olsen calls it the DHY, or despite,
however, yet type of writing.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,380
This has so many contradictions,
it keeps turning left and right.

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,760
Every time another sentence comes along,
you're going in a new direction.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,940
And as a result, this type of abstract
ends up being particularly confusing.

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,830
So those are the three types of
abstracts that you might want to see.

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,348
Now you might be thinking, how can these
structures exist if an abstract is gonna

22
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:28,223
follow the standard structure?

23
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:34,260
The IMRAD, the introduction,
methods, results and discussions.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,690
Well, two points.

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,072
First, in some kinds of situations,
abstracts are unstructured.

26
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,380
And they will have the AAA or ABT or

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,600
DHY kind of structure because there is no
other structure that's imposed on them.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,290
Second, as discussed before,
separate narrative structures can exist

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,340
as you tell the story of the research
question versus the research finding.

30
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,460
So sometimes what you're gonna see when
you read even a structured abstract,

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,200
is that the introduction methods
part has one structure and

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,100
the results discussion
part is another structure.

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,780
Maybe they are gonna be both
ABT structures, maybe not.

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,750
And that's part of what I
want you to be looking for.

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,315
So the only way to really learn how to
use these narrative structures is to help

36
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:30,667
you read, recognize, and ultimately write,
abstracts that have these structures.

37
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,170
And the only way to do
that is to practice.

38
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,810
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
sort some abstracts by these types.

39
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,192
Go to it.
