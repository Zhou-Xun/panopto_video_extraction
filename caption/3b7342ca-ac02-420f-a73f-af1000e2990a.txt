Hi and welcome to HP 607. My name is Kevin Halloran, and I'm going to be your guest lecturer this semester.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,290
You're probably already wondering why is Kevin Haller and leaving me an introduction message when Jeff McCullough is who I see on all the videos?

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,170
That makes no sense. I'll try to I'll try to answer that question for you.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
So Professor Jeff and I have been doing this for a little while now.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,940
I taught his class last year for his executive master's program.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,480
It was virtual as well, too, with a couple of days up in Ann Arbor.

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,930
And I really, really enjoyed that to be to be very honest.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,480
So one of your current teachers or works in the Griffith Leadership Center is named Kathy Kalala.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:52,440
Hopefully you all know her. She's a wonderful person and she was a classmate of mine when I graduated from the program way back in 1997 with my MHC.

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,120
And Kathy and I have stayed in touch. And she's always known that I, I wanted to be a teacher.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,080
That was my great ambition growing up. But I went into the private sector.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,629
I'll give you my background in just a second. And something came up with Professor Jeff needed me to teach a class and I jumped

13
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,290
in because I've got some finance background and it turns out I really enjoy it.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,320
So and more opportunities come up. I usually raise my hand.

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,490
It's my way of kind of giving back to the program, kind of scratching that itch for teaching,

16
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,570
but mostly just to really stay connected and do something that I really enjoy so quickly, my background and sort of why I'm here.

17
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,330
And you know what I know about finance and the differences I think you'll see between Professor Jeff and myself.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,600
I graduated again with an MHC in 1997.

19
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,150
Now, don't hate me. My undergraduate degree is from Notre Dame.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,700
Sorry, I graduated in 1992. I had a business degree there.

21
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,990
And long story short, I ended up in consulting.

22
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,770
I spent, uh, six, seven years doing consulting work, and then I moved from consulting into bond ratings.

23
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:05,100
And there's a lot of different bond rating agencies that are out there. I've worked for two of the Big Three, so I just have one more to collect.

24
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,750
So I spent about 15 years at Standard and Poor's, and I moved about five years ago over to Fitch Ratings, and that's where I am today.

25
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:21,629
And in that role I work with a lot of, uh, CFOs, Treasurers, VP of Finance when they issue debt and bonds.

26
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,110
Uh, so we dove very deep into the financing aspect of it,

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,280
and that gives me a lot of familiarity with this course material far and above what I used to be when I took the class, quite frankly.

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,049
Now this class is HP 607. It is, uh, I got a corporate health care finance for administrators, and that's exactly what it is.

29
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,290
It's not meant to be a deep, deep dove into.

30
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,060
I want to be a treasurer or a CFO or a VP of Finance or whatever it might be.

31
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:56,730
It's a I'm an administrator, and I need to understand a lot of the terminology and what it means and and frankly, some of it how it's calculated.

32
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,710
But just knowing how it's used when you make those financing decisions is very important.

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,520
So I'll tell you the main difference, I think between Professor Geoff and I. Geoff is really a corporate guy, which is great and the logic is sound.

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,060
Absolutely. So if you can do this in the calculations for corporates, you can do it for not for profits.

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,290
Corporates can do a lot of different things that not for profits can't do.

36
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,520
The biggest one is issue stock. So you can have an equity investment.

37
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,230
Now I am a tried and true through and through, not for profit guy.

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,490
So when we get into some of the material, it'll be a little bit.

39
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,129
Well, here's what the textbook says and what Professor Jeff says.

40
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,990
And and here's what I'm going to say really happens in the boardroom of a not for profit and how they make some decisions.

41
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,870
And I hope you find that dynamic as interesting as I do. And and we'll certainly learn together through the semester.

42
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,399
I think you'll find I am easily reachable and accessible.

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,620
I am working a full time day job, as they say,

44
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,710
but come Wednesday nights I'm yours and we'll do classes on Wednesday nights with office hours right after.

45
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,209
And I'll give you all my text information and email information and ways to reach me.

46
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:10,910
And I also think you'll find I'm an easy grader. I shouldn't say that too loud, but look, I sat in your shoes.

47
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,570
I know exactly what it's like. So here's to 607.

48
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,499
Can't wait to get started. We will see you guys soon.

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,680
And really, really. I'm looking forward to it. I hope you guys enjoy it.

50
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,460
I promise I'll do my best to make, you know, health care financing fun.

51
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,000
I know that that sounds difficult, but. But we're going to get it done together.

52
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,040
All right. We'll see you soon. Thanks so much.
