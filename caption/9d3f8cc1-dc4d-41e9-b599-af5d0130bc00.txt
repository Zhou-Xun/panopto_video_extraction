1
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:23,770
Okay. All right. So we separated our segment into three types of health implications mental health,

2
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,470
reproductive health and or women's health, excuse me, and then physical health.

3
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:37,750
So I'll start off with mental health. We saw in that first segment, kind of their whole world was falling apart.

4
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,820
Slowly but surely, their society was disintegrating and.

5
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:53,550
What that brings on is a lot of stress and anxiety and possibly later on, people can develop post-traumatic stress disorder and.

6
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,750
The uncertainty of someone's future when their country is going through like a civil war or revolution,

7
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,959
you know, makes them question whether they're going to have stability in their lives.

8
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:17,480
And ultimately, what that leads to is the scenario that we saw in the movie where the two sisters and their cousin had to leave.

9
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:31,510
So on top of that, another discussion that we had was about like kind of the social consequences that occur when there's civil unrest in society.

10
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,149
And one of those consequences is like this term called a brain drain,

11
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,330
where all the brilliant or talented, educated people in a country begin to leave.

12
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,000
And what that does is it affects the health systems that are in place in that country.

13
00:02:49,450 --> 00:03:00,970
So we have less doctors. We have less, you know, community organizers who can maintain these health systems and provide the services that people want.

14
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:09,520
And so another thing we discussed was the mental health aspect of things is that now that there's war and bombings,

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,290
people aren't going to want to seek out services. They're not going to want to get their, you know, birth control or their anxiety medications,

16
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,059
because right now what they're worried about is whether they're going to get attacked in the

17
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,620
middle of the night or if they're going to have to grab all their things last minute and flee.

18
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:38,590
So yeah. And then we also talked about women's health and you know, as we saw in the movie, multiple incidences of late,

19
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:47,200
one major incidents of sexual assault and then just sexual harassment that happened as the country decayed, more and more away from stability.

20
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,200
And just how about in any revolution, you know, or any, you know, civil war or anything like that,

21
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,820
where you start to lose that kind of like social stability, you're going to see increased rates of rape and sexual assault.

22
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,079
And, you know, with that would come increased rates of STDs.

23
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,870
And that, coupled with decreased medical access,

24
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,510
could mean more people dying of STDs or at least getting really bad infections from them and not get treatment.

25
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,320
And, you know, none that the attacks on women typically spill over to attacks on children.

26
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,950
You know, that kind of comes with the territory. So I think that that was a major issue that we saw.

27
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,620
And then inherently, as you guys, all parties go to, is a sort of a burden on your fiscal health as well,

28
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:41,870
because the reality of it through you made the point to us, if you have bombshells falling from the sky, it's an unsafe environment to go outside.

29
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,890
You're not going to be thinking about, how can I go on a morning jog? Where can I get vegetables from the market?

30
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,510
You're probably not even going to be thinking about let me go get a physical from my doctor because it's just not safe.

31
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,419
It's not relevant to your priorities at the time, which are kind of exist essentially.

32
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,420
I mean, even as we saw in the movie, their house lost power.

33
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,770
That's a priority that you're going to be thinking of before you think about your health.

34
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,420
And you're probably going to. CONAN The people on Zuma and you was about her.

35
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,370
I mean, I think none. Not Maria.

36
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,700
Rachel? Are you there? You have something to add?

37
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,320
I think you've covered most of what we had to say. I like the.

38
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,399
I had like one specific thing.

39
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,190
I don't know if it's like general generic or I don't know that word if you can like generalize it to the entire population.

40
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:47,850
But like the pressure that would have been put on like sarin you saw during that time to like maintain like a sense of normalcy,

41
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,049
I guess, like for their family,

42
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:57,390
like their father wanted them to keep swimming and like compete for a country that was like actively falling apart and like as an athlete,

43
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,790
like, trying to, like, sort of like, rationalize that and like the kind of schedule that they would have been on and trying to balance,

44
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,839
like coping with everything that was going on in their country with this,

45
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,610
like intense practice schedule with like still trying to do schooling and stuff like

46
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,040
that amount of pressure like would have impacted every like aspect of their life.

47
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,629
And so, like, I don't know if, like the entire population was dealing with that,

48
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:29,910
but like the two girls who were like the focus of the film would have been something that like, I think really stood out to me.

49
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:31,820
Yeah.

50
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:40,420
And to that point, the entire population, you know, obviously is in training to become Olympians, but there was still deal with that to some extent.

51
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:50,379
The classic example is in education when there was, you know, what's called a lost generation, which Dr. Lada spoke about a bit.

52
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:57,150
So an entire generation, people who just never went to school and just like how they might not want to go swimming because of track.

53
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,370
This all know just doesn't seem to make sense then.

54
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,060
Same thing with children go to school or you know, people go to university or those kind of things.

55
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,970
So. Absolutely. So great points that you all brought out.

56
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:18,070
Say you from the W.H.O. and you went right now to Damascus to set up your mission over that.

57
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:27,709
What would your interventions be? What would your priorities be? I guess priority one would be like the physical health side because you can't

58
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,770
really deal with your mental health and to your physical health until you're not.

59
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,630
I mean, if you're just been shot or something like that. So I guess that's satisfying that need.

60
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:45,559
On the hierarchy first and making sure people are fed and clothed and housed because you know, the pictures of Damascus were just horrifying.

61
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,000
It's just rubble that's like once giant cities are just piles of concrete very hard.

62
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,630
Oh, how how would you do that then? How would you.

63
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,200
I guess camps would be the first and best way to do that.

64
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,320
Like setting up, like, sheltered camps. I guess that would be like the first level for.

65
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,610
Well, boy, you kind of brought up reminds me of Lisa maslow's hierarchy of needs.

66
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,180
So if we're able to get food and safe shelters first, that would be great.

67
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:30,540
And then. Bringing in maybe people from the outside who are familiar with the area to be able to help some of the people cope with the trauma

68
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:40,530
that they just experienced or kind of help them organize their next steps after getting from like a dangerous place to place.

69
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,340
And who would your partners be? I guess whoever is currently in control, I'm not actually quite sure is.

70
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,889
I probably lean more towards international partners.

71
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,900
Partners than necessarily, you know, government or international or I mean,

72
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,780
almost governmental organizations squaring, which is because they're currently caught up in what's actually happening.

73
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,800
So either international partners or preexisting non-governmental organizations that are already trying to do similar work.

74
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,230
Jacob, you want the White Helmets, right? Yes. Just chat about it pretty quick.

75
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,390
Oh, yes. So it was a documentary. It's actually on Netflix about the last remaining.

76
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,110
I don't remember what specific city I guess was into, but I think it was the massacre.

77
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,379
It was the last remaining first responders group. And they were called White Helmets because they all wore White Helmets to identify themselves

78
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,960
as noncombatants that were just there to try to pull people out of rubble and stuff.

79
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,780
But they still got attacked all the time by both sides.

80
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:50,170
And they it was it's really worth watching because it's really, really crazy to see what happens when, like the entire system breaks down.

81
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:58,360
And all you've got is a small group of people that are trying to trying to provide the most basic life support stuff.

82
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,360
Those are just kind of heroic because it's just it's just normal people who happen to get a little bit of, you know,

83
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,249
first responder training and they would just run out of their house whenever they saw, you know, bomb explosions.

84
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,370
And it's it's really worth seeing. Yeah.

85
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,380
Did anybody watch the. But with Rachel dead.

86
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:25,580
Yeah, I was going to talk about that a little bit because that's like and like not outside organization, like, gets doctors from,

87
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,550
I think Damascus who are they're like the last remaining ones and they have this like completely

88
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,840
underground hospital because like everything above ground has been completely bombed,

89
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:43,339
but they have like no access to like medication or like anesthesia and all of that stuff.

90
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,850
And so I guess if I was in that position and I was like on a plane over there,

91
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:55,129
not like I would want to bring stuff or like have things like get them the supplies that they need to continue running like their operations,

92
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,530
the way that they need to be, like getting people on a seizure,

93
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,839
like basic pain medication or like supplies and food because like food was another issue

94
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,010
and they killed because they were trying to like feed everybody with like a bag of rice.

95
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:17,029
And so like that would be sort of like what I would lean towards focusing is like supporting the existing infrastructure that's already like the stuff

96
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,089
that's already there and run by people who've been there for a long time and

97
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,320
sort of like understand what's going on and like what they need to prioritize.

98
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,299
So that's sort of what I would lean towards. Highly recommend watching the cave.

99
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,380
It's on the like discussions tab and our canvas.

100
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:46,439
Marcus So you want to begin of awesome any questions of happiness for this group?

101
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,489
But I suppose I really also wouldn't be I'm not sure of the qualities of what it would be,

102
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,440
but there's serious limitations about what you can do in the moment.

103
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,000
But would it also be worthwhile to invest in creating safe houses for people to live?

104
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:11,210
Yes. And that's something they've done. So they've got the U.N. office building.

105
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,690
Coordination of humanitarian affairs on the Security Council.

106
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:22,550
They negotiate with both sides, saying when will we have a ceasefire so we can help you to come out and bring supplies ahead?

107
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,020
That's a really important then I guess it's an entirely separate conversation.

108
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Does the United Nations have a responsibility at a certain point,

109
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,740
once chemical weapons start getting used and everything like that for any type of intervention, not just the United Nations.

110
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,650
Every country. So there's a concept in international law called Drive to Protect,

111
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:50,520
which is any country can essentially use any military force when a government is harming its own people.

112
00:12:51,530 --> 00:13:02,669
So probably go to the U.N. Security Council. Ultimately, of course, and again, smoky because as well, we just giving guns to to to combatants because,

113
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,990
you know, they just decide which one the U.S. has done in other countries.

114
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,060
And so it seems what the U.S. and the other is doing is working out more of what you're saying.

115
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,920
Yes. Any ideas?

116
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,510
Good. Thanks so much. Group number two, please. And did you have the slides over?

117
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:44,010
Yeah, we have the supply. Shared it with Ned.

118
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,530
I voted for it and it wasn't like I could share. I want to ask you.

119
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:33,010
Something. Who knows what's worse for them, right?

120
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,900
Or maybe there was. Or that was.

121
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:49,570
I know. But way I think our allies.

122
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,850
And. There you go.

123
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,260
Thank you. All right.

124
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,700
So we got the trip from Syria to Germany, which was.

125
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,730
Follow up opportunities or other health outcomes.

126
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:21,589
Okay. So first we want to address the logistics of the journey as we saw like in the movie,

127
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:30,500
like you needed to have money or equitable assets to even think of leaving the country because every time they entered a new situation was like,

128
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,210
this is 2000 bucks here, this is $500 here. So they're like just bleeding money.

129
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,069
And most of the travel was like very dangerous.

130
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,340
So you had to be like 100% healthy and able bodied.

131
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,440
Like, it would be, like, hard to imagine,

132
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:54,890
like someone with any sort of like physical disability trying to like get into that boat and like survive the journey.

133
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,089
And also you need that ability.

134
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:07,399
If you did have some like medications that you need to take, you need to be able to like store up an audit, which, as we heard from the last group,

135
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:14,660
it's like nearly impossible during war time to even, like, get, like, basic supplies,

136
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:21,469
let alone like specific medications and plus, like the logistics of like going between countries.

137
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,990
You have to like know a guy going into it. Otherwise you're had to deal with con men that are like,

138
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:35,420
give me $2,000 and then like you get dropped off in the middle of the woods and you always run the risk of like being left there.

139
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,820
And we also cited risk for there are elevators for elderly women,

140
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:50,929
mothers and children because these populations are like more vulnerable to like some of

141
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:56,990
the wear and tear up the journey and diseases and often need more specialized care.

142
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,190
And like this kind of goes with the earlier one.

143
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,360
You can't be on any sort of dialysis or chemotherapy treatment.

144
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,979
And and this one's more relevant for this example.

145
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:18,020
But if you're traversing water, can you even swim or do any like basic life skills to get across the water?

146
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:28,170
Yes. A kind of somewhat a group one a lot of like the adverse health outcomes that we talked about had to do with just like immediate,

147
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:34,170
like bodily wellness. Just because, as Courtney said, this is just such a taxing journey,

148
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:42,480
like only people like who are like very well and like athletic could really like, you know, fare decently, all this type of thing.

149
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:49,979
So especially like in terms of nutrition problems, like in the actual journey on the water,

150
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,719
we saw that they actually like any supplies they had to like reduce some of the weight in the boat.

151
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,740
They started throwing those away and we saw that they constantly were like searching for water, like drinking from the tap and stuff like that.

152
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,799
And we didn't really necessarily like see how hungry they were, how often they had access to food.

153
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,980
But it can be, you know, pretty safely assume that they were really lacking in resources.

154
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,270
So like, you know, obviously lack of water was something that we saw pretty obviously in the movie.

155
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:28,230
And then there's no steady food source and only some countries were like readily providing resources.

156
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,250
So then that kind of like created a problem for not knowing like how long they were

157
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,640
going to be in a certain country and how long those resources were going to last,

158
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:42,210
especially for the people. That wasn't as much of a focus of the movie, but that were marching across Europe.

159
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,979
You know, I imagine that they had to stretch their supplies pretty thinly,

160
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,980
especially if they were in one country that was willing to give them food and then had

161
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,250
to go across another country where they had no idea where they might get resources.

162
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:03,269
So yeah, they reportedly their belongings. And then so as part of like some of the solutions like definitely nonperishable food items again because

163
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,540
you don't know how you're going to have to ration or how long that's going to last and waterproof

164
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:15,959
and then nutrient dense food items and like high calorie options and then formula because Courtney

165
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,660
had reminded us that at in our movie it gave a statistic that around 50% of refugees are under 18.

166
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:29,190
So there's lots of children who are probably in need of like nutrient supplements and like some of the nutty bars.

167
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:38,129
What were they called? It can't be. You know, it's something that like options like that that are nonperishable and nutrient dense and retailers

168
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,380
specifically for children since that such a large percentage of like refugee population.

169
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,960
Why do you think so many refugees or children under age 18?

170
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:59,350
I knew I was there. But, you know, if you go under the age of 18, you could file to be reunited with your family, which is what you was trying to do.

171
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:13,359
Yeah. And another good point about, ah, it was somebody before about how sometimes the process of being reunited can take years.

172
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,840
And by the time that process completes you sometimes like it's just probably more

173
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,660
quicker out of that or it's safer obviously to just cross instead of waiting.

174
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,979
Yeah, I would expect too that maybe families want to prioritize getting the youngest, say, first, you know, like mother,

175
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:41,320
father and mother, you know, you guys go and you'll be safe because, you know, it's the journey was treacherous, but so was staying put.

176
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:52,810
So. Exactly. Okay. One more thing, I think also, which I mentioned earlier about kids being animals by violence.

177
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,680
That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely all of those together.

178
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:06,550
Good. And then so obviously along with the journey, it was just like the sheer physical toll.

179
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,180
And so I can imagine that resulted in a lot of like bodily injury.

180
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,820
So just like sheer exhaustion and dehydration, like I can't imagine, like, you know,

181
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,960
you'd have to be incredibly healthy to even like attempt to tackle that and then risk of drowning,

182
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:28,130
like Courtney said, like there is a lot of people in the film who were like, I couldn't physically swim even if I had to.

183
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:37,160
The risk of physical assault and sexual assault, as we saw, both no access, medical treatment or first aid in that case,

184
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,850
like if somebody like cut themselves, for example, on the barbed wire crossing that border,

185
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:47,509
like when would they be able to get any type of like antiseptic or any type of treatment for that, especially something like that,

186
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:52,729
when they're in like conditions that aren't really like hygienic, you know, something like that could turn serious.

187
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,930
And there's no real options for first aid, no access like formula,

188
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,919
diaper supplies for young children, especially going back to the nutritional aspect.

189
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,280
If there's a mother who is like lactating or breastfeeding, if she's nutrient deficient, she might start producing breast milk.

190
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,560
So that's not a sure bet either. No medications like we touched on.

191
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,920
And then so potential solutions, maybe aid for safe passage once in the EU, the destination countries,

192
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:25,280
which is something I think they're going to talk about later because that I think gets a little finicky and

193
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,590
then like potentially first aid and pop up clinics to triage immediate injuries and treat for exhaustion,

194
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,390
which I'm sure there are options in some of the refugee camps that they didn't necessarily touch on in the film,

195
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,890
but just more readily available first aid and stuff like that, I think.

196
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,660
So prejudice and discrimination was a sort of getting on to it.

197
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:55,810
A lot of the time when they finally reached their destination. So the paperwork of getting your status takes up two years.

198
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,270
And even when children go like you tried to do before you're 18 to get reunited,

199
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,270
by the time she would have gotten the ability to apply, she would have been over 18.

200
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:10,619
So. That we were talking about how that rule is understandable.

201
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,250
But, you know, having the cut off at 18 is kind of finicky because most families who have children

202
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,239
young enough that they would be able to reach that threshold before they're 18,

203
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,520
probably wouldn't feel comfortable sending those kids across on this journey in the first place.

204
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,080
Each border crossing has different obstacles, as we saw in the film.

205
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,500
You know, interpersonal violence notwithstanding, there are systematic differences.

206
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,750
And this leaves a lot of opportunity for exploitation, especially when they don't understand the language.

207
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:48,989
And we saw that this also was an opportunity for families to be split up as both sisters who

208
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,400
spoke English had to go with a different car so that everyone had access to an English speaker.

209
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,670
Gender based violence along the way, as was spoken about in the first group.

210
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,160
The discrimination factor also leads to this and.

211
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:16,650
Reading very quickly the gender based violence. This entire journey we saw when they got to Hungary, she experienced some gender based violence.

212
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,620
And this leads into these other factors that we'll talk about.

213
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:31,690
One thing that I wanted to touch on before I headed this off was that anxiety and depression made it hard to continue the journey.

214
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:38,280
And so this is something that. You saw herself experience when she was in.

215
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:45,169
Serbian. Yeah.

216
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,370
And so when they experienced these traumas after experiencing repeated trauma at home,

217
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,439
it makes it really hard to sustain your resilience along the entire journey,

218
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:04,430
which takes a really long time, and it just takes a lot of mental energy, physical energy, emotional energy to continue to experience this trauma.

219
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,900
From those lines to actor. Sorry.

220
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,500
I don't know how to get back. Crystal.

221
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:24,739
Okay. But along those lines as well, after repeated experience of that, it would be harder to maintain a sense of calm.

222
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:32,650
So when the boat they quit, the motor quit working, they were increasing panic and trying to save one second in that situation really anyway.

223
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:38,719
And then it just really continued because more experiences and they are so many in

224
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,840
their home country before they left and then it just continued to make it worse.

225
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,330
For instance, like when they did have to split up because they spoke English,

226
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,839
if you had to weigh those pros and cons of doing that because that's what they had to do, as was the best way to get there.

227
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,340
But then waiting for the once to arrive after they left and stop and just not knowing

228
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,270
if you would ever be able to meet up and still having to continue to move forward,

229
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,930
kind of regardless of all the other experiences that were still going on the same time and

230
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,540
for an intervention and that it would be nice to have counselors at all of these checkpoints,

231
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,709
but. We already struggle to have counselors at our own clinic.

232
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:21,150
So it's an ideal that we would have mental health interventions along the way for these refugees, but.

233
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,650
Systematically. It is kind of hard to wrap your head around how that would be done in a efficient way.

234
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah, for all these interventions, it's really tough. For a few reasons did.

235
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,330
But you touched on obviously in the movie as well.

236
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:44,850
They talked about how they would want to go on the that the government didn't know about the police and have that studied.

237
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,160
So you can't position, you know,

238
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:52,290
the types of mental health counselors in a certain place because then the police know that's where you can go to catch people.

239
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,840
Mobile phones are a great thing and everybody has a mobile phone.

240
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:03,200
And something I've seen done quite successfully is having counselors on call on mobile phones,

241
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,940
or you call like a paramedic and they can help walk you through gang for traumatic injuries.

242
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:18,570
Something which I was involved in in Malaysia as well, was actually training refugees on how to give first aid, including psychological first aid.

243
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:24,720
So these then maybe, you know, out of every hundred refugees, one knows how to take care of basic injuries.

244
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,140
That can be also like a stopgap until they got to Germany. But this is probably the most difficult thing to do for.

245
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Okay. So we talked about some possible solutions.

246
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:44,350
So we brought up that a lot of people, when they travel from country to country,

247
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:48,399
there's often a lot of bureaucracy when they get to places like mainland Europe,

248
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,040
for example, because they might arrive somewhere like Greece or hungry or Poland,

249
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,130
but they might want to get somewhere like Germany or France and things like that.

250
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,780
So we're talking about helping kind of like facilitate that travel.

251
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:09,670
So maybe having to save costs along the travel route where they can get like food, water, they can rest, possibly things like that.

252
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,260
And like you mentioned,

253
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:19,350
like they would obviously have to be in places where the government roll out because like once you claim asylum as a specific scheme,

254
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,010
they're not allowed to leave that country.

255
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:31,480
And then also just providing basic supplies on travel routes to like food, like hygiene products and just whatever else people may need.

256
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,020
And then like, as it was mentioned about like, for instance, Palestinians,

257
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:43,030
although like probably into something like having like concerts, like my car is probably the best and.

258
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:52,340
Yeah. And also like just having more of a kind of like a more word of mouth type of thing just to kind

259
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:59,060
of like keep it under the radar since a lot of these I'm sorry to just keep a lot of things like,

260
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:09,700
um, because like, unfortunately in reality some of the things like kind of under the radar and just having more like basic supplies like medication.

261
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:18,620
And we talk a lot about like insulin or some people we need like hypertension medication and it's like.

262
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,970
Yeah. Yeah. And you had a point. It probably wouldn't be something that you're doing this.

263
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,530
It would be more grassroots efforts and community based organization kind of work.

264
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:34,080
Any comments or questions from drastic loss? Also.

265
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:45,679
And number three, please. I would just do back on the journey of the boat.

266
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:54,630
I used to be a boat which would go around and rescue migrants and refugees who were in the water then the Italians, the ships.

267
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:11,160
Another thing happened. That's it.

268
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:17,920
That's what each other? No, no. I mean the Italians that you can do whatever you want in your own territory.

269
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,310
All those neighbors and everybody. What is it? I can talk.

270
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:29,560
There's so many other things that I can do that go underground.

271
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,920
Where is it from? Gender based violence, some sort of culture shock.

272
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,890
And then go to school in West Virginia.

273
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,129
Infectious disease. I'm sorry.

274
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,850
We didn't know what we're talking about. Who was it? Well, it was a collective effort.

275
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,200
A lot of cycling and multiple infections.

276
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:02,280
We're thinking about what we all said, but. So we had the part in the journey in which they've arrived at Germany and now

277
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,870
they're seeking asylum officially in Germany and they are at the refugee camp.

278
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:17,969
Immediately we started thinking about what those camps conditions are, how those are influencing the health of the asylum seekers.

279
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,130
We thought immediately about infectious disease.

280
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,550
We saw in the movie that there were it was communal living, that they were sharing bedrooms with others.

281
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:33,809
There weren't doors to the bedrooms or curtains, I believe. And it also didn't look like there were ceilings going across the bedrooms.

282
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:41,820
So there's limited ability to isolate the spread of antiviral agents, for sure.

283
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,410
And then we're also concerned about a communal living, you know, communal sharing of bathrooms.

284
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,570
And when you don't have access to things like shower shoes, you're risking fungal infections.

285
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,390
You also looked up a couple of statistics that lower respiratory infections are pretty common in Germany, so we're worried about that.

286
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:12,059
Also, having TB is very prominent areas of this country that you have refugees coming in with TB that are spreading TB within the complexes.

287
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:20,760
And then of course, any other airborne infectious disease could certainly spread and most conditions given a of containment.

288
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,690
Yeah. So then we kind of touched on mental health impacts and this is kind of like a really broad group for

289
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:32,340
us because we kind of had to surmise all the mental health impacts that occurred throughout the movie.

290
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,610
So I think about the PTSD that occurred from having to be in the war in the first place and having to actively seek out refugee.

291
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:46,290
Then we see it from one part in the movie. They only offer mental health counseling once a week on Saturdays and the actual complex

292
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,250
they're visiting and I talked about like the predominant religions within Germany,

293
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:57,720
Christianity, I think is the most prominent and the most prominent minority. Religion is Islamic religion, which is what is most prominent in Syria.

294
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:02,580
So it kind of people did not want to go to these mental health counselors that they're not already

295
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,710
Muslim or practicing Islamic religion because it kind of sways them away from their own religion.

296
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,820
So it's not really a viable option for them.

297
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,210
We have to think about the stress that these girls are also under because their fathers pressured them to be like Olympic athletes,

298
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,410
especially the ages of 17. And your teenage years. That's a lot of developmental stress.

299
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,390
And then adding to that, we have the additive stress of, you know,

300
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:31,739
you start wanting to join the refugee team for the Olympics and overhearing people talk about the refugee team and how it's like kind of a pity

301
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:40,080
party for athletes and that hurts her and even more so stresses her out about her father's interpretation of her and how she's perceived by others.

302
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,220
We also do think about the, as you have mentioned before, how youths were aged out for the family reunion.

303
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,920
That was like their main reason and that was their whole reason, convincing their father to even go on the track to make it to Germany.

304
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,320
So to know that they can't even go through that option,

305
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,780
it's a lot for them to deal with and there's not very much access for them and the actual complex to deal with these issues.

306
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,520
You know, so to kind of end up with the mental illness aspect of it was also the the idea

307
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,460
because we were talking about the whole refugee aspect of it from Syria to Germany.

308
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,030
We wanted to touch on the whole culture shock idea that was going on with people from different countries,

309
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,860
not just Syria, but from all around Europe moving over to Germany.

310
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:39,750
So you're going to experience that. But also this idea that you are in a refugee camp regardless of the organization that is within this camp.

311
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:45,720
And then I actually wanted to talk because of that aspect about Mazir himself.

312
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,690
And this actually brought up the idea of potential for gender based violence within the refugee camp.

313
00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:05,700
And NASIR was actually interesting. And we actually saw this trip in the middle of this year due to visit Sara, Sara and Yusra in the complex.

314
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:12,330
And so we saw potential for a kind of gender based violence from a lack of security.

315
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,290
Well, so it was interesting. There was a sort of.

316
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,440
A basis for mental.

317
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:34,319
The whole mental mental health impact for New Zealand felt because I think in there was a scene where he had he wanted to go clubbing

318
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:45,480
a lot and he had problems with that because on his first night he pretty much went clubbing with Sarah and Yusra and that was it.

319
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,840
Nobody else does. Him and the other two. And that was it.

320
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,410
And that was his experience in Germany.

321
00:35:52,830 --> 00:36:01,080
So there's been not a lot of experience, I think in refugees was kind of just you hit a wall in terms of accessibility.

322
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,220
So I think that that's sort of like an experience.

323
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:13,920
And also there's also things with health crises where asylum seekers do not appear to come over with evidence of vaccination.

324
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:22,710
And what does the health care system all supposed to be looks like to help those refugees?

325
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:31,680
Instead. We just didn't know what health services are offered to them when they get there.

326
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,979
Like if they get sick, who do they go to go to they seek out treatment for?

327
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,150
How do they afford treatments there in that country since they aren't making money themselves?

328
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,630
Who's partnering with them to give them some kind of cards to get medical access?

329
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,000
Do they need insurance for this? Like, where do they even go?

330
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:50,850
They don't know the layout of Germany themselves, and it's hard for them to kind of get access to the medical treatments they need.

331
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,559
And again, we don't have vaccination records of them, so we don't know if they have I don't know,

332
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,010
a TB vaccination perhaps, which could be either good or bad for them because it's not really good vaccine.

333
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,440
But somebody here, they're like, that's neither here nor there,

334
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,770
but that would be beneficial and like helping them with their access to medical treatment.

335
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,470
So it kind of sucks not having any information on what that looks like inside of a facility.

336
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:22,320
BCG vaccine, the TB, that stuff on your lungs is the only one you can actually tell if somebody has had access to prescription medication.

337
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:27,520
I think so. That's a problem for them as well, from what we could tell,

338
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,850
because Germany does have a socialized healthcare system that literally every other developed country in the world.

339
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:41,220
So I don't think access to healthcare in terms of quality, it would be an issue but definitely navigate the system.

340
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,110
Yeah. Each know but I do. I go and even visit the doctor and speak English.

341
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,070
Would be sorry on Arabic would be quite difficult.

342
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,659
Yeah. And that was another concern too, just with accessing basic needs.

343
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,340
Like what? What if you have to go outside a complex to access those basic needs?

344
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:06,030
What violence are you potentially susceptible to as an asylum seeker, as a woman, as.

345
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:13,360
A Syrian refugee particularly. So we didn't. We didn't ki key into that so much.

346
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:19,300
And we saw a lot of that, of course, on our journey, but not so much as they were asylum seekers.

347
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,390
And to those points as well, when I was working in Malaysia,

348
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:31,059
we had a lot of issues with women not wanting to give birth in health facilities because of gender based violence by healthcare staff against women.

349
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,210
So that was a big issue, which we also saw in Bangladesh.

350
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:44,020
It's just absolutely horrific. But secondly, quite often doctors and nurses would call the police on refugee women giving birth.

351
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:51,849
But you know, they have a legal right to be in Malaysia. But the police didn't come and take them to, you know, prison for a few days,

352
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:58,360
just as a way of saying don't use our health care system, which happens in quite a few other places as well.

353
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,660
I think Germany has done that, but there is still that.

354
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:08,650
Sure. And of course, that has complications on the mental health system, especially when you're in the country for a long time seeking asylum.

355
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,270
So we sort of all together thought about what possible interventions might be.

356
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,750
It was sort of hard to think about these because they are more systemic, as other groups have alluded to.

357
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:27,549
And the movie didn't really allude to certain things like health care access, nutritional access,

358
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:32,650
affordability of groceries, etc. Things like that weren't really honed in on.

359
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,770
And towards the end of the movie as we were focusing on her journey to the Olympics.

360
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:43,269
But we thought of a couple of things. One, to provide culture some culturally sensitive counseling services to refugees,

361
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:51,630
we see that one potential barrier to accessing those services is one stigma.

362
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,740
And then to also just knowing that you're going to a certain location, everyone knows that you're going to get care.

363
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,620
But that really is a stigma, of course.

364
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:08,050
So again, with that reducing mental health stigma, how we do that and in a in a setting like the refugee complex,

365
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:14,140
what does access to religious services look like? We know that can be quite restorative when people have access to those services.

366
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:20,360
Again we don't want to that very much the movie towards the end there.

367
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:26,480
Again, Amir brought up a very good point that we need access to translators for asylum seekers.

368
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,330
That's a big barrier to accessing basic needs within a complex and then outside a complex as well.

369
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:44,269
In regards to infectious disease, we thought about maybe we need to ensure that these complexes have good air filtration for those airborne diseases.

370
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,080
And then what does sanitation services exactly look like in these places,

371
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:55,460
especially in our thinking about criminal backgrounds and communal living areas? I'll touch on the other ones.

372
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,570
Oh, again, we talked about it before. Like what a health services look like? We don't know.

373
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:06,099
And how do you have access to these? Yeah.

374
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:12,219
I thought that was just like the security on stage going back to like the gender based violence because he women,

375
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,570
their cousin came in the first night was like, go clubbing. I'm like, oh, it's like maybe like 2:00 in the morning.

376
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,820
They're like, how did you just slip in there like that? They're scenes where he's just in there, hanging out with them late at night in the hallways.

377
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,459
And if it's just that easy for someone else to get in there, then like,

378
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,790
how are we ensuring that the people, mainly the women and children in this building, are safe?

379
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,990
You know, it's disconcertingly easy to get into refugee camps.

380
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,959
They will always say, you know, these foments and all this stuff and that they let me into the one in Kenya,

381
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:46,720
like you mentioned it, kind of like it's really concerning who your partners.

382
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,380
Yeah. Yeah, I did a little bit of this.

383
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,619
So one of the partners they already have there is the State Office for Refugee Affairs that actually has a whole name to it that is German,

384
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,250
but I'm not going to try and say that. So it's just a repeat laugh.

385
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:06,610
F And so we basically saw their implementation of their interventions already in the movie.

386
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:11,980
So when you first come across, you'll have the initial reception or an emergency shelter for the first couple of months.

387
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,320
And here they do provide you three meals a day.

388
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,050
They also write you a stipend for clothing, along with donation of clothing from the people of Berlin to help refugees.

389
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,620
And they give money twice a year to the family for their own personal needs.

390
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,730
Additionally, since you're not eligible to work until your working visa comes in,

391
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:33,850
they're able to perform charitable work, and they are compensated for this by the same state office for Refugee Affairs.

392
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:39,009
And then they are provided a little medical card that they can use to go to different health facilities,

393
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,390
and they hand it to them so they can get their fees waived. So they do have access to medical care.

394
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:50,469
We see that a lot in this movie. And then another one I talk too much onto what the Germany International Rescue Committee was.

395
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:55,510
You're just pretty. They work with both government and nonprofit agencies to kind of work on getting people

396
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:01,239
situated from refugee situations and getting them acclimated to life because the government,

397
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,440
that's definitely the main problem. Any questions from across the street?

398
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,320
Thank you. Well, my question was, I don't know if you guys looked into this, but like,

399
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:22,490
what happens if they have like a pass or anything because they made a big deal about like it was almost like waiting.

400
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,760
If they're getting your pictures taken 500 times, getting fingerprints and then showing all the paperwork that you would walk into,

401
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:34,530
like, what if something got thrown out the boat along the way or they just didn't have it right?

402
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,480
We did not look into that. I don't know. I don't know. That is so I can't say.

403
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:47,420
And it's a great question because I always it would take longer to get your papers fixed because they did make a note of like,

404
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:53,740
oh, it takes a while to get your papers situated. I would imagine it would take longer, but I'm not sure I.

405
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,750
Yeah, I know, I know. Yeah, I have no idea.

406
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:04,830
I mean, obviously a series of too bad because most people have passports and they would actually have been a Syrian embassy in Germany at the time.

407
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,790
Probably so. Um, but think about other countries like the refugees coming from Myanmar.

408
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,430
They have absolutely nothing. I'll try to find out.

409
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,740
And, like, you know, a lot of guys. Yeah. So it's interesting.

410
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,150
That's a worry about, too, because if you lose everything in the crosshairs, everything,

411
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,170
the Democrats are going to try to bring stuff out as it goes on their passport.

412
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:35,090
Then what do you do? And. Good question.

413
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:45,900
Thank you. So thanks so much.

414
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:53,350
It was a really interesting discussion. We had just one other thing.

415
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,650
Like I mentioned, this talk will be on Friday at noon.

416
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:08,160
So for me, biology would be giving a talk about her life and career.

417
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,680
And I will be moderating this.

418
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:22,340
I believe the link to register is on canvas and if you can't make it, still do register because they will send out a recording afterwards.

419
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:32,360
And if you watch this on a one page kind of response to it or something like that, we will give you extra credit.

420
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,510
How much do we say it was? 5% of the market.

421
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:42,430
Yep, 5%. Five percentage points on the final paper. Any questions on that?

422
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,870
Yeah. So why would you want to do anything like those of us who can't make it on?

423
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,760
They're going to watch that. Um, let's say.

424
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,770
December 8th in loss of the Sunshine State.

425
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,760
And that is all for today, on Thursday.

426
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,640
Got to get the crack here.

427
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:13,900
We'll come in and give a talk on global subjects which we've got interesting and that you both the readings of readings are already accessible.

428
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,650
See you all then. Take us. I think you.
