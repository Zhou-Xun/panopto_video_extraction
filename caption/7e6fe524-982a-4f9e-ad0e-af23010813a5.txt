1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,510
Go ahead and get started here. I hope everyone's having a good afternoon and it's great to see everybody after a two week pause or gap, let's say,

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,990
I wanted to to just sort of check in, make sure everybody was able to access the videos while I was gone.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,260
Thumbs up. Okay. So that's important, of course,

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,510
because the page I've got pulled up here is highlighting that the ionizing radiation exam opens today and needs to be completed this week.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,639
You should have all seen you've got your grades back on the quiz for energy and radiation.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,090
Everybody did great, so no concerns there. So this is kind of the next big milestone in the class.

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,660
Certainly reach out to me if you have any questions. I will also say and I should maybe I've said this before the quiz,

8
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:54,480
but in the sort of introductory section here for each of the exams, I'll give you a breakdown.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,459
You know, what are the types of questions and this page you can view even before you start the exam.

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:08,160
So if you have questions or sort of concerns about what's going to be on the exam, what's covered is the exam to be completed independently.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,500
And the answer is yes. So as I talked about previously, everything is open note in this class.

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,889
I don't want you wasting time memorizing stuff, but I also don't want you working in groups on the exams.

13
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,880
This should be an open book evaluation of sort of your mastery of the content.

14
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,020
And for the ionizing radiation exam. There's really only one website that you should be visiting, but you absolutely should visit.

15
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,150
That's the chart of radionuclide site.

16
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:45,809
I'll also say unlike the quiz, which was effectively auto graded, so there was no sort of free field response there for the exam.

17
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,670
There are some questions where I'm looking for you to show your work, so please do that.

18
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,129
I love to give partial credit.

19
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:01,200
So even if you don't get the final solution correct, if I can sort of follow your thought process, I'm very happy to give partial credit there.

20
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,100
So any questions about the exam? Please Orient.

21
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,319
Right. I'm trying to learn people's names. It's hard after a couple of weeks off.

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,000
But yes, please. So is this kind of like once you have all week to do it or something like that,

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,299
but you can only what you start of 2 hours to finish it it exactly right.

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,290
Okay. Yeah so you can take it whatever is your best test taking period of the day if that's morning, afternoon or night.

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,290
But when she started, you are plugged in and you've got the either 2 hours or for those of you who have requested accommodations,

26
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,290
you have an extended period. Yes. What is that? Yeah.

27
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:42,690
This is one where we can revisit the question once this is unlike quiz one.

28
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,569
So for this one, you can move forward and backward quiz one I should just revisit and review those questions.

29
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,250
But as you may have noticed, some of the later questions kind of had the answers to the earlier ones,

30
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,719
and that's just never quite made it on the top priority list.

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,299
But yes, for this one, you can move back and forth a great question. Okay.

32
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,420
And so once again, let me just apologize that I was out of the country for two straight weeks and not able to teach.

33
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,260
So everyone was able to access the videos next week.

34
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,250
I am once again out. I will say this is unprecedented in my ten years here that I've got so much travel in such a short period of time.

35
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,839
So next week again it'll be asynchronous, but hopefully after that it'll be smooth sailing.

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,350
And you know, for better or for worse, you'll be stuck with me here in the classroom.

37
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,120
So with that, unless there's any other questions.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,210
All right, we can go ahead and jump into our our content for today.

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,620
So it's hard to believe, but for the past five weeks have already been spent on ionizing radiation.

40
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,690
So we're shifting now into the next of our big physical hazards topics.

41
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:57,360
So we'll spend the next five weeks talking about noise. And as I mentioned to you, I think in our very first session together,

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm kind of emphasizing these two topics, especially because this one is terrifying.

43
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,470
It can kill you. And because this one is one that you will deal with in your career, I can virtually assure you.

44
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,079
And then once we're done with the noise component, we'll move on to some other still important,

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,780
but maybe less and less likely to be something you'll spend a lot of time on in your career things like human migration,

46
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:28,440
non-ionizing radiation and thermal and cold stress. And then just looking ahead, because I know you guys have lots and lots of assignments stacked up.

47
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:36,090
So the final exam is a very similar format to what you'll do for the ionizing radiation exam in that you have essentially all week to take it.

48
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,040
You can take it whenever you want, but you'll have sort of a two hour period to do it once you start.

49
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,839
And because ionizing radiation is sort of so distinct from all these other topics,

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,730
the final is not going to be comprehensive in that ionizing radiation is is off the table once you finish up with this ionizing radiation exam.

51
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,390
But all the other topics that you see on here, what will be on the file?

52
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,940
Any questions about that? All right.

53
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,409
So with this first session on noise, I'm going to. Oh, sorry, Andrew.

54
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,630
I can't see you behind the pillar for the case study. Does it for the case study?

55
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,450
Radiation exposure. Does it have to have like.

56
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,120
Significant impact on human health for villagers villagers exposure to.

57
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,600
It's a good question. I you know, my preference is there's some kind of health impact.

58
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,250
But if you have a situation where there is exposure and no health impact, that's that's fine.

59
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,780
So if you can find one that does have a health impact, that would be preferable because, again,

60
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,910
one of my goals here with all of these physical hazards is not just to sort of make you aware of them,

61
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,270
but to help you understand sort of how do they actually impact our health.

62
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,690
So that's my rationale there. Yeah, good question.

63
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,800
Sorry if I don't see you behind the pillar. Feel free to jump out or shout or toss something up here because you're just out of my line of sight.

64
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,930
All right. So in this first session on Noise, we're going to cover just some fundamentals of of noise and sound.

65
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
I'll talk about some of the sort of broad trends,

66
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,570
at least what we're aware of in terms of exposures that happen both in the workplace but also out in communities.

67
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,510
And then a couple of sort of major concept that we're going to touch on today are sound propagation,

68
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,090
which is how does sound move throughout the environment?

69
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,989
Sound frequency or pitch as we perceive it as which is very important in terms of both our perception,

70
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:39,120
but also to our health risk and then sound magnitude, basically the intensity or the amount of sound that we're exposed to.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,970
So, you know, we can start with this very kind of basic question of noise versus sound.

72
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,640
Noise in the past has had a very simple definition of just unwanted sound.

73
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,479
So, you know, that sort of implies, well, gosh, the music that I'm listening to is sound to me.

74
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,129
But my neighbor, who doesn't like hearing it through the wall, it's very much noise, same source, same level.

75
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,480
But to one person it's sound, to the other it's noise. So that is really a very subjective definition.

76
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,190
I'll say for the purposes of this class, I'm pretty much going to use these two things interchangeably.

77
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,999
Typically, if we're talking about a community or a workplace and we're talking about high levels of sound, that's often noise, it's unwanted.

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,250
It's not something that we're we're seeking out or sort of desirable in any way.

79
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:36,110
The other thing I'll say is there's kind of a sea change happening right now in that lots of folks, myself included,

80
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:44,540
are trying to lobby to get this very simplistic definition changed or amended a little bit to the unwanted or harmful sound.

81
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,850
Recognizing that some of you might go out and do really noisy things in your life,

82
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,020
they might be very pleasurable for you, but they might also be very harmful for you.

83
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,860
So the sound in that case is not unwanted, but it's still potentially causing harm to your health.

84
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,420
So that's kind of the the historical definition.

85
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,800
And again, kind of our working definition going forward is unwanted or harmful sound.

86
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,629
So a couple of things about noise. Just to start us off.

87
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,520
There are folks out there, including myself, who think that noise might be at least one artifact,

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,990
not the most common exposure in workplaces in the United States.

89
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,259
So the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,

90
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:33,889
or National estimates that somewhere between five and 30 million workers are exposed to what they define as hazardous levels of noise.

91
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,840
So that would be an eight hour average exposure of 85 decibels or more.

92
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:46,550
So that's about as loud as someone pushing a gas powered lawnmower for 8 hours just by by point of reference.

93
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Now, I'll say and some of you will already be aware of this when it comes to sort of understanding exposures.

94
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,040
The workplace is one of the places where we tend to have better data because we can actually go out and measure people.

95
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,379
And so if you look at an estimate like this and you're like 5 to 30 million people, bless you.

96
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:13,190
That is such a huge range. Well, this should tell you there's a lot of uncertainty here, because if the workforce,

97
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:20,030
which technically we could go out and we could measure every single worker in America if we wanted to spend the time and resources to do that,

98
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,990
if that's the best estimate we can come up with, that's not great.

99
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,440
It means we don't really have a true understanding of this.

100
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,580
And when we move to the community, it gets even worse.

101
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:39,200
So there's estimates that maybe more than 100 million Americans and how many Americans are there and anybody know approximately?

102
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,920
Patrick About 335. Yeah, right in there.

103
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,520
And so that would mean it's something like one in three or so Americans are potentially exposed

104
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,610
above what the Environmental Protection Agency considers to be safe for community exposures.

105
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:05,480
Now, both of these levels, 85 decibels for 8 hours or 70 decibels for 24 hours, are intended to reduce the likelihood of hearing impairment.

106
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,179
So one of the things that we'll talk about repeatedly and we've already touched on in radiation,

107
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,770
in fact, is, you know, we can't just focus on the level.

108
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,780
We also need to focus on the duration of exposure.

109
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,650
And if you're talking about a community that is all day, every day, 24 hours a day.

110
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:31,430
So sort of the the distillation of all this is there are a lot of people exposed to noise, both in the workplace and in the community.

111
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:40,340
There's also a lot of hearing loss cases that have occurred in the U.S. and so this number is wildly out of date and definitely an undercount.

112
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,500
But there's sort of 28 million confirmed cases of hearing loss in the United States,

113
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,510
and about 10 million of those are believed to be directly a result of noise.

114
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:59,149
Now, if we look today, the global estimates are just about 460 million people around the world out of a population of,

115
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,570
say, seven and a half billion who have a hearing loss.

116
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,530
And that's expected to rise to potentially a billion people by 2050.

117
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,630
So there is almost no other health outcome you could think of where it's like, wow,

118
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,940
one in seven people on the planet or one in 14 and today have this impediment.

119
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:26,630
So the numbers here are quite large. And yet, as we'll talk about noise and hearing loss tend not to get a lot of attention.

120
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,300
They sort of get ignored for other perhaps sexier environmental health issues, which is unfortunate.

121
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:39,380
And we also have to recognize and I'll I'll talk about this later, too, that the way we regulate and in fact.

122
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:48,460
The levels that we require employers to protect their workers from are totally out of sync with the rest of the world.

123
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:58,440
So we'll go into some detail, I think, in the next lecture or the one after that about how we actually regulate and what the specific levels are.

124
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:07,450
But I'll I'll highlight just to start here in the United States, depending on the industry that you work in, you may or may not be covered by OSHA.

125
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,209
So that's not to say you might not be doing a very noisy job, but in two different industries,

126
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,760
if you have the same noise level, one of those industries, OSHA, might regulate you.

127
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,110
And the other they might say, sorry, we're we don't have jurisdiction here,

128
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,030
which means we've got kind of this patchwork coverage and we've got workers who can fall through the cracks again,

129
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,240
which is not a good thing from an occupational health perspective.

130
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,190
The other thing is, although noise is one of the exposures we've studied the most of any of the environmental health hazards we face,

131
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:43,900
we still don't necessarily have a full understanding of the dose response relationship between noise and various health outcomes.

132
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:53,950
We also don't necessarily have a good handle on how variability in exposure may increase or maybe decrease your health risk.

133
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,950
So we know a lot about noise, but we certainly don't know everything.

134
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,409
Now, just to get you all talking here at the start of the session, let's do this.

135
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,120
I want you to break up into groups of two or three and let's have maybe the front half of the room here, let's say the first two rows.

136
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,150
I want you folks to think about five noisy work activities or jobs or tools that might come to mind as well.

137
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,940
Those are really, really noisy.

138
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:28,120
And then rank them in your your peers about how risky you think they might be to people's hearing from obviously top to bottom.

139
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,629
And then for the last couple of rows, I want you to think about the same thing, but for leisure time activities.

140
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:40,330
So what kind of noisy activities might people do for fun or recreation and again, rank those in terms of how bad you think they might be?

141
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,430
So again, front to Rose Workplace, back to Rose Leisure and the third row back there.

142
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,049
I'll let your group decide which way you want to go. So let's take a couple of minutes to talk among yourselves,

143
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,488
and then we'll come back together in here, which came up with some questions about the first thing.

144
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:08,573
All right, folks, let's go ahead and come back together. I hear some good conversation going on out there and I want to hear the details.

145
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:15,203
So maybe we'll go in reverse order here. Let's start in the back of the bedroom and maybe the middle row, depending on what we talked about.

146
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:21,084
So all kinds of noisy and immediate time or recreational activities came to mind.

147
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:23,474
Motorcycle, motorcycle. Okay.

148
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:30,473
Certainly those can be very high level and people may ride them for a brief period of time or they may raise them for for an extended period.

149
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:34,284
And great example. What else about concerts?

150
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:39,683
Sure. Going to concerts. And so concerts in general can be risky.

151
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:42,894
But of course, you have to think about, well, how is the music being presented?

152
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:49,254
Is an acoustic conference with or a conference is it an acoustic performance, you know,

153
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:54,834
maybe in a small room without any people, or is it a giant mega arena with, you know, massive amplified music?

154
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:59,454
So that's both of those can be an issue. But the second, of course, has more potential.

155
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:06,773
What have you guys come up with? Is that like iPhones and very sure, headphones.

156
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:13,224
So headphones have been a big mystery actually since they really started getting popularized back in the early 1980s,

157
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:21,053
particularly for personal music players. And so it's relatively easy to figure out how long people wear headphones.

158
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:26,543
You could just ask them. But in terms of figuring out, well, how much sound is actually getting delivered to the person's ear,

159
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:31,794
that's been a very challenging technical problem. We'll talk about that, how we're sort of overcoming that in a couple of lectures,

160
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:37,734
but that that can definitely present a huge exposure and one that we've really struggled to kind of get our arms around.

161
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,224
Any other leisure examples that you folks came up with?

162
00:15:46,024 --> 00:15:55,384
Lawn mowing. Sure. So, you know, lots of work around the house if you're a woodworker by hobby or of course, occupation and,

163
00:15:55,594 --> 00:16:00,874
you know, vacuuming, there's all sorts of things we do on a daily basis or maybe a weekly basis for lawn mowing.

164
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:08,884
That might be relatively short, but it could be pretty loud or they might be relatively quiet, but maybe we do that for quite a bit of time.

165
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,804
So both of those things are are factors we have to consider. Great.

166
00:16:12,814 --> 00:16:17,043
Now, moving to the front of the class, what about workplaces or jobs or tools?

167
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,144
What kind of things came to mind for you all?

168
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:28,954
Yeah, we set up construction sites for the construction workers, but also the people that have to like live and work near a construction site.

169
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:34,773
So yeah, absolutely. Construction is a great example of both occupational exposure,

170
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:40,603
but it's also one of the types of noise that always comes up in surveys of communities about the noise.

171
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:45,634
And so living next to a construction sweet site is undeniably annoying and disrupting.

172
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:51,574
And then of course, the workers themselves who are creating that annoyance are also getting exposed from their own work.

173
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:54,933
Great example. What other occupations?

174
00:16:54,934 --> 00:17:01,294
Yeah. Is it Kristen at certain laboratory instruments like outside indicator or interesting.

175
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:07,953
Yeah. So we often think of sort of heavy labor or manual labor jobs like construction as being really noisy.

176
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:15,244
But certainly people can work with instruments and equipment that's more scientific in nature that might either

177
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:20,863
be relatively loud or it might put out frequencies that are sort of outside of what we typically focus on.

178
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:24,784
And so anything that's working with ultrasound, for instance, can still be harmful to us,

179
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:29,734
but we might not perceive it to be as loud as we do a lawnmower or a construction tool.

180
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:33,334
Great example. Others that you folks came up with.

181
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:36,483
Yeah, I know we didn't do that,

182
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:52,574
but I know that the mining industry is one of the worst places where there is a lot of I mean the most and low noise suburb of.

183
00:17:53,594 --> 00:18:03,284
Lost hearing is in my new because I think that is one in five or something like that that they.

184
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:10,933
Really goes to a hearing. Yeah. Mining classically has been an industry that is incredibly noisy.

185
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:16,423
It's also incredibly dangerous. So I can't remember if I mentioned this already and apologies if I did.

186
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:24,434
But we have OSHA that oversees general industry and mining again historically has been so dangerous that they have their own regulatory agency,

187
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:29,074
the Mine Safety and Health Administration, just to focus specifically on that industry.

188
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:35,263
So you're absolutely right. I mean, there are things that happen in mining that would be considered unacceptable in other industries,

189
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:40,304
like blasting when you're blowing apart a part of a mountainside or a slope to to get into or underneath.

190
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:45,524
And the machinery that's used is also incredibly loud and large.

191
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:52,774
So that's another great example. Don't any more workplaces or we said like engineering or manufacturing.

192
00:18:52,804 --> 00:19:03,044
You're sure manufacturing is one of the industries we have the most information on because while it's not perhaps so common in this country right now,

193
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:07,244
you know, for many decades we were an enormous manufacturing powerhouse.

194
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:14,263
And so we would go out to sample and realize that manufacturing workers have, you know, at least historically,

195
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:18,284
some of the highest exposures and some of the highest rates of hearing loss of any industry.

196
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:25,574
So those are great. You know, even without taking this class, obviously, you all have a good sense of some of the potential industries out there.

197
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:35,504
What I'm going to show you here is our our best estimate on a national scale of how many workers are exposed above 85 decibels.

198
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:39,613
And you might say, my God, what a crusty graphic. And you're absolutely right.

199
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:45,523
Look at the data on this. So this dates back to 1981 when probably most of you were not born.

200
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:49,344
And it just occurred to me and it's also shocking to me, I must say.

201
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:59,894
But so, you know, the fact that kind of our our most recent national estimates are now pushing 40 plus years old is pretty concerning.

202
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:06,814
And you'll also notice for, gosh, who is responsible for regulating occupational noise in the US,

203
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,364
OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

204
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:13,724
These numbers come from the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency.

205
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:18,164
So we've got numbers that are badly out of date and don't come from the agency we might expect.

206
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:25,304
And this is just classic or sort of prototypical for how we deal with noise in the United States, very patchwork, very disorganized.

207
00:20:25,964 --> 00:20:33,374
And so the last truly national survey that we had back in the early 1980s estimated that,

208
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:39,523
you know, by industry there were varying percentages of people who might be overexposed.

209
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:43,214
And so manufacturing and utilities, as was mentioned, is right on here.

210
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:49,273
Mining is on here, as well as as Velma mentioned, construction is hardly mentioned.

211
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:52,034
Also on here, nobody mentioned transportation.

212
00:20:52,304 --> 00:21:01,844
But if you imagine people who know pilot ships or pilot planes or drive locomotives, lots of potential noise exposure there.

213
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:07,904
Agriculture is another one. It's not necessarily as large an industry, but it can be quite loud.

214
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:14,713
And then you'll notice the military is on here too. So the military is not considered a sort of conventional employer.

215
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:17,654
They have their own classification system.

216
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:23,863
But as you might imagine, being in the military can be incredibly loud training exercises and things like that.

217
00:21:23,864 --> 00:21:26,294
And then when you go into combat, it's sort of all bets are off.

218
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:37,064
So back in 1981, the EPA estimated that there were a little over 9 million workers exposed potentially to harmful levels of noise.

219
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:42,164
Now, that number, we don't have an equivalent national survey that's been done since then.

220
00:21:42,164 --> 00:21:48,614
So we have estimates that are more recent. But this is the last again, truly national survey, which is kind of an embarrassment.

221
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:56,984
So in my lab, we've been trying to kind of tackle this issue and figure out, well, what might more current statistics look like.

222
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:02,383
And so we've assembled something called the occupational noise job exposure matrix,

223
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:08,234
and we did this by putting in Freedom of Information Act request to OSHA and MSHA and

224
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:14,084
all the various state OSHA plans by contacting industries and asking for their data,

225
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:20,413
by going to labor unions, asking for their data, and also by kind of passing through the literature and figuring out what's been published

226
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:25,664
here and doing all that so we can get a sense of what our noise levels in the country now,

227
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:30,644
but also maybe creating a longitudinal look at how they've been changing over time.

228
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:35,353
Now, what we're looking at here is just from the data that we got from OSHA,

229
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:42,614
which is about 750,000 measurements of their actual noise limit called the permissible exposure limit for the PDL.

230
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:47,173
And then we have about half as many measurements made according to the action level.

231
00:22:47,174 --> 00:22:52,724
And so that's a more kind of a trigger level that requires employers to take some action.

232
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,064
And the noise is measured slightly differently.

233
00:22:55,814 --> 00:23:03,134
And so what you'll see here is the data that we have go all the way back to 1979, and in this case, they go forward to 2014.

234
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:09,694
And we're looking at two different things. So with noise we can think about, well, what is the average exposure that people have?

235
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:16,444
But we can also think about what is the fraction of workers or the fraction of measurements that's over what's allowable.

236
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:20,194
So they're just kind of two different aspects of the different exposures.

237
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:28,203
And so the black solid line here is the mean level for those action level measurements that

238
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:35,074
I said and the solid line that the open circles here is the permissible exposure limit.

239
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:39,514
And then the other two lines here are the exceedance percentages.

240
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:44,283
And so what we can see here, I'm just going to focus on this, this bottom line here primarily.

241
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:48,544
So these permissible exposure limit measurements of which there are about three quarters of a million

242
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:56,434
in our data set were highest back in 1979 and then started to taper down to say the early 1990s.

243
00:23:56,824 --> 00:24:04,384
So that's good. That indicates that noise levels in American industry dropped over that, say, 11 or 12 year period.

244
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:10,354
But then they basically have bottomed out and not really gotten much quieter since then.

245
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:15,964
So does anybody know when OSHA came into being as an agency?

246
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:20,184
And if you don't, that's fine. No reason for you to do so. Yeah.

247
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:25,713
1970 was the passage of the ACT and OSHA actually became an entity in 1971.

248
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:29,284
So, you know, that's years before the data start here.

249
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:35,943
So previously there hadn't really been a regulation. And you might imagine as OSHA comes into effect and they start passing regulations,

250
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:40,114
it takes industry a little while to catch up, but industry starts to change things.

251
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:46,714
And so we see this decline. But again, after, say, ten or 15 years, the decline stops.

252
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:55,024
And so this is kind of unfortunate because it suggests that when OSHA was new and kind of people were focused on it, noise levels went down.

253
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:58,474
And more recently, noise levels have kind of bottomed out.

254
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:03,093
And workers continue to be overexposed at a pretty high level here.

255
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:07,234
So we're still looking at a exceedance of, say, 40%.

256
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:12,654
So four out of every ten measurements that OSHA goes out and does in a workplace are overexposure.

257
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:18,214
You know, ideally we would see that number at zero. So again, there's not a lot of data out there.

258
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:22,504
Ours is one of the few sort of estimates that have looked at trends over time,

259
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:30,004
and they have been generally downward, but sort of disappointingly downward over the past 30 years or so.

260
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:36,574
So lots of room for improvement, I guess is one way to put that. That was workplace noise that we were looking at.

261
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:43,734
This is community noise. So noise mapping has been a requirement for the countries in the European Union.

262
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:53,494
Going all the way back to 2013 really has not been broadly employed in the United States until about 2016,

263
00:25:54,484 --> 00:26:00,574
when the Department of Transportation developed this national transportation noise map.

264
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:06,033
And so what you're looking at here, all these funny little yellow lines are roadways in the United States.

265
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:09,093
And you can see there's kind of blotches of red here.

266
00:26:09,094 --> 00:26:17,194
Those are major airports. So this is kind of the Dottie's best guess at where noise exposure is occurring in the United States.

267
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:24,004
And again, we know airports, I think you probably know this intuitively, are one of the louder noise sources in the community.

268
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:31,594
But certainly roadways can be quite loud as well. So this is a like quantum advance over what we had before, which was nothing.

269
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:35,074
So this noise mapping effort is useful.

270
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:42,634
But I will tell you the thing that a noise map like this can't convey is what's happening in an individual level.

271
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:48,904
So this might say, gosh, if you live around Chicago, especially near Midway or O'Hare airports, it's probably pretty loud.

272
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:53,284
But that doesn't account for the fact that, gosh, you might also have a noisy job.

273
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:56,974
So this is part of the picture, but not all the picture at the same.

274
00:26:57,424 --> 00:27:01,954
If we consider occupational noise workplace as part of your exposure, but it's not all.

275
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:09,874
So what we've really been lacking historically our data on your cumulative exposure across the workplace and in the community,

276
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:19,714
and we'll talk about that more as we go through the class, too. And so just kind of building on this community exposure issue,

277
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:32,704
so these again are quite dated information from EPA in 1981 that my lab actually updated in 2013 to reflect kind of current populations.

278
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:36,964
But it sort of bears out a story that I think probably makes sense intuitively to you,

279
00:27:36,994 --> 00:27:42,543
where we think about, well, what's noisy in my community, it's things like industry living near a factory.

280
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:49,863
It's things like a construction site being near a railroad or urban sort of subways being there,

281
00:27:49,864 --> 00:27:53,194
airports being near roads and that all of those things put together.

282
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:58,954
So for each of these categories in blue, we're looking at the 1981 EPA estimates.

283
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:03,694
And in red, we just took basically the 1981 estimates and applied that.

284
00:28:03,744 --> 00:28:07,284
Into the current population is to figure out how might the numbers have gone up.

285
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:11,234
Assuming the noise hasn't changed at all in all cases but one.

286
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:13,484
So you'll see industry, construction, railroad,

287
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:22,604
etc. The red bar is bigger than the blue bar because we have many more people living in this country in 2013 and again in 1981.

288
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:27,764
The one sort of glaring exception to this rule is air transport,

289
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:37,154
and it turns out most of these other sources of noise have not been especially highly regulated since, say, 1980 or so.

290
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:43,454
But the Department of Transportation made specific requirements on the air transport industry,

291
00:28:44,444 --> 00:28:51,254
basically in recognition of the fact that as jet airplanes started to become more and more common in the 1960s and seventies,

292
00:28:51,644 --> 00:28:59,533
people in communities started to get more and more annoyed. Now you've got this really loud noise source flying over your house and so annoyed people

293
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:03,673
tend to complain to their politicians and the politicians turn to the dot and said,

294
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:07,184
Fix this air transportation issue and the dot.

295
00:29:07,184 --> 00:29:15,794
He turned around and to airliners and airplane manufacturers, I should say, airline companies and airplane manufacturers said,

296
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:19,724
you're going to make your operation quieter and we don't care how you do it,

297
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:23,414
but if you don't do it, you won't be able to fly these planes within the United States.

298
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:27,254
And the airlines said, oh, my God, you're going to put us out of business. And then they fixed the problem.

299
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:34,063
So they designed new engines. They did a lot of things that drastically reduced the amount of airplane noise.

300
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:42,074
And because of this government action, we now have just a tiny fraction of people exposed to high levels of airplane noise compared to back in 1981.

301
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:49,184
So I throw this out right now because I recognize probably as you do, environmental health can be a little bit depressing from time to time.

302
00:29:49,784 --> 00:29:54,914
But it's like, here's a case where the government did something and it made a huge improvement for public health.

303
00:29:55,124 --> 00:30:00,584
So we always have to keep in mind this is this is doable, even if it can seem a little bit challenging.

304
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:07,564
Any questions so far? All right.

305
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:12,914
So we're going to spend the next bit of time here talking a little bit about the physics of sound.

306
00:30:12,914 --> 00:30:17,953
And I I'm going to tread lightly over things that I don't think you absolutely have to know.

307
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:23,534
And it may feel a little bit like this where there's kind of a black box, but hopefully it will all make sense to you by the end.

308
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:30,104
So we're just starting out with kind of some very basic physics here when I am talking about sound.

309
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:39,224
Sound is just vibration in any medium. It could be the air around us, it could be water, it could be a physical object that's vibrating.

310
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:47,954
And essentially what we're thinking about here kind of conceptually, is the air is composed of lots of different molecules and atoms of this and that.

311
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:53,624
And as sound energy is imposed onto those molecules are atoms,

312
00:30:54,104 --> 00:31:00,104
they essentially pop out of place briefly and then they sort of overcorrect back the other direction,

313
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:03,104
and then they will end up back in their original spot.

314
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:10,244
And so we can start to think about things like, well, gosh, how far did a particular atom or molecule in the air move?

315
00:31:10,574 --> 00:31:13,844
That's kind of a measure of how much energy was imparted onto it.

316
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:22,904
And that amplitude can then be a measure of sort of how much energy or how much intensity of the sound is in the environment around us.

317
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:30,673
So as I've already said, kind of the three big things we're going to talk about today are propagation, frequency and magnitude.

318
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:34,484
Propagation, again, is just how sound moves through the environment.

319
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:42,104
Frequency is what we perceive as pitch so base or mid or treble in magnitude,

320
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:50,294
unlike most other environmental health hazards is something that we quantify in three different ways for noise.

321
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:56,084
And I will talk to you about why we do that and sort of which one of those is the one we tend to use most.

322
00:31:58,054 --> 00:32:03,484
So as I've said, you know, when when some sound energy hits a particle in the air around us,

323
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:08,793
that particle is going to vibrate and it's going to bump into the the molecule or particle next to it.

324
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:12,394
And that wave will then get propagated through all those contacts.

325
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:20,584
And so basically, if we imagine a noise source here that we're looking down from on above, that noise source is sending out energy.

326
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,923
And as energy hits an individual particle,

327
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:27,874
it's going to move that particle a little bit and then the particle is going to swing back to its original position.

328
00:32:27,874 --> 00:32:35,164
Now, if that didn't happen, so if the particles actually moved over time than me up here at the front of the room over

329
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:39,134
the course of our class would be pushing all the molecules in the room back towards the back.

330
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:42,873
That doesn't happen. Otherwise I'd be up here asphyxiating. So.

331
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:45,934
So those particles do return to their their origin.

332
00:32:46,504 --> 00:32:53,394
And what you can see here is every time there's sort of a burst of energy released from the source, we have this radiating wave that's traveling out.

333
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:57,184
So we have kind of a high pressure zone. That's the dark circles here.

334
00:32:57,514 --> 00:33:03,634
And then the spaces between the circles are rear faction zones, and there's zones of slightly lower pressure.

335
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:11,134
And so, you know, it's one thing to look maybe at a gif image here, but you can actually see this in nature, which I think is really cool.

336
00:33:12,004 --> 00:33:17,704
So if we watch this flow, you know, you can see the sound waves traveling out through the water.

337
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:22,694
The fog is taking its course. So I think that's pretty cool.

338
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:32,214
But I'm a I'm a dork. So maybe you don't find it so interesting because I know it can get tiresome to listen to me for an extended period.

339
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:36,564
I'll play this crusty old video for you just to mix things up a little bit.

340
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:42,594
How do you guys hear that in the back?

341
00:33:43,384 --> 00:33:53,154
To be able to answer this question, it's very mysterious, enjoying more and more perspective.

342
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:01,674
These vibrations, invisible waves in the surrounding area.

343
00:34:03,864 --> 00:34:15,224
We can picture these these as enemies trying to fight back against these battles, with this distortion they bring back.

344
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:30,953
And that's producing new distortions. It's migration that you just for these things that you have that in the past has been about these events,

345
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:36,174
about the media state that all of these names are being transmitted,

346
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:45,854
that air molecules every time that that is moving forward and push against the agenda and turn this movement back to the air the whole.

347
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:54,174
It's always makes me think you imagine animating that by hand. It was terrible.

348
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:59,104
Nobody talks about these matters to them.

349
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:04,584
Each time the Palm Springs inward compassion factor forms a nervous energy.

350
00:35:05,484 --> 00:35:14,063
Every molecule there about it will give you the fact that these things are going to happen, that there are almost no compensation.

351
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:20,454
And in the end, the number of times can be back and forth in 1/2,

352
00:35:21,014 --> 00:35:28,644
the frequency of the way you want to feel vibrations in the air here about the broken down cable, the distance.

353
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:32,693
That's what wavelength of any sound we've included.

354
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:42,474
Wavelength and. So again, just giving you a little bit more visualization of what I was describing verbally there.

355
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:48,624
If you imagine those molecules that you were just looking at in the short film from above,

356
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:53,004
again, we can look at we can see a rare fraction zone here and a compression zone here.

357
00:35:53,784 --> 00:36:00,564
And what's typically done in acoustics is we start to visualize this as a sine wave here, as you can see,

358
00:36:00,564 --> 00:36:08,694
where we can indicate the high pressure zones as the peak of the wave here and the rear faction's a sort of a trough.

359
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:15,204
And so essentially what we're looking at is we've got atmospheric pressure a little bit higher than atmospheric pressure.

360
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:21,174
A little bit lower. And essentially, the sound wave is always fluctuating around atmospheric pressure.

361
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:26,634
And so we can start to define various parameters about this wave, like, well, what is the wavelength?

362
00:36:26,664 --> 00:36:33,113
As they just said in the video, the wavelength is the distance between two successive peaks or two successive valleys.

363
00:36:33,114 --> 00:36:36,264
And so that's going to be some actual physical distance.

364
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:42,414
We can also talk about the time period or capital T and so essentially that's how

365
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:48,263
long does it take for one wavelength of sound to pass a fixed point in space.

366
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:53,244
So just some again descriptors that we can start to apply to sound waves.

367
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,354
Now, the wavelength, as I said, is something we measure as a distance.

368
00:36:58,164 --> 00:37:00,143
We can work in feet or meters here,

369
00:37:00,144 --> 00:37:07,884
although we will have one specific equation later in the class that the equation is slightly different depending on whether we're using filter meters.

370
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:09,594
We'll talk about that when we get to it.

371
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:17,184
One comment I'll make here, though, is that the lower the frequency of a soundwave, the the longer the wavelength.

372
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:24,294
So if we look at a frequency of, say, 110 hertz down here,

373
00:37:25,014 --> 00:37:31,314
we're looking at a wavelength that might be 100 feet long versus if we go up to 10,000 hertz.

374
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:34,284
So this would be a very low frequency sound, in fact,

375
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:42,804
a little bit below what human years can normally detect compared to something that's really a very high frequency for human ear hearing.

376
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:46,794
Then the the wavelength is only about a 10th of a fourth.

377
00:37:47,844 --> 00:37:53,994
And so this is going to be something that comes into play when we start to talk about noise controls later in the class.

378
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:59,304
We can actually take advantage of the wavelength of these sounds to some degree to try to reduce that.

379
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:07,223
Now, in terms of propagation, as you heard the narrator say in the film, there is a speed of sound,

380
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:10,734
and that speed is going to vary depending on what medium you're working in.

381
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:17,874
If we're talking about just regular air at maybe 20 degrees Celsius or so, something relatively comfortable to the human body,

382
00:38:18,414 --> 00:38:25,014
the speed of sound turns out to be 344 meters per second, or about 770 miles per hour.

383
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:29,183
And if you ever need like a fun facts to be an icebreaker at a party,

384
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:32,814
you can throw out that the speed of sound is about one millionth of the speed of light.

385
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:34,314
You can see what kind of parties I go to.

386
00:38:35,874 --> 00:38:45,023
So it turns out we can operationalize this equation and we have so you see a bolt of lightning and then you hear thunder 5 seconds later.

387
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:53,214
What does that tell you about how far away the lightning was? One mile one way.

388
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:59,364
Exactly right. So that turns out to be a really good approximation of the actual physics here.

389
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:07,254
So if I know I had a 5/2 delay between the lightning bolt and the thunder and I knew of the speed of sound,

390
00:39:07,254 --> 00:39:15,804
I can just rearrange and do my math and figure out that that lightning bolt must have been about 1700 meters away or roughly one mile.

391
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:20,333
So that's a useful rule of thumb, again, to figure out, gosh, how close is that lightning storm?

392
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:26,303
Do I need to be worried yet? Let's talk about sound in other media.

393
00:39:26,304 --> 00:39:30,623
So again, we can have vibrations in in all different kinds of media.

394
00:39:30,624 --> 00:39:35,004
So we can talk about here, we can talk about wood, we could talk about water.

395
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,894
You'll see for all of these different kinds of materials here, the sound blasting is quite different.

396
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:44,514
So in the air we're talking about 1100 feet per second or so.

397
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:54,474
On the other hand, if we're looking at steel, it's more like 16,000 feet per second or glass 18,500 feet per second.

398
00:39:54,474 --> 00:40:03,054
So the idea here is if you think about these different kinds of materials, air is relatively not dense compared to some of these other materials.

399
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:11,364
And the denser and the more closely packed the particles are in a particular material, the faster sound is going to be transmitted to that material.

400
00:40:11,934 --> 00:40:15,264
So again, that's why cities are so loud.

401
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:24,684
So that way cities are so loud. So here we're talking mostly about transmission through through different materials.

402
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:28,883
Cities tend to be louder than other surrounding environments because we've

403
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:33,444
got a lot of sources compressed into a relatively small geographic footprint.

404
00:40:33,594 --> 00:40:35,844
So it's more in the acoustics rather than the materials.

405
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:43,794
I'd say it's more the amount of energy or sound producing sources that we've got kind of combined into a relatively small area.

406
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:48,454
It partly explains why cities are so much louder than elsewhere. Does that kind of answer your question?

407
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:57,894
Yeah, or is like the way the sound like reverberation off of an object prior to that for this plane in that city example.

408
00:40:57,894 --> 00:41:03,113
Yeah, exactly. So the the amount of reflective surfaces you have around you and we'll talk about this in our

409
00:41:03,114 --> 00:41:07,584
room acoustics lecture are also very much going to dictate how loud your environment is.

410
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:14,184
So if we're in an environment like an anechoic chamber, this is a chamber that's designed not to have any echoes.

411
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:19,974
The walls are incredibly absorptive, and so any sound you make in there is just going to fall dead immediately.

412
00:41:20,304 --> 00:41:23,633
That's a much different environment than if you're in a reverberant chamber,

413
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:27,264
which is completely reflective and the sounds are going to be bouncing all over the place.

414
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:30,864
Yeah. Great points. Yeah, sorry.

415
00:41:31,974 --> 00:41:37,404
And what about with. The density of the air.

416
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:44,574
A low level is one. The density level of hyperactive kids is less right.

417
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:55,184
The sound is going to be slower because essentially the energy is having to travel farther between particles because the particles are more far apart,

418
00:41:55,194 --> 00:42:00,354
if that makes sense, in less dense air, which is what you find it out to predict.

419
00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:09,504
So that makes sense. Yeah. You know that popular image of, like, a woman who's singing and then she breaks the glass?

420
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:13,283
Oh, yes. I'm thinking in this example, is it is the glass breaking?

421
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:20,494
I just thought the glass is fragile. So great. Yeah. Because the sound is going at a faster speed in the glass.

422
00:42:20,994 --> 00:42:26,723
So it's a great question. So in the case of breaking glass, we'll talk about this in our human vibration section.

423
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:30,293
But every material, every structure on earth has a resonant frequency.

424
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:36,354
That's a frequency that if you activate it, the molecules are like, Oh, this is super exciting, and you'll actually get some feedback.

425
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:43,944
And so what you can do if you have the proper voice to do it, is if you present a certain pitch to the glass,

426
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:48,024
you can essentially activate its resonant frequency and it'll essentially vibrate itself apart.

427
00:42:48,444 --> 00:42:53,904
So it's more the pitch. It's also somewhat the intensity, less about the density of the material that makes sense.

428
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:59,874
Yeah, great. Great questions. So I show this actually, because it's very interesting.

429
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:06,534
You can use information like, well, gosh, what is the average water temperature across an entire ocean?

430
00:43:07,194 --> 00:43:13,013
And you can actually emit sound waves and start to map out and figure out temperature variations and all sorts of things.

431
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:21,173
And so by doing this, we actually have made maps of entire oceans in a much more detailed fashion than we have for maps of the United States,

432
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:25,014
for instance, for those of us living on land and exposed to sound.

433
00:43:25,014 --> 00:43:29,274
So we use sound for all sorts of, I think, pretty cool things.

434
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:33,684
Again, I've got a pretty low bar because this is what I study, but again, pretty useful.

435
00:43:35,184 --> 00:43:40,584
So that's kind of a bit on propagation. Let's switch a little bit and talk about frequency here.

436
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,584
And so frequency, as I said, is what we perceive as pitch.

437
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:50,394
So we can talk about very low frequencies, we can talk about kind of middle frequencies or high or treble frequencies.

438
00:43:51,114 --> 00:43:58,464
Now, you'll notice here on this graph we're looking at a whole range of frequencies all the way down to one hertz or one wave per second,

439
00:43:58,464 --> 00:44:02,244
up to 100,000 hertz or 100,000 waves per second.

440
00:44:03,024 --> 00:44:06,654
So you'll notice here there's kind of a crosshatch theory in the middle that we call audible.

441
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:15,383
So it turns out that a normal hearing, young human, can hear between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz.

442
00:44:15,384 --> 00:44:19,824
That's essentially the range that we perceive sound. So we call that the audible sound range.

443
00:44:20,634 --> 00:44:26,424
Now, of course, there are sounds that happen below that. So anything 20 hertz or below we call infrasound,

444
00:44:27,024 --> 00:44:35,214
meaning this is sort of sound that's in a region that's too low for the human ear to perceive, but it's not without use in nature.

445
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:42,114
So these are the frequencies that whales and elephants use to communicate over very long spaces or distances.

446
00:44:42,624 --> 00:44:46,853
And then once we get above 20,000 hertz, we're in the ultrasound range.

447
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:55,194
Again, this is too high for the human here to hear. But we use ultrasound, for instance, for dental cleaning appliances and things along those lines.

448
00:44:56,154 --> 00:45:01,164
For the purposes of this class, it's this 20 to 20000 hertz range that we're primarily interested in.

449
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:05,574
That's where we perceive sound and that's where our hearing tends to be impacted.

450
00:45:06,024 --> 00:45:12,764
And unfortunately, there are lots of sources and activities out there that produce sounds in these frequency range.

451
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:20,154
You guys already identified a bunch of them earlier, but, you know, machines that are cutting materials, vehicle engines,

452
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:29,244
the blowing or sucking of air in a workplace, things like blast furnaces, trucks and other types of transportation equipment, musical instruments.

453
00:45:29,244 --> 00:45:36,953
All of those tend to be right in this audible sound range. So that's kind of the range, again, that we're going to focus on.

454
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:40,854
And it's it's what we're primarily interested in for the purposes of this course.

455
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:45,773
What I'm going to play you now is a frequency sweep that's going to start at 20,000,

456
00:45:45,774 --> 00:45:50,034
at 20 hertz, and go all the way up across the range of frequencies and come back down.

457
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:24,184
Yeah. And so you may have noticed there was a bit of a lag after I pressed the button that was down at 20 hertz.

458
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,494
Very close to the human range of hearing.

459
00:46:26,494 --> 00:46:33,224
So at this particular level, probably most of us couldn't perceive that at the high end, there was also a bit of a gap.

460
00:46:33,244 --> 00:46:38,523
So that again, is getting into the range where if I cranked this up, we'd be able to hear it at a relatively low level.

461
00:46:38,524 --> 00:46:43,534
It's pretty imperceptible. I'll also say, as someone who is older than the vast majority of you,

462
00:46:43,954 --> 00:46:49,564
I probably lost the ability to hear those sounds a little bit before you did when we got into the high frequencies,

463
00:46:51,004 --> 00:46:57,274
because age is one of the but not the only aspect that can influence how well we hear across different frequencies.

464
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:03,214
Again, just to provide a few examples here. We'll take a break in about 5 minutes.

465
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,794
Here's a 300 hertz tone. So, again, pretty low frequency.

466
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:13,554
And as a result, we've got a pretty long wavelength here, a wavelength.

467
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:18,604
It's got a fairly good distance to it. 3000 hertz, very piercing.

468
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:26,464
Turns out our hearing is exceptionally exquisite at this or sensitive at this frequency, as we'll talk about in the next lecture.

469
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:36,124
And in 10,000 hertz, again, that's still a full 10,000 hertz below the limit of human hearing for a normal person, but still pretty darn high.

470
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:41,044
And listen to them all at once. And I cannot figure out how to get that to stop.

471
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:47,043
So we've talked about propagation previously. Now we're talking about frequency.

472
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:54,183
We can actually relate these two things. So the frequency RF here is the inverse of the time period.

473
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:58,564
So, so the frequency is going to be something we express in Hertz.

474
00:47:58,564 --> 00:48:04,144
And again, the time period is how long does it take for a single wave to pass a fixed point in space?

475
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:10,234
And so, again, we can start to think about, well, how do I quantify the sound waves in the environment?

476
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:14,673
I can talk about the wavelength, the distance between successive peaks,

477
00:48:14,674 --> 00:48:19,264
I can talk about the amplitude and sort of how high are the peaks or how low in the valleys.

478
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:23,044
That's a measure of how much energy is contained in here.

479
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:29,494
All of these lines are always going to be centered on the atmospheric pressure because no matter how energetic the sound is,

480
00:48:29,494 --> 00:48:33,094
when we turn it off, the pressure is going to return to ambient.

481
00:48:33,454 --> 00:48:37,294
If that was not the case, as I talked to you over the course of 2 hours,

482
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:42,424
the room would start getting louder and louder because the sound energy is accumulating, which obviously it doesn't do.

483
00:48:43,384 --> 00:48:50,644
And again, I can talk about the time period as sort of how long does it take for one sound we to go past the fixed point in space.

484
00:48:52,594 --> 00:49:00,874
So again, for for human health purposes, this 20 to 20000 hertz range of sound is what we're primarily interested in,

485
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:04,023
but we're not always interested in that entire range.

486
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:09,754
Sometimes I might want to look at just a smaller or a smaller or a narrower range of frequencies,

487
00:49:10,204 --> 00:49:13,864
and so we can do that by applying what are called band pass filters.

488
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:23,104
So if we imagine some kind of sound source with that intensity and frequency here, I can employ something called a low pass filter,

489
00:49:23,104 --> 00:49:28,444
meaning that all of the low frequency sound comes in, but then the higher frequency stuff gets cut out.

490
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:38,584
Or I can have a high pass filter where I'm sort of measuring the higher frequencies, but I'm eliminating the lower frequencies or a band pass filter,

491
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:46,174
which we use quite, quite commonly, which is basically I'm going to measure something between some upper frequency and a lower frequency.

492
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:55,294
So there's kind of a band that I'm interested in and band stop is something we typically don't do or use at all in environmental health.

493
00:49:57,034 --> 00:50:03,904
So when I'm looking at specific bands and my band might be 20 to 20000 hertz, kind of the entire range of human hearing.

494
00:50:04,444 --> 00:50:12,034
But for instance, if I'm designing a car and there's a rattle in the car or some kind of ringing in the car,

495
00:50:12,034 --> 00:50:17,044
and I want to figure out what is that frequency and where is it coming from? I'm not interested in all the frequencies out there.

496
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:21,183
I want to look at a pretty narrow range to figure out where is this problem coming

497
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:26,013
from so I can identify these bands here and I can use them to make measurements.

498
00:50:26,014 --> 00:50:30,334
Any time we're talking about a band, there's a couple of different parameters we can talk about.

499
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:35,914
One is the center frequency. So what's the sort of smack dab in the center frequency of this band?

500
00:50:36,454 --> 00:50:43,204
And I can also talk about F one, which is the lower frequency band and F two, which is the upper frequency band.

501
00:50:43,804 --> 00:50:49,324
And we've got a pretty simple equation for sort of understanding the relationship between these.

502
00:50:49,324 --> 00:50:54,633
So the center frequency is equal to the square root of the lower frequency band.

503
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:57,934
F one times the upper frequency band F two.

504
00:50:58,924 --> 00:51:05,704
Now, some of you may have heard or may be familiar with the concept of an active any of you who are musicians or play piano,

505
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:10,474
for instance, may know that's the distance between successive C notes on the piano.

506
00:51:11,674 --> 00:51:22,174
So an active band is something that's defined where the F to that upper frequency range is two times that of the lower frequency band range.

507
00:51:23,074 --> 00:51:29,314
And then one third octave bands which we'll talk about a little bit more, are not something that we use very commonly, but they are used,

508
00:51:29,764 --> 00:51:36,964
for instance, to try to develop controls or ways to reduce sounds, maybe by developing an enclosure or a wall or something.

509
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:43,444
And so in that case, the upper frequency band is equal to the cubic root of two times F one.

510
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:47,883
Now, lest you think I'm just making this stuff up,

511
00:51:47,884 --> 00:51:57,724
it turns out frequency bands have been standardized for like eight years now because for one very important reason if I make measurements.

512
00:51:57,804 --> 00:52:01,384
Of sound here in the United States and someone else is making them in Europe.

513
00:52:01,404 --> 00:52:06,384
I want to be measuring sound the same way, the same frequencies, the same definitions here.

514
00:52:06,984 --> 00:52:16,643
So these definitions go back again many decades. And what people have done and what's been sort of harmonized through standards by the

515
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:22,214
International Electrotechnical Commission is we identify sort of which bands are out there,

516
00:52:22,234 --> 00:52:26,994
what's the lower in the center and the upper bound of those bands?

517
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:30,794
Again, we can talk about octave bands which are relatively large,

518
00:52:30,804 --> 00:52:36,414
or we can break each of those octave bands up into three, and then we're looking at one third of the bands.

519
00:52:36,894 --> 00:52:41,453
So in this way, again, measurements I make here, I can talk about bands 21 and we can agree,

520
00:52:41,454 --> 00:52:45,444
okay, these are the ranges of frequencies for that particular band.

521
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:49,404
So this kind of standardization is critical throughout science,

522
00:52:49,404 --> 00:52:53,394
just to make sure that if I'm making measurements and someone else is using a different instrument,

523
00:52:53,844 --> 00:52:57,624
that instrument has been programed to make measurements in a comparable fashion.

524
00:52:59,964 --> 00:53:04,673
All right. I tell you what, let's go ahead and take 5 minutes right now at the top of the hour.

525
00:53:04,674 --> 00:53:10,134
So let me have you back at 105 and we'll shift gears and we'll start talking about the magnitude of the sound.

526
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:16,834
So please get up, Stretch, and I'll I'll see you in a couple of minutes. Even if you saw nothing.

527
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:33,148
So we talked about propagation. We've talked about frequency magnitude again and sort of how much sound is there in the environment,

528
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:37,208
as I said, kind of unique among hazards and environmental health.

529
00:53:37,988 --> 00:53:42,878
For this one, we measured in a couple of different ways sound our sound intensity and sound pressure.

530
00:53:42,878 --> 00:53:44,347
We'll start with sound power here.

531
00:53:44,348 --> 00:53:51,817
So some power, like any measure of power, is sort of the measure of the total flow of energy from some specific source.

532
00:53:51,818 --> 00:53:57,248
So if I had a speaker suspended in the middle of the room here that's generating sound,

533
00:53:57,548 --> 00:54:02,108
the sound power would be what is the total amount of acoustic energy coming out of that?

534
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:08,978
Speaker And I would typically take a measure of that at some distance, ah, from the source itself.

535
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:16,057
And so like all measures of power, we measure this in terms of what's just like we rate light bulb power for instance.

536
00:54:16,058 --> 00:54:21,248
And so that's a measure of joules sort of how much energy is passing through the surface per second.

537
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:27,518
So Sam Powers Nights, again, it's the total acoustic output of the source that's really useful,

538
00:54:27,518 --> 00:54:30,608
for example, if you're trying to compare apples to apples.

539
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:36,938
So if you're comparing different types of equipment and trying to figure out which one is noisier,

540
00:54:36,938 --> 00:54:45,188
sound power is really the number you want to get at. And in fact, if if all of us were sort of consumers in the European Union,

541
00:54:45,788 --> 00:54:52,658
the EU requires that many different types or sort of categories of equipment be labeled with sound power when they're sold.

542
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:57,518
So if you were in the market for a jackhammer, for instance, and you went to the store,

543
00:54:57,548 --> 00:55:02,258
there would be two different jackhammers maybe, and they would each have a sound power label on them.

544
00:55:02,738 --> 00:55:06,818
And if you wanted to, you could choose the jackhammer with the lower sound power,

545
00:55:07,058 --> 00:55:11,198
knowing that that's going to generate less energy and less sound energy on your job site.

546
00:55:11,198 --> 00:55:16,057
So again, a really useful number here and it does let you directly compare.

547
00:55:16,058 --> 00:55:21,368
So you could talk about what's the sound power of this jackhammer compared to the sound power of a bulldozer,

548
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:26,348
a much bigger piece of equipment, and you're working in the same unit. So it's a really handy number.

549
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:30,578
The problem is there is no way to measure sound power directly.

550
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:34,208
You don't actually have the sort of equipment available to us.

551
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:40,177
So this is something we have to estimate. What we can measure is sound intensity.

552
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:42,307
And so this is a similar concept here.

553
00:55:42,308 --> 00:55:47,858
So we're still looking at our source, maybe a speaker, and we're measuring sort of how much sound is being emitted.

554
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:52,058
But in this case, we're not trying to capture the whole sphere around the speaker.

555
00:55:52,508 --> 00:55:55,558
We're rather defining a little bit of an area here.

556
00:55:55,588 --> 00:55:59,438
We're measuring how much sound energy is moving through that particular area.

557
00:55:59,768 --> 00:56:03,428
And from that, then we could estimate what's the total sound power?

558
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:07,297
So now we're talking about sound intensity.

559
00:56:07,298 --> 00:56:14,558
So this is still joules per second, that's power. But now we're multiplying by a surface area accounting for this little bit that we're measuring.

560
00:56:14,558 --> 00:56:19,298
So the units here are no longer just what's now it's what's per square meter.

561
00:56:20,178 --> 00:56:24,908
The nice thing about sound intensity is it is something that can be measured, as I said.

562
00:56:24,918 --> 00:56:30,338
But I'll tell you, the measurement setup here is very complicated, very expensive.

563
00:56:30,338 --> 00:56:35,588
It's not anything I have the ability to do in my lab. So there are specialized labs that can measure this.

564
00:56:35,948 --> 00:56:39,607
And again, those are the labs where if I wanted to estimate a total sound power,

565
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:48,097
I'd send my equipment and have it measured there so we can start to relate sound power and sound intensity again.

566
00:56:48,098 --> 00:56:55,717
Sound power in what is the total energy being emitted in sound intensity and what's per meter squared is the

567
00:56:55,718 --> 00:57:03,547
energy passing through some particular surface area that we define so we can have some sound source of power.

568
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:07,538
W We can take a measurement at some distance or radius.

569
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:16,567
R from the source and we can figure out at that distance the sound intensity is going to be the sound power divided by four pi r squared.

570
00:57:16,568 --> 00:57:22,328
And so we're just sort of estimating from the power, what would the intensity be at some distance away?

571
00:57:23,948 --> 00:57:27,967
Now, as we talked about in radiation, we are ionizing radiation.

572
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:31,628
We have this same inverse square law concept here.

573
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:39,488
So when we have a point source or our source W here, let's say it's radiating sound out in all directions.

574
00:57:39,908 --> 00:57:49,448
And so as I said on the previous slide, if we take a measurement at the radius here, we can relate the sound power to the sound intensity.

575
00:57:50,138 --> 00:57:57,158
But then the critical thing to note here, again, just like ionizing radiation is, the further we get away from that source,

576
00:57:57,638 --> 00:58:03,818
the sound intensity is going to drop off and it's going to drop off with the square of distance.

577
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:11,078
So what that means at the end of the day is a little bit of change in distance from a source can actually rise.

578
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:16,578
In a tremendous drop in sound intensity. And so from an environmental health perspective,

579
00:58:16,698 --> 00:58:22,277
what that means at the end of the day is if I got a noise source and someone who's exposed to that source,

580
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:25,548
the more distance I can put between the source and the receiver,

581
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:27,678
the better that's going to be for the receiver,

582
00:58:27,678 --> 00:58:34,968
the person and even a little bit of a change in distance due to this inverse square law could result in a pretty drastic reduction in sound.

583
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:40,788
So distance as with radiation is also our friend when we talk about sound exposure.

584
00:58:42,588 --> 00:58:46,788
Now the third measure of magnitude which we haven't talked about yet, is sound pressure.

585
00:58:46,788 --> 00:58:55,337
And so sound power is a capital W, sound intensity is a capital I, sound pressure is a lowercase P here.

586
00:58:55,338 --> 00:58:59,988
And some pressure is really what we perceive as kind of the loudness of a sound.

587
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:06,407
So when we talk about sound pressure, we're talking basically what is the instantaneous change between the background or

588
00:59:06,408 --> 00:59:10,698
ambient pressure and whatever the sound is that we're measuring at a particular time,

589
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:15,618
the units we use to measure sound pressure are passed scales.

590
00:59:15,738 --> 00:59:19,068
So this is equivalent to Newtons per liter squared.

591
00:59:20,298 --> 00:59:29,058
One key concept I want to get across here is we're interested in some measure of the change in pressure that's not going to be zero.

592
00:59:29,478 --> 00:59:35,148
So as I've described to you already, if we introduce a sound into a room like me talking and then I stop talking,

593
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:39,858
it drops back down to ambient pressure immediately.

594
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:46,968
What that means is if I take a sound pressure for long enough, it's always going to average out to be the ambient background pressure.

595
00:59:46,968 --> 00:59:49,158
So that's not a very interesting measure.

596
00:59:49,188 --> 00:59:55,428
If every time I measure sound, I always figure out, well, if I average long enough, it's always just going to be ambient back up pressure.

597
00:59:56,208 --> 01:00:00,167
So and the reason for that, again, is our sound waves go up and down.

598
01:00:00,168 --> 01:00:07,428
We've already talked about the sine wave relationship here, but they're always going to average out to zero to the background sound pressure.

599
01:00:07,428 --> 01:00:13,458
So what we do to avoid that problem is we square the pressure that we're measuring.

600
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:17,298
And so, you know, as with any number, whenever we square things,

601
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:23,717
these negative numbers or the fluctuations below ambient background pressure are going to end up being positive.

602
01:00:23,718 --> 01:00:28,878
So if we square all the numbers here and average them, we end up with a number that's not zero.

603
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:30,078
That's what we're going for.

604
01:00:30,648 --> 01:00:36,438
And so whenever we talk about measuring sound pressure, we're always going to be talking about a root mean, square sound pressure.

605
01:00:36,438 --> 01:00:41,267
So basically we measure all the pressures over some period of time.

606
01:00:41,268 --> 01:00:43,788
We're going to square all of them to make them positive.

607
01:00:44,328 --> 01:00:48,828
We sum those up and then divide by the number of measurements we made and take the square root.

608
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:52,428
And now we have a root mean square pressure.

609
01:00:52,428 --> 01:01:03,227
So anytime you see literature describing sound, it should imply somewhere unless it's really sort of lay or popular media that it was a root mean,

610
01:01:03,228 --> 01:01:10,218
square sound pressure and again, communicating that is really our only way to make sure we're measuring sound in the same way.

611
01:01:12,078 --> 01:01:15,467
So how does this relate to sound intensity and sound power?

612
01:01:15,468 --> 01:01:21,348
Well, sound intensity is actually arguably the more important property that we're interested in.

613
01:01:21,888 --> 01:01:25,188
But sound pressure is super easy and super cheap to measure.

614
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:31,578
Of course, all of us have two built in sensors here that are designed to detect fluctuations in sound pressure.

615
01:01:32,268 --> 01:01:36,467
So intense these kind of the more important underlying principle.

616
01:01:36,468 --> 01:01:44,358
But pressure is what we actually measure routinely. And it turns out the square of the pressure that we measure is proportional to sound intensity.

617
01:01:44,358 --> 01:01:46,098
So that's kind of the relationship there.

618
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:52,578
And again, just to make sure this this concept is kind of lacking in when I talk about measuring sound intensity,

619
01:01:53,058 --> 01:01:59,528
I'm talking about the flow of energy. So if I imagine some imaginary source of noise in a workplace,

620
01:01:59,528 --> 01:02:05,718
say sound intensity is what sound energy is moving through the environment in different directions.

621
01:02:06,078 --> 01:02:13,668
Sound pressure is going to be a series of snapshots of what was the pressure at a given time, in a given point in space there.

622
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:19,548
So it's not the the movement in energy, but rather the again, the instantaneous change in pressure.

623
01:02:21,048 --> 01:02:25,458
So sound pressure is very easy to measure.

624
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:30,888
As I said, it's also pretty ungainly in terms of the units that we're working with here.

625
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:36,588
So I already describe that we're measuring in terms of Pascals or Newtons per meter squared.

626
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:43,038
It turns out that the threshold of human hearing is 20 micro Pascals,

627
01:02:43,038 --> 01:02:52,007
and that's basically the amount of pressure that's exerted from a single atom moving a single atom's distance on to your ear canal or your eardrum,

628
01:02:52,008 --> 01:02:57,948
I should say. So it's a it's a very, very small sound amount of energy, basically.

629
01:02:58,518 --> 01:03:04,698
So 20 micro Pascals, that's the lowest amount of sound that a normal hearing person can hear.

630
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:11,088
A whisper might be 200 micro pascals conversational speech, you know, maybe a little.

631
01:03:11,118 --> 01:03:20,138
Quieter than I'm talking right now might be 20,000 if we get up to what most of the world recommends as an eight hour limit for the workplace,

632
01:03:20,148 --> 01:03:23,748
that's about 360,000 micro Pascals.

633
01:03:24,108 --> 01:03:29,508
If we get up to an OSHA allows in the workplace, that's 630,000 micro Pascals.

634
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:34,938
And some of you may have experienced pain from sound levels that were so extremely high in

635
01:03:34,938 --> 01:03:41,358
the past that often or for most people doesn't kick in until about 200 million micro Pascals.

636
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:46,038
So if you imagine 80 years ago when people were first starting to design sound level meters,

637
01:03:46,578 --> 01:03:51,918
the idea of having an instrument that could go from 20 to 200 million was an absolute impossibility.

638
01:03:51,918 --> 01:03:59,598
And so scientists back then had to figure out how do we compress this into a range that we can actually measure with pretty rudimentary technology?

639
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:03,978
And the solution they came up with was employing the logarithmic scale.

640
01:04:04,788 --> 01:04:07,218
And so let's talk about how this works.

641
01:04:08,238 --> 01:04:18,098
When we talk about sound power, we can talk about the levels that have or have not had a logarithmic transformation applied.

642
01:04:18,738 --> 01:04:21,438
When we talk about levels here.

643
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:28,908
What we're doing is we're comparing some value that we measured or estimated in the environment to some reference value.

644
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:34,788
So when we talk about a sound power, we can talk about a relative sound power.

645
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:39,678
So let's say I've estimated how much sound power is coming out of this, this jackhammer,

646
01:04:39,978 --> 01:04:44,238
for instance, and then they're going to divide that by some reference sound power.

647
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:49,498
And the reference sound power, as you see here, has a value of ten to the -12.

648
01:04:50,238 --> 01:04:54,408
And that's the amount of sound power that a normal hearing human can just barely hear.

649
01:04:54,408 --> 01:05:02,028
It's the threshold of hearing. So I can consider this relative sound power and then I can turn it into this unit of decibels,

650
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:05,418
which probably most of you have heard about for for noise before.

651
01:05:06,138 --> 01:05:09,408
I take that sound power that I measure the estimated,

652
01:05:10,158 --> 01:05:19,548
I divide by the reference sound power I take the log ten of that ratio and then I multiply by ten and now I'm in units of decibels.

653
01:05:19,638 --> 01:05:29,148
And when we talk about decibels, now we're talking about that's a sound power level which we represent as a capital L sub W here.

654
01:05:29,748 --> 01:05:35,717
So this is a basic equation where I could take a sound power, you know, something labeled in Watts.

655
01:05:35,718 --> 01:05:41,088
I could divide by ten to the -12 watts, take a log, ten of that, and then multiply by ten.

656
01:05:41,088 --> 01:05:47,178
And now I'm in units of decibels. We can do the same thing for a sound intensity.

657
01:05:47,868 --> 01:05:51,227
So I can divide that, as I said, with sound power.

658
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:56,718
It's not something we actually measure, but we can estimate it. I can actually measure sound intensity with the right setup.

659
01:05:57,318 --> 01:06:01,008
I can divide some measured intensity by this reference intensity.

660
01:06:01,008 --> 01:06:04,307
And the reference intensity happens to be very similar to sound power.

661
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:08,208
So it's still ten to the -12 watts, but now it's watts per meter squared.

662
01:06:08,838 --> 01:06:12,288
And again, that's just the minimum sound power excuse me,

663
01:06:12,288 --> 01:06:17,837
sound intensity that a normal hearing person can hear and I can then convert this into decibels.

664
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:20,428
So I divide my intensity by that.

665
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:29,658
So intensity and watts from your squared by my reference intensity of ten to the -12 watts for meter squared, take the log of that multiplied by ten.

666
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:36,168
And now I'm in units of sound intensity level or else of eyes you can see here.

667
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:45,648
And so something to keep in mind. Remember that underlying scale that we can hear from 20 micro Pascals to 200 million?

668
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:52,638
That's an enormous scale. We've now effectively compressed that into a much more manageable scale of decibels.

669
01:06:53,388 --> 01:07:00,978
But keep in mind, as we talk about noise here, you may think, well, like 89, 90 decibels, 92, those all sound about the same to me.

670
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:04,518
Keep in mind, on the underlying scale, that's actually a pretty big distinction.

671
01:07:04,968 --> 01:07:10,398
And so something to remember with regards to decibels is every ten decibels

672
01:07:10,398 --> 01:07:16,278
increase in a sound level is going to be a tenfold increase in sound intensity.

673
01:07:17,028 --> 01:07:20,987
So if I go from 1 to 10 decibels, that's a tenfold increase.

674
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:25,288
If I go from 1 to 20 decibels, that's a 100 fold increase.

675
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:31,247
And if I go from 1 to 30, that's a thousand fold. So, you know, when I'm looking at numbers and I'm like, well,

676
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:35,838
this neighborhood is 50 decibels and this other neighborhood is 80 decibels, that sounds about the same.

677
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:40,278
You know, in fact, those are a thousand fold difference between those two levels.

678
01:07:40,998 --> 01:07:44,748
So this especially becomes important when we talk about noise controls,

679
01:07:44,748 --> 01:07:49,428
because you might start talking about, well, gosh, is that a three or four decibel reduction important?

680
01:07:49,428 --> 01:07:53,268
And actually it is. It's a huge reduction in how much sound is actually present.

681
01:07:55,668 --> 01:08:00,407
Okay. So we talked about log transformations for sound power and sound intensity.

682
01:08:00,408 --> 01:08:03,558
Now we'll talk about sound pressure, which is what we typically work in.

683
01:08:04,488 --> 01:08:09,018
Keep in mind, again, the intensity is proportional to the square of sound pressure.

684
01:08:09,498 --> 01:08:16,678
And so we can do. Find this sound pressure level equation as ten times the log of ten of the square

685
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:21,117
of our measured sound pressure divided by a reference sound pressure here.

686
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:24,687
And that reference sound pressure is 20 micro Pascals.

687
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:28,948
That's again the minimum amount of sound that the human ear can detect.

688
01:08:30,118 --> 01:08:35,997
We could do a little bit of mathematical rearranging, which is the more sort of conventional way to present this.

689
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:44,578
So I could see the sound power level in decibels is equal to 20 times the log of my measured pressure divided by the reference pressure.

690
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:51,508
And so with those three equations, we can go from sound power to sound power level,

691
01:08:52,138 --> 01:08:58,078
from sound intensity to sound intensity level in decibels or sound pressure to sound pressure level in decibels.

692
01:08:59,278 --> 01:09:08,278
And the net effect of that sort of the grand benefit here is we go from this super unwieldy scale here

693
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:13,557
of 20 to 200 million micro Pascals to something that's a little easier to wrap our heads around.

694
01:09:13,558 --> 01:09:22,378
So in this converted decibels scale, the threshold of hearing now becomes zero decibels and the threshold of pain is somewhere.

695
01:09:22,588 --> 01:09:27,178
This can vary by individual, but it's somewhere between, say, 130 and 140 decibels.

696
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:34,198
So this scale, again, un programable in kind of historical, technological terms,

697
01:09:34,558 --> 01:09:41,728
but the decibel scale is much more achievable in terms of actually designing instruments that could make measurements over this range.

698
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:50,968
So we'll talk a little bit more about decibels and then we'll wrap up on some some lighter content.

699
01:09:51,658 --> 01:09:58,438
But some of the things we can start to do once we are working in decibels are, for instance, to try to talk about noise attenuation.

700
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:07,288
So let's say I've got a situation, I've got a high noise level, I make some change to the environment and the sound level goes down.

701
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:12,448
I've now caused some attenuation there. And how would we actually consider that?

702
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:18,087
Well, one way to do this noise attenuation calculation is I measure the sound intensity

703
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:22,108
level before I do anything to the room and then I measure it again after.

704
01:10:22,588 --> 01:10:27,268
And the difference there is going to be my noise attenuation and the way I would actually compute

705
01:10:27,268 --> 01:10:34,168
that using these decibel values is I would take my before value divided by my after values,

706
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:39,268
take the log of that ratio multiplied by ten and that's now my noise attenuation.

707
01:10:39,928 --> 01:10:45,208
I could do that for sound intensity. I could do something very similar if I'm measuring sound pressure.

708
01:10:45,928 --> 01:10:50,007
And again, something else to keep in mind just for cues.

709
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:57,147
When you're taking the exam, for instance, sound intensity is going to have this ten times the log of ten values.

710
01:10:57,148 --> 01:11:05,698
Sound pressure is going to have 20 times the lot of ten because again, sound pressure to a square sound pressure is proportional to intensity.

711
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:12,747
So that's where that toe comes from. So just giving you a kind of hypothetical example here,

712
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:19,288
let's say this was a room in a factory and I had two pieces of equipment in here and I shot one of them off.

713
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:24,628
So how many? And again, the key here is these are identical noise sources.

714
01:11:24,628 --> 01:11:33,148
So two identical pieces of machinery. And I flip one of them off by how many decibels do I expect the noise level to drop in this room?

715
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:43,738
And so using my noise attenuation calculation here, okay, I've got my before intensity which isn't identified and I've got my after intensity here.

716
01:11:44,278 --> 01:11:50,518
Let's just say arbitrarily my before intensity is two because I had two machines and after intensity is one.

717
01:11:51,118 --> 01:11:56,607
If I do the math and I would suggest running through some of these basic calculations on your calculator just

718
01:11:56,608 --> 01:12:02,547
to make sure you've you've got to figure out that by cutting the number of sources in this room in half,

719
01:12:02,548 --> 01:12:05,848
my decibel level is going to drop by three decibels.

720
01:12:06,478 --> 01:12:09,778
And that turns out to be a really useful rule of thumb.

721
01:12:10,678 --> 01:12:17,848
So any time I'm either doubling the amount of sound in a room or cutting it in half, the change is going to be three decibels.

722
01:12:17,848 --> 01:12:23,878
So this is something where, you know, when at least some of you go out and your your hygienist working at a plant,

723
01:12:23,878 --> 01:12:27,928
someone might say, hey, we're thinking about doubling capacity or production at this facility.

724
01:12:28,288 --> 01:12:33,388
We want to cram twice as many machines into this room. Do you have any idea how much louder you can be like?

725
01:12:33,538 --> 01:12:39,238
Yes, three decibels and you blow them away. I guarantee you, people are impressed by the basic ability to do that.

726
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:45,418
Or if they said, hey, you know, the economy's down, we're going to have to take half the machines out.

727
01:12:45,418 --> 01:12:48,508
Do you have any idea what kind of impact that's going to have on our sound levels?

728
01:12:48,508 --> 01:12:54,508
You could say, yeah, it's probably going to drop by about three decibels. And maybe that means our workers are no longer overexposed.

729
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:57,118
So that's a pretty useful rule of thumb.

730
01:12:58,738 --> 01:13:08,098
Another practical question here is not if I eliminate half the machines, but what if I move away from a source?

731
01:13:08,098 --> 01:13:11,938
So if I've got a worker who's working right up next to a machine. I moved them away.

732
01:13:12,418 --> 01:13:20,278
How much is that going to influence their exposure? And let's say in this case, I've got a worker who's well off to show you the example here.

733
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:25,917
And let's say I've got a worker who's one foot away to start with and I'm moving them to two feet away.

734
01:13:25,918 --> 01:13:33,118
So I'm doubling the distance between them. You know, all of this is dictated by the inverse square law.

735
01:13:33,178 --> 01:13:37,497
You know, practically speaking, you might think 1 to 2 feet. That's not going to make much of a difference.

736
01:13:37,498 --> 01:13:42,178
But again, that inverse square law means some level drops very rapidly with distance.

737
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:48,418
So if I do the math again, my starting distance is one, my ending distance is two.

738
01:13:48,928 --> 01:13:55,918
I take ten times the longer ten of that ratio, I figure out, wow, just by doubling the distance, I'm getting a six decibels reduction.

739
01:13:56,758 --> 01:13:59,848
That's huge. Again, you may think six decibels, big deal.

740
01:13:59,848 --> 01:14:03,778
But remember, on the underline scale, that's a tremendous reduction in sound.

741
01:14:05,278 --> 01:14:08,907
So we'll touch on this again when we talk about noise controls.

742
01:14:08,908 --> 01:14:18,088
But one of the best, easiest and often free ways to reduce people's noise levels is just have them move a little bit further away from the source.

743
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:24,958
And so, again, this is important enough that I'll sort of classify this as a useful rule of thumb.

744
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:34,168
So any time you're moving at a doubling of distance away from a source, you're going to drop six decibels or so each time you double that distance.

745
01:14:34,648 --> 01:14:37,168
That's good. That means your exposure is going down.

746
01:14:37,768 --> 01:14:42,688
On the flip side, if you're having to move people closer and closer to a source, every time you get,

747
01:14:43,048 --> 01:14:49,078
every time you essentially move half again as close to the source, your level is going to go up by six decibels.

748
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:55,708
So just some rules of thumb, again, to to live by and maybe be able to remember and employ in the heat of the moment.

749
01:14:57,928 --> 01:15:04,528
We might also be tasked with questions like, well, gosh, I'm going to cram a bunch of different equipment into this room.

750
01:15:05,248 --> 01:15:12,928
All of the pieces of equipment have different sound levels. How noisy is the room going to be after I put all the equipment in here?

751
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:17,458
Or maybe we'll start with the easier scenario here.

752
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:22,678
Let's say I want to cram four different pieces of equipment into a room here,

753
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:27,327
and all of these pieces of equipment each have a level above 100 decibels.

754
01:15:27,328 --> 01:15:33,988
So when I put them all into the room, what's the overall sound pressure level going to be or sound intensity level?

755
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:39,277
And so again, that's a pretty practical question when you're designing a facility.

756
01:15:39,278 --> 01:15:44,638
And here we have a different sort of variation on our equation here that we can employ.

757
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:50,338
So if I've got a bunch of sources that I'm trying to put together and they all are identical,

758
01:15:50,348 --> 01:15:56,487
meaning they all have the same sound level in decibels, I can use this equation here.

759
01:15:56,488 --> 01:15:59,818
And so I'm taking in this case we're working in sound pressure.

760
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:07,198
So I have individual sound pressures for each of those pieces of equipment, and I'm trying to compute the overall sound pressure level.

761
01:16:08,578 --> 01:16:14,788
So if all of these pieces of equipment are the same and as we've talked about,

762
01:16:14,788 --> 01:16:20,667
this is four pieces of equipment each at 100 decibels, I can run them through this equation here.

763
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:24,228
So for each of them, I'm going to take the sound pressure level that's 100 decibels,

764
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,858
one divided by ten, and then I to take ten to the power of that turn.

765
01:16:29,638 --> 01:16:36,538
So if we do that at 100 divided by ten, well, that's and so then I've got ten to the 10th power here.

766
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:44,037
I multiply that by four, I'm going to take that value and take the log of that multiplied by ten.

767
01:16:44,038 --> 01:16:49,317
And I'll figure out and again, run through this on your calculator just to make sure you're able to do these log transformations.

768
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:52,958
Every calculator's a little different, but once I do that math,

769
01:16:52,958 --> 01:17:00,358
I figure out that my overall sound pressure level from four 100 decibels sources is going to be 106 decibels.

770
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:06,518
Now, if ever you're on an exam or a quiz and you're in this class and you're like, Hmm,

771
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:11,578
I think if you put three sources at 100 decibels together, it's going to be 300 decibels.

772
01:17:12,358 --> 01:17:18,717
Stop right there. You will almost never in your career see levels over about 145 or so decibels.

773
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:22,258
So if you're doing math and you're like, Oh, that's easy, it's 280 decibels, you're wrong.

774
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,918
I could just assure you and take it from one who's been there and done this.

775
01:17:27,178 --> 01:17:33,137
So again, 400 decibels sources produces a 106 decibel overall sound pressure level.

776
01:17:33,138 --> 01:17:36,958
It's a little bit mind bending, but this is the joy of decibels.

777
01:17:38,128 --> 01:17:44,247
I can take that same equation, and in this case I could apply different sound pressure levels.

778
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:48,178
So let's say I still want to put four pieces of equipment in this room, but now they're not identical.

779
01:17:48,178 --> 01:17:52,318
One is 80, one's 85, one's 90 and one's 95 decibels.

780
01:17:52,888 --> 01:17:59,758
What's the overall sound pressure level going to be here? I've got my same equation to figure out the overall sound pressure level.

781
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:08,038
So I take ten times the sound pressure level divided by ten, some those and then do ten times log ten of that term.

782
01:18:08,038 --> 01:18:14,938
So, you know, expanding this equation out. I've got my lady, the source 85, 90, 95.

783
01:18:15,388 --> 01:18:16,768
And if I do all the math there,

784
01:18:16,768 --> 01:18:25,918
I figure out my overall sound pressure level here for sources ranging from 80 to 95 decibels is going to be 96.6 decibels.

785
01:18:26,698 --> 01:18:32,097
And again, if you were to do that arithmetically, you might say, well, having all those in the room is going to be 350 decibels.

786
01:18:32,098 --> 01:18:35,337
And again, that should just immediately trigger to say that that number is impossible.

787
01:18:35,338 --> 01:18:42,898
It must be wrong. Yeah. Or what happens if you just take the average of each four and I go back and do one calculation without doing that?

788
01:18:43,978 --> 01:18:48,088
Oh, you mean like arithmetically average these and then plug it into the equation?

789
01:18:49,468 --> 01:18:55,228
That's a great question. It's it's going to be wrong, but it's not going to be as wrong as this, I guess, is one way to put it.

790
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:59,128
It'll be closer, but it's still not going to be perfectly correct.

791
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:06,307
Although maybe I'll grab my calculator after class and figure that out because yeah, it's not going to be horribly wrong.

792
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:11,008
I mean, it's not going to be perfectly correct, I guess is the bottom line. Yeah, exactly.

793
01:19:11,008 --> 01:19:16,768
You can you can double check this on the spot as well or in checking that I'll mention here,

794
01:19:17,398 --> 01:19:21,358
we can also use the same equation to subtract sound level.

795
01:19:21,368 --> 01:19:25,708
So let's say I've got two pieces of equipment in a room and when both of them

796
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:30,387
are running at 100 decibels and I take one of those pieces of equipment out,

797
01:19:30,388 --> 01:19:35,578
and when I measure that equipment all by itself, that piece of equipment is 96 decibels.

798
01:19:36,178 --> 01:19:40,227
So I've got 100 decibels. Overall, one of the pieces of machinery is 96.

799
01:19:40,228 --> 01:19:44,008
What is the other one in terms of the sound pressure level?

800
01:19:44,008 --> 01:19:51,987
And so I can take this same equation, but now instead of adding the sources here, I can simply subtract them.

801
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:57,958
So I would say, what is my overall that's 100 and then I'm subtracting 96 decibels.

802
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:03,208
And if I if I run through that equation, plug and chug, I'm going to get 98 decibels.

803
01:20:03,418 --> 01:20:10,738
So again, just to state this slightly differently, if you've got a 96 and a 98 decibels source in the room,

804
01:20:11,218 --> 01:20:19,468
the overall sound pressure should be 100 decibels. So it's a little funky, it's nonlinear, it's not arithmetic like we've been thinking about,

805
01:20:19,918 --> 01:20:23,428
but it is something that we can compute with with pretty good certainty.

806
01:20:24,448 --> 01:20:29,788
Now you need to be able to do this on your calculator to be clear.

807
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:32,847
So, so definitely make sure you can get the same numbers.

808
01:20:32,848 --> 01:20:41,278
I've got the slides, but there are also again some kind of quick rules of thumb that you can employ here to do a quick and dirty calculation.

809
01:20:41,908 --> 01:20:48,568
And so with this approach, you essentially take two values that you're trying to add or subtract from each other.

810
01:20:49,188 --> 01:20:56,517
You look at the difference between those, and then you can apply a factor to kind of estimate what the resulting term would be.

811
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:03,147
So just to break this out in words, if I've got two levels, let's say 90 and 91 decibels,

812
01:21:03,148 --> 01:21:09,268
and I want to put them both in the same room, well, 1991 are one decibels apart.

813
01:21:09,268 --> 01:21:10,558
We can all agree on that, I'm sure.

814
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:18,208
And so if I go to the second part of this table, that tells me that I add three decibels to the higher of the two sources.

815
01:21:18,928 --> 01:21:26,308
So if I'm adding a 90 and a 91 level source, that means I'm going to add three decibels to the louder source 91.

816
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:30,748
So 90 and a 91 decibels source together should equal 94.

817
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:38,878
Now, if I've got sources that are two or three decibels apart, I'm going to add a slightly smaller value to the higher of the two.

818
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:44,608
If they're 4 to 8, I'm going to add an even smaller value and this is kind of mind blowing as well.

819
01:21:44,968 --> 01:21:49,288
If I've got two sources and the difference between them is more than nine decibels.

820
01:21:49,798 --> 01:21:55,468
The second source, the lower source is essentially adding nothing to the sound pressure.

821
01:21:56,248 --> 01:22:03,657
So maybe so that would mean if I have 100 decibels source in a room and I add a 90 decibels source to that room,

822
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:10,858
it's still going to be 100 decibels in there. And again, that's kind of confusing, but if you think about it, maybe on a more visual analogy.

823
01:22:10,858 --> 01:22:19,257
So if I've got like a giant powerful searchlight in a room and I bring in my little handheld penlight, have I added energy to the room properly?

824
01:22:19,258 --> 01:22:20,248
Is it meaningful?

825
01:22:21,328 --> 01:22:28,798
And so that that quieter source, again, a source that's nine or more decibels different or lower than something that's already running,

826
01:22:29,038 --> 01:22:35,757
it's not going to add any meaningful amount of energy. So again, if your boss ever came up to you and said, you know,

827
01:22:35,758 --> 01:22:40,887
it's like 90 decibels in here and I want to add a whole ton of 70 decibels sources, is that going to be a problem?

828
01:22:40,888 --> 01:22:47,068
You could say actually, it's really not because the 90 decibels is just going to totally dominate this exposure.

829
01:22:49,288 --> 01:22:52,497
All right. We'll skip our poll everywhere.

830
01:22:52,498 --> 01:22:53,248
As for today.

831
01:22:53,638 --> 01:23:03,928
And so, again, just to drive this home with another rule of thumb, anytime I'm doubling or having the number of sources that I have in a space,

832
01:23:04,258 --> 01:23:10,558
the change in the sound pressure level is going to be three decibels. So if I go from 1 to 2 and adding three decibels, the.

833
01:23:10,648 --> 01:23:19,977
I go from 4 to 2, I'm going to be subtracting three decimals, just kind of wrapping up here.

834
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:27,138
And I think we're going to finish a few minutes early today. Just coming back to this concept of magnitude and frequency.

835
01:23:27,148 --> 01:23:34,588
So when we talk about amplitude again, that's something that we're going to quantify either as a sound power level in decibels

836
01:23:34,588 --> 01:23:38,488
of the sound intensity level in decibels or a sound pressure level in decibels.

837
01:23:39,118 --> 01:23:43,348
And just kind of comparing these things for a quieter sound pressure level.

838
01:23:43,948 --> 01:23:51,058
For instance, we're going to have a relatively low amplitude and a larger amplitude is going to mean a higher sound pressure level.

839
01:23:52,468 --> 01:23:55,138
Also for lower pitch or lower frequency sounds,

840
01:23:55,138 --> 01:24:02,188
we're going to have a very long wavelength and for higher frequencies or higher pitches, we're going to have a much shorter wavelength.

841
01:24:02,908 --> 01:24:05,878
So those are, again, pretty important things to keep in mind.

842
01:24:06,778 --> 01:24:15,958
The other concept I'll sort of bring in here just to close us out is the relationship between magnitude and frequency.

843
01:24:17,338 --> 01:24:26,038
So two different tones of sound could have the very same decibel level, so the same amount of energy,

844
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:30,928
but they may be perceived quite differently from us if there are two different frequencies.

845
01:24:31,468 --> 01:24:36,208
And so there's another term here that we're really not going to explore much beyond this couple of slides.

846
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:43,978
So you need to to remember this specifically, but funds are a unit that was developed to quantify loudness.

847
01:24:44,488 --> 01:24:48,238
And so again, loudness as we perceive it, is different than intensity.

848
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:50,637
Intensity has nothing to do with our hearing.

849
01:24:50,638 --> 01:24:58,648
It's just a sort of an objective measure, whereas loudness is our perception of how how loud something is.

850
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:08,368
So when these bands were invented, they tried to tie this to the measure of decibels that we've been using or sound pressure level SPL.

851
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:18,148
And so they said it a thousand hertz. The loudness in these units of fans is going to be equal to the sound pressure level in decibels.

852
01:25:18,628 --> 01:25:23,878
And the folks who did this research initially were last names, Fletcher and Munson.

853
01:25:23,878 --> 01:25:29,637
And so we now have something called a Fletcher Munson curve that they developed.

854
01:25:29,638 --> 01:25:32,668
And so what we're looking at here is pretty complex.

855
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:41,188
Let me unpack this for you. So we've got phones are the units in the middle here ranging from zero all the way up to 100.

856
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:49,288
And then we've got sound pressure level on the Y axis here ranging from actually from minus ten all the way up to 130.

857
01:25:49,738 --> 01:25:55,738
And then on the x axis here, we're looking at frequencies from really low frequency to pretty high frequency.

858
01:25:56,488 --> 01:26:01,348
And so, as I said a moment ago, at a thousand hertz right here,

859
01:26:01,348 --> 01:26:07,168
you can see that the number it finds actually matches the number in decibels or sound pressure level.

860
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:14,878
So in a thousand Hertz, fans are equal to decibels. But as we get away from a thousand hertz, that relationship changes a bit.

861
01:26:15,718 --> 01:26:19,798
So maybe the thing to start with here is this dash line on the bottom.

862
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:25,828
So this is essentially the threshold of human hearing at different frequencies.

863
01:26:26,488 --> 01:26:31,528
So you'll notice I mean, you might think, well, gosh, I hear equally well at all frequencies.

864
01:26:31,828 --> 01:26:35,788
That's in fact, not correct, according to the graphic here.

865
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:44,007
And according to the science, we actually hear much less well at low frequencies than we do at sort of midrange frequencies,

866
01:26:44,008 --> 01:26:53,158
and we hear slightly worse at very high frequency. So remember earlier I played that 3000 Hertz tone and I said it's like a especially piercing.

867
01:26:53,758 --> 01:26:58,887
That's because that particular tone is right down in this area where our hearing is most sensitive.

868
01:26:58,888 --> 01:27:05,788
So so something presented at that frequency is much more intense than something presented at a lower frequency,

869
01:27:05,788 --> 01:27:09,238
like 300 hertz, which is one of the other demos that we do.

870
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:13,467
So we see this kind of sweeping upward curve here.

871
01:27:13,468 --> 01:27:17,128
And what this means is that something that's perceived at, say,

872
01:27:17,488 --> 01:27:25,258
one or two finds at a thousand hertz is going to be perceived at a much different fine level at a lower frequency.

873
01:27:26,518 --> 01:27:33,028
So maybe another way to visualize this is that these steep curves that rise upwards

874
01:27:33,028 --> 01:27:38,577
at the lower frequencies indicate that as frequencies decrease or go down,

875
01:27:38,578 --> 01:27:48,358
it takes more and more sound for us to perceive those frequencies as being equally loud to kind of the frequencies at the center of our hearing.

876
01:27:49,588 --> 01:28:01,348
So this 40 hertz curve here just to pick 140 fans or 40 decibels at 1000 hertz is probably about as loud as this room.

877
01:28:01,348 --> 01:28:04,738
If we were all in here whispering to each other, not especially loud.

878
01:28:05,398 --> 01:28:10,528
And so at 40 fans, you can see here that this curve rise.

879
01:28:10,728 --> 01:28:18,768
Pretty steeply, meaning that the lower the frequency, the more sound pressure it takes for us to perceive that is 45.

880
01:28:19,338 --> 01:28:27,078
So we're not especially sensitive at the lower frequencies. We have this little bump here in the area that we are hearing as most sensitive at.

881
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:31,698
And then we have another kind of upward increase at the higher frequencies,

882
01:28:31,698 --> 01:28:38,448
meaning it takes us a bit more sound at those high frequencies for something to sound equally loud as it does a thousand hertz.

883
01:28:39,378 --> 01:28:46,397
So the overall takeaway from this is that human ears are not especially sensitive at low frequencies.

884
01:28:46,398 --> 01:28:51,178
That's why, you know, most well, at least back in my day,

885
01:28:51,418 --> 01:28:56,808
if you could buy an inexpensive stereo or something that always had a bass boost button on it.

886
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:04,188
And basically what that would do is, is put a bunch more energy artificially into the low frequency so you can actually hear them.

887
01:29:05,658 --> 01:29:15,318
We're really sensitive in this region between, say, one in 6000 hertz and then we're less and less sensitive at higher frequencies above that.

888
01:29:15,798 --> 01:29:19,848
So this is how the human ear perceives these different frequencies.

889
01:29:20,448 --> 01:29:27,977
Now, one of the things that we want to do when we measure sound in the environment is if I've got an instrument that I developed,

890
01:29:27,978 --> 01:29:31,158
I want it to measure sound the way a human perceives sound.

891
01:29:31,168 --> 01:29:34,638
I don't want it to be completely decoupled from the human experience.

892
01:29:35,268 --> 01:29:40,397
And so the challenge that scientists had early on is we've got to get these curves

893
01:29:40,398 --> 01:29:44,358
and kind of programed them into our instruments so that when I make a measurement,

894
01:29:44,778 --> 01:29:48,048
it's going to kind of mimic how the human ear perceives sound.

895
01:29:48,648 --> 01:29:51,948
And so what was developed as a result are what are called weighting curves.

896
01:29:51,948 --> 01:29:57,948
And this is important. This is something we use all the way through instruments that were built just today.

897
01:29:58,548 --> 01:30:00,468
And so essentially the challenge was,

898
01:30:00,468 --> 01:30:08,268
let me take those Fletcher Munson curves and convert those into something I could program into a sound measurement instrument.

899
01:30:09,228 --> 01:30:11,868
And we've ended up with what you see here.

900
01:30:11,878 --> 01:30:20,747
So just to introduce you to the different lines, we've got this kind of purple or I'm not even sure that's so good with colors,

901
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:25,098
but you see the squiggly looking kind of purplish line here. Is that fuchsia in that area?

902
01:30:26,748 --> 01:30:30,888
So this is kind of the representation of human hearing.

903
01:30:31,248 --> 01:30:36,228
And essentially what we're looking at here is this is just the reverse of that 45 curve.

904
01:30:36,408 --> 01:30:43,548
So if you sort of imagine what the 45 curve here would look like if we flipped it upside down,

905
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:51,048
this is essentially the threshold of of human hearing or that the characteristics of human hearing.

906
01:30:51,498 --> 01:30:58,728
And we're trying to match that by programing a curve into an instrument to get as close to that human hearing curve as we can.

907
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:02,948
And the two ways that we do that are the so-called a waiting curve.

908
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,437
That's the blue line here. And the C waiting curve.

909
01:31:06,438 --> 01:31:18,208
That's the red line. So the blue line here, the awaiting curve, is essentially our representation of how the human ear here is at 40 funds.

910
01:31:18,918 --> 01:31:23,968
And the red line, the DC curve is a representation of about 105.

911
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:28,547
And so what we see is that and I should introduce the axes here.

912
01:31:28,548 --> 01:31:35,298
So on the Y axis, this is relative response zero, meaning when the instrument measures the sound,

913
01:31:35,298 --> 01:31:37,998
it's neither adding or subtracting anything from the sound.

914
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:42,948
It's just what it actually measures and the relative response getting further and further from zero.

915
01:31:42,948 --> 01:31:49,067
This is this means that whatever sound comes in at this particular frequency that the meter is going

916
01:31:49,068 --> 01:31:54,168
to subtract 40 decibels to account for the fact that the human ear just doesn't hear that well,

917
01:31:54,168 --> 01:32:02,958
at least lower ranges. So essentially at each frequency, we're going to be applying some kind of relative response.

918
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:09,708
And the whole idea here is just so that the meter can measure sound the way the human person does it in terms of loudness.

919
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:14,268
Now that a waiting curve, if we apply that we refer to the decibels as.

920
01:32:15,228 --> 01:32:18,438
And probably most of you have heard that that unit before.

921
01:32:18,858 --> 01:32:26,208
And so that's just our our way of saying I've measured sound and I've waited the sound by frequency to match the human ear.

922
01:32:27,678 --> 01:32:30,798
So DBA is what we use for almost everything in sound.

923
01:32:30,948 --> 01:32:35,808
The only time we use DBC, that's the red curve is for really intense kind of sounds.

924
01:32:36,318 --> 01:32:42,468
And let me just play you a demo here to show you the difference when we apply the a weighting.

925
01:32:42,918 --> 01:32:53,028
So let's go. Unweighted, meaning we're not changing the measurement at all.

926
01:32:53,118 --> 01:32:56,358
So you can hear there's a fair amount of kind of rumble or bass in there.

927
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:07,758
They bring in steel and. So with a waiting, you can hear that rumble is kind of gone.

928
01:33:07,998 --> 01:33:14,208
It's shifted more towards the higher frequency. So in applying the weighting, we've taken out a lot of the low frequencies.

929
01:33:16,688 --> 01:33:22,298
This was a film. But again, you can hear a lot of the sort of rumble in there, lots of low frequency when it's fun.

930
01:33:23,378 --> 01:33:28,478
And then the A-rated example, you won't hear that yet.

931
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:33,308
It sounds more hollow to be kind of ten years just lacking in that base.

932
01:33:33,788 --> 01:33:39,158
So so when we talk about frequency weightings, this is a critical part of sound measurement.

933
01:33:39,548 --> 01:33:44,078
Like, she won't stop. It's a critical part of sound measurement.

934
01:33:44,078 --> 01:33:49,628
And that, again, we're doing our best to measure sound the way the human ear perceives it.

935
01:33:49,628 --> 01:33:57,398
And so DVOA is what we use for virtually every measurement that we make of noise, either in the workplace or in the community.

936
01:33:57,878 --> 01:33:59,917
And in measuring DBA, again,

937
01:33:59,918 --> 01:34:07,208
we're largely discounting these low frequencies and actually emphasizing some of the mid frequencies where we hear especially well.

938
01:34:08,598 --> 01:34:13,038
And so once again, I just want to highlight the benefit of this technology,

939
01:34:13,038 --> 01:34:17,567
having been around for 80 plus years as people have agreed and standardized.

940
01:34:17,568 --> 01:34:24,408
So what does an E weighting curve look like? What are all the relative responses that we apply at each individual frequency?

941
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:32,448
So when I measured DBA here in the United States, someone else measuring DBA in Thailand is measuring the exact same values.

942
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,958
Or I should say it's making the measurement in the exact same way.

943
01:34:37,068 --> 01:34:40,668
So in this class, for, again, virtually everything you're going to do,

944
01:34:40,668 --> 01:34:45,998
it's going to be in a DBC is is sort of the next most common, believe it or not.

945
01:34:46,008 --> 01:34:49,907
I think there were six total weighting curves that were invented back in the 1950s

946
01:34:49,908 --> 01:34:53,987
and sixties and people were quickly like six is a bit too much to keep track of.

947
01:34:53,988 --> 01:34:57,138
Let's just pick one and go with it. And debate was kind of the winner.

948
01:34:58,368 --> 01:35:01,868
So as I said, DBA is is really what we're going to do.

949
01:35:01,878 --> 01:35:09,588
It's intended to mimic human response, to sound it kind of low levels of sound pressure, the 45 curve.

950
01:35:10,128 --> 01:35:14,928
And again, if we're measuring according to the weighting scale we want to report TBA.

951
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:22,307
Not doing this is a major issue when you read stuff in the popular press because they'll just report decimal values and it's like,

952
01:35:22,308 --> 01:35:29,868
well, as a DB or as a VBA because those are actually very important and meaningful differences and C weighting.

953
01:35:29,868 --> 01:35:34,128
We really only apply for pretty intense exposures above 100 decibels.

954
01:35:34,908 --> 01:35:41,237
If we're making so-called unweighted or flat readings, we will report those as unweighted,

955
01:35:41,238 --> 01:35:47,358
or there's now a new feature called C Weighting, meaning I'm treating all the frequencies the same.

956
01:35:48,558 --> 01:35:54,888
So these are just critical ways, again, for us to make sound in the best representation that we can the have here.

957
01:35:56,598 --> 01:36:04,878
And I'll I'll just wrap up here by saying we can also take information across different frequency bands and combine it.

958
01:36:04,878 --> 01:36:11,087
So it's very common historically for people to have made measurements according to Octave Band.

959
01:36:11,088 --> 01:36:15,678
So they would have taken each of these bands from 63 to 80000 hertz,

960
01:36:16,098 --> 01:36:24,618
and they would measure a sound pressure level in each band and stop there because 40 or 50 years ago that was just a best practice.

961
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:30,948
Today we might want to say, Hey, let me convert these into DBA measurements so I can compare them to kind of modern standards.

962
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:34,788
And so the way we would do that is we would look at the table that I showed you a

963
01:36:34,788 --> 01:36:40,937
moment ago and figure out what's the relative response at 63 hertz at 125 words,

964
01:36:40,938 --> 01:36:45,347
I would apply that. And now I have an A-rated frequency band.

965
01:36:45,348 --> 01:36:49,577
They're the alternative to that.

966
01:36:49,578 --> 01:36:55,428
And I should say I can I can sum of these values up using my overall sound pressure level equation.

967
01:36:56,358 --> 01:37:03,678
The alternative is what I described to you that very quick and dirty table of differences between sound pressure levels you're adding.

968
01:37:04,368 --> 01:37:14,837
So I can also take this whole set of measurements that I made and I could do the apply that table kind of physically.

969
01:37:14,838 --> 01:37:18,588
So I could say 46 and 62. Well, those are more than nine decibels difference.

970
01:37:18,978 --> 01:37:23,418
So the result of those is 62, 71 and 79.

971
01:37:23,418 --> 01:37:31,608
Those are eight decibels difference. And thinking back to that table, if values are 48 decibels different than I at one decibel to the higher value.

972
01:37:32,148 --> 01:37:35,688
So 71 and 79 is going to result in the overall value of 80.

973
01:37:35,688 --> 01:37:39,168
And I could go through sort of the whole matrix here and figure it out.

974
01:37:39,648 --> 01:37:45,078
Either way that I do it, I'm going to come up with an overall sound pressure level of about 89 decibels.

975
01:37:46,428 --> 01:37:54,648
So sorry, this is two more slides and I thought I had just in conclusion here,

976
01:37:54,678 --> 01:37:59,087
I'll say the human ears perception of sound doesn't match exactly with decibels.

977
01:37:59,088 --> 01:38:08,747
I've just described that for some time. In fact, we can't hear or perceive a change of less than, say, plus or minus three decibels.

978
01:38:08,748 --> 01:38:15,137
We're just not that sensitive. And a change of ten decibels will sound about twice as twice as loud.

979
01:38:15,138 --> 01:38:21,288
So I'll just play you a quick demo here. This is going to flip flop back and forth with three decibels changes.

980
01:38:23,878 --> 01:38:29,918
It's very subtle. Q Can you hear the slight change?

981
01:38:32,078 --> 01:38:32,888
It's stepping up.

982
01:38:34,838 --> 01:38:45,068
So plus or minus three, maybe you can pick out plus or minus ten, on the other hand, is much more noticeable but won't actually play interesting.

983
01:38:47,138 --> 01:38:53,798
All right. Even power points telling you it's time to be done. You have these in your slides so you can play that example for yourself.

984
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:59,467
So just in closing, we've kind of covered the basic physics that we're going to cover in the next class.

985
01:38:59,468 --> 01:39:04,448
We'll talk about how the human ear works, how it becomes damaged by noise,

986
01:39:04,778 --> 01:39:08,888
and we'll also talk about how instrumentation to actually measure noise works.

987
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:15,488
So thanks, everybody. Good to see you again for this next class that's going to be online video recordings.

988
01:39:15,528 --> 01:39:22,058
I'll send out a reminder and then I will see you in two weeks. Back in the room here with apologies for my absences.

989
01:39:22,388 --> 01:39:24,038
So thanks, everybody. You have a great afternoon.
