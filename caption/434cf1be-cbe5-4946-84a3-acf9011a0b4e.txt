00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,040
Hi everyone, it's Krystle at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:17,450
I use she/her pronouns and I'm one of the Career Services Advisers here at the school, ready to talk to you about letters of recommendation.

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,000
So the first thing that we're going to talk about is kind of just the logistics component of getting a letter of recommendation,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,770
and what you need to do to prepare to make sure that you have a really standout document for any of your upcoming applications.

5
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,430
So we want to think about first, what is a letter of recommendation.

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,520
This is a formal document that is going to outline your qualities, characteristics and capabilities,

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,530
all related to a future position or program that you might be applying to. A good letter of recommendation will comment on and

8
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:57,620
provide evidence about your achievements based on personal experience and or observation about how you've performed in the past.

9
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:05,930
Before we move on, we do want to think about what is the difference between a reference and a recommendation, a reference is usually much less formal,

10
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:14,180
and it's often just a list of people that you could have called upon to speak to your skills and qualifications. In most applications,

11
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:21,980
these names and contact information would be provided later on in the process and would simply be someone's commitment to say, yes,

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:31,970
I'm willing to vouch for you on behalf of myself and my former employer or my current employer to talk about the skills that you have.

13
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,620
A letter of recommendation is a lot more of a commitment, because it is that formal written

14
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,690
document that speaks to the evidence that they have, based on your past performance.

15
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,170
Typically,

16
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:50,480
these are written well before an application is due and take a little bit more coordinating than just writing someone's name on the document.

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,940
So today we're going to be focusing on letters of recommendation, not references. If you do have questions about that,

18
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:02,450
I recommend that you reach out to a Career Services Adviser at your current institution to find out,

19
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,890
what are the typical ways that people list the references that they have in the application process?

20
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,790
So thinking about preparing for the letter of recommendation process,

21
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,330
it's really important to think about who are you going to ask?

22
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,500
Who are those individuals that are going to provide stand out letters of recommendation and can provide the evidence that you're looking for?

23
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,500
So this is someone that you should have a relationship with, either personally or professionally or maybe even both.

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,600
They should know about your career plans and qualifications to achieve those plans,

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,640
whether it be attending more school or pursuing a job after graduation.

26
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,100
You'll want this person to be a strong writer, because it is a formal document that is written,

27
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,060
and you want someone that's going to be reliable to complete it on time.

28
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:58,750
Most applications will not hold the deadline if the writer has not completed the letter of recommendation on time.

29
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,230
For a pro tip, and you'll see these throughout the document in the orange bubble,

30
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,940
they're down at the bottom of the presentation, are some questions that we commonly get.

31
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,120
So in this case, we want to make sure that we're paying attention to the application's specific requirements.

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,380
Sometimes, there are specific roles that a person has to play in your life in order to write a letter of recommendation.

33
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:30,610
Some examples of this could be your faculty academic adviser, a past supervisor, and or someone who knows you personally, but is not a family member.

34
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:37,930
So just make sure that you're paying attention to make sure that you're fulfilling all of the qualifications in your application process.

35
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,060
Next, we want to think about after you've identified these people, when should you ask?

36
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,820
There's a lot of qualifications and things that we need to balance when we're looking at the letter of recommendation process.

37
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,920
Timeline is really tough. Oftentimes, our writers are busy

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:02,170
at the same times that we're looking for those letters of recommendation, so early fall, early winter term, tend to be really busy for faculty.

39
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,930
But we want to make sure that we are giving them at least one month in advance to write the letter.

40
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,920
So whether this means you're going to reach out over the summer to prepare for

41
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,340
fall term applications for graduate school or just having someone on deck that,

42
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,850
you know, you're going to apply for a program starting in November,

43
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:30,160
maybe you reach out to them in early October to make sure that you have plenty of time for them to be able to write a quality letter.

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,180
When we're asking for a letter of recommendation,

45
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,100
we want to make sure that in the process of the timeline and figuring all that out,

46
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,410
you also are providing an "easy out" for any of our recommenders.

47
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,770
This is to make sure that there's not too much pressure, in case the person does have too much on their plate or they're already committed to a

48
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:59,080
number of letters of recommendations and don't feel like they have the time to complete something that is of quality for you. In this easy out,

49
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,200
we can say you understand that the individual is busy, that you have other people on deck,

50
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,080
and that's part of why the timeline is so far out is because if someone does need to back away from the process,

51
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,930
you're not finding yourself in a pinch to still complete the application materials on time.

52
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,380
Next, we think about how should I ask? And in the slide after this,

53
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,610
we are going to have a little bit of an email template to be able to ask the recommenders.

54
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:32,110
But first, we want to think about, do you have a solid foundation for the person that is going to be asking the letter of recommendation?

55
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,790
It's really tough to ask for these documents without that built relationship beforehand.

56
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:43,270
So this is something that happens months, maybe even years in advance of getting the letter. And when possible,

57
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,660
and I know this is fairly difficult right now in our pandemic reality,

58
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,290
we want to start with an in-person conversation. That could include attending office hours, checking in after class,

59
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:00,280
or maybe even meeting up in the cafeteria for a quick cup of coffee. In Zoom life that can look very similar,

60
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,710
such as attending office hours, hanging out after class, but probably not the cup of coffee.

61
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:12,070
The reason that we recommend starting with an in-person conversation is because it's much more dynamic than writing an email.

62
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,930
And it's also much harder to say no to an in-person, you're like, "hello, this is my face,

63
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,110
remember, you like me. Please help me."

64
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,620
And then after we've done the initial survey and feeling out of the situation, would they be willing to write one?

65
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:37,460
Then we follow up with an email request to have all of the documentation and details that the recommender could need to move forward.

66
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,950
As promised, this is a quick email outline that you could use when asking for a letter of recommendation.

67
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:50,510
Remember, we always start with an in-person conversation or a back and forth, if we can, before we send this email.

68
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,270
We do want to address it fairly formally, unless you have a different type of relationship with the recommender.

69
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,330
The first paragraph is going to remind them how you know each other and the relationship that you have.

70
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,020
This is particularly important if you're writing to a faculty member who hasn't had you in class for quite some time,

71
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,540
or if you have since left the position that you're asking for a recommendation from.

72
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,490
So we remind them a little bit about who we are and the connection that we have.

73
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,230
In the second paragraph, we're going to make the "ask" and have something specific that the writer could focus on.

74
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:32,720
This includes, could you talk about my teamwork abilities or my ability to deliver successful research results?

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,230
This gives the reader something to focus on, but should be broad enough that they can say, yes, I can talk to that with a number of different details,

76
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:47,300
because we do want to provide some creative ability for the writer to choose what they think is most important.

77
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,720
Finally,

78
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:55,700
we're going to include some details and maybe some attachments to provide additional information to provide that great letter of recommendation.

79
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:02,210
And then here's the tricky part, is that we also might offer to write it for them or to provide additional details or assistance.

80
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:08,630
We'll talk about that a little bit later on. But just wanted to put it out there. In all, this email

81
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,850
should be no more than 200 words, probably closer to 100 words in total.

82
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:19,610
Remember, our writers are very busy, and we want to make sure that we're giving them enough information to be able to say yes,

83
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,880
but not putting too much tax on their time because they're already going to be

84
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,580
spending a fair amount of time creating and drafting this letter of recommendation. So a little bit more about the timeline.

85
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,430
We want to make sure that first, we're starting with the full month in order to create a deadline.

86
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,800
About two weeks out,

87
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:46,120
you're going to follow up with an additional reminder and see if they're looking for any additional information or support for writing the letter.

88
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:52,210
This is also, if you haven't heard back from your recommender, when you want to start thinking about a backup or an emergency plan.

89
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:58,150
Two weeks is going to be a tough turnaround, but it's still possible to do if you need to do so in a pinch,

90
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,950
if you still haven't heard from your recommenders or had confirmation that they've submitted a week out,

91
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,750
it's completely appropriate to do a gentle nudge-nudge, be it email or in person,

92
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,410
to make sure that the individual is completing their materials on time.

93
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,690
At that point in time, it's also going to be important that you start to initiate your emergency plan,

94
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:24,280
reaching out to the contacts that can do you a little favor and get it turned in on time, even though there's a quick turnaround. Two days out,

95
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,100
if you still haven't heard from the individual, you want to try to follow up in as real time as possible.

96
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,660
So making a phone call, having a Zoom chat, and then making sure to circle back

97
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:41,210
also with the emergency plan. Two days is definitely enough time to write a document, but it is going to be a pretty quick turnaround,

98
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:47,010
and we want to make sure that we're still getting things submitted on time. With things being submitted on time,

99
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,150
this is our pro tip, on this slide, is that most students will set an internal

100
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,050
deadline for both themselves and their recommenders to make sure that there's

101
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,090
a little bit of wiggle room in between when you are planning on submitting

102
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,190
your materials and when the documents are actually required to be completed.

103
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,090
That gives us space for this just-in-case emergency plan, but also gives us room for some technology challenges,

104
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:18,270
or if, as we've seen in the past, maybe the system goes down and you can't turn things in for a couple days.

105
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:27,290
We want to make sure that we're not relying on the very last second submissions to get everything in.

106
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,880
So what should you prepare for your referrer? We want to think about, still, timeline and making sure that we're giving the person

107
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:43,100
who is writing our letter of recommendation as much information as possible. This includes a written summary of the position or job responsibilities.

108
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:52,130
Most of the time, this will look like a copy of the job responsibilities or descriptions and or a summary of the program that you're applying for. Here,

109
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,990
you'll want to make sure to do some legwork and not just send your recommender a ton of information.

110
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,790
You may want to highlight the most interesting parts or talk about why this job is a great fit for you

111
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:09,290
in an additional piece of information. With that, you'll have your summary of qualifications.

112
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,790
This is for you to think about, like your resume, your cover letter,

113
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,030
a personal statement that you might be turning in to show the ways that you've

114
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,680
intentionally thought about your skills and qualifications for the position. Here,

115
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,010
just like any position application,

116
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:33,260
you want to make sure that you're drawing a connection between your application documents and those program expectations or position descriptions.

117
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,610
The way that you make the connection between your past skills and experience is completely within

118
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:42,440
your control, and will help boost your application success if you're able to draw the

119
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:48,030
direct connections between your skills and qualifications and what the reader is looking for.

120
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:54,390
You'll also want to make sure to provide your recommender with an overview of the submission process and deadline.

121
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:01,440
This can include if you know about if it's just a letter or if it's a form, sometimes letters of recommendation

122
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,180
also include a summative, like click a bunch of boxes right in the top 10%, top 5% of your career.

123
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,460
It could also include specific prompts that the recommender needs to be able to fill out.

124
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,190
Sometimes these can be quite intensive, and so we want to make sure that we're giving the recommender as much information as

125
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,320
possible to be able to complete things on time, within their own timeframe as well.

126
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,540
You should also, in the information provided, include a way to contact you with questions and a preferred method for that.

127
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:40,260
And of course, a big giant thank you, because this is something that is going to definitely help you stand out in the application process

128
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:47,520
and the individual is giving you the gift of their time and energy to be able to complete this.

129
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,320
Finally, as promised, we are returning to the "should I be able to write my own?"

130
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,150
Some writers will definitely ask the applicants to write their own letter of recommendation.

131
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,900
This is its own practice and challenge, but is definitely acceptable,

132
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:08,470
and something that we will talk about later on in the next presentation about some things that helped make a letter really stand out from the crowd.
