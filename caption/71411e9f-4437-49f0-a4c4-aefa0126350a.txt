1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:12,710
Every time I thought I was going to think I could go in and get done with that thing again.

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,370
You want to throw away? Yeah. I mean, if you.

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,400
Right. So I really think to be over 35 and 34.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:31,110
Yeah. The fact that we can return him.

5
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,330
Oh, really?

6
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,160
Question. Can you do that? Yes.

7
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:58,450
I mean, even if, like, really want to move into Acadia.

8
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:12,630
Yes. That is that I was going to study their size and shape their details.

9
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:21,309
Their final exams are inside of the guy.

10
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,560
It's like riding on a one wheel premature. Yes. That's like 20, 32.

11
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,030
That's like the future. In the future, yeah. I don't matter at all.

12
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,930
Thousands of things. You know how much more?

13
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,370
Four for the one way.

14
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,790
I don't want to do that. You guys.

15
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:52,180
Look, there's a 5000 at all, like, orange dot explosion where they're like, an acronym for electric.

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,730
Oh, you see a mouthful?

17
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,590
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the people in New York.

18
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,830
You just like. Like they're like. Oh, she's pretty dangerous, though.

19
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,720
Yeah, but no, they definitely.

20
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:21,380
I mean, that was all right down here in New Zealand.

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,090
One, they have the way. They're different. It's like, oh, they were sweet Thursday nights.

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,110
Yeah, no doubt. Yeah. Not too busy.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,870
Like, I would like to go to sleep, but they were like, cover the bees.

24
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:52,320
I was like, Yeah, we went for the first time and I was swimming and there was a long, like six foot thing in the water.

25
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,890
It was like six feet. Always stuck with that. Yeah, right.

26
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,070
It just has been with single person.

27
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,790
Oh, yes. Very, very big seals.

28
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,850
And those are things that they like fight with each other.

29
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,920
Yeah, they think so. And they're really some things that you should you should be scared.

30
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:32,740
The first thing they were is one of the things where he said, no, this is all right.

31
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,990
Hey, hey. All right.

32
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,810
So thanks, everyone, for making it this far on Friday.

33
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:53,000
Got a little something to eat or that? Let's do some housekeeping stuff first because next week is, well, that'll be different class.

34
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,830
And next week is our first group who is going to my lab to do mouth necropsy.

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,500
So in this class, you know, we talked about our study design, we talked about designing our protocol.

36
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,160
Now we're going to pretend that the animals have been vaccinated and challenged and now we're at the study endpoint.

37
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,870
So we're going to collect tissues from the animals. So knowing that this is a study, this is a course result from previous data,

38
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,889
one thing you'll notice next week is that the rats that we're using have magically changed into mice because it's easier to get poll mice call rats.

39
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,930
So you're just going to have to ignore that the rodents, same general principles apply.

40
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,379
So we will be necropsy and cull mice next week.

41
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,320
Usually these animals are from our breeding colony or they're from the transgenic cau like animals that don't have the of interest.

42
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,180
So these are animals that are going to be euthanized for any fur in any course.

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,700
So we're going to get some educational value out of using them for our class. So we'll have mice for necropsy.

44
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,860
This is going to take place in our our small animal necropsy lab up at my core on our campus.

45
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,799
So we'll just review kind of how to get there. Today to focus for today.

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm going to explain. I'm going to do that. Finally, that study writing module to explain specifically what I need to see in your papers,

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,720
because we're going to have to start constructing the methods. And then I'll briefly show you a little bit of the necropsy PowerPoint.

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,650
So before next week, as far as things that you'll have to do, I mean, this is the way to do it.

49
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,380
Two things that are going to have to do if you have not already done so.

50
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,259
We need to review the PowerPoint, the lab safety module PowerPoint that's on our modules.

51
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,890
And there's a quiz. It's like a non graded practice.

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,640
Well, it doesn't count towards your final grade for the class. You just have to do it.

53
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:51,360
You have to do that before the lab. So like I think I don't know if I would tell you.

54
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,999
I know you took us anywhere else. Taken it so far. Didn't open for me until today.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,510
I at 430. Oh, no. Okay. Sorry.

56
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,149
It's not supposed to happen. All right, well, if anyone has difficulty accessing it, accessing it, please let me know.

57
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:12,590
Because part of the, like, occupational safety requirement for this class is that I give you safety information specific to our lab.

58
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,500
So just talked about general safety stuff and it talks specifically to our lab, like where is the fire exit, all that kind of stuff.

59
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,370
Do you have to do that before lab or you won't be able to take your lab? Okay.

60
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,250
So if you're in group one, you have to do that before next Friday. If you're in the next group, you have an additional week.

61
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,530
Just make sure you get that done. So that is assignment one.

62
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,670
And then the other assignment, you're going to go over the two PowerPoint or go over the two PowerPoints.

63
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,580
I'll show you where those are, the necropsy guidelines, our mouth necropsy guidelines and the tissue trimming guidelines.

64
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,280
So we'll do a little bit of in class today. I'm not going to go through every single slide because you're certainly capable of doing that yourselves.

65
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,880
But that will help you benefit best from the lab itself.

66
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,960
The structure of the lab. Like I said, we obtained coal mines.

67
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,690
When you get there, we kind of show you where our little site is for PPE.

68
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:12,959
We get everyone gussied up in their PPE, then we show you the mouse euthanasia station.

69
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,260
One of my technicians will be helping us in explaining about mouse euthanasia.

70
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,370
The mice will be euthanized. I will do a demonstration necropsy,

71
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,450
but in order I'm going to do that kind of fast because I want you guys to have plenty of time to kind of work on your own tissue collection.

72
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,470
So you'll be much better prepared if you read that necropsy guideline thing before.

73
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,850
Yeah, well, we re doing like GOP guidelines or so. Yeah.

74
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:42,130
Yeah. So I'm in academia, but the university itself doesn't support GOP because, um,

75
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:51,180
so GOP structure has a built in quality assurance, so it's a much more structured setting.

76
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,250
So we are following sort of standardized toxicology, necropsies.

77
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,340
So it has a lot of similarities to what you would be doing.

78
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,010
Like in a S.R.O., we don't really have the recording aspects of GOP.

79
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,790
Like if I'm doing a GOP necropsy, I usually have an exception system.

80
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,779
Start marking everything, you know, in a defined record system.

81
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,500
As I go when I'm marking deviations, it's just a much more complex thing.

82
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,230
So technically speaking, it's not DLP, but technique wise it's very reflective of that.

83
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:28,650
But it's like if we were actually doing a real vaccine study, yes, we would be doing that, right.

84
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,040
It depends what stage we are in the process. So we said that ours is an efficacy and maybe an early stage toxicity.

85
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,610
So we could do this non GAAP.

86
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,420
Oh, okay. In order to apply for an R&D application,

87
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:49,070
you need to have a defined safety study where the main purpose is toxicology and that would be have to be done GAAP.

88
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:56,700
So if we were in a drug company, even within a drug company, they will sometimes run studies in a non DLP fashion, usually in the discovery arm,

89
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,420
like where you're kind of searching for good B compounds and optimizing them

90
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,140
before you get to the stage where you're establishing the regulatory safety.

91
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:15,630
So even in a if we were a zero by design, this would probably be a non JLP study to be followed up by a GOP state before this study.

92
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:24,270
Does that make sense? Okay. All right. So next week we'll get there, put on APB, we go to the lab, talk about euthanasia.

93
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,540
Well, I'll do a quick demo of necropsy, then you'll collect your tissues.

94
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,710
And then the other thing, we'll have some tissues out so you can understand tissue trimming.

95
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,780
And I'll explain what I mean by that today. That's actually after necropsy.

96
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,830
You have to fix the tissues for a period of time and then they need to be trimmed into a form small enough to go into a histology cassette,

97
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,000
to be made into glass, slides down through that tissue.

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,690
Trimming is kind of an important part even for you in academic science,

99
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,790
because very often if you're running an animal study, you get to the end of study, you collect your tissues.

100
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:03,480
Often you're submitting to an outside histology that, you know, these are the livers, these are the kidneys from my mice.

101
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:10,860
So you're submitting them tissues and fixative, how you collect that tissue and how a lot of times people will submit it in their own cassettes.

102
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,569
How you trim that tissue in large part dictates the quality of the slide.

103
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,020
You'll get to the yes, you really have to understand that part and we'll be able to practice that.

104
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:28,530
We're also next week we'll kind of tour through our histology lab, which also is our lab that has our clinical pathology facility.

105
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,300
So we have our hematology instruments and our clinical chemistry instruments that we talked about last week.

106
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,310
So I'll show you those. We'll show you some stuff on a micro toms. We'll be able to kind of see that process.

107
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,910
Okay. So that is next week starting for group one and then Group two will follow on the 14th.

108
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,710
So those of you in group two, you have no class next week, okay.

109
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:57,930
And those of you. Yeah, that makes sense. And those of you in group one, you have class next week and then you'll miss the 14th.

110
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,240
Does that make sense? A lot of those folks are going to associate 14th anyway, so we tried to work it out that way.

111
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,410
There are no what group they're in. It's under people.

112
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,070
See how you're distributed. Okay, think, think, think.

113
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,320
Okay. So just further logistic stuff. I did change one thing.

114
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,570
I will reiterate this. I have sort of written in the study, in the study report presentation as well.

115
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,810
I was trying to think about logistics of this. We're starting to get into the part of the semester where everything starts piling up.

116
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,880
Okay, so next week you're all on 616? Yeah, yeah.

117
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,200
Next week on the seventh you get your 616 exam,

118
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:46,110
which you have open book and that one is not due until that Monday which is the 17th like we talked about this morning.

119
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,070
I know. And 30 is coming up. Things are all confusing.

120
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,420
So what I decided to do, essentially, I recommend not starting until after you do the necropsy, after the.

121
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,610
Makes sense there. But essentially at any time after today, you can start writing your methods, section,

122
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,980
draft or even if you want to sort of flush it out to have all the information to write your method

123
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:14,629
section draft because of the 6060 exam and Sochi and all that confusion are going to take both methods.

124
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,260
Section drafts do for both groups the same day.

125
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:25,520
Okay, so that's October 21st. So next two weeks are our necropsy labs.

126
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,300
Now things do you just show up? You do your necropsy lab, everything's cool.

127
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,240
The methods section. So the thing that you're going to turn into me, that's your method section and I'm going to review for you.

128
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,840
Right? That comment is not due until the next time we meet here.

129
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,350
Okay. So we're going to skip two weeks right up and at CRC and then the next time you meet here at the start of class,

130
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:52,760
that will be do I rise is progress turn and electronically and then I'll get your method gave you comments back on that.

131
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,840
Okay so I know you know if you're waiting till after the necropsy that that kind of shortens things a bit for those of you at the second group,

132
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,350
but you can certainly started earlier kind of pull the skeleton together.

133
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,390
But you know, balancing all the factors, I think that's going to work out best logistically.

134
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,750
Okay. And you certainly are free to turn that in earlier, if you can put it into your schedule earlier.

135
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:23,360
Yeah. So that's the basic idea of it then.

136
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,980
This is. All right.

137
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:36,180
So next week we're going to be in C, r, c like this a little bit.

138
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,350
Okay. So and CRC best way to get there.

139
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:52,740
I mean you can certainly drive it there sort of up north, you know, the engineering campus, the best bus route to get there is northeast shuttle.

140
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,350
So if you go on to our plus site and click on that will take you to the actual bus schedule.

141
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:09,040
It comes every 15 minutes during the day. I think probably the best route or the best stop is at Mott, so I can't figure out which way we're oriented.

142
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,899
But, you know, across from us, I think that's East Medical Center Drive coming up between the two buildings.

143
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,340
There's a bus station near, but there's also one at the cardiovascular center.

144
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,350
The Zena picture thing by the hospitals is closed right now because they're building that big new structure.

145
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,370
So probably Cardiovascular Center or Mott or whatever works for you and then that's great.

146
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:37,360
You want to take a nice little trip all the way up through the engineering campus and the bus stops just south of our building.

147
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,580
We are on Building 36. Okay.

148
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,670
So these are the parking lots that are south of our campus research center.

149
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,320
These are some additional parking. Lots of the engineering campus is down south of here.

150
00:14:52,650 --> 00:15:00,840
Building 36 is the southernmost building on the North Campus and CRC complex and the bus stop is right outside our door.

151
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,240
So that door is controlled by a card reader. But I'm going to have one of my techs out there.

152
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,780
I'll send you an eye contact information so you know you're late or something and need to get let in.

153
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:19,080
There's also kind of a card reader entrance up there, but the easiest thing is just go in the door directly behind the bus stop.

154
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:27,209
Okay. So northeast shuttle, if you're driving up there, this red thing, the blue parking lot face of the building, this is visitor parking.

155
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,370
It's metered. So if you're driving in the park, there is a bike rack up there if you're so inclined.

156
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,870
And then there's yellow and orange parking lots here. But the bus is pretty straightforward.

157
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,860
One note we can provide, you can leave to go back.

158
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,250
So Northeast shuttle route kind of continues on and travels up by like a Dominos Farms area.

159
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:53,040
So to go back, it's actually quicker if you take that express, you see it here.

160
00:15:53,430 --> 00:16:00,030
But basically if you hike across or a parking lot the way back, there's another parking lot down here kind of between the engineering campus.

161
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,110
That's quicker because the Met Express just kind of comes up here and goes back.

162
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,170
The Northeast shuttle continues on. So if you want like a 20 minute side ride, you can take the northeast shuttle.

163
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:15,060
But that express, which doesn't come all the way up here, it comes here is actually a bit quicker.

164
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:20,930
All right. Yes. Yeah. Also, when you if you get dropped off at that Hayward Hubbard.

165
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,610
Yeah. Where you're talking about Northwood Express, Northwood, it takes you up and takes you back to North Central Campus as well.

166
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,769
Okay. Yeah. And that one I think is also pretty frequent, right? Yeah.

167
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:37,140
And I think if you go through Building 32, it's okay here you can just enter for.

168
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:44,910
Yeah. And then go around to building 36 because 32 you don't have to go through the card reader just have to.

169
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,540
But I think to get if you go downstairs from 32,

170
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:55,620
well actually that way it's because you're in the basement and a little actually that way you can because like they can't block your exit out.

171
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:01,230
So if you're it's a little more confusing if you go in this southern door, you're right at my lab.

172
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,990
If you're familiar with the complex, you actually can walk all the way up here, go here and go downstairs to 36.

173
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,600
You'll be able to go this way. You can't go back that way because on the ground floor, it's like card reader control.

174
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,510
They will never block the exit route because fire hazard.

175
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:24,030
But but for I mean if you're not familiar with the complex, the easiest thing is probably just going right in this door or at that door.

176
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:33,170
All right. I know that there is it's a bit time constrained, you know, for people who have the class in between, feel free.

177
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,900
So I would suggest, you know, just kind of plan ahead, bring some food, you know, the busses or whatever you need to do.

178
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:44,190
We usually have for this lab some snacks and things out in our kind of kitchen area.

179
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,620
And, you know, if at any point you feel like talk about safety right up there,

180
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,570
but obviously if you need to step out for a minute, just get some refreshment. I know it's a long day.

181
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,170
I don't want anyone to collapse in the middle of lap. All right.

182
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,829
So is everyone fairly clear? I know it's confusing. It will all become clear.

183
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,700
All happen when we get there. That's what we're doing next week.

184
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,850
All right, so let's do this first, I think.

185
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:22,270
Okay. So tough path reporting. So this is kind of an outline in general, but also what I want you to do for your reports.

186
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,560
So we think about top path reporting in general. There are two main types of reports.

187
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,800
There's a very controlled industry based, a regulatory report.

188
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:41,049
So that would be the kind of things you would write in a JLP setting, like you work for pharma or contract research organization for pathology.

189
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:46,480
The pathology report in that setting is only one component of a larger toxicology report.

190
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,450
Okay. So myself as the pathologist, I would be running one component of that that would be incorporated into a

191
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,130
larger toxicology report that also would have things like pharmacokinetic data,

192
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,690
pharmacodynamic data and other aspects of toxicology.

193
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,450
And that's the type of report that would support an investigational new drug application or a medical

194
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:14,530
device or chemical registration application as opposed to tox path reporting in experimental biology,

195
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,840
either in a discovery phase of industry development or in academia.

196
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,410
The differences here are that it tends to be a wider audience.

197
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,190
So you have a little bit of a different purpose to the reporting. You're either trying to answer, you know,

198
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:37,690
a hypothesis driven question or trying to get a little bit more at the mechanism rather than just is something safe and effective in industry,

199
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,690
these reports may remain internal.

200
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:47,829
If I'm doing something as part of a safety investigation, I would have to provide that as part of the investigational new drug application.

201
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,450
But this might be sort of early phase internal documents in that setting.

202
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,560
And again, pathology data is one component of the study report.

203
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,050
So in most cases, there's other components to it.

204
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:07,150
So the purpose of these, like I said, is a little bit earlier, these may support an academic hypothesis or inform a future research direction.

205
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,060
But that said, there are some commonalities to the both of these types of reports.

206
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,300
Both of them are typically written in a standard scientific format known as the RAD structure,

207
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,110
which is most likely, even if you didn't know it by name, are familiar with.

208
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,929
So this is a structure that was originally proposed in the early seventies by the

209
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:34,240
American National Standards Institute as a defined format for scientific writing.

210
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:43,150
And essentially the inference stands for the fact that this type of report has an introduction, a materials, a results and a discussion section.

211
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,760
So your basic scientific report,

212
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:53,140
which obviously differs a little bit in the content based on field and in the order in which we put things, but that's the basics to it.

213
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:59,829
So essentially it sets a report, obviously, of a title to the paper in both journal writing,

214
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,340
you have an abstract, and even in the reports that are the DLP setting,

215
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,680
they're sort of a summary that has the function of an abstract, which is kind of a short summary of the entire thing.

216
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,309
You'll have an introduction section. The purpose of the introduction is why did you do the study?

217
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:22,630
What are you doing and why did you do it? So when we write our introduction, we want to identify what is the study objective and why is it important.

218
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:31,360
So I have to have a clear idea of that from your introduction. The materials and methods are obviously the how the results you've set the stage for,

219
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,410
what I'm trying to do and why it's important the results tell the answer.

220
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,059
What did I find? And you're in the results.

221
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:43,750
You're trying to build the case to your conclusion, and then your discussion is placing those results in a larger context.

222
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,620
So pose the question. Tell me how you did it.

223
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,880
Answer the question and provide context to the answer.

224
00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:01,330
So in the discussion at the end of the paper, all of this should lead up to the conclusion, which again is a bit of a reiteration of the results.

225
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:07,900
But it's your it's what you leave your reader with at the end. And the important thing here is that it clearly addresses your study objective.

226
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,120
Like if I read the introduction and then I go to the end, I should have answered the question that I posed.

227
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,650
And then in your abstract, which is the short version.

228
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,600
So maybe I don't have time. I just read that the abstract is not a suspense novel.

229
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,650
You're like, We won't answer this question, the obstruction of the summary of all the information.

230
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,670
So I should know what was the question very briefly, how did I do it? What was the answer?

231
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:38,210
So that's all the basic information. I didn't know what your study is about in the context of regulatory science.

232
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,970
Like I said, investigational drug applications. We talked about this before.

233
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,380
In order for clinical trials to take place, there has to be an R&D in effect.

234
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,050
And the supporting data for an R&D includes all the preclinical animal studies.

235
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,530
The way this usually works, you submit your R&D, which has all your summary work and the preclinical animal data,

236
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,600
and then once that gets submitted to the FDA, the clinical trial can occur 30 days after the receipt of that.

237
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,540
And by the FDA. So the FDA essentially you have this kind of a unique structure, but the FDA has a timeline.

238
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,170
To read all your information and say, well, well,

239
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,220
I don't believe that this is going to be safe and put a hold on your clinical trial so that to try to move things through.

240
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,810
But there is an opportunity to say this is not effective.

241
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:37,519
Once all the clinical data. So like once you get your human study data back, you take the preclinical work for the idea plus the clinical work,

242
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:47,870
and that forms the skeleton of a new drug application, which is the final data packet that gets approved for the FDA for marketing of a drug.

243
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,620
Okay. So the idea is the preclinical work summary, it says, okay,

244
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,740
going to human and the FDA has all the work and that's where they say yay or nay as far as approving a drug.

245
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,280
These are very defined application has a very defined format.

246
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,820
The content and the format are specified in federal law.

247
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,420
So you might hear about things being 21 CFR compliant.

248
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:18,490
Right. So that usually refers that refers to the section in federal law that describes the requirements for this type of reporting.

249
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:27,530
And now they're actually submitted electronically. So you might hear reference to the common technical document, which has certain components.

250
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,580
So this is part of an R&D application. The the document name is the common technical document.

251
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,550
And the things that I've circled here are the animal components in that.

252
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:50,149
Okay. So animal data, the summary of your animal study is part of an M.D. So this is just you don't need to know the details of these,

253
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:58,310
but this is just a template explaining the different components of an idea and the parts that involve animal studies.

254
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:07,520
But even within that regulatory structure, it has the same basic in red design.

255
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,060
So this is in a regulatory report or a GLP report.

256
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:18,630
There's all these tend to be huge very long because all the raw data is at the end, but essentially they have a regulatory component at the front.

257
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:26,210
So that title has a signature page. So everyone has to kind of sign off that things were completed in a regulatory compliant way.

258
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:35,270
There's a quality assurance statement describing GAAP compliance and then a summary which kind of takes place at the abstract, right?

259
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,040
So this is equivalent to obstructive it in a literature report from academic science.

260
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,030
And then it has all the same components that we just talked about with the infrastructure.

261
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:54,110
So even though these are big, long reports with lots of summary tables in raw data, the basic design of it is the same for this class,

262
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,169
though we're not going to write, you know, we don't have all the information to do that.

263
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:03,620
We're going to use essentially an experimental toxicology format, just like you would in the primary scientific literature.

264
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,910
And I just highlighted the parts of a regulatory report that are that are similar.

265
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,219
So here's our study.

266
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,030
Again, our mock study is Vaccine X, which eventually hopefully you will replace that with the actual compound name when we do our review.

267
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,880
Don't forget that I did have somebody do that once.

268
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:28,820
So this is an efficacy and toxicity experimental study of an inactivated whole virus, experimental vaccine.

269
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,830
And what's going to be important in your introduction is to state the study objective.

270
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,279
We actually have two objectives here. We're looking at efficacy.

271
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,890
Is there evidence for efficacy in preventing or a mere ameliorating virus associated disease?

272
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,350
And is there evidence of adverse effects? Okay.

273
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,260
So that's kind of the big picture. Here is our report requirements.

274
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,339
So that same in red structure kind of highlighted them there.

275
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,320
So this is a rough outline of what my expectation is for the report.

276
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:08,780
I have some rough page guidelines here. I'm not you know, I'm not grading by page.

277
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:16,940
So if you get all the information in in two pages and someone else doesn't have three or four, that by itself shouldn't affect your grade.

278
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:23,239
I'm looking for the information in the correct order and with the correct complete and with the completeness.

279
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,420
This is here as a guideline for you just as you go forward.

280
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:33,140
I don't need 20 pages in each section in order to fulfill the requirements of the course, but it's just a rough guideline.

281
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,950
So these are the things we're going to be addressing at the end of your report.

282
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,920
I'm going to ask also that we put some figures in table. Some of these will be common when we go over the data.

283
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,740
You'll see I'll be providing you with some tables or providing you with some figures because we're all reporting the same study.

284
00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:01,070
But those will be in your report as well. And then for the references, we are going to follow the toxicological pathology journal guidelines.

285
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,500
So once we close out of this presentation, I'll again show you where those are in the modules.

286
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:13,340
But there is instructions for authors under the background resources material for the journal Toxicology Pathology.

287
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:23,280
That's the format that we'll use for references. And there is also in your module an example, just a vaccine study from the literature.

288
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,750
You know, our look is going to look a little bit different for different study, but that just gives you an example of kind of the style of report.

289
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:38,639
Okay. One thing I wanted to mention for the discussion in an industry report, you know,

290
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,040
for an idea application, those reports are always very context limited.

291
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,090
So it's really limited to the study context speculation is not desirable.

292
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:53,309
So a lot of times there's not a lot of mechanistic information in an industry based report.

293
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:59,190
You're just answering the question, you know, was this drug well tolerated in the context?

294
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,510
What's the evidence that are supporting tolerability? What is the evidence supporting efficacy?

295
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,600
Academic reports dependent on your study objective have a much broader potential context.

296
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,180
And a lot of times in the discussion, you're trying to point the direction to future research.

297
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,780
So the discussion of an academic report is a little bit wider.

298
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,930
So even though it's a little bit wider, you still want to tie it to the study purpose and make sure it's well supported.

299
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,360
You're not going to go off on a wild tangent that's not supported,

300
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,520
but you could be a little bit more speculative in the discussion, and we'll address that shortly.

301
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:40,079
When you're writing your methods, it's important to remember when we talked about the arrived guidelines,

302
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,780
which were the guidelines for animal study reporting,

303
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,660
and we talked about certain aspects of the methods that should be present so that people can assess,

304
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,589
you know, the validity of your study, how well-designed it was.

305
00:29:52,590 --> 00:30:01,260
You have all the information as the reader necessary to understand whether the study was conducted in such a way that you can believe the results.

306
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,810
This is a reminder side of that. This is our overview of paper deadlines.

307
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,950
So there are some alterations here from the original syllabus that we just talked about.

308
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,050
So one is that all groups, the methods section will be due October 21st, right?

309
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:24,270
So we'll skip next week and the following week. That's our lab session that everyone's methods are due October 21st.

310
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:32,549
Then we're going to continue our analysis of the data. All the results except for the microscopy will be due the 11th.

311
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,810
That's the same as the original syllabus and that's on the of our campus.

312
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:44,160
So as well the histology results will be due the 18th, which is our last sort of regular class day.

313
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,200
Then at that point you'll have all the information you need to complete your papers.

314
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:57,150
The week after that is Thanksgiving. So essentially you'll have a two week period of time to finish up your papers.

315
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay. You don't need to turn in interim drafts of your introduction and discussion.

316
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,650
If you have that early and I'll give you a deadline as we get closer, I'm happy to comment on those.

317
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:13,380
But at that point, the main deadline is the second, which is when your final paper is due.

318
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,970
So you have that two week period through Thanksgiving to write final thing, right?

319
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,470
All sections of groups will be due on the second.

320
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:28,710
Here's a little bit of a change. This is also the day of the final quiz, which is unfortunate.

321
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:38,010
But when I think about what's happening with 616 and everything else around there, that's actually the best way to structure it to avoid complicating.

322
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,299
616 So the final papers do that day.

323
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,690
At that point, you'll have had feedback, you know, on your methods and your results.

324
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,990
If you want your interim comments in your draft discussion, that's fine.

325
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,120
That'll be due that day. The class. Prior to this, I pass out a very detailed study guide.

326
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:01,260
The quiz in this class is pretty straightforward. It's like I tell you, essentially the material you need to know is in the study guide.

327
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,530
It's not as kind of potentially concept related or speculative as 616 So it's pretty straightforward.

328
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,350
So even though it's a little unfortunate to have to do the same day, it's really more of a quiz than an exam.

329
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:22,350
Okay. So we will go over the organized study guide to go over, but that will be done and this class is done on the second December,

330
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:27,420
which frees you up for 616, which is a little bit more involved from an exam standpoint.

331
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,980
And 6/16 final exam is December nine. Okay.

332
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:42,870
Well, premature, but the usual format for that is an exam and canvas that you have like an eight hour period to complete.

333
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,630
You might play a little bit with the time depending on other classes,

334
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:50,879
but the advantage to this is that there is no this class won't be here the afternoon of that day.

335
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,140
So be able to just keep going with the exam. It's not going to take 8 hours, believe me.

336
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,159
It's going to be a short like two hour exam.

337
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,700
But you can take it any time during that day. Okay, that makes sense.

338
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:08,730
All right. So I know it's little confusing, but that I think logistically will balance all of the competing priorities better.

339
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,930
Okay. Grading Interim Draft through your methods and results. Pass fail assignments.

340
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,160
Select your methods and results have to get turned in as part of your participation grade.

341
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,360
If you fail to complete, that affects your participation grade only.

342
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,790
It's to your advantage because I give you comments with those interim drafts of the final paper,

343
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,850
though, is graded entirely based on the finished product.

344
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,760
Okay, so I just grade that new. So you could have terrible drafts.

345
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,060
Who cares? It all starts of you with the final thing. The final paper is graded by a rubric.

346
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,290
I have that on our canvass site. It's not automated or delegated.

347
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,800
It's done by me. I get to read all these papers.

348
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,340
It's great fun. And I put comments at that one.

349
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,880
Okay. So final paper graded by rubric. Yes.

350
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,920
When you say has failed, do you mean that like to passively like turn in something that.

351
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:11,299
Correct. Got it. Yes. So, like, sometimes people have had a situation, there's another class and they're just totally swamped.

352
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,130
And essentially they turn to the method section, you know, that has like subject headings and there's maybe little bullet points.

353
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:22,700
It's not fully written. That's fine. You turned in something, you've started thinking about it.

354
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:29,479
It behooves you to have it more completely written. Because I can provide better comments, right?

355
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,930
If you're writing it, if you just give me a skeleton, I'll be like. That's great.

356
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:40,210
Looking forward to the final version. But you know, it's for your benefit to get the feedback.

357
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,750
As long as you're kind of showing me, you're keeping up with the class of turning in something, you pass the assignment.

358
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,670
There's a grading rubric. You know, you can take a look at this yourself.

359
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:55,620
Let me know if there's any questions about it. But that's often good to kind of look at as you're assessing your own work.

360
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,690
Like, how would I assess how well I've done in each category?

361
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,049
Okay. There's the requirements.

362
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,720
Slide again. Same thing I just showed you. So this is kind of breaking it down.

363
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:14,840
An abstract obviously consists of a concise statement of the problem of interest and very importantly, the study objective.

364
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:19,370
Like I should know from reading her abstract, what are you trying? What question are you trying to answer?

365
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:28,070
In general, I recommend that you write this blast because it's kind of the summary of all this, all the data.

366
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,200
So I used to worry about that till the very end. As far as the introduction.

367
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:38,420
There tends to be sort of three components to it. The background is where you describe the problem.

368
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,880
So usually that's something written in the present tense tells me why I should care about the study that you did.

369
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,790
So we're doing a viral vaccine study, so usually it's going to be some description of the viral infection.

370
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,730
So usually present tense virus X affects how many thousand people annually.

371
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,210
It's a big problem because of this, that and the other. And then I'm going to state the study objective.

372
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:08,000
So here are the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy and toxicity of a novel vaccine comprised of blah, blah, blah.

373
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,320
So that's the study objective. So if you had a one word sentence or was the sentence telling somebody what you're doing, that would be it.

374
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,790
And then there's a short overview of the study designed to design you.

375
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,389
So here we we start to fulfill these objectives.

376
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:31,640
We tested these objectives using a rat model animals that were dosed however many times over such and such a time frame.

377
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:38,880
So a short summary, not your methods reiteration, just that I come away from the introduction with that idea of like, why should I care?

378
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:45,560
Here's a big important problem. Here is the objective of this particular study, and here's the general overview of the type of study it is.

379
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,770
Is it a zero study? Is it a cell culture study? What is it?

380
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:55,210
This part is usually past tense. Sometimes people write a little bit differently, but that's it.

381
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,290
Methods. Oops, I see that. Methods.

382
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:11,240
3 to 5 pages in your canvas site where we used to have like the sketchy protocol with all the red writing in it, there's now a partial protocol.

383
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:17,810
So if you look out the campus site, the word document has been replaced by the DHS 717 partial protocol,

384
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,360
which has a summary of all the stuff we talked about when we discussed our protocol.

385
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,550
And it has pretty detailed information. It essentially is a bullet form of your methods section.

386
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,090
So the little thing work in your favor is much of your method section is almost cut and paste from there.

387
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,550
Okay, we're all right. The same methods.

388
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,180
If there are sections that work well for cut and paste or just cut and paste them in, a lot of them are bullets you constructed intercept.

389
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:51,259
It says you don't have to like there's only so many ways you can say that the virus was grown in a cell culture.

390
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,650
So don't worry too much about that. It's more the format of everything.

391
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,950
So you're going to borrow freely from that to write this section.

392
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,639
Okay. It often helps you to use subheadings.

393
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,980
And in the vaccine study that I used as an example, you'll see how there are subheadings like animals.

394
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,580
I don't know how using the virus culture or whatever it is.

395
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:18,130
So these are two subheadings that will. You present in your methods, the things that I put at the top and the information for this.

396
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,590
You know, we talked about this in a broad sense, but I didn't give you much detail.

397
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,190
The detailed information is in that partial protocol document.

398
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,980
Okay. Methods are in past tense describing what you already did.

399
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:38,360
When I talked about protocol, I harped on and on about all the details that you need to provide to write a prospective study protocol.

400
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,190
In general, when you're reading a paper, the methods in a paper are less detailed than that,

401
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,020
but should give sufficient detail to allow a reader to assess the validity.

402
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:54,210
So you think the purpose of a protocol in your lab is to tell yourself or your technicians what to do, right?

403
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,389
It's going to have a lot of detail in methods. I want to give the overview so that people can understand what I did,

404
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:04,670
but I don't have to describe to the same level of detail as if I were explaining to a technician, Here's what I want you to do.

405
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:12,350
So that can sometimes take some time to find that balance. Here is the methods overview for animals to remember.

406
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:18,530
A lot of this stuff is similar to the Orion guidelines. You're going to need to get the species, the strain, the age, the vendor.

407
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:24,199
So there are some still hidden portions in your partial in that protocol.

408
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,399
So it still says rats. Eventually it's going to tell you more specifically what kind of rats.

409
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,800
But I don't want you to just kind of look that up because that's going to be a give away from looking at here.

410
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:39,890
So all this stuff, again, is in that partial protocol, the specific data is in that partial protocol section.

411
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:46,850
Remember, subheadings can really help you. And then for pretty much all academic journal articles,

412
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:51,800
now there is a required section sometimes actually requires you to put this in the front that

413
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,720
talks about what types of regulatory approvals you've got you've the study has obtained.

414
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,590
So again, it's not a gap study, but it has been approved by something.

415
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,790
So maybe entities that approved the study and explain what are the humane endpoint point guidelines we use?

416
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,190
Like what did we put into place to decide when these animals have reached End Point in the study?

417
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:23,570
Okay. So that's an overview of the sections necessary for your methods. And then this is an overview of the study sort of split into the end points.

418
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,580
So we talked about things that we're going to measure during the study so that the IN-VIVO portion

419
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:33,020
thinks we're going to measure efficacy and toxicities and just the effects on the animals.

420
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,860
So you could divide this into we've already measured these things.

421
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,090
This is actually at the end about that endpoint in evaluations.

422
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:49,790
These are the things that we're going to measure. And then these are some assays that we're going to do to assess efficacy.

423
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:59,030
One point here, we talked about T cell active, which is excellent for in terms of our understanding of it in this study,

424
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:05,900
all that was done was virus, quantitation and tissues, the measure of virus and tissue at a B cell assay.

425
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,260
Okay, we don't have a T, I don't have data from a T cell pipeline.

426
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,940
And that's pretty common for an early stage study because we said this is the easy thing to do.

427
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,940
So if we're doing an early stage study, we don't get a good result here. We're not going to invest the time and the expense of t cell assays.

428
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:26,570
So we talked about that. But there's only going to be virus quantitation and an antibody measure.

429
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:36,980
Yeah. Obviously in your study, you're going to want to talk about how the results were statistically analyzed.

430
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,840
For now, I'm going to ask that you just put a placeholder there. We did do the power analysis.

431
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,879
You can put that in. That's the partial methods, but just placeholders for this.

432
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,340
So just write the words, statistics or something because we're going to talk about that later.

433
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,880
But she says, quote, You and I made a go of it.

434
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,410
All right. I thought, all right, so that's your method?

435
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,410
That's the part that's do your introduction, you know?

436
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:13,030
Don't worry about it now. Just different methods part. So for results, I estimated for toxicity.

437
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:20,020
It's for me. I think it's easiest for this study to separate the two aims, the toxicity and the intricacy of discussing results.

438
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,650
You know, you could do it slightly differently, but it's easiest to follow it, easiest to structure that way.

439
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,090
So this is kind of divided into the endpoints that support assessment of toxicity.

440
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,010
So these are some suggestions for headings for the toxicity section.

441
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:42,969
So obviously for toxicity, if animals did survive, that's some evidence of adverse findings.

442
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:48,580
So we're going to we're going to remark upon any early euthanasia always when you read a study,

443
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,150
the number of animals that they say started the studies.

444
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,280
If you started with 100 animals, you have to account for each of those 100 animals, whether some of them died early,

445
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,870
some of them died of unrelated study thing, or if animals made it to the end of the study, the number in has to equal the number out.

446
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:11,980
They can't just randomly disappear. So any early euthanasia where these these unrelated or unrelated or any data

447
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,230
censored for some non study related reason or other purposes during the study,

448
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,770
maybe the animals didn't die or were not euthanized. Were there any clinical findings?

449
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,060
So like were the animals lethargic, anything like that?

450
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,610
And then clinical findings like body weight, the body weights is a good proxy for toxicity was said.

451
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:36,340
So that'll probably be your first figure talking about what the body weights are doing and interpreting that figure.

452
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,370
And then this, I don't know,

453
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:47,170
I have as well I guess because this toxicity at the endpoint we are doing some clinical pathology on the animals that aren't getting challenged.

454
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,660
So this is just safety toxicity of the vaccine.

455
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:59,140
So we have groups that are not going to be challenged and those results will be explained a word about figures.

456
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,030
So it's just some random figure. There's two types of figure headings that you can use when writing.

457
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:08,740
There's kind of a traditional we were just explaining what the figure depicts.

458
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:17,310
So this is some random figure. It says multivariable adjusted odds that's on the y axis of diabetic retinopathy.

459
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,640
Retinopathy according to sleep duration, the time versus the odds.

460
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:28,749
This just tells you what the data shows. But you as the reader then have to interpret right based on what all of these

461
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:34,660
lines are versus kind of a newer style where you do the work for the reader.

462
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,180
This is pretty common in academia.

463
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:46,270
Here it says a total sleep duration of 6 to 8 hours per day was associated with the lowest risk of diabetic retinopathy.

464
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,050
So here the reader can just kind of follow along.

465
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:56,500
You're telling them the conclusion from the figure, this can be very helpful in academic writing because you're building towards your hypothesis.

466
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,810
If it's not supported, you run the risk that someone says, No, it doesn't,

467
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,990
but it can be a more engaging way of writing figure legend than having somebody do it themselves.

468
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,950
Because depending on how engaged they're with your topic, they might just let that wash over them.

469
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,200
Either way is acceptable.

470
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:21,700
I will say that probably in academic writing and academic writing, the trend is more towards this, but either way is acceptable.

471
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,499
This I use a lot because I tend to find that each step kind of supports towards your conclusion.

472
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,670
It makes it easier to up to support your conclusion.

473
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,290
Captions Same kind of thing. So here we have another figure.

474
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:43,330
When you're writing a figure out study, this is talking about arts engagement and its association with longevity.

475
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:51,129
So here I have this diagram and I have to read in the figure legend to know what the solid blue line is, the yellow line and the pink line.

476
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:56,320
This a pretty low figure legend. And depending again on my interest level, I might fall asleep right at the end of that.

477
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,940
In this one, I don't even need to read this. I can look at the figure.

478
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:06,370
It tells me exactly what the lines are and I can almost figure out for myself before I ever read this.

479
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:14,500
So a lot of times this can be a really effective way of just making your figures more interpretable at first glance.

480
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:23,459
So there's some comments there. This is just following through.

481
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,030
So a lot of this, you're just going have to go back through and make sure you have all these categories.

482
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,920
But in addition to the hematology findings, you're also going to be showing organ weights.

483
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,200
Our growth findings and any histological findings related to toxicity.

484
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,170
One thing to keep in mind as you're doing your writing are really effective.

485
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,640
Kind of goes back to basics. Each paragraph has a topic, right?

486
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,640
So in scientific writing, you kind of want to be very dare to be simple and dare to be direct.

487
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,670
So you don't want to build a sister. A suspense novel is often more effective to have your topic centered near the front,

488
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,430
if not the first sentence, and then all the stuff in that paragraph has to support that topic.

489
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:12,930
So one good, especially in the results section, one thing that you can do to kind of make sure you're staying that clear,

490
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,460
read the purpose of your study and then go through and read each topic sentence.

491
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,420
Just the topics, that is all your paragraphs and it should make sense.

492
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,120
So it's easier when you're writing, you know, you tend to kind of break your paragraphs up according to the length,

493
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,790
but it really should be broken up according to topic.

494
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,100
And it should be clear from the beginning of the paragraph what the topic of that paragraph is going to be.

495
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:43,380
So one really easy way to make your scientific writing more effective is that strictly adhere to that one topic per crack per paragraph guideline,

496
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:49,320
and make sure that all the supporting information answers the topic at the front of each paragraph.

497
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:53,520
That seems simple and straightforward, but when you're reading people's writing,

498
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,960
that's one thing that you'll find if you're getting confused, usually because that was the altered or not adhered to.

499
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,750
All right. So then you have your toxicity, then have results for efficacy.

500
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:12,510
So the efficacy portion of our study relates to a challenge.

501
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,640
So once we infected the animals with virus, did we have mortality or clinical findings?

502
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,299
And was that different between the group that just got challenged,

503
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,380
like with the vaccine and the group that got challenged with our experimental vaccine?

504
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,430
Same kind of findings. Any early euthanasia and clinical findings?

505
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:40,860
What are our body rates for those groups and then other findings related to virus titer or to a change in the antibodies?

506
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:46,530
So same guidelines topic one paragraph was topic sentences, simple declarative sentences.

507
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:56,010
Okay, this is just finishing up. So again, you're just going to have to keep going back to this, make sure you have all the aspects.

508
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:04,070
Another important thing in your results section, if there's some sort of have your methods, if there's some sort of thing that happened in the study,

509
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:12,270
like maybe there were individual animals where someone forgot to harvest it or get at necropsy or body weights were not measured for whatever reason.

510
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:19,380
Maybe something happened in the pavilion. Any deviation from the methods of the plan that might affect the results should be mentioned.

511
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,400
It's sometimes this happens. Or if you're showing organ weights at one group, I don't know if someone forgot to harvest the adrenals.

512
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:35,010
The denominator of those results, you know, you looked at 20 adrenals overall and one in one group.

513
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:39,390
You might have only looked at 19 because one adrenal was lost at necropsy or something.

514
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,930
So as long as the results are there and you've indicated what happened, that's fine.

515
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,209
That's legitimate, because I, as the reader, can read your study.

516
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:57,450
And if I if you've lost 50% of the adrenals, the necropsy, I'm going to have more doubt and the validity of your study than if you were more complete.

517
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,540
But you can't just say if that was the case.

518
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,590
You can't say the adrenals were evaluated if that was not true for all the animals.

519
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,080
Okay, so it's not uncommon to have little things,

520
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:12,690
but you can put it out there and then the reader can decide for themselves whether that affects the validity of the results or.

521
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:20,370
And then finally, the discussion 2 to 3 pages. It answers the question that was being asked.

522
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:24,990
So you really want to go back? What was what did I say in the introduction? What was my study objective?

523
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:32,790
Did I answer that question? So if that's not the case, that's really weakens the believability of your paper as a whole.

524
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:39,510
And importantly, you want to justify your answers. So essentially, you're trying to convince me that your conclusion is valid.

525
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:45,150
You have a caveat paragraph. So are there any results that are in conflict with your conclusions?

526
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,980
So there are put on your critical thinking hat and anticipate and address any counterarguments.

527
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:57,300
What's an alternative explanation to this data that someone might be reading a study and thinking, Well, could this be an alternative possibility?

528
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:05,790
And then I as I said in academic science, usually you're doing this paper to kind of support future research.

529
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:10,210
So are there wider implications? Maybe there was evidence of toxicity.

530
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,040
What are the likely mechanisms for that? Like, why might this have happened?

531
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,760
And then that follows into. What would be the likely next step.

532
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,270
So if the study achieved its objectives, how do you build from that?

533
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:28,290
If something unexpected happen happen, what's the likely next step for further exploration?

534
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,470
Okay. References for this exercise.

535
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,730
It's not a literature review, right? Not a review paper.

536
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:45,810
So the references are present to support the data in the paper so it doesn't have to be, you know, huge.

537
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:52,050
The references should support your independent conclusions. So you're putting in the necessary pieces of information.

538
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:59,520
Unpublished sources are generally not acceptable in an academic publication, except in very rare circumstances.

539
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:04,049
So when you are writing the background material,

540
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:10,140
like when we have our big reveal and I talk a little bit more detail about the virus, about the vaccine, we talk about mechanisms.

541
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,440
You can use the information I present in class for each relevant slide or always have a reference.

542
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,830
So you'll have to go.

543
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:25,230
If you want to use that piece of information, you have to go to that reference inside it according to the reference guidelines that I've specified.

544
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:29,190
Don't just write Dr. Bergen's lecture. September 30th.

545
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:34,590
Yes, it has happened. So I'm giving you the references for a reason.

546
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,950
Writing a paper. So make sure you cite them appropriately.

547
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:49,230
There's another version of this class that uses a chemical compound, and I had someone look up and cite the package insert as a reference,

548
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,730
which is interesting, but typically that's not going to be acceptable for the most part.

549
00:52:54,750 --> 00:53:01,890
There are some circumstances like in a clinical trial where that actually would be acceptable, but really you want to go into the primary literature.

550
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:07,350
Okay. Depending on the topic, sometimes you will use a review or a textbook,

551
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:13,109
but a lot of times primary literature in academic science is preferable to review unless you're citing

552
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:19,590
something that's so common knowledge or so accepted that a review or a textbook would be acceptable.

553
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:27,560
Okay, there's the formatting. So that is uploaded on campus under instructions for authors for talkspace.

554
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,520
Here's a couple examples of it.

555
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:37,050
It is a reference style where you can use it in text references that are the theme of the year so you don't have to number them.

556
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:41,570
You know, if you use a reference manager, it's pretty easy to resort to numbering, but if not,

557
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:46,290
it's a pretty small paper that gets annoying because you forget lose track of that.

558
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:53,190
So it's an indexed reference with name and year, and then this is just an example of the citations at the end.

559
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,130
I think the end notes file down there. I mean, so smiley product pages and.

560
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:07,140
No, but you can. And I believe that the adult style download is available on the instructions for authors document if you're so inclined.

561
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:14,910
Okay, so there, there's the methods draft you're assigned. This is that is part of your participation grade but is itself ungraded.

562
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:18,569
We already talked about that. Oops, I forgot to change the slide.

563
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,110
Everybody is due October 21st. Sorry I forgot to change up.

564
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:28,620
Please let me know if there's any questions. The nuts and bolts are should be submitted electronically as a word document.

565
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:35,520
If you've any difficulty with that, let me know. But it should be pretty straightforward double spaced with one inch margin.

566
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:42,090
So space to make comments and stuff. You will receive a track changes version with comments or edits from me.

567
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,800
And then this is your reminder for how to find the information.

568
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:51,720
So there's a study protocol and everything will be on campus.

569
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:57,720
Let me know if you have any difficulty finding everything. Oh yeah.

570
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:05,850
So most of this is pretty straightforward that I've already said advice methods are typically written in past tense,

571
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:10,710
so protocol is telling yourself what you're going to do. Methods are telling the reader what you did do.

572
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,860
Their summaries are not as detailed as the protocol. There's an example vaccine study in our campus site.

573
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,910
The subheadings are helpful and then finally dare to be boring.

574
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:27,690
So it's not a suspense novel, but the most important thing in scientific writing is clarity, right?

575
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,679
So clarity can separate, read this and figure out what we did.

576
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,540
And is it clear to the reader how does this support the final conclusion?

577
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,740
Okay, so that's the methods draft. That is due October 21st.

578
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:47,010
Let me know if you have difficulty finding the information for it or any difficulty related to that.

579
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,910
Okay. Any questions about what is due?

580
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,010
Yes, I have questions about the unblinding.

581
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:01,790
What in the process are we going to talk about? I'm sorry about the what about like with the vaccine, actually.

582
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:05,930
Oh, yeah. I'm like, where's our thing?

583
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:11,310
Safe. I'm finding I'm blinded to the results of it.

584
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:16,050
Sorry. No, no. Okay.

585
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,530
So where is it?

586
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,730
Yeah, November 11th in short term.

587
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:32,990
So I wanted to treat it as if we were doing this real study.

588
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:38,860
So like, if I told you now what the effect, what the viruses, and certainly if I told you what the vaccine is,

589
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:43,270
you could actually go to the literature and look up what the likely result is that we're going to get.

590
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:48,910
So I want it to be that we see the data and then we have to interpret what the results are.

591
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:55,239
So all of our results interpretation is going to happen first because the only question we have to answer is,

592
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:03,520
is there evidence of toxicity and does it is it effective at decreasing the adverse findings of the virus or does it decrease virus titer?

593
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,839
Does it decrease pathology? We can answer all of that without knowing anything beyond that.

594
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:16,540
It's a respiratory virus. But to get the information for your writing then, I mean, depending on how fast we go through this, but so far,

595
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:24,580
the 11th is going to be the day that the big reveal will take place, and that will probably spillover discussion wise into the 18th.

596
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:30,340
But we'll know. We'll know what it is. That exciting day, a red letter day.

597
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,640
All right. I'm going to take a short break to drink some water if anyone needs to take a quick break.

598
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:41,230
I just want to show you some stuff for necropsy so that you're a little bit prepared for that.

599
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:49,730
And that's how we'll finish up. Does anyone anticipate any difficulty?

600
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:56,630
I know the class schedule is very daunting for any difficulty getting an CRC or like on the timing or anything.

601
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,080
All right. Yeah. Yeah, I might be. I'll.

602
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,729
I'll try to get there as fast as I can. Okay. Are you. I have an interview.

603
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,810
And that one. Okay. And then I'll come directly to my brother.

604
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,190
But bring lunch. Yeah. Yeah. I'll bring some food in. Okay.

605
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:17,720
Are you in group one or two? Group one. Okay. But it should work out timing wise.

606
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,560
I'll just catch the past. 110. Okay.

607
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:25,980
These are ready for being at my house if you want.

608
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

609
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:39,020
Yeah. I'm also more than happy to like there because I like both weeks because I'm going to be up at the end.

610
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,610
Okay. I work on the second floor of the house.

611
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,630
Amber is volunteering her personal shuttle services.

612
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,090
But I'm going to go out to the A.C. and own kills themselves.

613
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:57,260
All right. So you talk to your classmates.

614
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:05,210
If anyone runs into an issue, please just let me know. Um, you know, to interrupt so we can make sure or if you're going to be a little bit late,

615
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,870
just let me know so that I know I can leave and check out there or something.

616
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:21,840
That part of the class is always the most nerve wracking for me because there's so many parts of the school just sticks and saying,

617
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,640
I've always like a little bit, Oh my God.

618
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:32,870
But most people actually enjoy that cause they probably the most because they're doing something cool to see, like all the different instruments.

619
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:47,710
Just see how that works. And I love my friend the basement before, but I've never been like in one of the labs.

620
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,860
Who's going to ask? I saw some pretty big cages of dog toys, including dogs.

621
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:05,470
There is no well, there was a group doing what they did with her, doing something.

622
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:10,090
There were beagles that were adopted out last year. Oh, I see, Mr. Chance.

623
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,720
But there were. Those are usually really small.

624
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,329
I remember there was one of them,

625
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:26,080
I think was a dental study where they would remove a tooth and they were put in like dental or sort of dental stem cells or something.

626
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:34,090
And they were in a separate and I don't remember the specifics of it, but there was a dog study I think last year.

627
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:39,250
Those bills were adopted out. Dawson is a very unusual for here at the University of Michigan.

628
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,079
There are like some that also mean less than ten on campus.

629
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,400
But there are some primate studies and some of the primates also gone.

630
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:56,520
And from there is such a large, you know, that's why they read about like, yeah, that was probably three feet by three feet.

631
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:08,110
Yeah. The dogs tend to be housed in like kennel type things and then they have that sort of a group of taproot.

632
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:13,780
If they're adopting that, they have like a socialization or like a building is one of the buildings.

633
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:19,749
They have a little sign up and they kind of run around, run around like in the tech offices,

634
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:23,830
because if they're going to go from a kennel situation living in a house, they have to kind of be familiar with that.

635
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,250
So they have like an actual group of technicians who's in charge of that training program.

636
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:38,080
Yeah. And actually, one of the primates, a lot of the primates are for research, like the bioengineering group,

637
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:47,260
who does neural they have they do neural implants like they do for research where people paralytic illnesses so

638
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:55,240
they record kind of take a video record that erm operates the brain that controls older group and then you know,

639
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:03,879
so like once you know the electrical activity that a person might have goes crazy but I can program that it's going chronically to

640
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:12,490
control your muscle cells are trained to perform visually essentially so they're really smart and they move towards the ground,

641
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:20,290
they play video, they literally learn how to do that. The I think as that there are limits already you know the motor tracings for that.

642
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:27,070
And then at some point they catch the voice of the game.

643
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:32,229
You know what the electrical activity is it just being recorded and going to a

644
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:38,139
robot so that the robot arm is doing what the monkey kind of azure like to see.

645
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:42,160
And it's for developing devices like for people who work like Gehrig's or whatever,

646
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:48,310
paralysis and more refined, you know, like neural net replacements for a moment.

647
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:56,500
That's a good that Neuralink has. But yeah, there's a lot of a lot of there's a lot of different labs that are doing that type of study now.

648
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,310
So yeah, that's in part.

649
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:10,120
Yes. And I don't know what they were expecting.

650
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:18,120
Oh, yeah. I like I avoid the basement as much as possible because the whole thing has become

651
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:24,990
fun to go inside in the reception for about half everywhere for hear about this,

652
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:28,990
like the Microsoft search study, I think.

653
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:37,240
Oh, yeah, yeah. We're like it's like electrode kind of paper, I think a pretty large corporation trip to the back or not,

654
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:45,130
but like fast into the back of a car and then by like affecting the electrical stimulus, you could kind of directors of the car.

655
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:53,229
It's like a remote control. Why are these people?

656
01:03:53,230 --> 01:04:01,180
Are these. I mean, I don't know that this believe me, again, it actually was I don't know,

657
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:08,139
like how practical like the thought that like the copper prices that are hard to implement,

658
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:14,049
that it's like maybe the reason everybody's like we're just for reconnaissance because I mean,

659
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:20,320
how can a copper is really a rescue, but you're not going to make a robot.

660
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:26,390
I mean, it's hard to make a robot that could go like over to rain.

661
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:29,580
Oh, you know, so like like rescue dogs.

662
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:35,440
And the dogs can sometimes go places where people can't and like if they put a camera out to go in certain places.

663
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:39,760
But if you just see something, you just go into the.

664
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:46,140
But that was the possibility, I think is more proof of principle that like you could make the electrical link.

665
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:50,520
But I do remember reading that you're just like, that's, that's,

666
01:04:50,530 --> 01:05:04,720
that's actually a powerful reference point where the results are really cool so that it would go like I think,

667
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:09,470
I think it's like a more and more basically like training because like, you know, people like this,

668
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:16,180
how much can they really are they trained the fish they're gonna take in the trade, the fish food or something to go over a target.

669
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:24,429
And then they founded the check on this moving robot so that the fish swam persistently given direction.

670
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:29,080
And our goal measure, given the water flow, whatever the robot would,

671
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:39,100
that they have to try to pretend like there's the take and it's on this like four wheel drive vehicle and one time it's is like driving down the road.

672
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:52,610
Yeah. I'm like, maybe I have a 13 year old swordfish at home and I wanted to fish are really slightly artificial, intelligent,

673
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:57,189
and I don't know how hard it is because here people recognize different people

674
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:01,770
that my daughter bought but I don't know yet they're surprisingly intelligent for

675
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:08,790
you use yeah I think cerebral goldfish like dual stuff but yeah my the picture

676
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:16,080
that the goldfish is a two very good driving it's like genetically engineered.

677
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:26,800
Yeah. I don't know. It's pretty cool. I wasn't trying to wasn't care for their ability to move out a lot.

678
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:35,040
So you can see a lot of people together and it's a bit more like a human.

679
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:47,570
So I think that I think that this is what is going on and they want to keep it a secret metaphor.

680
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,899
I think this is the connection Miles is run away to.

681
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:58,000
Like if he shakes the fish well enough, the official jump.

682
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,489
Okay. They can think. Yeah, they can hear. Oh, it's nothing you can hear.

683
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:08,410
I don't think he hears it. Right. All right. All right.

684
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:17,019
Let's try to finish up. So I do want to kind of look over this between now and the time that we are in lab.

685
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:22,360
But just to kind of give you some brief sense of what we're going to be doing, this is like an old style.

686
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,629
This is part of our kind of handout that we provide to investigators.

687
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,920
So I haven't had time to update this to the widescreen format, but it's still effective.

688
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:36,640
So that's very rare to do. Mouse necropsy, which is essentially procedure was the same thing really as rat necropsy.

689
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:46,090
This is just kind of an overview of the instruments, which I'll show you next week in the kitchen necropsy.

690
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:52,629
One thing that's important is gentle tissue handling, and that is both in the form of your instruments.

691
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:59,680
The one instrument I often use that is sort of rough tooth forceps here because there's just enough friction to grab the tissue.

692
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:04,150
So smooth forceps, you might think that's like less harsh on tissue,

693
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:09,250
but if you have to keep grabbing at the tissue and it keeps sliding out, that's actually more traumatic to the tissue.

694
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:13,480
That's something that just grabs it one time. So you'll see next week when I do my demo.

695
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:19,300
Ideally, if you're interested in a particular organ, you're going to try to grab the connective tissue adjacent to it.

696
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:23,620
So if I'm trying to grab the spleen, I'm not going to take my forceps, squish it down into the spleen.

697
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:28,120
I'm going to grab the connective tissue adjacent to it. That's easiest to see then to explain.

698
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:32,979
But in general, I use these instruments a lot and I like to use a rat tooth forceps.

699
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,950
So this has like a spike in it and then a receptacle there.

700
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:43,389
You can have a very secure hold there, but obviously you don't want to use that right other the tissue of interest and then there are forceps.

701
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:48,550
Those are very kind of sharp. I actually don't like those a lot, but there are circumstances where you would use those.

702
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:55,900
You'll see all those. That I tend to use one sharp, blunt scissor.

703
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,380
So that's what I use for the outside. It's a tougher scissor.

704
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:03,240
And then I have sharp, sharp scissors, which are more dissecting scissors for finer tissues.

705
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:09,510
And then we we typically use a scalpel blade for certain portions, as you'll see a couple of instruments.

706
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:14,910
So this is kind of standard necropsy for a mouse in general, for any animal.

707
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:22,170
If it's an animal that sort of if its anatomy is such that it can be, it's more kind of compressed front to back.

708
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:27,120
You tend to necropsy that type of animal on its back for large animals or animals

709
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,960
that are kind of more like a horse or something that's more compressed side to side.

710
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:37,170
Those animals are necropsy on their side because as you open things up, you want everything to lie flat so you can see it.

711
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:41,940
So like when I was up at Michigan State, we had this huge, ginormous necropsy table,

712
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:48,270
so like cows and horses and stuff, we would do them on their side. But this is a good general for most of our species.

713
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,440
All right.

714
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:57,420
So in humans, I don't know why you would be, but if you were reading about autopsy in humans, they talk about a y-shaped incision, actually.

715
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:59,160
And this is what we still do in primates.

716
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:05,730
You make a y-shaped incision where there is an incision kind of along the collarbone and then down the middle out of the animal.

717
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:11,879
In my mice, I use an inverted Y. They go all the way up to the chest, and my first step on of it crosses.

718
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:21,120
I make an incision straight down the middle, and then as an inverted Y down each leg, and then I'm going to spread the skin apart.

719
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:25,559
So there is my initial incision, although I don't think I would procure a part.

720
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:31,050
I don't wear it the way I usually do. This is I grab with my forceps and pull up the skin,

721
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:37,830
usually right at the base of the thorax so I can make an initial neck with my scalpel blade or with scissors.

722
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,100
But I'm pulling up so I'm not damaging the tissue underneath,

723
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:48,030
pulling up and then making my neck and then I can insert my scissor blade in the elevated tissue.

724
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:51,900
So on cutting is the skin and not damaging the tissue underneath.

725
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:54,900
I'll show you how to do that. There is an initial decision.

726
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:00,920
And then the other thing that tends to happen here is people I don't know if you're all surgeons,

727
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,989
could be people make a decision and they're trying to necropsy this little thing.

728
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,780
It's necropsy. They're not going to need to suture this close.

729
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:13,530
So you want to open things widely so you don't want the hair and everything to get into the deeper areas of tissue.

730
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:18,750
So once I make that initial decision, you reflect the skin back.

731
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:24,870
And in animals, there's a lot of looseness to their subcutaneous tissue, so it's pretty easy to reflect the skin back.

732
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:29,339
And then usually I affix the skin in some way.

733
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,610
We actually just use pins for this cheap, easy way to do it.

734
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:39,900
And now I get a good view of the body as a whole and even some structures underneath on the underside of the skin.

735
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,620
So what this is pointing out here are lymph nodes.

736
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:44,910
So it's hard to see,

737
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:51,960
but there's a blood vessel that goes from the frontline down to the back line at the junction where these blood vessels kind of come together.

738
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,810
There are lymph nodes. These are the kind of that acts, the inguinal lymph nodes.

739
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:04,440
You'll see those better in real life. But you actually can work your scissor underneath those and remove these as a lipido chain.

740
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:09,870
There's brachial like nodes there at the back of the arm that are hard to see here, but we'll see those next week.

741
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:15,660
And then there are also superficial cervical lymph nodes that are on the mouse itself in the area of the throat.

742
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:21,630
So it's a good place. You can see lymph nodes. If you have some sort of antigenic activation, those might be enlarged.

743
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,780
If it's an animal has form or something that might be a large.

744
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:29,940
If you have an immune compromised animal, you might have a hard time finding them at all.

745
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:35,540
Okay. The mammary chain also tends to follow these blood vessels.

746
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:38,129
So like in young mice, these aren't going to be very well developed.

747
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:43,530
But if we have a mammary tumor model, sometimes we collect that area of tissue for mammary gland.

748
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:51,390
All right. So I just look first and then I'm going to open the abdominal and thoracic cavities of the mouse.

749
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:58,320
So probably better here. This white thing here in the thorax, right here are all the ribs.

750
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:02,970
This is the base of the thyroid. So the viper is the breastbone.

751
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:08,610
So that's where the ribs come together and connect to the breastbone at the base. There's a bit of cartilage called design for it.

752
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:16,550
I grabbed that and then I make an incision. If I'm pulling it away again from the deeper tissue, I make a little nip just below the thigh.

753
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,280
FLOYD And then I can use my scissor to expand that.

754
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,219
This is just the body wall. I'm just opening the body wall.

755
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:29,910
I can pull back this body ball, I pull that up, I can open the abdomen and I can open the body wall to either side.

756
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,590
You don't take the blood out of the heart first. I do.

757
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,520
I didn't show you that in this image. I think I actually do have an image of that.

758
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,599
A few slides down. There's a couple of ways you can do it.

759
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,900
You can do it after this stage because their diaphragm is here and you can actually pick the diaphragm and see the heart directly and.

760
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:54,410
Once you open the diaphragm, the chest tends to collapse and there's less pressure.

761
01:13:54,860 --> 01:14:01,170
So usually if we're controlling the whole necropsy, we take blood before we even open the mouth.

762
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:09,320
So at the first stage, we'll actually, just by knowing where it is, put a needle through the mouse's skin and draw the blood directly from the heart.

763
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:12,710
But I think in this I took a picture of it so that you could see it.

764
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:25,790
Hey, so that could be it. So, as I was saying, very often we do this initially, but this picture is trying to show you how you can draw blood.

765
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:31,310
In our methods, we said we were going to draw blood after euthanasia from intra cardiac puncture.

766
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:37,550
Hard to see, but this is me pulling up on the side for this tissue here that I've punctured.

767
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:43,400
This is the diaphragm. This is the muscular barrier between the thorax and the abdomen.

768
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,959
So what? That's the tact that can contract and relax, providing kind of the port,

769
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:54,410
the part of the pressure that maintains the negative pressure inside the thorax at necropsy.

770
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,620
When you take all the tissue out, you're going to have to cut it to that diaphragm.

771
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,600
But this is showing sort of the open chest cavity way of drawing blood post euthanasia.

772
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:06,430
So this is the needle, this red thing. Here is the heart.

773
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,180
This piece in here is a section of lung, but basically the heart is going to be essentially on midline.

774
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:16,630
We tend to do this before we ever open the mouth just because we take we do right after euthanasia.

775
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:21,590
And once you've kind of figured this out, you can usually estimate where the heart is pretty effectively.

776
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,360
But this is just kind of showing you where it is and we'll be able to see that next week.

777
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,959
I was gonna say. So what does that mean? That I can continue and open my abdominal cavity?

778
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,620
I usually actually continue this this decision on the side so I can just pull

779
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:43,580
everything apart and then I can start to see my viscera out more readily.

780
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:49,490
So that's opening the abdomen to open the thorax.

781
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:53,960
You're continuing the incision, but either side of the rib cage.

782
01:15:54,500 --> 01:16:00,920
So looking at this picture, you're going to make a cut here all the way up really to where the collarbone is.

783
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:07,970
And another cut here through essentially removing the sternum, which is the breastplate and then the associated ribs.

784
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:15,920
Okay. So I think I have this here. When you do this to avoid damaging the tissue, these are your pedicure bones.

785
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,940
You need a little bit more of a tough scissor. So these are my sharp, blunt scissors.

786
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:28,010
I have one arm of the scissor inside the rib cage, but I'm putting pressure towards the outside so that my tension is towards the ribs.

787
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:33,499
So I'm not, like, digging it into the heart of the law. So I think that's a weird thing to explain.

788
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,640
Our power point, this is the sternum almost removed.

789
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:43,910
This was focused on here. It's it's not the greatest photo but you can see the cut edges of the ribs part.

790
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:50,420
That's where we took some blood. The lungs are collapsed, so the lungs work to disrupt the negative pressure of the thorax.

791
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:55,790
They're going to kind of shrink, but they're sort of the pale pink things either side of the heart.

792
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:00,050
And then this white thing here that's actually at the top of the heart is the thymus.

793
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,640
So that's the site. It's a lymphoid tissue, the site of t cell development.

794
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:11,600
And in mice and humans and most of our mammal species, the thymus tends to regress with age.

795
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:17,719
So in an adult animal, it can be hard to see. In rodents they tend to preserve sometimes throughout their lives.

796
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,520
They've kind of a lot of fighting tissue,

797
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:27,530
but that is a tissue that can be decreased if you have immune depletion or if you have like a like an immune deficient mouse.

798
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:31,460
Okay, so this is that sternum removed.

799
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:38,990
So this is actually a little bit of an example of trimming and necropsy this sector of the breastbone, it's bone.

800
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:44,060
And in the center of bone, there's actually not a poetic tissue.

801
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:49,760
So there's bone marrow. So this is one easy section that I often keep for bone marrow assessment.

802
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:58,070
So I cut off the ribs on either side and then I keep this tissue and I'm going to put the 3D calcifying agent to remove the calcium in it,

803
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:02,870
and that's going to make it stopped enough to process it cut like the rest of my soft tissues.

804
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:13,370
The sternum is one tissue I have to keep for bone marrow. So now we have the abdomen open, we have the thorax open, and we have a good visual.

805
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:17,690
We can just see at first glance if there's anything abnormal.

806
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:25,010
So the thoracic cavities opened, the sternum is removed. I can see all my organs if I'm going to.

807
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:31,730
If I go ahead of time that I'm going to take anything like for microbiological culture or I want things to be relatively sterile.

808
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:36,860
Now is when I usually take those tissues surviving to sample the liver or the lung or something.

809
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:41,750
But I want the tissue to be relatively clean. This is usually an opportune time to do so.

810
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:46,670
And you can also see if there is any growth, deviations or abnormalities.

811
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:53,330
Let's just kind of orient you. So this is where. That diaphragm was the very famous heart, lungs.

812
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:58,610
Diaphragm was here. Here's the liver. That's probably still a little bit the diaphragm on top of the liver,

813
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:04,160
here are the intestines and then the kidneys are behind all this against the back wall of the abdomen.

814
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:07,490
So we won't be able to see the kidneys until we remove those intestines.

815
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:12,590
Oh. So this picture is kind of a bit of a goof.

816
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,450
Usually the salivary glands and the cervical lymph nodes are still here.

817
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:22,880
So one of the first steps I do is remove those. And once you do that, you can see the trachea.

818
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:26,900
So this trachea is leading behind the heart to the lungs.

819
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:35,240
So this picture, we should've taken it before, but this is essentially removing the salary glands so something you could lift up and remove.

820
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:42,170
I'll show you that. Perhaps you don't know the greatest image of them, but the salary glands are paired.

821
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:47,660
There's a superficial cervical lapel, which you actually see better over here, this white globular thing.

822
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:51,810
And then there are other glands that are adjacent to it. And they're paired on either side.

823
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:57,950
So it comes out kind of like a lie. And that entire tissue actually can be consulted and process for histology.

824
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:05,860
Okay. So at this point, it kind of depends a little bit what the focus is of your necropsy.

825
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:10,900
If you're doing a complete necropsy, you want to concentrate on the tissues that are going to degrade first.

826
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:17,620
And what are the ones that degrade the fastest is the GI tract, and that's because they have the bacteria in it.

827
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:26,440
And so bacteria and enzymatic degradation are the two factors that affect postmortem autopsies so often.

828
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:32,320
The first thing I'll do is remove the GI tract in the female or technically the male too.

829
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:36,700
Before I do that, I need to remove the reproductive tract because it's in the way.

830
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:42,790
So this is a female and in rodents they actually have a bye corner uterus.

831
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:49,150
So humans, we have a kind of a simple uterus where it has one uterine body and then the cervix and vagina.

832
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:56,590
In many of domestic animal species, you have cervix and vagina in the lower portion and then you have two horns to the uterus.

833
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:02,590
Okay, so these are litter bearing animals, so they can have fetuses implanting all along any of those horns.

834
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:07,750
So it looks like a Y and so they have a black on its back.

835
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:11,500
So the reproductive tract is ventral. This is the bladder.

836
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:15,880
Then behind that we have the cervix and virginal canal. These are the uterine horns.

837
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:22,330
And then this tube here, which is dorsal to that, towards the back of the mouth is the colon.

838
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:29,739
So we want all this out of the way so we can get to the pole. So the female the way I do that, it's a mouse.

839
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:33,430
So like I can just use a scalpel blade for this in a larger animal.

840
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:40,540
I would need to use a wrong jaw, which is like a bone cutting tool. Um, or I'd use a bouncer, basically.

841
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:46,030
I know that this is like a Y and the central portion, the cervical vaginal canals of a midline.

842
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:54,640
So use my bladder, which is on midline as a guide, and I take my scalpel blade and just push down and cut through on either side of the bladder.

843
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,510
And what I'm doing is that splitting the pelvis kind of on the side.

844
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,570
And this side, the pelvis is like a box.

845
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:09,460
So essentially remove the middle portion of the pelvis and then I can get to the cervix, the virginal canal that goes through the pelvis.

846
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:18,550
That's all but hard image to illustrate. But this is sort of this isn't the greatest version of this picture.

847
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:25,060
But what you try to do once you've done that is grab the hair tissue near the vaginal opening,

848
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:29,530
you're grabbing a tougher tissue and then you can use that as a little bit of a guide.

849
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:35,500
And we actually can retract this dorsally and then remove the entire reproductive tract.

850
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:42,429
So out of focus. But here's is bladder. Here's where the two horns come together through cervix.

851
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:45,900
And then somewhere here it switches to vaginal canal and then there's a little bit of hair.

852
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:52,390
Skipper always kind of cut the tissue at the base uterine horn and that it's hard to see here, but up towards the kidney,

853
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:58,390
there's a fat pad and then the ovaries and fallopian tube or the over duct are in that fat pad near the kidney.

854
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:09,729
So when you remove that, it looks kind of like this. There's that popcorn uterus and we can actually put this in our histo cassette or on a

855
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:14,710
sponge or sometimes we actually use a piece of cardboard and fix that flap like this.

856
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:21,130
So we're going to put it I'll show you when we do this at necropsy, you put it in the fixative and it fixes flap,

857
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:27,490
and then you can trim it down to its component parts later after at least 24 hours of fixation.

858
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:31,390
Okay, so now the reproductive tract is still intact.

859
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,690
I can tell where everything is, but that's going to go to fixation.

860
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:43,719
I don't have images for you here of the female, but essentially with the male, what I do usually is remove the testes and epididymis.

861
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:51,790
First, if I'm doing a tox study, we often dissect those out and weigh the testes and the epididymis different,

862
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:58,270
like separately because the epididymis is storage for mature sperm and there's some maturation that occurs there.

863
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:07,239
The testis is the site of spermatogenesis, so you can have toxicants that, you know, don't affect the previous cycle of sperm.

864
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:12,190
So it would be plenty of sperm here, but definite. But they're affecting spermatogenesis in the testis.

865
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:16,150
So if you look at organ weights tables, very often those are weighed separately.

866
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:21,639
And depending if there are changes in weight in either of them, you can pinpoint where in the cycle is provided.

867
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:27,330
Genesis There's an issue. Okay, so now good, right?

868
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:31,299
Yeah. Here you go. The third you probably go after.

869
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,910
But now I'm going to remove the entire intestinal tract.

870
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:39,580
And this is just showing you before I remove it kind of it's all kind of crammed into the abdomen.

871
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:44,530
But essentially if you have stomach and the stomach gives rise to the small intestine,

872
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:49,240
which actually forms kind of a fan, so the small intestine is incomplete.

873
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:56,260
So imagine like yeah, like a fan, but you open up and so there it kind of goes small and gets tightened at the end.

874
01:24:56,470 --> 01:25:00,670
This is the base of the fan. There are. Lymph nodes.

875
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:03,700
You'll see when I lay this out at necropsy next week,

876
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:11,080
the blood vessel supply comes from the middle part of the pan and extends to the pleated external part of the small intestine.

877
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,560
And there are 30 lymph nodes that follow this blood vessel.

878
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:23,260
So what essentially I'm going to do when I get to the stage is remove those mesenteric lymph nodes and that releases the base of the fan.

879
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:27,070
So now the small intestine gets kind of spread out. You lose that pleat.

880
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:30,700
So that becomes really, really long. That will become obvious. We do it at lab.

881
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:35,680
It's hard to explain in a photo, but if I were to lay out the small intestines, I see it as a fan.

882
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,490
There's a blimp that did touch in a rodent.

883
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:44,860
This is a seagull, which is a blind in the junction between the largest small intestine.

884
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:54,370
It's the site of the majority of microbial activity in the rodent GI tract, and there is lymphoid tissue adjacent to it.

885
01:25:54,370 --> 01:26:02,229
That's analogous to our appendix. So we don't really have a second in a human, but rodents have a lot of microbial activity in this,

886
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:08,260
and they have this expanded bladder pouch, which is the second that's the junction between the small and large intestine.

887
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:14,650
So to remove the GI tract so that the female reproductive tract is gone.

888
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:19,450
Essentially, the forceps are holding the skin near the rectum because that's a tough tissue.

889
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,070
And then the scissors are cutting all the way around.

890
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:29,440
If you have a tube here that's released and then if it's a tissue that if it's a mouse that's recently euthanized,

891
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,940
you can actually put gentle traction and remove the entire GI tract.

892
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:43,120
So you remove the lower part, you get to the small intestine, then you take out the lymph node and you can remove the entire tract.

893
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:52,960
This is just kind of a image that I think I have spread inside and show it and that way that I'm going to have to show you in lab.

894
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:57,429
But that way you could remove it all as one tissue. This is at the anterior portion.

895
01:26:57,430 --> 01:27:00,490
The lower portion has been removed. Now we see the kidneys.

896
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:07,509
The pancreas is kind of a pink looking structure. It looks less white than lymphoid tissue, but it's a pink structure.

897
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:11,740
And in mice, it's very diffuse. They have a lot more kind of pancreatic tissue than we do.

898
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:16,330
But you get to a point where you can't retract any more and then you'll see the stomach.

899
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:25,329
So this is the stomach in situ, in mice. And in most rodents they have a non glandular portion to the stomach.

900
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:30,790
But squamous epithelium, it's like a storage pouch. It's the expanded portion of the esophagus.

901
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:35,470
And then they have a glandular portion, which is the true stomach, but they're just a portion of the stomach.

902
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:41,229
The liver here has been flipped off towards the diaphragm and there's a lobe here of the liver,

903
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:46,720
along with that called the caudate lobe that's actually covering the esophagus like I've open up.

904
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:54,910
So once I flip that up, I can grab the esophagus with my forceps and cut anterior to that and then I can remove the entire stomach.

905
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,970
The spleen is in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen.

906
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:03,320
It often comes out with the stomach or you can remove that separately.

907
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:08,120
That's just me showing that. Oh, and here's the image I was looking for.

908
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:11,680
So this is the entire GI tract. The mouth removed as one.

909
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:20,200
Couple of things you can do here. One strategy is to remove the color fecal pellets of the colon and remove the

910
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:24,040
contents of the second and then just fill the remainder of the GI tract with

911
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,269
for once you're fixing from the inside out and then you drop the entire thing

912
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:32,440
into fixative and then you could trim it into smaller portions after fixation.

913
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:41,050
But essentially there's a couple of different ways of processing the GI, and we have diagrams for each way that you'll see in the lab.

914
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:48,100
But if you're kind of practiced at it, from euthanasia to this point can take you less than 5 minutes.

915
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:53,200
So usually you can do this pretty quickly and that's very effective for the GI because as I said,

916
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:57,370
the microbes present in the GI make it degrade very, very quickly.

917
01:28:57,370 --> 01:29:00,790
So you want to avoid that for proper histologic interpretation.

918
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:06,670
Okay. So once you've done that, the GI tract is gone. Next step is usually to remove the liver.

919
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:10,780
So this is the diaphragm that has been cut so by force.

920
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:17,290
I care about the liver here, but my forceps are holding on to the diaphragm, which has connective tissue attachments to the liver.

921
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,820
But by hold my breath, I want to damage the liver itself.

922
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:25,629
And then I'm just going to use my scissors to release it. Then I have the liver.

923
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:30,310
Take this. The entire liver for both. You can't see it here, but in the mouth.

924
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:35,410
So here's the left lateral lobe. The right medium lobe has sort of Bible.

925
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:41,799
And in between the two of us, this mouth probably recently discharged the contents of its gallbladder.

926
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:47,380
But the gallbladder is typically situated between the two by lobe, the piper vacation of the median lobe.

927
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:50,990
So these are two lobes that I often collect for histology.

928
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:59,170
You don't want to put the entire display. One of most common problems that we see a lot of people will put that entire liver into formalin it's.

929
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:02,830
The minute it's too big a tissue to effectively fix.

930
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:06,879
So if you do that, you're going to have a ptosis in the center of the liver.

931
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:15,100
Both. So what you actually want to do is either section it at necropsy or what we have to do is separated into its component lobes,

932
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:19,810
left lateral, right median. And these are the three lobes from the back.

933
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:23,650
So we separate it to its component lobes. And those are the six it is.

934
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:32,590
These are small enough to fix. Alternately, our preferred sections for histology, which we usually take after fixation,

935
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:37,690
are one section through the left lateral and one section through the right medium that contains the gallbladder.

936
01:30:37,870 --> 01:30:40,990
But you don't want to throw the whole liver informal, and it will not work well.

937
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:46,450
So there's liver lobe separated. So now the gut's gone.

938
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:55,540
The liver is gone. Here are the kidneys in situ. So in the abdomen of the animal and at the anterior pool of the kidneys, we have the adrenal glands.

939
01:30:55,990 --> 01:31:01,330
Okay. So you can actually remove the kidneys individually with their attendant adrenal gland.

940
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:05,560
And then usually we'll separate out the adrenal glands afterwards and weigh them.

941
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:11,470
The adrenal gland is the sort of production sort, the site of production for corticosteroids.

942
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:19,840
So an increase in size of adrenal gland can be indicative of increased corticosteroid production like with stress.

943
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:26,770
So adrenal waves are often used as a proxy for stress measurement in mice and in any species, really.

944
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:34,380
So removing the adrenal gland. And then this one, we should take it off the adrenal to take the picture.

945
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:42,310
But for suctioning for a month. The kidneys are small enough that you can put them in the formalin and have a fix for a rat.

946
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,250
The kidneys are a bit bigger and too thick to fix,

947
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:52,870
so for a rat you want to section the kidney before putting it in the fixative and to see if it's important to us to keep track of left and right.

948
01:31:53,470 --> 01:32:01,210
We usually use the harmonic of left longitudinal reflection on the left, kidney and half longitudinally and the right kidney with cross section.

949
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,900
And the important aspect here is making sure you get the center portion.

950
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:11,980
So either in this plane or this plane, because that's where the renal papillae end and that's where the ureter emerges from the kidney.

951
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:18,070
Okay, so that's quick. So now the abdomen is pretty much empty.

952
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:25,120
And so now we're going to remove the thoracic organs and the tongue, trachea, heart, lung of the mouth altogether.

953
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:31,900
It's just kind of shorthand or really what we refer to as the pluck, probably related to chicken fingers or something.

954
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:40,840
But we remove the plaque by we're going to remove this from the anterior from the mouth cavity towards the chest.

955
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,620
So what this person is doing here is splitting the mandible.

956
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:48,969
So the lower jaw is in place here. They're taking the scalpel blades.

957
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:53,080
Little hard to see here and cutting through the bone on either side of the tongue.

958
01:32:53,770 --> 01:32:59,140
It's much easier to see in person, but when you do that, you can actually use the tongue,

959
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:03,760
which is a very tough tissue as a sort of handle and kind of gently retract backwards.

960
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:13,210
And then the scalpel blade cuts where the trachea adheres to the back of the cervical tissues, the growth pressure right off.

961
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,049
But there is the tongue, there is the larynx.

962
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:22,540
Here is the trachea. I can kind of see the tracheal rings and they just keep going,

963
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:29,560
kind of cutting the attachments and eventually end up with the entire sort of thoracic corpus in one go.

964
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:34,180
So the lung has collapsed, right? Because we've removed it from the thorax.

965
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:39,250
And when it's collapsed it's really, really hard to interpret histologically.

966
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:42,220
So we want to replace the air space with a fixative.

967
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:50,200
So we typically do is use a needle to infuse that fixative through the trachea directly into the lung.

968
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:55,570
You could do this either after removing the lung or a lot of times I do it while it's still in my mouth.

969
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:59,080
So you don't want to over expand it just to the extent of the thoracic cavity.

970
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:03,310
So this is showing you the difference between the flattened, collapsed lungs,

971
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:08,500
very hard to histologically interpret and the ones that are filled with fluid.

972
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:16,960
Okay. If there's pathology presence, like if there's some inflammatory cell influx in the lungs, you're not going to be able to fully fill it.

973
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:21,760
So that can be also indicative of pathology and you'll see that histologically.

974
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:28,300
Okay. So then that goes into the fixative that is fixing it again from the outside in the inside.

975
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:34,390
So that's the reason you can put that whole puckered fixative because you are fixative going through the inner portions as well.

976
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:39,309
Usually we trim thyroid if we're looking at that tissue after fixation,

977
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:47,480
but it's just a diagram showing it that the thyroid gland is located on either its parent, it's located on either side of the trachea.

978
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:57,639
So usually I leave that in place and then when I go to trim after fixation, I just take that entire piece by trimming the heart.

979
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:02,660
I usually leave it. Place during fixation and then before the next step in the process.

980
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:06,470
I trim that either crosswise or longitudinally.

981
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:10,610
This is an example of the heart cut longitudinally after fixation.

982
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:18,590
As you can see here, it's a little bit hard to see. The right ventricle, which is very thin, is stretched over this portion of the heart.

983
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:22,579
This is the perfect tricolor septum, and this is the left ventricle,

984
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:28,250
which is much thicker because it is the pump blood through the entire body cavity and then the atria at the top.

985
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:35,300
So now the through the abdominal cavity is empty, the thoracic thorax is empty.

986
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:42,350
You just have a couple of tissues at the periphery. So a good tissue for sort of skeletal muscle and nervous tissue is the hind limb.

987
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:50,810
And so essentially, we usually remove this at the at the femoral head through essentially disarticulated at the hip,

988
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:54,350
and then we can trim that or fix it as a whole.

989
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:56,180
This is a disgusting picture.

990
01:35:56,660 --> 01:36:05,060
But in the skin, if you're doing a skin study or if you're looking at lesions in different areas of the skin, oftentimes you want to localize things.

991
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:09,960
The skin has different characteristics depending on where the body, where in the body you are.

992
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:17,600
So a lot of time this will remove the entire pelt, which I know the squirrels, but you can just kind of separate that by pulling gently forward.

993
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:22,370
I like what your cat does and she brings. Might help for you if you ever had a cat.

994
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:27,140
Did that pup find it? So this is the entire pelt removed.

995
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:32,180
When you're fixing tissue, you want to try to fix that tissue like this,

996
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:36,790
that stain flap, so you can actually mount that like a little tiny bearskin rug.

997
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:44,510
You can wrap this entire thing on a cardboard piece of paper or a piece of cardboard and put it in the fixative and it'll fix totally flat.

998
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:50,450
I know it's weird. And then after fixation you can trim.

999
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:57,409
So one, if there's two or three things you can actually photograph and mark like record where those are after fixation,

1000
01:36:57,410 --> 01:37:02,040
you want to trim it in the direction of hair growth. If you look at the back, some of the hair goes this way.

1001
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:09,290
If it was this way because this way, if you trim it in the direction of hair growth, the entire hair follicle will be present.

1002
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,100
The section, if they turn out like this, they're going to cut the follicles off at the base.

1003
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:18,530
You're not going to see as much for the next step, which I have to show you after fixation,

1004
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,380
you're going to cut these long strips and those are going to be, at that point fixed and solid.

1005
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:26,870
Like it's not going to be flip it around if you're going to embed those when you

1006
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:30,830
make the wax blocks on edge so that you can see all the layers of the tissue.

1007
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:35,000
So that's why the importance of fixing it flat, because if it gets curled up,

1008
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,480
we're not going to see the follicular structure to the extent that you need to.

1009
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:45,680
Okay. So now you have muscle, you have nerve tissue, you have skin for for examining the brain.

1010
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,670
There is a couple of ways you can do it, but one of the more common is actually to remove the head.

1011
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:56,090
So usually you find the atlantico axial joint and cut right at the Atlantic axial joint, which is at the top vertebra.

1012
01:37:57,050 --> 01:38:00,200
And then on the right hand side is the mouth.

1013
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,620
Skull is so thin you can kind of almost see through the cranium.

1014
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:07,650
But essentially what you do is starting with a scissor at the back,

1015
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:14,480
the frame of Magnum cut through the cranium on either side of the brain and then just reflect the cranium top.

1016
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:21,139
And at that point, you can either remove the cranium and fix the brain in place because now the cranium is gone to fix it.

1017
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:26,690
It can penetrate. Or we have a little device that you can remove the entire brain and fix the brain itself,

1018
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:32,090
like if you need to get brain weights or something like that. So that is for fixation.

1019
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:41,390
These are some resources that have similar either videos or presentation for necropsy of the mouth.

1020
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:49,340
So those are other useful resources. What I've described here is just general rodent necropsy without perfusion.

1021
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:52,620
So this is designed to take tissue,

1022
01:38:52,700 --> 01:39:00,620
put it into a fix that has a sufficient volume and fix it after tissue collection for things like neurologic studies,

1023
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:04,580
like where you're taking the whole brain, you want to make sure you get good penetration of fixative.

1024
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:10,550
Another strategy is to euthanize the mouth and perfused through the vasculature with fixative.

1025
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:17,300
So a lot of neuro studies use this some cardiovascular studies and it has to advantages one.

1026
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:22,250
First, you can clear the tissues of blood, so it's going to make it a little bit easier to interpret.

1027
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:29,420
So you can use like a heparin on ceiling first to clear the tissues of blood,

1028
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:35,509
and then you also kind of can inject a fixative that then helps fix the mouse

1029
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:39,050
from the inside out at the same time that you're doing inversion fixation.

1030
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:48,799
So for perfusion fixation, usually you're using the fixative, typically you open the chest cavity and infuse it through the ventricle,

1031
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:53,150
through the left ventricle, and then you let the blood clear out the right atrium of the heart.

1032
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:58,240
And then after you've perfusion sex, usually you that immersion fixed.

1033
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:04,530
So again. They're going to fix it. If both sides perfusion fixation is a little bit tricky to do and it takes more time.

1034
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:11,550
So for general bankruptcy, this is kind of a standard technique, but there are certain studies where perfusion fixation is preferable.

1035
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:17,370
All right. So that is necropsy that will be easier to understand next week.

1036
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:22,080
So I would suggest to go over that. And then the other thing that you're going to go over on your own.

1037
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:27,720
Okay, fine. The other thing you're going to go over on your own is the training guide.

1038
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:32,990
This is also kind of an educational document we provide to investigators.

1039
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:40,650
It's a good one to have on hand. But if you remember this slide from 616, this is kind of the basic process of his, the slide preparation.

1040
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:48,600
So necropsy fixation. And it takes a good 24 hours typically to have adequate fixation.

1041
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:50,910
But then in order to proceed,

1042
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:59,250
we have to trim the tissues to a small enough shape to fit the adequate orientation to fit at a tissue cassette like the ones at the top.

1043
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:03,690
And those are going to go further through processing and embedding. Okay.

1044
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:08,820
So I'm not going to go through this whole presentation, but if you go forward, you can see four different tissues.

1045
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:17,550
There are diagrams of how we typically fix it, and these are actually taken from the reader tissue trimming guidelines.

1046
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:22,750
So this is a regulatory talk, standardized trimming guidelines.

1047
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:27,690
This is a good resource if you're planning a study and you're doing a weird tissue, kind of like prostate or something,

1048
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:31,650
and you want to see what are some recommended training methods of the reference for that.

1049
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:36,300
These are our general tips for doing tissue trimming.

1050
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:44,910
The basic principles are that the tissues have to be trimmed to have at least one flat surface that corresponds to what will be seen on the slide.

1051
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:50,880
Okay, so skin remember, skin is like a rug. It has a base and it has sort of a plush of the rug.

1052
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:56,790
So when you said that to the tissue, you don't want to just go face down on the skin because you're just going to be cutting through hair follicles.

1053
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:03,360
So you want to think, I want to see the side of the tissue, so I want to have a thin strip cut that I can embed on edge.

1054
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:09,090
And then with the blade of the Microdroplets coming in, it's going to give me a nice flat surface that has all the layers of tissue.

1055
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:14,010
So certain tissue with longitudinal tissue is where we process the splat strips.

1056
01:42:14,010 --> 01:42:22,530
And I put it on edge tissues with a capsule and an interior, like a liver or a kidney, have to show all level levels of the tissue.

1057
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:26,639
So you've got to think about the two dimensional view you want to see and trim the tissue.

1058
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:33,150
So that is reflected. Okay. And then the final thing, so if you're doing this yourself, what other tip?

1059
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:40,700
So you're trimming your tissues, sending them to the lab. Those concepts are typically marked as things like silly, but it's very important,

1060
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:44,280
are marked for the number to pencil or there are special histo pens.

1061
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,870
The first or one of the first steps in histologic processing is to use the solvent.

1062
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:52,800
If you carefully map all your tissues with a sharpie or a pen,

1063
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:58,470
all of your careful markings on your tissue cassettes is going to be dissolved in the first step and processing,

1064
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:02,400
and you won't be able to tell the difference between any of your samples and your experiment will be over.

1065
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,920
So it's very important to mark your tissues with a number two pencil as rudimentary as that seems.

1066
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:12,960
That's another common issue that we see with samples submitted to our court.

1067
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:17,220
And sometimes we try to catch it, but sometimes it's hard to tell if it's pen or pencil.

1068
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:23,190
And there's nothing anyone can do once those mistakes are made. So again, this is in your notes.

1069
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:30,390
And there's a nice guy that you could use for yourself or for others in your lab, kind of reminding you of all those do's and don'ts.

1070
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:35,729
All right. So and it's all very essentially hard for today.

1071
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:39,660
I'm not going to go over and even look at this yourself. But again, it's just the tissue training guide.

1072
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:44,730
Let me know any questions. And very often we'll be doing some of them ourselves.

1073
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:50,190
But first, along with other things, how do you decide how much?

1074
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:57,740
That's all they wanted. So for general diagnostic testing, we do it qualitatively.

1075
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:05,000
I think our goal is to kind of just like the one human inflated position in life, which is why I like to do it with a lot of skill.

1076
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:11,840
If I can use like a Thor because I want to take the breath and can expand to the outer limits of the thorax and just kind of eyeball.

1077
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:18,920
Okay. Is it fair to do that if you're doing that inhalation study where you might be measuring like alveolar size,

1078
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,680
then you have to be very controlled about how much you.

1079
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:30,680
So you can use a gravity lung perfusion where you have to perform a lot of essentially at a set level

1080
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:37,310
above the cap and the is here at the top level and the height of the form and above the mouth.

1081
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:42,050
You know that compared to the partial pressure at which you're accusing the lung.

1082
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:45,500
So if you're doing it that way, it'll sort of equalize the pressure.

1083
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,000
So I think 30 centimeters is the typical height in which we use.

1084
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:52,339
So if you're going to do a really controlled study,

1085
01:44:52,340 --> 01:45:01,030
I would do a perfusion set up where everyone is getting confused at a particular height and then basically it fills to the extent that it can be.

1086
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:04,690
As long as you don't have a huge height, it's not going to overdose.

1087
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:22,700
Okay. Yeah. Thank you for. Another crash course in enemies related.

1088
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:29,530
Thank you. I'm fine. Thanks.

1089
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:33,900
Have a good weekend, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1090
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:40,570
I appreciate that. I've known all your kids and I love you.

1091
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,740
And I'll probably get there a little bit early, sir. You have?

1092
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:58,040
Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, I if you're out because I'd say if you want to study the schedule a marriage alone, it'll make you possibly very, very.

1093
01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:04,450
Yeah. It's weird how to have that extra I offered her as my like a weird about right now.

1094
01:46:04,550 --> 01:46:08,080
Oh. Oh, good. There's something. I mean, I should be fine.

1095
01:46:08,470 --> 01:46:11,620
I'm going to take it like that. Like what?

1096
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:17,770
Well, actually, WolframAlpha is what it is, and the challenge is now increasingly diverse.

1097
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:24,940
And we have all the challenges that result from medicine.

1098
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:30,130
Yeah. You're never going to have to say that. Like, I've only really the only really.

1099
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:35,979
Yeah. So I like talk about the positives and like reading the paper. Well, can you help clarify the question?

1100
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:42,670
And it's like you can really help others have maybe a challenge to be with this increasing diverse community.

1101
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:51,520
Your challenge with maximizing and capitalizing on and recognizing and utilizing, and so you can actually use benefits.

1102
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,720
Like that's the challenge.

1103
01:46:53,650 --> 01:47:04,240
And that's what I came to appreciate and appreciate that there is a human and other thing is a great feeling, more tension, you know.

1104
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:10,120
Sometimes if people are going in there with the right mindset.

1105
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:16,500
Sure. I learned out of high school that I could have, like for any girl looks pretty good.

1106
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:23,870
Yeah, that's really exciting. I was, like, having kids that are younger than either of them.

1107
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:32,150
Yeah. I downloaded Firefox and I tried to imagine what campus it might be and was crashing during.

1108
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:35,419
Like even during your quizzes.

1109
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:39,510
I have this crashing every question I write, so I read all the short answer, you know,

1110
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:44,270
Murdock, and then I copy and paste the hand and squeeze before it crashes me out again.

1111
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,330
Is that related to your computer or.

1112
01:47:47,890 --> 01:48:00,020
I was I made a ticket with the Help Desk, and they basically said that it was it's not a property of my computer because I'm a server,

1113
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:04,550
because I'm able to get into and start and answer one question.

1114
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:12,310
So that lets you know that canvas was working. And my feeling for you off campus for your time was both on and off campus a house.

1115
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:19,969
So it's not like life I think, either. So I just tried a different browser and I'm going to try to update my computer

1116
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:26,000
to Windows 11 because I'm casting their ballots and the university so slowly.

1117
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:33,319
Like, you know, I think I had tons of that. And I just like having I'm sorry that I you know how does the people are still

1118
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:38,149
using Windows ten university updates everything so slowly in your browser.

1119
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:46,460
It might. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm going to try. I'm going to try your quiz and other features on Firefox and see if I let you use it.

1120
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:50,510
Right. Yeah, I was. Yeah. Weird. That's usually what they tell you then.

1121
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:55,940
Yeah, it's okay. I like that. I'm just hoping that maybe an update of the canvas.

1122
01:48:55,950 --> 01:49:03,240
Yeah. Something updates and I've it's gone I think my browser history besides like your pokies or things or something that would help.

1123
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:09,530
Yeah that might still be like page um, responding to software, letting an error like memory overload or something.

1124
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:14,329
Yeah. Did you try going to wildlife survey for his help?

1125
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:21,860
You know, like we're going to talk to do an actual. Yeah, but yeah I did a helpdesk and I got a ticket and basically they said like with

1126
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:25,969
this general like their histories all make try different browsers exact thing.

1127
01:49:25,970 --> 01:49:29,960
So that's how I'm going to help you. Let me know if you need extension, right?

1128
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:35,380
Yeah. Now, you and I are like casual though, so you can say no ten questions.

1129
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:42,200
Yeah. Now you off the thing. I hope that every now 38 hour and a half to do type thing.

1130
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:45,059
Yeah. And that's, I was just scrambling to get anything.

1131
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:51,800
You know I didn't finish it because it's was, um, yeah, I picked out every few seconds waiting for it to figure itself out maybe.

1132
01:49:52,730 --> 01:49:57,200
Yeah. For the phone it not for, for, for the midterm for 616.

1133
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:00,829
That shouldn't be an issue because of download Firefly for the final.

1134
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:04,760
It might be for this hopefully by the time. Yeah. So yeah this isn't a problem.

1135
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:08,839
I was honestly, I'm kind of traumatized from that experience.

1136
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:19,040
But yeah, when you said that it was kind of take home we downloaded I was a breath of fresh air that I find it look like I noticed.

1137
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:23,660
You can put that same question to Kevin. Yeah, I noticed. Like, the feel of you.

1138
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:27,350
Like every little thing that I have to go down to write something.

1139
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:33,280
Yeah, I have to go back and I have to trust, but in theory, it should work so people can take it with that.

1140
01:50:33,290 --> 01:50:39,259
It. Yeah, it's no doubt you should go back to where you are. Probably a little bit afraid that that might actually be true.

1141
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:45,559
Yeah, I just. And I just don't want to deal with, like, having to fix everybody's issue.

1142
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:52,060
I'd rather just do it. Yeah, it is. And it has a lot of things in it where people could just take it all back to the basics.

1143
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:57,040
Hard work works. I mean, we have an exam on Monday and paper and pencil.

1144
01:50:57,050 --> 01:51:04,340
Yeah, yeah. Even all the way back to there. I mean there are things that canvas I think workflow and so I think I'm over the place.

1145
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:08,810
Yeah. I mean, higher management, not so much short answer.

1146
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:16,160
Yeah. Yeah. Like the talk of length you if but you have a lot of options that you know if you had an S the end.

1147
01:51:16,190 --> 01:51:20,759
Oh yeah it's like that's versus mad because of how I usually I mean I go through

1148
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:24,319
and I try to for example but it doesn't look like there's too attached.

1149
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:27,950
So right out play right. But, um, yeah.

1150
01:51:27,950 --> 01:51:35,719
And like easier for the instructor to be able to have something automated correct people but like there are some things where I'm just like,

1151
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:39,730
you know, yeah. All right, good.

1152
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:43,280
Thank you so much. Yeah.

1153
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,470
And, well, I don't know, I.

1154
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:28,280
Yeah. Yeah, that.

1155
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:45,360
Yeah. Yeah.

1156
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:59,520
Right. Chemical weapons may be used to kill.

1157
01:53:45,580 --> 01:54:10,100
They? Yeah.

1158
01:57:58,030 --> 02:04:35,510
I think. I.

1159
02:09:35,920 --> 02:15:17,390
Now. I.

1160
02:41:09,850 --> 02:43:01,360
Oh, there. No.

1161
02:43:07,050 --> 02:43:20,050
To. So I did for something.

1162
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:33,230
But now I'm kind of, you know, very well placed to be attached to a company to refer people through Google Home.

1163
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:38,730
Well, yeah, I think know.

1164
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:46,240
Oh.
