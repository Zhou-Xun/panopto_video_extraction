Hi. Welcome back to Pop Health 530.

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:23,190
In this module, we'll discuss negotiation. It is a very important skill you'll need for the success for your career.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:32,740
A professional career. I will also go so far as to suggest that knowing how to negotiate will benefit every aspect of your personal life,

4
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,380
making you happier, more satisfied and more confident person.

5
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,760
Like it or not, or whether, you know, we're not we all are negotiators.

6
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,750
We negotiate on a regular, perhaps daily basis.

7
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,060
Many of the negotiations we take party are informal and not so obvious to us.

8
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:00,210
For example, persuading your daughter to put on the coat before she goes off to school on a freezing day.

9
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:06,870
Discussing with your husband about whose responsibility it is to drive your daughter to her

10
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:13,230
piano lessons or haggling over the price of a new Subaru outback with a car dealership.

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,940
Other negotiations may be more formal looking our work plan and deciding how to share the work with a coworker.

12
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,470
Hammering out a contract with a supplier. Convincing a client to accept a late delivery.

13
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,290
Discussing the terms of a job offer with a recorder.

14
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,180
Or more relevant to us. Asking your boss for a salary increase.

15
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,050
The list of negotiations can go on and on and on.

16
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,540
The bottom line is this No matter where you work and no matter what your job is, you need to know how to negotiate.

17
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:59,620
This is non-negotiable. A few years ago, Thomas Friedman, a New York Times columnist, wrote a bestselling book on globalization.

18
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:04,630
He basically argued that new technologies, information,

19
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:13,180
people and commerce opportunities are converging to create a flatter and more competitive world.

20
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,750
Therefore, that book titled The World Is Flat.

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:27,860
In a way, organizations are becoming flat or flatter, too, because we have come to rely less on hierarchy to get things done,

22
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:36,860
because there are more and faster innovations that compel us to change because information is much easier to access,

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,570
usually right at the tip of our fingers and because the workplace has become a lot more diverse.

24
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:55,310
Diversity, as we know, means differences. Differences can potentially lead to conflicts because of unproductive misunderstandings.

25
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:04,910
Fortunately, the league. All these undesirable outcomes can be prevented and mitigated by effective negotiation.

26
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,790
Having said that, I'm certain that very few of you will consider yourselves an outright negotiator,

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,890
meaning who has mastered the art of negotiation and love negotiating.

28
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,040
Most of you, I'm sure, don't like negotiation.

29
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,800
More likely, you may avoid negotiating, even when the avoidance works to your detriment preventing you from getting what you want and deserve.

30
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,040
The fact that you don't like negotiation and try to avoid it whenever you could is actually quite understandable.

31
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:45,520
It is very common among us. The feeling, I believe, is primarily due to a misconception that negotiation is like a tug of war.

32
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,090
It is a zero sum game, a win lose situation.

33
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,400
And whether you are winner or loser, there are always bad feelings.

34
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:02,780
As a matter of fact, negotiation doesn't have to be a zero sum game or a win lose situation,

35
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,530
unlike what we see in the clip from the movie Erin Brockovich.

36
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,190
If done right, negotiation can be win win.

37
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:18,730
If your goal is to make a positive difference in the world as a public health professional, as a manager or as a leader,

38
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:23,140
an important skill that you'll need is the ability to envision,

39
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:31,090
negotiate and bring about a sustainable agreement among parties that have conflicting positions.

40
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,720
The word I want to emphasize is sustainable.

41
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,630
Zero sum games and win lose situations are not sustainable.

42
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,430
They lead to retaliation. To be sustainable.

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,740
The parties involved in negotiation have to walk away feeling satisfied and feeling they are winners.

44
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,040
In the remainder of the module, we will explain four important aspects.

45
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,600
First, what negotiation is and what it involves.

46
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:12,710
Second, how negotiation may help to advance interests both your interests as well as the interests of your negotiation partner.

47
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,550
Served how negotiation shall be perceived as a joint problem solving process.

48
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,490
And finally, a3d strategy for solving joint problems.
