00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:14,210
In this part of the lecture, I will describe ways the field of public health discusses health differences.

2
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:25,610
First, I want to state explicitly that for those of us working in the field of public health, we believe health is a fundamental right.

3
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:37,750
The World Health Organization, a non-governmental organization focused on international public health, had this to say over 70 years ago.

4
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:49,870
The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race,

5
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:56,430
religion, political belief, economic or social condition.

6
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:08,790
And that sentiment, that belief that all individuals are entitled to not just the absence of disease or not being critically injured,

7
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,950
but the highest attainable standard of health is really important.

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:26,030
So, too, is the second part of the quote that this highest attainable standard of health should be possible no matter which religion,

9
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,850
race or social condition social Class One is in.

10
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,380
We're going to come back to those categories a little later in this lecture,

11
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:48,730
but I want to highlight this belief that health is a fundamental right for all as a chief motivator of our work in the field of public health.

12
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:54,140
This is our goal, our mission, our aim.

13
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,440
Let's start out with the most basic term health difference.

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:08,380
We see health differences or differences in health outcomes when there is a different amount of a health condition,

15
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:15,080
illness or death in one population compared to the general population.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,790
We may also see health differences when comparing two groups.

17
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:33,200
Let me give you some examples. Typically, we see worse or reduced mobility among the elderly compared with the general population.

18
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,660
That is an example of a health difference as people age,

19
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:49,240
they typically experience reduced mobility or more trouble walking than those in the non elderly general population.

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:58,930
So the physical abilities between the two individuals pictured at the top of this slide represents a healthy difference.

21
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:11,460
Similarly, we might expect to find a higher rate of arm injuries among professional tennis players than in the general non tennis playing population.

22
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:23,800
The rate of arm injuries would be different, with professional tennis players disproportionately having more arm injuries than the general population.

23
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:35,130
The types of injuries Serena Williams faces versus those faced by Beyonce are an example of this health difference.

24
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:44,560
Neither of these examples of health differences are likely to occupy prominent places and a public health agenda.

25
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,670
These are health differences or as they are often called, health inequalities.

26
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:05,330
These are differences in health outcomes without any evaluation or moral judgment as to whether these unequal numbers are fair or just.

27
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:16,170
Health disparities are something different. Health disparities, sometimes also referred to as a health inequity,

28
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:22,230
are defined by the United States Department of Health and Human Services as a

29
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,620
particular type of health difference that is closely linked with economic,

30
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,090
social or environmental disadvantage.

31
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:45,080
Health disparities adversely affects groups of people who have systematically experienced greater social or economic obstacles to health.

32
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:53,900
So as you can hear in this definition, health disparities are a type of health difference,

33
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:06,510
but they are health differences that are rooted in and linked to various forms of systemic disadvantages or challenges.

34
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,660
So what do I mean by systemic disadvantage or challenges?

35
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:24,500
For most social identities, there is a group or groups that experience more power or privilege who have the upper hand than members in other groups.

36
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:35,330
For example, historically, individuals who have a heterosexual sexual identity have held more social and legal advantages

37
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:43,190
versus those who identify as any other sexual identity other than exclusively heterosexual.

38
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:55,350
Those who have more wealth or higher socioeconomic status have fewer obstacles to health than those with few financial resources.

39
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:12,500
Spend a few moments thinking about how each of these categories may shape whether an individual experiences social benefits or challenges.

40
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:20,040
Health disparities are unfair, preventable differences in health outcomes.

41
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:28,370
Think about health as a foot race where the finish line is reaching that highest attainable standard of health.

42
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:37,190
To reach that highest attainable standard of health or the finish line, some people have more obstacles than others.

43
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,780
The runner on the top has a straight path with no obstacles.

44
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,230
The runner in the middle panel faces additional challenges.

45
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:55,420
She's carrying a small bag on her back and has to run over small speed bumps in order to reach the finish line,

46
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,710
the runner at the bottom must overcome a heavy load and hurdles in order to reach the finish.

47
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:12,340
Finishing first or finishing with good health is a function of the number of obstacles an individual faces.

48
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,540
These obstacles are those factors listed on the previous slide.

49
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,500
The obstacles might be differences in income or differences in mental health.

50
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:34,150
Inequities can occur across socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, geography, gender, disability status,

51
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:45,410
mental health and sexual identity and orientation or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion.

52
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:53,270
We could teach an entire class on how each of these identity categories shapes health outcomes.

53
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,190
In public health, two hundred and in many aspects of public health,

54
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:06,570
we spend a lot of time looking at the roles of race and racism in creating obstacles to good health.

55
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,120
This is because disparities in health outcomes between white and black Americans are

56
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:20,080
especially pronounced and have deep seated historical roots in so many aspects of our country.

57
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,330
You'll read more about that and one of the assigned readings in today's lesson.

58
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:37,510
So far, I've been talking about health disparities in conceptual terms, so let me give you a concrete example of a health disparity as shown here.

59
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:45,860
African-Americans account for forty five percent of all new HIV cases in the United States.

60
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:51,130
While making up only 13 percent of the US population.

61
00:08:51,130 --> 00:09:01,510
In other words, despite the fact that only 13 percent of Americans are African-American, African Americans experience.

62
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,180
Forty five percent of all new HIV diagnoses.

63
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:14,170
So the health disparity or the disparity in health outcomes here is HIV cases,

64
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,840
and the group that experiences this health disparity is African-Americans.

65
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:28,510
We know that African-Americans have historically and systematically the discriminated against here in the United States.

66
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:34,720
One consequence of the systemic social and economic disadvantage many African-Americans

67
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,690
experience is higher rates of HIV when compared to the general US population.

68
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,888
In the next section, I'll provide additional examples of health disparities.
