1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:07,200
I wish I could find the right person.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,420
So I think it was a very nice man, but I don't know.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:27,780
Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about it, you know, probably even more.

4
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:42,210
Sorry. I literally have a few announcements for you and, you know, I might start your.

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:58,670
Yes, I did my homework exam one more time to find out for yourself about scuse me and release your exam grades.

6
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:10,290
And as if you look at the syllabus, there is a reason anybody who received less than 70 received less, and so enough to start.

7
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:23,850
So in a lot of questions we got Ron we were well after this the retake.

8
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,770
It happens. So basically I'm offering that people can retake back to the same exam and to improve their score.

9
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,190
So I can't really I want to release that.

10
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:50,380
And Louisiana State actually welcome to come during office hours or ask me if you want to we can look at your exam.

11
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:00,280
So and then I released homework to today and so that is will be due in two weeks.

12
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,670
And then yes, I went over just quickly, the questions that you asked for last week.

13
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,120
There was a lot of questions on the wastewater algae.

14
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:22,840
I use the wastewater for surveillance. And I just wanted to add in a lot of the result around exactly how it happened and and why

15
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,040
it is going to happen or if it's actually happening in a way it's happening since COVID.

16
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,740
And the big thing is that health departments now are investing in doing the work themselves, not actually relying on other experts.

17
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,950
They're hiring people. They're hired. They're buying the equipment needed to do the wastewater sampling.

18
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:51,490
So more the more and more health departments are actually carrying out to being able to do it themselves as a surveillance tool.

19
00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:03,520
I also want to note one question was about how what surveillance, what a career in surveillance looks like as an epidemiologist.

20
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:11,470
So that kind of leads us nicely to our guest speaker, who has spent her career doing surveillance as an epidemiologist in Bogota.

21
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:20,440
She's an expert on HIV surveillance. She's got her MPH here, U of M in after biology.

22
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:27,430
And we were talking earlier sat in where you're sitting many times listening to lectures.

23
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,570
She's has over 30 years of 30 years, three decades of experience doing HIV surveillance.

24
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,030
And so that means she's spanned. You know, the the epidemic, the HIV epidemic since emergence,

25
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,950
the current situation really has a unique perspective on surveillance with respect to HIV.

26
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:58,209
She worked until 2012 with the Detroit Health Department and under the state health, the state of Michigan,

27
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:07,120
Michigan Health Department, and has been integral in both developing and managing HIV surveillance in in the state.

28
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,890
So with that, thank you. I'll turn this microphone.

29
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,450
Is it on in the back? Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, great.

30
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,110
Wonderful.

31
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:27,680
I was telling Joe I haven't done this lecture in person for three years, so if I start looking for Zoom notes or something, you'll understand.

32
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,160
It's been a while, so I'm just going to dove right in.

33
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:39,740
I also wanted to say that I left the State Health Department in Detroit in 2012 and have been working as a consultant for the last ten years.

34
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,219
And during that time I've worked with about 30 different health departments on using their HIV surveillance data for prevention and care.

35
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,200
And I. Yeah, so let me just dove into our topics and.

36
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,280
See we're seeing heavily as presenter rather than while Mr. Mouse does not seem really sensitive.

37
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:08,690
Now, here we go. So the topics I'm going to be discussing today are going to be to review and definition of public health surveillance.

38
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,240
I know you got some of that last week, but I have a particular perspective I like to emphasize on that.

39
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,370
Briefly review the natural history of HIV Infection. Overview the methods, strengths and weaknesses of the surveillance system.

40
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,979
Talk a little bit about how the data are used and why we collect it and end with

41
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,450
some websites for obtaining HIV data in Michigan and nationally and some HIV data.

42
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:45,500
Infographics i. This is a heavily funded surveillance system, I would say more funding than any surveillance system for any communicable disease.

43
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:52,250
And consequently, I would view it as a role model, as opposed to thinking that this is emblematic about how disease surveillance is done.

44
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,250
Infectious disease surveillance is done in general.

45
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,049
Certainly in the last three years, we've learned a lot about the problems with our surveillance systems.

46
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,120
But we'll talk about that as we go on.

47
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,390
So. Public health surveillance.

48
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,530
I like these definitions that it's the systematic and ongoing assessment of the health of the community,

49
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,819
including timely collection, analysis, interpretation, dissemination.

50
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,240
As you can see, I emphasize subsequent use of the data.

51
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,770
Case reporting is the most common type of disease, although those terms are tend to be used interchangeably.

52
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:38,680
It is population based. It is not research and it is not a consent process, which is something that also comes up quite a bit.

53
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,740
I have trouble with asthma and I'm sure we know it's.

54
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,060
Use the arrows. Think it's as old as the memory stick I brought in?

55
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,659
I got it. It's okay. It's. It's working. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. What?

56
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,580
I talk about population base. What I mean is that it collects everyone we meet.

57
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,160
Our goal is to get everybody who's living with HIV reported to the health department.

58
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,379
And it's used because it's used not only to plan prevention programs and care services,

59
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,990
but also to capture rare events and some disease surveillance, specifically HIV we'll be talking about today.

60
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,710
Also serve the purpose of reaching out to individuals under skill score and to provide services for them.

61
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,880
And in order to underscore the need to include the whole population.

62
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:39,540
Unless these these surveillance definitions which are like one from 1994, one from 2010, I like because they define surveillance by using the data.

63
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,799
The 1994 quote just says, unless data are provided to those who set policy and implement programs,

64
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,240
their use is limited to archives and academic pursuits and is therefore considered to be health information rather than surveillance data.

65
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,809
I really like the more light way they talk about it in 2010, where he says the reason for collecting,

66
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,040
analyzing and disseminating information on the disease is to control that disease.

67
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,020
Collection and analysis should not be allowed to consume resources if action does not follow.

68
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,860
And William Fakih, for those who who don't know him,

69
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,890
was head of CDC but is probably best known for being the head of the effort to eradicate smallpox in the world.

70
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,990
No small job. And he wrote a wonderful book called House on Fire that I thought was fantastic.

71
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,010
And I highly recommend it for any of you. I got to see him in person.

72
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,729
It was very exciting. Something he was he's about six four.

73
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:38,910
So I think he was challenging. So I'm going to give you an example and this next slide.

74
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,590
Where we go is an example of using surveillance data as information for action.

75
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:52,120
This slide talks about how the national HIV behavioral surveillance system in HBS has been used in that way.

76
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:01,120
The Detroit Health Department area is an NHP site, and we've been gathering data from that from that system since, I think, the early 2000.

77
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,650
So first, the data are gathered, collected and analyzed.

78
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:15,220
They are then the data are then disseminated, and then they are used to for public awareness and activism.

79
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,230
For example, this pin here, you see my mouse when I do this or if I need the pointer,

80
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:30,370
the 46% button here was two because in a 2005 round of NHP us where they interview people and then also test them for HIV,

81
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:37,959
they found that 46% of African American men that they interviewed who were HIV positive did not know that they were HIV positive,

82
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:47,540
which is a very large number. And they use that to have a public health response to prioritize the response in the African-American community.

83
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,780
Many men, many voices was a program to work on that and to make progress towards strategic plan goals.

84
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,740
I want to spend a minute on the consent issue, which I mentioned on the previous slide,

85
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,730
where I said that disease surveillance and case reporting do not include consent

86
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,470
and that we use the information to describe disease patterns as a whole.

87
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:19,070
It isn't consent based because of how vital the information is for public health to act and to prevent disease transmission.

88
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,630
And I'm going to let me give you some examples here.

89
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:28,110
So food borne illnesses such as salmonella, we want to find out about it to stop transmission and to identify the source.

90
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:35,090
So imagine if you're doing a a an outbreak investigation and you want to find out what the cause of it is.

91
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,760
Is it the lettuce, the watermelon, the alfalfa sprouts that they never,

92
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,240
ever distribute any more because there were so many outbreaks associated with them?

93
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,420
If you needed consent to get those reported, especially, can you imagine today?

94
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:53,569
I mean, this was difficult enough pre-COVID. I mean, the thing about COVID is that what it is?

95
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:00,620
I can't tell you what it was like in February of 2020 to watch what was happening and seeing the

96
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,080
horses leaving the barn and knowing the barn door was closed and would never get them back in.

97
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,919
Watching the complete disaster that this initial response was and the intense politicization of

98
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,710
basic public health interventions was a horror that I hope I never lived through again in my life.

99
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,650
And can you imagine now where the whole idea of contact tracing became?

100
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,849
Nobody would talk to the health department. Nobody talks to anybody anymore. They don't talk to people.

101
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,350
They call them. They don't talk to you. Don't pick up the phone. You don't answer the phone if they're not in your contacts list.

102
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,629
It's just the idea of reaching out to people and finding out what they ate.

103
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,970
If you needed consent to even talk to them or they need consent to be reported to the Health Department,

104
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,329
you would never be able to control foodborne outbreak, something as simple as that that we take and we take for granted.

105
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,649
So. Yeah, it's a difficult time.

106
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,299
And I'm hoping yet that the pendulum moves on this eventually.

107
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,800
But at the moment it's really quite difficult to do some really basic things that we do

108
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:10,640
in terms of respiratory spread such as TB notify contacts for treatment or quarantine.

109
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,690
Bodily fluid, but non respiratory spread such as HIV.

110
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:22,969
We do the reporting for to facilitate linkage to and engagement in care to notify contacts or help the people who are living with HIV.

111
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,460
Notify their contacts by themselves to offer prep, which is pre-exposure prophylaxis,

112
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,210
and to follow up on clusters and outbreaks to interrupt transmission.

113
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,910
The illnesses in these next two slides.

114
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,450
Are both required to be reported to health departments for public health action and are examples of disease surveillance data.

115
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,590
I think they help us put the HIV surveillance in context.

116
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:55,550
After these two slides, I'm going to talk a little bit about the natural history of HIV and then discuss and dove into the methods.

117
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,940
So this slide is examples of noncommunicable diseases or conditions.

118
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,130
Although foodborne outbreaks are caused by an infectious agent, they're not transmitted person to person.

119
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,350
They're therefore included in the non-communicable disease category.

120
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,430
This information is used to identify the source and remove it, identify people at risk and provide prophylaxis if warranted.

121
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,960
An example of a public health action that would be started would be, for example, a recall of a food source.

122
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,180
I mean, I'm sure you've all experienced this in your lifetimes.

123
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:33,890
I clearly led poisoning because I find it really fascinating because it's it's a classic example of a non-communicable and noninfectious condition.

124
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,340
And interestingly, when I was doing this, putting a slide together in 1990, I learned that in 1995,

125
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,890
elevated blood levels became the first noninfectious condition to be reportable on a national level.

126
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,020
And I'm going to get into the laws around reporting and how that's done later on the lecture.

127
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,420
The information is used, of course, to identify children with elevated blood levels and link them to treatment,

128
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,170
identify locations with high levels of lead, and remove the source of lead.

129
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,580
Again, notice the emphasis on using the data for public health action.

130
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,700
These two examples do not involve identifying and treating contacts of the person with the infectious condition.

131
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:20,889
In contrast, communicable diseases are caused by viruses or bacteria in people that people spread to one another through contact with bodily fluids,

132
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:25,190
blood products, or through the air. Think of the root of the word being communicated.

133
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,759
It implies that it's between people. Not all infectious diseases are passed directly between people.

134
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,850
For example, they may be cooked up from food, insects or animals.

135
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:40,000
These two are communicable and the information collected is used to identify, test and treat contacts.

136
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,570
For TB, we link persons to care and monitor treatment.

137
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,389
I looked up to see if they still use directly observed therapy, which is what Dottie stands for,

138
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,590
which means a nurse goes to your house and watches you take your TB treatment.

139
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,830
They are still doing this, which I find stunning because we have technology.

140
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,540
Vicki I mean, I don't know how many of you have ever had an implantable birth control device.

141
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,800
But what that is is letting is releasing those drugs into your system.

142
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,040
So, I mean, once you take them orally and know that you tolerate them.

143
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,670
I don't understand why we aren't using implantable devices for tuberculosis control.

144
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,230
It's not as big a deal in this country, but there are places where this is a huge issue.

145
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,839
Anyway, my parents, who grew up in New York City,

146
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:31,450
told me that their exposure to TB was riding the subways in New York City, and they're using friends anyway for syphilis.

147
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,770
We provide treatment that cures the infection contrary to HIV, which is still not curable, and identifies sexual partners of cases.

148
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,750
Test and provide treatment as warranted.

149
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,260
HIV is communicable, but the stigma associated with it makes standard public health practices much more difficult.

150
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,010
And we're going to I'm going to be talking some more about this.

151
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:58,220
It's like, oh, you know, I forgot to say while I'm talking if so, if you have a question or comment, just wait me down.

152
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,050
I'm happy to get interrupted.

153
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:06,520
You don't have I didn't put a specific discussion section in this because I have so much material I want to present to you.

154
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,030
But I really want to encourage you to ask questions.

155
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,230
If there's something that comes up for you while I'm talking, or you can wait till the end as well.

156
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,719
I'm not great about doing it at the time,

157
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,920
but I will do my best and challenge you guys to give me a ten minute warning or something because I end up in another room.

158
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,280
Anyway. Good public health surveillance system characteristics evolve in response to ever

159
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,540
changing needs of society in general and of the public health community in particular.

160
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,190
And I will talk about how HIV has evolved a lot.

161
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:47,469
They are timely and comprehensive. They produce data used by staff who design prevention and care programs and for communicable diseases,

162
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,840
produce information that can be used to interrupt chains of transmission for chronic diseases or conditions.

163
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,490
They measure prevalence over time.

164
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:02,920
They identify risk factors that can be modified to decrease prevalence and provide data to design and evaluate prevention programs and guide policy.

165
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:12,280
I'm going to just I don't I, I sort of made this assumption in the past that everybody would know this basic stuff about HIV,

166
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,320
since you guys have, like, grown up with it.

167
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,390
But I'm just going to talk about it a little bit because I don't want to make too many assumptions, and you just never know.

168
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,100
So HIV, of course, is the virus that causes HIV infection.

169
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:30,370
AIDS, which we are trying now to call stage three to emphasize that it is a stage of HIV infection

170
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:35,290
and not a separate thing all by itself is the most advanced stage of HIV infection.

171
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,070
Let me just also I knew I would digress and zoom. I never digress.

172
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:46,540
But you get my digressions here, which I think makes it much more fun. We recognized AIDS before we knew what caused it.

173
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,820
I mean, we didn't know what was happened. We didn't know what caused it in the early eighties.

174
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,049
My father had coronary bypass surgery in New York City in 1982 and had he was a physician who said,

175
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:06,360
and I quote, I've seen better hemoglobin on a corpse. And they refused to give him blood because they knew something was happening.

176
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,359
It seemed to be blood borne. And, you know, it's like we'll get your hemoglobin up another way.

177
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,579
You're not getting a blood transfusion and and you're probably not aware of this because

178
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,470
we've really this is one way we've prevented HIV extremely successfully in a biomedical way.

179
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:28,570
A very high proportion of hemophiliacs in the eighties got HIV because when they ended up needing treatment for an uncontrolled bleed,

180
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:35,260
the medication they got was called blood. So just think about the statistics behind my father.

181
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,150
Getting one unit from somebody and somebody getting a getting factor.

182
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,760
What's it called? I can't remember fact or something.

183
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,950
Anyway, the treatment that they needed to stop the bleeding was pulled from hundreds and hundreds of of a blood samples.

184
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:57,639
So it was really common for them to have hepatitis C back then we called it not a non B hepatitis because we didn't know what it was.

185
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,790
We just knew it wasn't A or B or HIV.

186
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,590
And I know some women working in HIV that are all widows of men who they got HIV from their husbands and their husbands died.

187
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,249
So anyway, it was it was called AIDS because that's all we knew was acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

188
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,250
We didn't know what caused it. We first identified the cases in 81.

189
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,030
We didn't identify HIV until 1985.

190
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:29,890
And it's crazy because AIDS is still the name of so many different organizations and they nobody wants to change it to HIV.

191
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:37,839
I'm like, is that because you have cause you need a vowel in your name? Anyway, it's, it's it's recognized that way.

192
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,590
What can I say? But it is a stage of HIV infection.

193
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,100
It is spread through contact with blood, semen pre seminal fluid rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, breast milk of a person with HIV.

194
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:57,970
In the United States, it spread mainly by having anal or fragile sex or sharing drug injection equipment with a person who has HIV.

195
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,590
Antiretroviral therapy is the use of HIV medications to treat HIV infection.

196
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,870
It does not cure it.

197
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:15,200
It can get your viral load down in your blood to undetectable, which is an important prevention and care goal, which I'll talk about later.

198
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,280
People want to take a combination of HIV medications every day.

199
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,200
When we first, it was really when we had effective treatment.

200
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,750
It was 1996 when I used to do this, like this lecture back 20 years ago.

201
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,260
I would show these mortality slides in the U.S. among 25 to 44 year olds.

202
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,040
And in 1996, it was a very steep decline.

203
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,350
I mean, it saved lives in a way that we'd never seen before.

204
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,750
It revolutionized HIV treatment. Before 1996, it was a death sentence.

205
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:57,770
After 1996, if you took your medication and you tolerated and had health insurance, not a problem, of course.

206
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,210
Right? It was manageable.

207
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,180
And it's manageable to this day. It is still not being cured, but the medicines are evidence of that.

208
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,600
Okay. I'm going to let you peruse this on your own and not spend time on this.

209
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,550
I know you guys have the slides so you can look at it.

210
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:25,130
I find this slide kind of helpful because it gives you a sense of when it so p24 antigen comes up here.

211
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,850
HIV RNA is here. And excuse me, I was wrong.

212
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,409
Here's P24 antigen. Here's HIV, RNA and antibodies.

213
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,070
And so it helps with you understanding that when.

214
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:46,690
What you'll identify based on when you test after time of infection in the old days, the antibody tests.

215
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,940
Yes, you had to wait weeks after infection. Now they're tests that are much more sensitive than.

216
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,540
So I want to talk a little bit about surveillance methods. One of the things I find the most interesting is the state and federal roles.

217
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,580
So the dynamic of the tension between state and federal all precedes code, and it's just gotten so much worse.

218
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,810
The laws and rules governing communicable disease reporting reside at the state or city and county level.

219
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,469
I put that in there because Philadelphia is the only state I know that has some laws that are completely different from the state of Pennsylvania.

220
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,370
But I'm not from Philadelphia, but the more people I've met there,

221
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,399
I was at a meeting where the person from Philadelphia introduced himself as being from the great state of Philadelphia.

222
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,280
They really themselves is a different entity and in fact have different reporting laws in the state of Pennsylvania,

223
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,889
because I know the medical director there and she wasn't having it.

224
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:43,670
So she took, you know, well, just you know, this has to Philadelphia if we can't handle the rest the state doesn't want to go along with this.

225
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:51,650
CDC and national organizations like the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists make recommendations, not requirements.

226
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:59,029
I will probably allude to CSG a couple of times. If you're not aware of 60, I recommend that you look at their website.

227
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:04,130
They have an internship program. It's a great place to look for jobs and just know what's happening.

228
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:10,280
It used to be it used to be an organization prior to 2001 or two.

229
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:17,240
That was just for every state has a state epidemiologist, it was for the state epidemiologists.

230
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:25,399
And then what they did in the early 2000s was opened it up to being an organization for any epidemiologist that worked at a state,

231
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,209
territorial, tribal or local level or the state health department.

232
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,870
You didn't have to be the state epidemiologist. So of course, the membership got much bigger.

233
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:41,480
They worked closely with CDC to make a set policy in terms of HIV reporting.

234
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,430
The process of establishing a national HIV reporting system spanned 22 years.

235
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,829
It was 2008 before we had HIV reporting in every single state in the country.

236
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,760
And one of the last states to come in was, you know, that small state of California.

237
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,180
So we were until five years later when they let the report, the numbers come in and stabilize.

238
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:13,069
It was 2013 before our national report included every state in the country for HIV reporting the politics behind HIV reporting.

239
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,340
We had anonymous reporting. We had unique identifier reporting.

240
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,100
It was a mess. Anyway, that was more in my lecture 20 years ago.

241
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,730
We spent too much time on that now, but it took a long time. There were three.

242
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,490
One of the ways that CSG makes policy is by producing position statements.

243
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,940
I find the position statements fascinating. I recommend you look at them.

244
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,960
I thought I ran across some I hadn't seen before when I went and looked at this.

245
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,310
There is one. They have an acronym for it. Now they have a new.

246
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,650
Like, for example, when they set a case definition for COVID, it's a CSG position statement,

247
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:55,730
case reporting of any communicable disease or not communicable get set through CSG position statement process and

248
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,340
they now have a position statement for a definition of essentially people who died in the hands of the police.

249
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,540
I had no idea. It was fascinating. Anyway, you might find that interesting.

250
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:13,009
Go look at their position statement page. But there have been 37 HIV related CSG position statements over 35 years.

251
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:20,540
I coauthored about 12 of them and really worked to move policy forward across the country.

252
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this. You guys have my chapter from this textbook if you want to look at it.

253
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,940
These are the things. These are the topics that are in there. If you're interested, I will dove into some of them in more detail today.

254
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,130
Obviously, I'm not going to do all of them, but I just wanted to point that out as a resource for you.

255
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:51,360
So case ID and HIV definitions. HIV infection is defined as the presence of the virus or antibody in the blood of an infected person.

256
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,990
Stage three is severe disease and defined by low levels of immune function and or the presence of one or

257
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,380
of over 23 what we call AIDS indicator diseases and a person with confirmed or presumed HIV infection.

258
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,010
So just I'll show you the case report farming. You'll see these in a little bit.

259
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,549
But the thing that, again, just to give you the historical perspective, remember,

260
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:18,950
we didn't we saw people dying of a of these diseases that normally healthy people should get.

261
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,920
They were diseases that only occur. People with an immune suppressive condition or advanced age and.

262
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,980
So that's what we did surveillance on.

263
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,060
When I started the surveillance system of the Detroit Health Department, I started by going Henry Ford Hospital,

264
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,230
a different medical center where everybody was admitted and reviewing medical records and looking for these diseases.

265
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,820
I had a room, I had a physician who later died of AIDS,

266
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,169
who was the only one who wouldn't let me into his practice to help to work on disease surveillance.

267
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,870
And so I just went to the infection control practitioner at the hospital.

268
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:56,630
He admitted patients and said, you need to look at every one of his admins and see if they need to be reported to the Health Department.

269
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:08,300
And it was very cumbersome because it was these diseases are in the are diagnosed by an array of different clinical mostly clinical.

270
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,540
Processes. So, for example, pneumocystis pneumonia, which they don't call that anymore, they've renamed it,

271
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,040
I don't know what it is anymore because nobody has surveillance for it, but because it was too hard to find.

272
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,399
So we really wanted to move towards lab based reporting and I'll talk about that because and looking just for HIV infection.

273
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:35,270
And so HIV surveillance, which when I started it was called AIDS surveillance, was the AIDS surveillance program.

274
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,649
And then it it morphed over time. So there are some differences.

275
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,830
The changes have there have been many changes.

276
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:52,520
They have an asterisk at the bottom or the numbers of times we've changed the HIV and AIDS kit definition and classification system since 2014.

277
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:00,890
In 2014, we is the most recent one and we had to change it because to accommodate how HIV is diagnosed in the laboratory,

278
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,630
we included staging criteria and tried replacing the term AIDS.

279
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,480
But we also simply tried to simplify things. We tried to get the 23.

280
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,690
Diseases out of the case definition. But this is the part that's interesting about the process.

281
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:24,880
We had a I went to a meeting to work on the position statement that preceded this change in the case definition,

282
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:32,920
and somebody argued very strongly for not taking them out. So all these other AIDS indicator diseases are still in the case definition.

283
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,150
And as we knew what's going to happen, nobody does surveillance on them because it's too expensive and too much more work.

284
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:47,020
But these are always published in MMW hours, often in what's called recommendations and reports are special, not just part of the weekly MMW are.

285
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,940
Have you guys seen MMW as you read them? You know? Okay, good.

286
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:08,330
Which is great. Okay. Good to know. So in terms of data sources, in case finding HIV reporting is now required by every state in the U.S.,

287
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,660
data sources are primarily health care providers in laboratories,

288
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:17,090
but also include non-clinical testing sites, blood banks, plasma centers and life insurance companies.

289
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:24,709
HIV infection can be detected at any point during the progression of the disease and reportable events occur throughout the disease process,

290
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,870
and these are some examples of that.

291
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:35,569
So when when somebody is first infected, which is not the same as when they were diagnosed, we probably don't know about it until they're diagnosed.

292
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,990
And we spend a lot of money on incidents in incident HIV infection back in the

293
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,570
early 2000 and started realizing that they really parallel diagnosis trends a lot.

294
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:54,190
If you get CD4 reporting, viral load reporting, these are all different states under which you can diagnose HIV.

295
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:03,800
Obviously, if you are diagnosed with HIV, when they have under 284 cells per microliter, under 40% of total or AIDS defining illness,

296
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:10,580
that's considered a very late diagnosis, and the likelihood of them surviving it is less than if you can get them diagnosed earlier.

297
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,860
I want to talk a little bit about the flow of data to give you a sense of how complex this can be.

298
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:29,220
So, of course, we start with people who are living with HIV. And then if they're diagnosed, they they present in these various settings.

299
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:39,140
And what's reported are tests genotypes which I'll talk about in 4/2 viral loads, which is just the level of virus in the blood or CD4 count.

300
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:44,549
So over time, if you have an uncontrolled HIV infection, you have more virus in your blood.

301
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:50,340
So your viral load goes up and your CD4 count, which is measure of the strength of your immune system, goes down.

302
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,270
So low CD4 is high. Viral loads are signs of an advanced HIV infection.

303
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,200
So getting those kinds of reports was was helpful for search for disease, surveillance, genotypes,

304
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,569
r e all the strain stuff that we keep talking about with, with COVID was looking at strains of HIV.

305
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,540
And the reason for do those to do that was very different than why we're looking at it for COVID, since this isn't an airborne illness,

306
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:23,490
is because it helped you identify people who might be part of an outbreak or cluster so you could intervene and stop transmission.

307
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:32,060
The reports go from these sources to either the local city or county health department or directly to the state health department.

308
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,220
Most local, city or county health departments report directly to the state health department.

309
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,219
There is active case finding that happens. CDC funds these active case surveillance programs.

310
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,260
That's what I was funded with from CDC when I started in Detroit in 1986.

311
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:55,070
We had 85 cases of AIDS. I remember thinking how late I was getting into the game because it'd been around for four or five years.

312
00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:02,270
Little did I know. And they also fund about six or eight large city health or county health departments.

313
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:08,120
When the case reports go to CDC, they do not have the name or address or zip code.

314
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,879
They are identified. By what's called a soundings code.

315
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,960
And if any of you have a michigan driver's license and you pull it out,

316
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,580
the first four digits of your Michigan driver's license is the sound code of your last name.

317
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:31,030
It's an alphanumeric code that's done just every like for example, every Moga top is an m 231, but not every M 231 is a metal cutoff.

318
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:37,570
And so you can't go back and identify the person, but it helps, along with the first to rule out duplicates on a national level.

319
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,900
But they can't completely roll out roulette duplicates without going back to the

320
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,440
state health department because nobody above the state health department has names.

321
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,120
So I think that was a very big issue and continues probably to be from a community perspective.

322
00:32:52,570 --> 00:33:00,190
And of course, the data are used for CDC reports, city, county, state reports, website slides, infographics, news stories, etc.

323
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:08,140
I like to I think I'm a little bit of an armchair historian and I, I always like showing this early case report.

324
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,720
This one is a favorite of mine because it was the first case that we had.

325
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,190
It was actually it was the third case, we were told, the Michigan Department of Public Health back then.

326
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,380
It was case number three. And this provisional case surveillance report was like, this is just to give you a sense of how it really happens.

327
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,300
CDC sees this happening.

328
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:34,510
They've got a group of people there figured out what to do when they mock up a case report form and they write stuff on our cell,

329
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:40,690
like who took this call from a physician and Henry Ford? Richard was like,

330
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:50,110
he just retired like last three years and he'd been around for a thousand years and he was the first officer on that 2014 case definition.

331
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,370
Anyway, he took that call, which I found fascinating anyway.

332
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,760
So, you know, you see what they're doing. We didn't know what was going on. We're just trying to collect information to help figure it out.

333
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,320
So we kind of started noticing there were a lot of Haitians, so we kind of added that over here.

334
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:13,330
And if they're an immigrant, what country were they from as kind of, oh, you're not seeing my let me get the latest one.

335
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:18,770
So did it work? No, it looks.

336
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:30,850
I look, I'm looking up. I can see it on the screen. Anyway, just above where I saw the lasers, right now iPhone is on the other screen.

337
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:39,160
I had to split the display. So if you push the miles off the edge of your screen, it'll come onto the screen should anything.

338
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I'm not sure which side I'm on the screen that they're seeing.

339
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,960
If he hears the laser, can I say yes?

340
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,980
So if you take it now, they can see it.

341
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,800
Oh, the bounce. Okay. Thank you.

342
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,250
It should have been. Yeah, I was looking for the laser pointer. Okay, great, great, great, great.

343
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:14,409
Thank you. Keep that in mind as you can't see where you're pointing to what you should see.

344
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,870
I'm doing this on Zoom. I mean, I even have a separate monitor.

345
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:22,240
Still, I need to, like, more geography and just see the whole thing and need other people bounce my slides.

346
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,700
For me, this is the back half of it.

347
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:33,099
So the doctor was seeing the patient was Dr. Modified from Henry Ford, the reporting physician down there in the middle was Dr. Evelyn Fisher,

348
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:39,040
a very dear friend of mine who was involved in HIV for a very early stage.

349
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,349
She was went up to gay bars in the early eighties and just gave gay men condoms and said, we don't know what's going on here,

350
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:49,569
but I think this is a really good idea that you might want to use is just and she

351
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,649
was involved with starting one of the first AIDS service organizations in Michigan,

352
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,740
which back then was called Wellness Networks.

353
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:02,200
And now I'm on the board and it's a huge ten county community based organization, Detroit.

354
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:08,390
And what was one of our initial people that I have to say died of COVID?

355
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:22,970
It's really hard for me. I just found this really interesting because you can see what she's putting here under other pertinent information is just,

356
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,540
I don't know, whatever might help. We didn't know what was going on.

357
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,739
We were just kind of putting this on. Or did they using drugs? What kind of drugs did they get?

358
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,770
A blood transfusion. You see how they wrote that at the bottom of the screen?

359
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,850
I just found this fascinating because it just really gives you the sense of what

360
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,330
it was like on the ground as we're trying to figure out what this was about.

361
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,270
This is what the case. This is one I think this is 20% of the case report for now.

362
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,680
And I'll just I'm not going to go through it in any detail. You have the slide.

363
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,530
You can look at it. What I found interesting that I want to show you here, if you look at that little does it show it showing.

364
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,800
Yes, it is the little fluorescent arrow.

365
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,670
We are doing a very poor job at collecting HIV rates among transwomen.

366
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,110
We have anecdotal evidence and other evidence that the rates are extremely high.

367
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:21,829
But because we are talking to people to do this reporting, it comes from labs, it comes from a medical record.

368
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:28,670
But if you think doing this from lab reports, I can guarantee you that what labs collect is what they need to collect,

369
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,900
to identify it, to send it back to the provider and to bill.

370
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:38,209
They are going to ask about sex, birth and gender identity. I can just about guarantee you that.

371
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,320
So we try to collect that and it's on there, but it's difficult.

372
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:53,389
And and it's it's been a problem because, again, if you don't like well, I started working I started a small business called HIV Counts.

373
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:59,750
And my my my motto was that what is on my my website is without data, you're just another person with an opinion.

374
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:08,719
And so without the data for trans women, it makes it very hard to figure out what's going on, how to do prevention in that in that population.

375
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,640
So anyway, I just want to show you that because it's certainly something we've been working on for quite some time.

376
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,069
This just gives you a sense of of why we had to change the case definition 2014,

377
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:26,720
because there's so there's a whole group of algorithms of TV lab tests that are part of an algorithm that are used to make the case definition.

378
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:31,310
And it's difficult because sometimes the providers don't order them all at the same time.

379
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,210
So there's been some challenges around these diagnostic tests.

380
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,260
The testing and treatment history. This is all is all there.

381
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:53,050
This form is from the national case report form, not the Michigan one, which is the one I just showed you, because they took all these.

382
00:38:53,350 --> 00:39:01,500
They took all these opportunistic illnesses that make most of this up off the form because nobody reports them any names.

383
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:08,919
It's too much work and too expensive to look for them. And if anybody's on a preventive medication, they're not going to get these illnesses.

384
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,760
So it's less and less important. But I just wanted to show it to you.

385
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,379
In terms of electronic lab reporting or lab reporting, which became electronic lab reporting.

386
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,200
It wasn't always electronic, which was much more difficult.

387
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:28,290
I spent seven years working to change the law in Michigan so that we would get labs we'd be required to report.

388
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,610
But when we did it in the early 2000, we didn't require it to be electronic because not everybody did it electronically.

389
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:42,930
To this day, sometimes it's, you know, we'll send you a fax that works well.

390
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:50,280
But HIV related lab results are the main method by which health departments are notified if a newly infected

391
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,310
person or previously infected person state of HIV and it result the receipt of these test results.

392
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,370
It triggers active case finding activities. For HIV.

393
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,880
ELR is how health departments learn of a case of HIV. It is not.

394
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,090
Alone sufficient to report a case. You saw all the information. I know.

395
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,899
Went through it quickly. It's on that case report from a labs. And I'm going to give you all that.

396
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:20,020
I think of it as lab identification or lab case finding, because you can't really complete a lab report.

397
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,640
I mean, a case report for me to give you a sense of.

398
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,480
What's required. If you send a case to CDC that doesn't have race on it, they don't count it.

399
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:37,689
I mean, it's a required variable. You have to have race on it. I know this has gotten better, but when I left the Health Department in 2012,

400
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:44,620
I'd say about 50% of the cases of other sexually transmitted infections didn't have any race involved at all me reported at all.

401
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:52,870
So it's not common or normal that you would that CDC would require race in order to count the case as a case.

402
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,570
So there's a lab reporting is great, but it's not going to get you a county case.

403
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,630
And you could talk about talk and how the data are used a little bit.

404
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:07,270
Are we done for time? Okay. Okay.

405
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,820
Oh, I. So I'm going I'm using my zoom slides from the last two years where I read everything.

406
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,970
And as you can see, it's not my preferred mode of lecturing.

407
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here,

408
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,540
but I just to show you that it's not even getting electronic lab data doesn't instantly mean that you've got a case.

409
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,439
There's a whole set of procedures that have to happen.

410
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,030
The labs have to be standardized and validated. They have to be matched in the exist.

411
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,499
Any existing cases in E which is the name of the sort of the software program

412
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,050
from CDC that we use to report cases and figure out if it's a match or not.

413
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,170
Is it the same person? It's it's it's a process.

414
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,209
It's not just, oh, we look, we just dump them in.

415
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:57,690
And because ruling out duplicates is obviously quite important in terms of where we are nationally with this.

416
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:07,470
This is the state of CD4 and viral load reporting. As of December of 2021, we've made incredible progress.

417
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:13,170
The blue states all have complete reporting of CD4+ and viral loads at any level,

418
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:18,329
so even an undetectable level of viral load is reported because we want it.

419
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:22,380
We use it as an indication of someone as of a case.

420
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:32,170
It doesn't have to be a detectable level to be reported. So like Idaho, for example, labs don't require reporting of all test results.

421
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:38,659
One of the things that happened back in 93 is when we added low C-4 counts to Jade's case definition,

422
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:45,590
and it revolutionized surveillance because before then it was all those 23 AIDS indicator diseases.

423
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:52,460
And once we had a lab test that could diagnose AIDS.

424
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:59,939
Some states passed or lab reporting laws based on level, so it'd be only under 200 counts would be reportable.

425
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,730
And that's probably what's going on in Idaho and New Jersey. I don't know what's going on in New Jersey.

426
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,910
It's not like it's a low in any state the way Idaho is.

427
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:13,110
But anyway, and as you can see, as I told you earlier, the laws in Pennsylvania are different than the laws in the state.

428
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:22,540
In the state, Philadelphia. So anyway, and that's just to give you a sense of of what's going on.

429
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:33,190
So case finding activities supplement electronic lab reporting is a talked about medical chart obstruction by the staff at the site of care.

430
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,359
We work to access electronic records. This was a big deal.

431
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,080
I mean, to go to the health department like Detroit Medical Center and say, we want to look at your records electronically.

432
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:49,339
HIPA was put in place in 1996, I believe might I don't know why.

433
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:55,989
I think I know that date, but I think it was prior to HIPA which required or this was I think that the start of

434
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:01,120
electronic medical records I don't know I don't remember before that they were all on paper.

435
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,920
So you had to go to the medical records room and pull off a paper.

436
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,060
Imagine such a thing, pull off of, you know, paper.

437
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,740
My mother, who could never have just died at the age of 124 years ago,

438
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,339
I think she kept going to her doctor because she was a single doctor, didn't use electronic medical records.

439
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,950
So I went in to see him. He had her medical records.

440
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:31,330
Life looked like something like, seriously, you can find any you know, there's no control left for you, no paper, medical records.

441
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:38,560
Anyway, it's very challenging. But but once we were able to get them electronically,

442
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,600
when I went back to visit the staff after I left, they had like three, four screens up, you know,

443
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,390
with different electronic medical records and without filling out a paper case before for which we did,

444
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:53,350
they could report a case, you know, just the way you guys would think you would do it.

445
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,969
Now, when I started, I should have brought my paper chief's report forms in with me.

446
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:05,530
I have some samples because I forgot it was going to be in person. So anyway, they were carbon paper kind of.

447
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:14,110
I mean, they were triplicate in triplicate. They were this big. They had a perforation towards the top because the name was above it.

448
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:22,090
So you only sent from the perforation down to CDC in an envelope with a stamp on it to Atlanta.

449
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:33,580
I had to teach my son, like, where the stamp goes. How did you guys know where they just get it once an envelope saves a lot of work.

450
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:43,040
Excuse me. So, anyway, acts of remotely accessing electronic health records was a huge, huge.

451
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,929
Um, so, of course, I always have to tell my little stories because it's so much more fun.

452
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:53,410
So when I started the surveillance system, I was in my little office in Detroit and the file cabinet was behind me.

453
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:58,960
And we get death certificates not only to collect deaths, but also, of course, some case finding, quite late case finding.

454
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:05,030
And I got this death certificate was like, oh, okay, I'm her name sounds familiar. And I go out, turn around and pull open the medical report.

455
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:09,520
This is the answer to the questions. The person who said, What's it like to work in disease surveillance?

456
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,729
This will give you some idea. I open the file cabinet, I pull out her medical record, her file, I see her case report form.

457
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:20,380
And lo and behold, there was already a death certificate in this file.

458
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,550
Now, there's a lot of things you can do twice, but dying isn't one of them. And I was like, which?

459
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:31,630
So the first the first case to be diagnosed in Detroit receiving hospital.

460
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:37,840
Now Harper was one of the two part of the Detroit Medical Center and the other one was at the other hospital.

461
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:43,810
So both of these women had died within the Detroit Medical Center and two separate hospitals.

462
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,490
The fact that they didn't know this blows my mind anyway.

463
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:54,490
So I went over to see the infection control practitioners in Detroit receiving because they were just like hardscrabble.

464
00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:03,640
They're like on death, they're related. It turns out that the person who died the second time was the sister in law of the first case.

465
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:09,520
They have very similar names. Their names were they were within a couple of years of each other.

466
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:18,400
And it turns out that her brother, the husband of the first case who died, was a GM worker and had really good health insurance.

467
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:23,500
So when her SISTER-IN-LAW died, she took over her health insurance.

468
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:29,590
So when she showed up at the second hospital, having had a stroke, they looked at the medical record,

469
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:35,950
which for some reason didn't show that she was dead and watching.

470
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:41,830
This was so fascinating to me. So watching reading the medical record, which started out was she had AIDS.

471
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:49,900
And then I think because residents tend to embellish things as they watch what the what their what the presiding physicians do,

472
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,309
she had multiple opportunistic illnesses by the time she died.

473
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,280
I called the family and said, When did you find out that your mother had AIDS?

474
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:04,030
Oh, when we start on the death certificate, I called risk I called the risk officer at the hospital after that.

475
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,209
But it was just incredible to me that they did not know this.

476
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:13,270
She didn't have HIV. There's no evidence that she had HIV. She just was using her mother and sisters health insurance.

477
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,540
So she got her medical record at the same time, it's I love this.

478
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,570
As you can tell, I think it is enormously fascinating.

479
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:28,140
So it's great to get to talk to epidemiologists who at least have a hope of getting why I think this is so cool anyway.

480
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,440
Flow of Data Sources. This is my coauthor on my book chapters from South Carolina.

481
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:38,940
So we used South Carolina's example to give you a sense of case reports.

482
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,229
The real reason I brought this up was to show you the linkage to birth and death files,

483
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:46,560
which was an important part of the disease surveillance system. The.

484
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:54,220
Death files are mostly you can't give somebody care at that point, obviously, but at least you can know that they died.

485
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,080
And it just helps with complete report. Complete report.

486
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:03,040
We link to birth files because if a child is born to a mother who has HIV,

487
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,229
she that child will have will have antibodies, even though they don't you don't know yet whether they're infected.

488
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:16,000
And so you finding out whether the child was the child was positive, you knew that the mother was and it was the case finding technique.

489
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,370
So I just wanted to show you that. Strengths and weaknesses.

490
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:33,420
So overall active surveillance programs are funded, monitored and evaluated in 50 states, six cities and eight territories.

491
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:39,660
There are very specific standards that were set in the reevaluated by CDC on an annual basis.

492
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:48,989
The based on annual standard evaluation results, the completeness of reporting of HIV as of December of 19 is estimated to be at least 85%,

493
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:55,260
which is quite complete for a disease surveillance system in all but in all but one jurisdiction.

494
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:04,230
The implementation of implementation of MAME based reporting in all 50 states was completed in 2008.

495
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,530
Another strength is the C ust HIV subcommittee.

496
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:18,330
I would say of all the national work I've ever done, establishing the HIV subcommittee, which took me forever in 2003, was really helpful.

497
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:29,040
What was interesting about CSC history is that they, when it was all just the state epidemiologist from each state,

498
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,330
I will tell you, it was probably 80% white men and then some white women.

499
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:40,110
And when I wanted to bring the 65 surveillance coordinators into a subcommittee, I don't know what the [INAUDIBLE] happened,

500
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:44,360
but they were front, they were threatened, is how much money you're going to have by laws.

501
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:47,910
I was like, Yeah, they will conflict with 60 by laws.

502
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:55,530
It took a few years. I, I finally worked out because one of the other white guys who was really got what I was trying to do basically.

503
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:02,620
Had meetings with me and the other state employees who, you know, convinced them that I wasn't a threat.

504
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:06,819
I mean, it's really interesting because what I watched happen is now he has all these

505
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,910
other subcommittees with run by laws that do these things and meet regularly.

506
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,089
And and they still meet on the second Wednesday of every month.

507
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:18,160
In fact, the call is this afternoon, and I will be on this call and it will have over 100 people on this call.

508
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:24,490
Who and they they do surveys every year to talk about what they need from CDC and the leadership meets with CDC.

509
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:30,430
I chaired this group for four years and now it's like leadership is like 44 people because there's so much work to be done.

510
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,120
So it's just it was it was we had no way to communicate with CDC about what we wanted.

511
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:41,830
I mean, I remember the big thing was, could we have a list that would be nice even to started.

512
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:45,670
We didn't have email. I mean, just, you know, just gives you a sense of these things.

513
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,380
Another strength is is ihat is it's a relational database.

514
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:58,540
It allows for capture, recapture, evaluation. And I think it was in your slides from last week or early last time on Monday,

515
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,520
and it is allows for the use of data for linking it reengaging people in care.

516
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:10,870
This last bullet is a very important piece of why the surveillance data need to be complete.

517
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:16,120
For those of you who are aware of what we're doing, my case is anybody know what runaway funding is?

518
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,650
Few of you do. Okay. So Ryan White was a hemophiliac.

519
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:30,160
He was. He lived in Indiana. He was. People were terrified to have him in school because they didn't know how it was and how it was transmitted.

520
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,670
The the. The things that were done to help the families of hemophiliacs.

521
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:41,730
There was a family called the Ray family in Florida, and they had like three kids who were hemophiliacs, who had to who AIDS.

522
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,650
And I believe their house was burned. Kids were not allowed to go to school.

523
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,710
People were terrified. And you understood it on some level.

524
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,370
But the house burning, I think it's gone a little too far.

525
00:52:54,570 --> 00:53:01,559
Brian White did a lot of work. He worked with Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor and had a big national perspective.

526
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,810
And when he died of AIDS, they named the Ryan White Care Act after him.

527
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:15,510
And it was it is the source of medical care for people living with HIV and is the funder of last resort.

528
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:20,540
So if you have insurance, it doesn't kick in. But if you don't have insurance, Brian White kicks in it.

529
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:25,020
And the funding from Roy White comes from course of Health Resources Services Administration.

530
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:32,730
And they really get the whole issue of sort of the need for wraparound care that people.

531
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:43,170
The transportation is an issue that there are a lot of issues around what people need in order to actually get their medication.

532
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:53,519
I'll give you a little example. I I was sort of mentoring a grad student here in Michigan who's a young black man and he's HIV positive.

533
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,620
And he came over we were talking about his dissertation and I said, So are you taking your meds?

534
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:03,060
He's like, No. I'm like, You would start with why you can't take your medication.

535
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,700
Well, because I have to go to North Campus to get them. And I don't have a car like you have to go to north.

536
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:14,040
Just these little barriers. You want to know why people don't take their meds, things like that.

537
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:21,100
It's not like. And I happen to live next door to somebody who was running the health service at the time.

538
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,250
I'm like, why do you have why are the meds on the main campus?

539
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,890
And I don't know whether they were or not, but they were after that. And he got on his meds.

540
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,670
But they're real issues around heroin, white people who are growing white.

541
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:40,770
They have a viral suppression rate of like 87%. That is really high.

542
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:47,520
We are not good at getting these meds out to people and we can people would be much healthier if we could figure out all the wraparound stuff.

543
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,880
HIV data are the basis of the Ryan White formula,

544
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:58,019
and the way that I got the labs was changed in Michigan is I told people that that we

545
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:02,249
had we were underreporting cases and that the data were used to bring money around.

546
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:07,140
So I had to tell them, bring money into the state. It was easy to pass it off to that.

547
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:13,290
Just to give you a sense of how much money that is in fiscal year 2020,

548
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:22,950
it was $2,388,781,000 distributed to the States for incentives for Ryan White for care money.

549
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:28,350
So getting it reported is important. HIV Surveillance Weaknesses.

550
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,970
The surveillance systems vary in maturity across the states, as you saw.

551
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,110
Not all states, even the states that were dark blue in that map, that have complete reporting,

552
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,640
don't all have electronic or otherwise for all 34 counts of viral loads.

553
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:53,690
I was doing it at a state in the South like 2016, 2017, and they still had people like entering from a paper case report,

554
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,830
a paper map report into the into the surveillance system.

555
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:05,749
It only includes people diagnosed with HIV and who reported confidentially, confidentially.

556
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:10,309
The long asymptomatic state means that up to a fifth of infected people are not diagnosed,

557
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:17,450
although the 2021 estimate was 13% increase in demands on surveillance programs occurs

558
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:24,200
as funding decreases and challenges with reporting from the 2014 testing algorithm.

559
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,269
So slides I added from work that I didn't have last year that I wanted to talk about

560
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:34,940
where the technological weaknesses were working with cumbersome data technologies.

561
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,509
And we're also behind on the whole data data modernization that they're trying to do.

562
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:44,780
And I, I would suggest, if you're interested all in this,

563
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:52,280
that you look at some of the links I have on this slide that the need to, you know, it's fun, it's funny.

564
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,809
People always had this feeling like this throughout the government is out to get me

565
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:00,379
and they have this one really big database that they know everything about you.

566
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,360
But I'm thinking, don't I wish they had a database like that?

567
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:13,160
Because I can tell you they don't. And they have I mean, they don't understand.

568
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:21,530
This is an example of how Chicago is working to address incompatible databases for the purposes of identifying clusters of HIV.

569
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,979
They didn't try to get all these data systems to work together.

570
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,930
They created this enclave which took use just as program to to look at the results

571
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:34,910
of what was in these different sources of data in order to generate these.

572
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:43,340
We need to look companies to look in order to generate this aligned list and prioritize people that might be in a cluster.

573
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:49,219
And this is just I mean, people are still doing things with Excel databases and spreadsheets.

574
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:55,070
And even recently, somebody and one health department are still using access databases.

575
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:59,070
Many of you never worked with access. It's okay.

576
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:03,210
As long as you don't need the Internet, it's fine. It works just fine.

577
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:09,810
It's not great. I remember I said we had access databases.

578
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:17,639
In terms of the obvious thing is, so what happened in 2020?

579
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,370
You might ask the HIV surveillance.

580
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:30,719
So we had a 17% decrease in cases between 2019 and 2020, which is what our CDC says should be interpreted with caution.

581
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,880
That's the Regeneron statement due to the impact of the pandemic on access to testing,

582
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:40,380
care related services, case surveillance activities, and state and local jurisdictions.

583
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:50,310
And then, of course, just getting testing materials during 20 I what I would call into the the the monthly CSG subcommittee calls.

584
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,660
Everybody had staff that were being detailed to the COVID.

585
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,750
They were losing, they were just taking them out of the HIV surveillance programs.

586
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,170
They knew they understood surveillance and sticking them in comfort.

587
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,559
And people asked me whether there was a consultant that was doing a lot of COVID work.

588
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,640
I said, No, I'm doing HIV work for the people at the health departments that are doing COVID.

589
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,060
Because they still had to do that.

590
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:18,110
The lack of sufficiently funding our public health infrastructure, of course, came into stark view in the last several years.

591
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:26,809
I talked to bills. They were they were detailed to COBRA and detailing field staff for HIV STI SGI and is related to

592
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:32,299
increases in syphilis and reduced STI screening and diagnosis led to decrease in San Clemente.

593
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,690
Let me talk a little bit about why that is and not just gloss over that.

594
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:41,240
So field staff with cases of syphilis because syphilis.

595
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:51,300
Chlamydia is the most. We have more cases of Clemente than any other specific individual communicable disease.

596
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,930
There would never be enough staff to go out and talk to all the different people who have chlamydia.

597
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:00,150
But syphilis is is it used to be a manageable number.

598
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:07,620
So when you have the field staff that used to go out to somebody's house who had syphilis and found out who their partners were,

599
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:15,479
trying to get them into care, they also we also have the same with so I think we finally passed it here in Michigan called expedited partner

600
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,930
therapy where you can give the person the penicillin and they can give it to their partners because it's curable.

601
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:26,400
These are curable diseases. And of course, it leads to congenital syphilis.

602
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:32,580
And seeing increases in congenital syphilis from a disease that is manageable and treatable is a crime.

603
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:36,720
I mean, that is just so. But Koven, you know.

604
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:49,090
As I said to your TA earlier on, I said 20 was just a [INAUDIBLE] show, you know, on every possible level and it didn't help with,

605
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:55,920
with what was happening to it was and then there was reduced screening so people didn't know they had chlamydia.

606
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:02,290
It was asymptomatic. And so we saw it looked like we had the rates going down because we weren't testing.

607
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:10,630
Do you still remember when a certain previous president came on the scene and said, if you don't test, you don't have cases.

608
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:15,350
Problem solved. It was a very painful time.

609
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:22,300
This very thing is not rock. You're right.

610
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:32,070
You know, I do want to show you before everyone.

611
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,210
Um. Let's see, where was I? Okay.

612
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:48,450
So, anyway, so the 20, the 2020 SD surveillance report just released in April talked about what happened to those different numbers.

613
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:53,910
So, you know, cases committee didn't really drop just that we weren't testing.

614
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:01,710
So there you go. Using surveillance data to monitor HIV prevention and care.

615
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,840
Oh, good. I'm glad we're at this point. Okay.

616
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:12,689
So HIV surveillance data uses have evolved over time influence by changing case definitions, reporting policies and practices,

617
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:18,210
effective therapy and expansion of testing and new testing and technologies like rapid in-home testing.

618
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,830
Historically, HIV data was used only to monitor the epidemic.

619
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:28,140
It was understood, and our agreements with the community were the data were used.

620
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:38,129
As a report that would describe how many cases we had an X and Y groups they were it

621
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:44,580
was not used to identify individuals in terms of using the data to notify partners.

622
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:50,510
A very traditional public health activity has never really been uniformly accepted.

623
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,110
You can imagine now it's even worse.

624
01:02:53,100 --> 01:03:01,470
And this is a really interesting article that I recommend to the World Bank Quarterly, where she and her other coauthors,

625
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:07,409
Pat Sweeny, talked about using surveillance data as a foundation for improving care and prevention.

626
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:15,780
Because what happened was before when we first started, we just got reports of HIV, when we started getting reports of C force in viral loads.

627
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:21,689
If you think about this, we knew who wasn't in care now, so we knew somebody who had HIV.

628
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,579
They had an out of control viral load.

629
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:34,110
And although c for the idea that we didn't use this information to try to get these people back into care felt irresponsible.

630
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:42,540
We had a number of of of consultations nationally to talk with the community about that, to get the community behind the need to do this.

631
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:50,760
And and that support happened. And so there started to be really a change in how the surveillance data were used.

632
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:55,910
This paradigm shifting paradigm and broadening data used for prevention programing,

633
01:03:55,950 --> 01:04:04,770
supporting care and treatment outcomes to evaluate the national HIV AIDS Strategy goals and what they called data for Public Health Action.

634
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:12,090
But I want to talk about the ethical considerations around using the data in that way.

635
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:20,260
Public health surveillance data if they're used to protect, maintain and improve the health of the public, which I think is our responsibility.

636
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:27,610
They have to be acquired and used for legitimate public health purposes and they must be stored securely.

637
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:35,020
We have to recognize the use of public health. Surveillance data may conflict with individual interests because of stigmatizing

638
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:40,690
and potential legal consequences for highly stigmatized infections like HIV.

639
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:46,630
Scrupulous attention to how the data are collected, protected and used is vital to disease control efforts.

640
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,160
And if used at the individual level, the reason should be to improve the health of the individual.

641
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,590
The data to care example is the what I was talking about in trying to get people back into care.

642
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:01,749
I want to see I use the term legitimate public health purposes and didn't define it.

643
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:08,410
And I think that's important to understand. Legitimate public health purposes include efforts to prevent disease or premature death,

644
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:11,590
promote health among members of a community through activities,

645
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:17,350
several examples of which are in the Centers for Disease Control Security confidentiality guidelines.

646
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:24,730
Examples include assessing health needs, health status of a community, developing public health policy,

647
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:30,909
responding to public health needs in emergencies like, for example, a respiratory spread, a virus of pandemic proportions.

648
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:35,080
Just use your imagination and evaluating public health programs.

649
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:45,040
I'm emphasizing this because the responsibility to keep the information confidential and use it for those purposes is important.

650
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,330
But I will still tell you in a lecture that I'm not going to be doing for you.

651
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:53,860
All right. Now is is that HIV is still criminalized in many states.

652
01:05:54,190 --> 01:06:02,290
And so it it is. In fact, if you would know that you have HIV and you have sex with somebody who then

653
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:06,670
tells says that you didn't tell them whether they even got infected or not,

654
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:14,170
you can end up in jail. And I actually gave you a couple of of links to some really interesting articles on criminalization.

655
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:20,620
I think it's important. One of them is a story about what happened to somebody, what it was like for him in some states.

656
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,800
I mean, you know, I think Nebraska had an infamous spitting case, you know, like I was spit on.

657
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:32,229
This guy needs to go to jail because he spit on me and that's HIV, even though, of course, it's not a mode of transmission.

658
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:36,340
So the the emphasis on legitimate public health purposes when the criminalization,

659
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:42,940
the criminal system is is when HIV is criminalized in various states.

660
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:50,910
Is very important and it and if you want the community to be working with you, they need to trust you.

661
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:58,170
You need to build trust with the community. And they need to understand what it is that you're doing with the data.

662
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:04,650
Adequate legal and other controls for protecting privacy of health related information and discrimination have to be developed,

663
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:09,030
and use of individual level data, including for legitimate public health purposes,

664
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:16,020
should incorporate input from those directly affected by such use during the design of the programs and on an ongoing basis.

665
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,820
Security confidentiality is vital to a successful surveillance program.

666
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:27,520
Ongoing stigma and criminalization underscore the need to keep identifying information secure with access,

667
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:33,339
limited on a need to know basis, and a current security and confidentiality policy with regular trainings.

668
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:37,360
A requirement of CDC funding of active surveillance programs.

669
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:48,180
I see. I've got 10 minutes, so I'm going to. These national.

670
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,360
This infographic displays CDC HIV prevention priorities.

671
01:07:51,360 --> 01:08:00,329
And I'm showing it to you because the the goals here in this shaded area all use surveillance data to

672
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:06,540
measure their success attain and evaluate the success of goals to reduce transmission of HIV is in red.

673
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:10,049
Identify people who appear to be out of care and offer them assistance.

674
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:18,000
To return to care is in purple and blue is the rapidly detected interrupt active transmission for clusters and outbreaks.

675
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:23,520
Ending the HIV epidemic is something that started in 2017 that certain previous president

676
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,770
I was mentioning announced this during the State of the Union address in 2017.

677
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,350
I was like stunned that he was doing this.

678
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:36,510
So what I heard was she wanted to cure something and they told him cancer wasn't likely something he could do.

679
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:47,700
So so. So Fauci at all figured out how to, you know, how to have a phobia to HIV and started this whole and in HIV epidemic and.

680
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:54,249
Oh. These are all important goals.

681
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:58,150
And they're not in conflict with the National HIV AIDS Strategy.

682
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:06,040
The problem is, when you give money to people, you have to be able to give it to people who can spend it and you have to put it and

683
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:09,510
not have it conflict with the rehearsal money that they're getting from Ryan White.

684
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:16,440
And it's just this is like, I'm not gonna say this, but it's like, oh, my God, it's like using them.

685
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,380
It's like using them. Oh, yeah.

686
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:24,160
It's just coordination, coordination, coordination. It's just crazy.

687
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,220
When politics get involved, it's never a good thing.

688
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:38,620
Anyway, bettering HIV prevention goals is another role of surveillance, because if you think about it, how do we know people with HIV are diagnosed?

689
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:43,390
How do we know they're linked to care? How do we know the retained in care? How do we know they're virally suppressed?

690
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:49,179
Oh, it would be this part I showed you back when I showed you the whole thing about how we do reporting and what we report.

691
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:57,650
That's how we know those things. The National surveillance system is the primary source of data used to monitor the epidemic in the United States.

692
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:01,910
Oh, but we're going to use some data. Okay. This is. These are from the national.

693
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:05,630
National data from CDC. And I find this I love this stuff.

694
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:14,359
So. This is estimated HIV incidence among black African-American males over age 13 between 2010 and 2019.

695
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,739
And as I think you can see, the purple line is the 13 to 24 year olds.

696
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:24,650
An asterisk at the end means it's a statistically significant change, either increase or decrease.

697
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,380
And so you can see what's happening with the the the.

698
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,670
Now, can you see my cursor? Is it working away?

699
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:40,760
I'm not going to do that. We'll just talk and you'll know what I'm looking at. But the purple line and the gold line.

700
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:47,780
And so what you can see now is that over time, we need to be paying more attention to what's happening with 25 to 34 year olds.

701
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:54,830
And at a glance, this kind of data show you what's happening and where you might want to expend your money to spend your money.

702
01:10:54,830 --> 01:11:01,670
And the numbers are are actually quite high. The 13 to 24 year olds in that purple might start out in about 35,000 cases.

703
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:08,040
And by the end of the decade, I think it was down to about in the in the mid-thirties.

704
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:13,760
So I find this these kinds of things to be very helpful in looking at the by three different races ethnic groups.

705
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,079
I think you'll find interesting Hispanic males similar kind of thing.

706
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:24,980
The numbers going down in the purple, the 13 to 24 year olds, numbers going up among the 25 to 34 year olds.

707
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:30,110
And then let's look what's happening with white males where it just looks a little bit different.

708
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:35,840
And you can see that this is actually quite stable among that 25 to 34 year olds.

709
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:42,290
And if you think this has anything to do with access to health care, just throwing that out there, look, look, look at that gold line.

710
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:47,900
And Hispanic males and black males. Look at that line among white males.

711
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:51,980
Go one. I just find this really interesting.

712
01:11:53,330 --> 01:12:00,320
There are statistically significant drops among the 13 to 24 year olds and the 35 to 44 year olds.

713
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:03,709
I don't think we know excuse me, the 45 to 54 year olds.

714
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:09,060
I don't think we saw that. And these other groups, there were they were much more stable.

715
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,610
And then for women, what I wanted to show you was this is a little bit different.

716
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:19,220
These are cases that regardless of of age group, just by by racial group.

717
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:25,220
And you can see clearly that the majority of women living with HIV in this country are black.

718
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:29,239
It's close to 55,000 black women.

719
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:34,790
And we've had a significant decrease. And you can see the numbers are lower and stable, white and Hispanic.

720
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:40,400
This this slide is from a website called AIDS View.

721
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:44,110
I tried to get them to change to view HIV, but they.

722
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,510
Now it's age view. It's always going to be an interview anyway.

723
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:54,420
I think the technical advisory committee for 11 years since they started 11 years ago, I know that's not happening.

724
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:59,249
But anyway, they do these wonderful infographics, so feel free to play around with this website.

725
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:03,690
And you can see because they, they, they're very good at picturing these things.

726
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:09,780
So you can see that the rate among black males with an HIV diagnosis is 8.3 times that of white males.

727
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,890
For Spanish males, that rate is two point ratios, 2.9.

728
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:21,749
For black females, 18.2 the rate among black females living the diagnosis of HIV compared to white females.

729
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:27,990
And this is true in every state for this. I've never seen a place where this disparity doesn't exist.

730
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:36,830
It's less of a disparity among Hispanic females. I'm just going to stop here.

731
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:47,510
I'm going to just show you a few funny little things we do with data and PR and then spend the last 5 minutes,

732
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:55,070
see if anyone has any questions or comments. So this under you equals you undetectable equals and transmittable as it was.

733
01:13:55,100 --> 01:14:03,050
It is a big PR push that happened when we realized that really if it's people who are on medication and their viral load is undetectable,

734
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:08,000
they don't transmit HIV to their sexual partners or drug using partners.

735
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:16,040
And so there's been a lot of push of this you equals, you think to it to try to get people into care.

736
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:22,669
And so this is from the this one's from the International Aid Society. This one I love is from an organization called Love Leads here.

737
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,070
And they have some great pictures that I thought were great.

738
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:34,700
And then this one is also from this is from the UK just kind of said 85% of people diagnosed with HIV in the UK are not infectious,

739
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:39,080
meaning that they're having undetectable viral loads.

740
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:48,850
The Prep campaign is a big one because what's happening with pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is a pill that provides up to 99% protection from HIV.

741
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:53,500
And it's it's for HIV negative people who think they may be exposed to HIV.

742
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,740
The most of the people who need it are black males, and most of the people who take it are white men.

743
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:07,660
The disproportionate naledi involved in it is I was at a board meeting the other day and

744
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:12,580
two of the three gay men on the board were showing each other their monkey pox vaccine.

745
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:17,229
And then the third guy said, Mike, let's just not that exciting.

746
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:22,240
I don't really think I need to look, you know, I'm getting it out.

747
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:27,820
But we're already seen as racial disparities in monkeypox, and the rates are higher among black and Hispanic men than they were among whites.

748
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:34,479
Who's getting vaccinated? Just take a wild guess. Disproportionally like I mean, I'm glad are getting it interested.

749
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,930
It needs to, you know, be given to other people as well. So anyway,

750
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,519
I just want to conclude that the HIV surveillance data are considered to be the most

751
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,870
complete for any communicable disease that used to inform prevention and care programs.

752
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:50,590
Their foundation through the foundation of our nation's response.

753
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:56,020
Black men and women bear a disproportionate HIV burden and increasing routine testing,

754
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:59,950
linking and retaining people in care along with a cure which would be really helpful.

755
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:06,910
Providing a r, t and combating stigma discrimination are critical components of reaching the goal of ending the epidemic.

756
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:11,379
Here's some websites for you to look at for HIV data.

757
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:16,480
And then I. I threw in some graphics for you guys to look at.

758
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:22,500
This is just an example. One of the maps for AIDS for you and I will end there and see if people have

759
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,870
because you have been screaming out comments or questions while I was talking.

760
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:35,350
Does anybody have anything they want to ask for, say or. Why don't you go ahead?

761
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:39,549
Okay. First of all, this was really fantastic.

762
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:47,470
Thank you so much. My colleague and I here actually working with pediatric HIV in West Africa.

763
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:50,540
And one question that really came to mind is like,

764
01:16:50,560 --> 01:17:04,240
do you have any advice for individuals who are working on projects that are kind of like creating the baseline for surveillance of any any disorder,

765
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:11,590
illness or disease? Because I know sometimes it kind of feels like we're groping in the dark since this is hasn't been done before in that context.

766
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:15,820
So do you have any general advice or restate the specific question?

767
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:26,799
Do you have any advice about like what questions to ask ourselves as like you're developing a new baseline surveillance specific to disease,

768
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:33,730
illness disorders? You know, I'm flashing through here because I want to get my contact information.

769
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:38,770
So if you want to contact me, you can like my email address is on the bottom of that.

770
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:48,969
So you've got the slides, too. Yes, that's true. So, I mean, part of why I showed you that first case report form, as you can see what it's like.

771
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:57,250
I mean, it's getting people to understand the need to collect the data and then you'll feel you feel your way through what you need to do.

772
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:00,700
And if there's I mean it but it's the politics are crazy.

773
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,459
One of the first things I have when I started as a consultant was to go to go out and help them set up their surveillance system.

774
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:09,790
And I was told by the people I was working with, they're not going to do it by name.

775
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,150
It's a nonstarter. I'm like, Oh, my God.

776
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:22,030
And because all the all the endo going in, these three last names were Patel and all the Afro Guyanese had some other really common last name.

777
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:27,040
And I'm like, So you're using an identified that's based on the last name to tell people apart,

778
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:34,300
but they were like, No, you can't do it this way, blah, blah, blah. I end up with a meeting and I finally I'm trying to delicately bring this up.

779
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:38,560
And Haiti was doing it by name, which had more cases, nobody else in the Caribbean.

780
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:46,360
And and this guy says to me, Are you trying to tell me that we're using a system, we're trying to set up a system that's been shown not to work?

781
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:53,739
I said, yes, that is what we're doing here. The politics were like, Look, it's not going to happen.

782
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:54,610
I have no idea.

783
01:18:54,610 --> 01:19:00,249
Spending some time in Guyana, they really needed to deal with food borne illnesses, in my opinion, much more than they need to deal with HIV cases.

784
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:04,540
But anyway, it was. And what to do with all those plastic water bottles.

785
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:10,780
But anyway, it's going to depend on the context of where you were, Jim, know, where you're working.

786
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:16,569
And I think it's really getting people's trust, the issue around the community not being separate.

787
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:21,729
And I think as epidemiologists, I mean, when people first was like, I have to talk to people in the community,

788
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:24,970
I'm like, I'm just talking to the doctors and the nurses and the people from the lab.

789
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:32,770
But you have to do that. You have to get out of your office and talk to the people who are living with this illness and understand it.

790
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,140
Because you I mean, in turn, there's lots of stuff I do on clusters and and.

791
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:42,430
An example of like the whole thing with clusters was, you know,

792
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:49,420
they had an outbreak in Massachusetts and they wanted to take this testing ban because it was among those people living underneath this viaduct.
