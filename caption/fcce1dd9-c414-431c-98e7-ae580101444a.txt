00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,580
Welcome to EPID 634's module on dynamic models. In this module,

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,640
I'll provide a definition of a dynamic model.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:19,160
The learning objectives of this module are to define the properties of a dynamic model and to to contrast a dynamic model with a static model,

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:29,220
a statistical model and a kinematic model. So what is a dynamic model, a dynamic model has many features.

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:38,070
First, a dynamic model is a model whose structure explicitly defines the forces that cause change using first principles.

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,850
That's a mouthful. We will delve into more in more detail shortly about what we mean by forces

7
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,840
that cause change and what we mean when we say we say using first principles.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
Second, a dynamic model evolves over time.

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:06,500
And third, a dynamic model predicts future trends or trajectories based on current conditions and forces causing the changes.

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,590
A dynamic model as defined here is inherently a mechanistic model,

11
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:18,990
which is what I mean when I say ma a model based on first principles that define forces causing change.

12
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,490
So let's now go into more detail about the features that I mentioned above. First, by talking about processes that evolve over time.

13
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:34,710
Second, by talking about how forces that caused the processes to evolve over time is defined by first principles and third,

14
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:45,790
by talking about how dynamic models predict future change. Let's look at two dynamic processes as examples of how they evolve over time.

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,730
In Iowa or located in northern Michigan.

16
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:58,750
Scientists have observed over decades a very predictable interaction between predator wolves and they prey moose.

17
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:07,930
As you can see from the graph, in the early 1970s, there was a sharp increase in wolf population.

18
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:17,860
This increase, this increased population size overexploit of the moose population, which slowly decreased in population.

19
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:27,220
This decrease in prey for the wolves resulted in a sharp decline in the wolf population during the late 70s.

20
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,980
That's relaxing the predation on moose. The moose subsequently started to increase.

21
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:47,310
In the Papuan population during the 80s and 90s. The increased prey resource resulted in the wolf population rebounding in the early 1990s.

22
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:57,750
In the 90s and early 2000s, this is an excellent example of a dynamic process evolving over time, evolving over time.

23
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:06,540
The observed time course is predictable, giving the prey given the prey predator relationship between the moose and Wolf.

24
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,880
A second example of a dynamic process evolving over time is the time course of

25
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:20,430
daily covered cases in Michigan from March 2020 through to early to January 2021.

26
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:28,890
We observe here two outbreaks, the first in March, when there was a sharp increase in cases peaking in early April,

27
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,960
followed by a slow decline plateauing by early June.

28
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:41,370
And then slowly increasing during the summer, this plateau continued until early October,

29
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,460
when there was a sharp increase in cases peaking in early November.

30
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:57,630
Since then, the cave count has steadily been decreasing. This is yet another nice example of a dynamic system evolving over time.

31
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,550
I would like to contrast these dynamics with a static modeling approach.

32
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:13,170
Classic risk assessment. We're interested in estimating the probability that the occurrence of an adverse an occurrence of an adverse health event.

33
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,530
Likewise, in epidemiology, we are often interested in metrics like case fatality rate,

34
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,050
which parenthetically is not a rate, but a proportion of static models are useful.

35
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,400
And in this case, highlights disparities between whites and blacks.

36
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:38,000
So we can see from these examples that a dynamic model and process evolve over time.

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,910
Next, let's look at what I mean by saying that a dynamic model is based on first principles.

38
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,950
I would like to do this by first contrasting dynamic models with statistical models.

39
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:59,370
Statistical models are used to take data from, for example, patients and summarize those data estimating relationships between exposures and outcomes.

40
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,710
Statistical model is therefore used in inductive reasoning to come up with

41
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,800
generalizations that are based on specific observations about the association between,

42
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,570
for example, being exposed to a contaminant and having a specific disease.

43
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,060
Through the analysis of data, hypotheses can be tested in practice,

44
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,200
we often develop a null hypothesis and observe whether or not the null hypothesis is supported.

45
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:35,610
Mechanistic models, on the other hand, are formulated through first principles based on what we know about dynamic processes.

46
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,100
For example, we know that when a susceptible person comes into contact with an infectious person,

47
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,910
a transmission event can occur after a latency period.

48
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:52,350
The exposed individual becomes infectious for a period of time and then recovers by codifying this process.

49
00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:01,740
Using equations, we can make statements about causality, using deductive reasoning, enabling us to generate hypotheses that we observe.

50
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,230
These models can inform each other.

51
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:13,560
For example, results from a mechanistic model can inform data collection that can be subsequently analyzed through statistical models.

52
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,730
On the other hand, results from a statistical model can either help validate or invalidate a mechanistic model structure.

53
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:31,450
If it invalidates the model, we need to go back to first principles and to make appropriate revisions to the model.

54
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:41,840
So let's look at a few examples of a dynamic processes. One, a simple transmission process, and the other is simple population process.

55
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:51,170
In both examples, we are predicting changes in the future as specified by the left hand side of the equals sign.

56
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,060
The prediction is summarized on the right hand side of the equals sign where the parameters

57
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,760
are describe describe the forces that are causing change in the transmission model.

58
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:10,010
The example, the forces, a transmission event which summarizes a contact rate and infectivity in the population growth example.

59
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:15,200
The force is this is summarized as a per capita growth rate parameter.

60
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,820
Lastly, the parameters in combination with the current state of the system is used to predict the future.

61
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:31,340
This can be contrasted with a Kinnick manic model that simply described changes over time through a time varying function,

62
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,270
but does not represent a description of the forces here.

63
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:42,170
The pragmatic nature of temperature trends is described by assign function.

64
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:52,830
Why is this not a dynamic model? Because his mall does not explicitly describe the forces that are causing temperature to change.

65
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,660
So lastly.

66
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:03,120
There are two important definitions to be aware of and distinguish between state variables are variables that track the state of the system.

67
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,720
For example, population size or the number of susceptible is infectious and immune parameters

68
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,670
are factors that represent the forces that cause changes in the state variables.

69
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,380
For example, transmission rate parameters and growth rate parameters.

70
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:29,070
Transmission rate parameters describe to forces the contact rate of individuals a social factor and the infectivity of a pathogen a biological factor.

71
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:37,200
We'll talk more about these parameters later in the course. In sum, a dynamic model describes how the state of this system evolves over time.

72
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,482
By explicitly codifying the forces that act upon the current state of the system.
