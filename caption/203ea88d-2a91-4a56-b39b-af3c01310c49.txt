1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,510
Okay, everyone, let's get started on today's recitation section.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:27,020
So we're going to work on some calculation of some integration problems today just to get used to this double integration.

3
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,730
So before we got to, I got started on the actual exercise.

4
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:39,590
Um, just have one, have a quick. Description or introduction about the stable integral.

5
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,450
So we used the girls, we started using the girls when we introduced this by very random variables.

6
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:57,230
So the double in the girls essentially is deriving extension of the standard integration for a single, random or single variable.

7
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:08,060
So we can consider this double integration as doing as calculating the volume for this function in the three dimensional space on a particular region.

8
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:19,230
Okay. So. Compared to the standard integration of a single variable which is calculating the area under the curve.

9
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,110
This is calculating the volume under. A service.

10
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:34,680
Right. If you can draw this function, this, uh, the function which is a binary function of X and Y,

11
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,630
it's going to be a surface in this three dimensional space.

12
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,050
All right. And if you just focus on the particular region in this x y plan.

13
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:59,400
So that's a plant in this. That's a region in this two dimensional plane, x span by this x axis and a y axis.

14
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:08,310
Then you have a region there, right? So this double integration of this spiral function on this region, ah, is essentially calculating.

15
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,380
Assume that if you project your from this region onto the surface, onto this functional surface,

16
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,670
that's essentially this calculating the volume of this of this thing.

17
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:39,540
That's the double integration. Okay. So that's throughout the extension of the integration calculating instead of toggling RVO and calculating volume.

18
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:49,200
So that's what we're always about. So with that, we can start working on this integration, see how to solve double integration in practice.

19
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,400
So why don't we start with something easier?

20
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,970
So first example, we have this function defining this way.

21
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,640
These are the one minus X squared, minus Y squared. And the region of interest, is this a square area?

22
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,620
0 to 1, 0 to 1 for both X and Y? So what is that, our integration.

23
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:18,600
Of this function. So take a couple of minutes to try to solve this problem.

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,930
Again, keep in mind what we are trying to do is to calculate the volume of this function in this area.

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:05:03,890
Okay. We are working on this double integration problem.

26
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,420
So you take out a piece of. Paper try to solve this problem.

27
00:05:39,470 --> 00:06:41,470
Okay. When you finished, just show me your hand, okay? Okay.

28
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,530
Did you get it? I need another minute.

29
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,250
How many of you have solved this problem? Good.

30
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:04,560
Okay, so let's look at this together. So, first of all, we can roughly draw what the function is looks like in this three dimensional space.

31
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:14,090
Essentially, it's going to be a curve right in this three dimensional space, and it's going to intersect with this x z plan.

32
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:27,500
Use. The function intersected with the zipline with this parabola half parabola and intersect with the y z plan with another hot parabola.

33
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,360
So it will cut across the x y plan and reach the next one.

34
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:39,440
If both X and Y equal an active one. So that's one of the function log like we can imagine in this three dimensional space.

35
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:49,910
So essentially this double integration is about calculating the volume of this function on this square area where X and Y from 0 to 1.

36
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,380
Okay. Mathematically, to solve this, you can solve it.

37
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,250
By first integrating Oprah y and then integrating over X.

38
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:08,350
So if we integrate the inner part, the inner integration, we can as we discuss in class, we can treat acts as a constant.

39
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,700
Right. And just consider this function as a function of why and say what is integration.

40
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,900
So if you take that part out. So essentially we are doing this.

41
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:30,000
Integration in our integration and we can find the original function was derivative is

42
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,980
this guy is going to be one minus X squared times Y minus one over three Y to the third.

43
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:47,820
Right if you take the derivative with respect to y, I gave you exactly the function in the middle and then you evaluate it from 0 to 1.

44
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,650
And that's. One minus X squared, minus one over three.

45
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:01,640
Right. Why are the words two or three minus a square?

46
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:11,120
And then you can solve the outer integration. So integrate this new function that you got from the inner integration.

47
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,730
And it's integrated over X. That's going to be.

48
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,430
Two over three x minus one over 3x2 the third, and again evaluated from 0 to 1.

49
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,240
And the result is going to be one third.

50
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:38,670
Okay. So I hope you all got it. So that's the. A relatively straightforward example of integration.

51
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,600
But things can be more complicated, right? Depending on how the region look like.

52
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,140
In this particular case, since it's a square region, you can freely change the order of integration.

53
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,560
So what I'm doing here is first integrate outward and then integrate with integrate acts.

54
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,120
Or you can do it the other way around. Become first integrate acts.

55
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,210
And then you're going to y essentially everything stays the same.

56
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:16,350
In fact, in practice for this for this type of problems, you can always do it the other way to double check your solution.

57
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:24,510
If you are not certain whether you got the right answer or not, the two different approaches would give you exactly the same result.

58
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:32,240
So things can be complicated if even if we just change this region.

59
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,890
Originally, we have this square region.

60
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:45,020
So integrating acts, integrating why it doesn't really change your integration limit or in the integration boundary.

61
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:55,330
But if the region. Has something to do with X and Y, then this could quickly become quite complicated.

62
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:07,180
So in this case, we are considering another region which is defined by both X and Y, namely the circle in the quarter, circle in the first quadrant.

63
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,140
I assume this is your x y plan. So we're just going to integrate that function.

64
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,490
In this area. Okay. The same function.

65
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:28,890
But we integrated a slightly different region. So now try to.

66
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:38,240
Solve this problem. Okay. So again, we may solve this problem.

67
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,000
You can solve this integration by first integrating the inner part and then the outer part.

68
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,980
It doesn't really matter which one you take on the inner part.

69
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,550
Either you do it the Y first or two acts first since it's symmetric essentially the same thing.

70
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:08,740
Okay. What do you need to be? Careful, is that if I say you want to do a Y first, that is to say for a fixed x value, you integrate along these lines.

71
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,170
All right. So one thing to be particularly careful about is what is the integration limit?

72
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,420
You are not integrating from 0 to 1 anymore is from zero to something.

73
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,880
So. Why don't you take another couple minutes trying to solve this?

74
00:12:29,180 --> 00:15:41,640
See whether you can get it. Okay.

75
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,040
I hope you at least you got the inner part. So let's look at the inner part first.

76
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,409
So. This new region.

77
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:57,570
When we do the integration, the most important thing and the most tricky part is to determine this integration limit for the inner part.

78
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:07,110
So let's say if we start with the integration over why that is to say you can fix a particular value of X, right?

79
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,290
And then integrate it along this vertical line.

80
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,130
So one thing that you can notice immediately is that with any fixed X, the Y going to always start from zero, right?

81
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,120
And then it won't go up to one unless X is equal to zero.

82
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:31,080
It will go up to this. The boundary of this quarter circle.

83
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:42,840
And in particular, if this is, as we know, the coordinates for this on this point, the Y and it should be square root of Y minus a square.

84
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,370
Right, because every point on this circle is going to be X squared plus Y squared equal to one.

85
00:16:50,720 --> 00:17:01,430
So if you start with an X, the vertical line that touch this union that that this quarter circle is going to have a Y value of.

86
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:08,020
Square root of one minus X squared. Since it's in the first quadrant, it's always a positive one.

87
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,410
So that's the integration limit for the inner part.

88
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:19,840
So that is to say, we can rewrite the inner integration as integration from zero to a square root of one minus x square.

89
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Of this function as a function of y. Okay.

90
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:31,240
The same as before. You can write the run out the original function, evaluate this 2.0 and start going to one minus x square.

91
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,190
And got this. Got this result. Yet.

92
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,620
So that's the inner part. Any question about the part.

93
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:46,770
Okay. So once we have the inner part, we can deal with the outer, uh, being the, the outer part.

94
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:55,230
So we just carry over this function two over three Y minus X squared to the power of two or three or two.

95
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:03,769
And then what is the limit for this x? Does it involve?

96
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,929
Why? Why should I involve?

97
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,640
Why? Because we already integrate our why. So acts is just.

98
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,260
The support for acts. In this case, acts can go anywhere from 0 to 1.

99
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,800
So your order in integration should be should have a boundary from 0 to 1.

100
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,340
So the inner part of when you do the inner part,

101
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:39,010
you are ready to take into account the this irregular shape of the region for the outer integration, and you don't have to worry about it anymore.

102
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,129
Justine Aguirre From 0 to 1, that's all possible.

103
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:50,800
That is for us. Okay, so now the problem, the original problem becomes solving this integration, this univariate integration.

104
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,000
So. It's now very straightforward how to solve it directly.

105
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,300
Let me give you a hand and consider doing a change of variable by setting us to be.

106
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,410
That's a sign of theta. Okay.

107
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,440
Once you do this change of variable, you will find the function is going to be different, right?

108
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:30,570
So if you're plugging in sine theta into this, this function, that's going to be two over three cosine theta square to the power of three over to.

109
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,390
Because a one minus sign square is cosine square. Right.

110
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,060
And the x is just the cosine theta.

111
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,310
The theta. That's the University of Nevada.

112
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:57,030
So you rewrite the theater as the of sine theta, which is cosine theta times theta and being very careful about the integration limit.

113
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,170
Now, instead of from 0 to 1 where sine theta.

114
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:09,210
Actually for a zero or signs they require zero corresponding to theta equal to zero and

115
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,330
as equal to one or sine theta equal to one corresponds to a theta equal to pi over two.

116
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,400
So once you do this change of variable, this is what you are. What do you need to solve?

117
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,430
Okay. So if you further write it.

118
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:37,580
Clean it. That's going to be two over three integration from zero to pi over two cosine to the pa for theta v theta.

119
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:46,550
Yeah. So that is much cleaner compared to the original one, although it's still not straightforward how to solve it.

120
00:20:47,480 --> 00:21:08,930
So let me give you another hint. So here we need to use a function called the triangle trying to go metric.

121
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,520
Try trigonometric function, which is cosines.

122
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,460
Square is equal to one half.

123
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,830
Cosine to theta plus one.

124
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,510
You probably have learned this before in your math class.

125
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:38,430
So this is a. Special relation for its cosine functions.

126
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,110
So cosine squared theta is equal to one over two cosine to theta plus one.

127
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:50,320
So with this function now, I'll give you a few more minutes to try to solve this problem.

128
00:21:51,110 --> 00:27:26,910
Okay. Okay.

129
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:34,410
You got it. So let's look at this together.

130
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,950
So the reason why we introduced this function is to lower the power for this cosine term.

131
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,510
Right. If it's just a cosine theta, we know how to do the integration.

132
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,450
But if it's in the higher order, it's now so straightforward what the original function is.

133
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:57,000
So that's why we need to take advantage of this relation of how to reduce the power.

134
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:08,430
Okay. So when we apply this, we can say the original function is equal to two or three integration from zero to I over to.

135
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,110
Cosine to theta plus one. Square.

136
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:25,260
Peter. And you can break out this square term that I give you.

137
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,010
One, two, four, four Times Square to Theta Plus.

138
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,290
Cosine to theta. Plus one over four.

139
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,340
All right. Or. To hear.

140
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,840
Okay. Uh, yes.

141
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,710
So once you break out this square term, this is one we have.

142
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,440
So now you can say we have three terms. One is a square term, which is still complicated to solve.

143
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,600
One is the first order term which should be able to solve.

144
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,410
And the other is a constant, which is something we're able to solve.

145
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:25,470
Okay. So if you break it down, there's three parts you can find the disintegration of, let's say, the second part.

146
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:33,950
Zero to pi over to two times cosine to theta.

147
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:41,000
The thing to the original function is sign to theta, right?

148
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,670
If you take the derivative of this sine theta, you got exactly two times cosine theta.

149
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:59,000
So evaluate from zero to pi over two, which give you a sign of pi minus sign of zero, which is exactly zero.

150
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,310
So the second term, the integration is zero.

151
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,379
And the last term you can write out the integration which is one of your four times PI over two and then to deal with the first one,

152
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,050
you just apply this relation one more time. Okay.

153
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:21,050
You apply this function one more time to further lower the power from the second order to the first order.

154
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:30,140
And then you can use your way of learned in calculus to solve it eventually with some calculation which are all made here.

155
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,040
You can find the final answer is pi over eight.

156
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,290
I hope you got the correct answer.

157
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,790
So as you can see, even if we just change the region a little bit, the calculation can quickly become very complicated.

158
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,560
So in practice, there is no shortcut. There is no easy way.

159
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,250
There is no universal solution to this double integration.

160
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,970
Sometimes the functional for me looks simple, but still it could be complicated to solve.

161
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:10,110
And for this problem, there is actually another way to do it, which is using the polar coordinates.

162
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:16,020
So we use this polar pawn coordinates to solve this double integration.

163
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:24,450
When either the integration or the region has a simpler expression in this alternative coordinate.

164
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:33,900
So the idea of the Koehler polar coordinate is instead of using the original Euclidean coordinate.

165
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:45,510
We can raise. Any point in this two dimensional space by using the radius and the angle.

166
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:54,840
Okay. So you can express the coordinate of this. Any point in this space using X and Y or you can equivalently representing A, using R and the theta.

167
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:01,020
Why are there specific relation between the original coordinate and this polar coordinate?

168
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,930
Is X is equal to our times. A sine theta and a y is equal to our times.

169
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,690
Sorry, I say to our times cosine theta y is equal to our times sine theta.

170
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,000
So that's the 1 to 1 mapping between the original coordinate and the new coordinate.

171
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:30,840
And more often, if you are integrated or the region has something to do with a circle, then that is typically a sign.

172
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:39,790
A hint to use this polar coordinate because for circle, we know one thing for sure.

173
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,150
That is all the points in the circle have the same radius.

174
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,390
Right. So you have to use to coordinate X and Y to represent all the points in the circle.

175
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,080
But once your chance to this polar coordinate, you only need one parameter.

176
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,040
Those are the radius. So that is.

177
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,910
A hint when we should use this polar coin.

178
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:17,710
Now, thinking about the original problem, we have this quarter circle region and this, uh, integration which has f squared plus y squared.

179
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,570
Both are signs indicating that maybe it's time to consider using this polar coordinate.

180
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:37,220
Okay. Once you change the change the variable using the polar coordinate, you can find immediately that this guy is equal to the integration of our.

181
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:45,540
Waiters and zero lads are equal to one. Right? That's for this x squared plus y squared less than one part.

182
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:53,770
And theta is from zero to pi over two because it's in the first quadrant.

183
00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:02,470
So this is much simpler than the original region in the sense that this region is a rectangular region.

184
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,990
All right. So this new region is rectangular region. And we have seen before it is a rectangle region.

185
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:18,000
Then you can easily alternating or switch the order of this double integration.

186
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:24,630
You come first in way to are then theta or for theta, then r one does not interfere with the other one.

187
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:31,600
Unlike the original region where you have this the boundaries defined by both X and Y.

188
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,250
So you have to be extra careful.

189
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:43,360
And now once we do this change of variable, it becomes a very regular rectangle area, which is much easier and also the integral.

190
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,890
It's also becomes much easier and it's just going to be one minus our square.

191
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:57,790
Right. And one additional thing that we need to take care of is this d d y.

192
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:07,090
So when you do the change of variable, you have to calculate the Jacobean or this high dimensional case for this multivariate case.

193
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:20,110
So the X, the Y is equal to the Jacobean times, the r d theta, where this Jacobean is defined as the determinant of ax,

194
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:29,170
partial derivative of ax over our ax, over theta y over r and y over theta.

195
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,870
Okay. So in this case, if you calculate this partial derivatives,

196
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:49,390
partial derivative of us over RS cosine theta x over theta r times sine theta negative y over r is sine theta.

197
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,940
And finally Y over theta is our cosine theta.

198
00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:06,660
Okay. If you calculate a determinant, that's going to be our cosine squared theta plus our sine square theta, which is just r.

199
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,320
So that's the Jacobi. So that is to say the original of the x de y.

200
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,980
If you wanted to change our variable, it should be equal to our times.

201
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:22,090
ERP theta. So that is equal to r v r v theta.

202
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:30,430
Okay. So using this polar coordinate, which ends with our original integration in this form through this new integration.

203
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:39,100
It's. Okay. So now the problem is to solve this new integration.

204
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:45,550
So I give you maybe 2 minutes. It should be much easier to solve than the original approach.

205
00:38:33,910 --> 00:39:10,290
This. If.

206
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:32,100
All right. So I hope you all got it. So, as you can see, once you change the coordinate, the, uh, the calculation becomes much easier.

207
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,680
And you can probably just use a one or two steps to get the final answer of PI over eight compared to the previous change of variables.

208
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:47,400
And, you know, using that, uh, uh, trying to go metric function, it's much easier.

209
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,110
Okay. All right.

210
00:39:51,680 --> 00:40:03,660
Next example. So sometimes it's when we do this double integration, we also consider changing the order of the integration.

211
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay, so changing the order sometimes may be the key to really solve this double integration.

212
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:15,330
And if the region is a rectangle, then it's a no brainer.

213
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,560
You can do it either way if you change the order. Nothing changed.

214
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:32,400
Just keep the regional integration limit. But in general, if the region is not a rectangle rectangular, then when you do this change of order.

215
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:39,970
Make sure that you also change the integration limit accordingly, otherwise it won't be correct.

216
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:50,020
Okay. For example, let's consider this case. To solve this integration, our integration of E to the Y over Y on this region,

217
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:56,260
which is defined by Y between X and the square root of X and as from 0 to 1.

218
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:05,970
Okay. So in the original form you first do the integration of Y and then do the integration of X.

219
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,530
But. It's not hard to say that this function e to the Y over y you can try it,

220
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:21,500
but there is no closed form original function whose derivative is disregarding the other words?

221
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:28,940
You cannot solve it. You cannot solve this inner integration explicitly.

222
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:37,060
So that's. A sign where we need to use this change of order.

223
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,710
And before we do that, let's take a closer look at the integration region.

224
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,630
It's not a rectangular region. Right? The inner integration actually involve acts.

225
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:53,560
So you can draw that region. You have as you have, why we know acts is from 0 to 1.

226
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:01,510
Okay. So that's defined by the outer integration and wise from acts to a square root of x.

227
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,590
So Y equal to x is just this straight line.

228
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:10,650
Okay. So why is greater than so?

229
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:17,720
Anything that above this line is why. Also, why is the last line square root of x?

230
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:21,480
If you draw the square root of x, that's a parabola. Okay.

231
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:35,870
So that's a tilted parabola. Anything below this curve is going to be y less than square root of x and both line intersect and this as equal to one.

232
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,430
Why? For one point. Okay.

233
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:51,490
And if you think about this region that we are trying to integrate this functional, that's just this very thin area defined by this two curves.

234
00:42:51,610 --> 00:43:00,130
One is equal to Y, right? This curve is equal to Y and this curve is square root of x, equal to Y.

235
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:08,410
So anything in between. That's what we were trying to integrate. So the original function is just the integrating.

236
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,120
First for any fixed, you are integrating this vertical on.

237
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:21,170
From access to the square root of acts, and then you integrate acts from 0 to 1.

238
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:29,510
Now, if we want to change the order of this integration, the function states the same E to the Y over y.

239
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,260
But the limit is going to be different for any given y.

240
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,260
What is the limit? Or X.

241
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:53,690
If we want to switch the order. To do X and Y so the functions stay the same, but the integration limit is going to be different.

242
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,310
First, the way we want to integrate X for any given y.

243
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:10,460
This is from what? So from these acts to these acts and these acts is what?

244
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:21,110
If this curve is y or the square root of x, so the y coordinate is y, then the x coordinate should be y squared.

245
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,669
Right. And similarly for this person, this line is X equals Y.

246
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:30,390
So a y coordinate as y, last coordinate is also y.

247
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,800
So the integration is going to be from Y square to Y.

248
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:43,460
All right. And then for why now is unlimited is now restricted.

249
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:47,780
Okay. So it's from 0 to 1 on the outer integration.

250
00:44:48,470 --> 00:48:25,080
So now try to solve this problem. Okay. All right.

251
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,990
I hope you all got it. So let's see.

252
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:37,610
Once we switch the order, we can first integrate our acts, but the function does not have access, or the other words is a constant function.

253
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:49,700
If we want to integrate all acts, right, so that can be directly right out as E to the y over y y square to y.

254
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,110
So that gave us this, uh, exponential.

255
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,920
To the power of y minus y times, the exponential the power of y.

256
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:07,080
So for the first one you can easily write out. The original function is also itself E to the Y and for the second one, if either just what's our,

257
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,520
you know, function and make adjustment, or you can do this integration by part.

258
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:17,550
But either way, it's a much easier problem than our original one, which doesn't even have a close form solution.

259
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:22,590
So in the end, you can find the final solution to this problem is is E minus two?

260
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:27,719
Okay. So this is an example where you have to do this change of order.

261
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,450
And in order to solve the problem, the original integration,

262
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:38,370
the original order does not allow you to close to two to explicitly evaluate now in the integration.

263
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:45,330
Okay. Any question? All right.

264
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:50,610
So we have introduced a couple of tricks for solving this double integration.

265
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,210
Uh, consider change of order.

266
00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:07,530
Um, change of coordinate. And sometimes you may have to resort to some other functions to simplify your integration.

267
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:13,800
So those are the most commonly used tricks to solve this double integration in practice.

268
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:18,540
There is no universal formula or whatnot.

269
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,080
So you just have to be sometimes have to be a little bit creative about how to solve these problems.

270
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:33,690
But again, the more practice you do, the more you you've seen then that the the problem will be easier to you.

271
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,440
Okay. So that's all I have prepared for today.

272
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:45,960
And if you don't have any additional questions, feel free to, uh, I'll be here for a couple of minutes.

273
00:50:45,960 --> 00:51:09,530
If you have other questions, feel free to ask. Okay. She?
