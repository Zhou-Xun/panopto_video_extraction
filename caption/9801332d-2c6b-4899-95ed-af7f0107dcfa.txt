00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:14,510
Welcome to Ebbitt six as module on incorporating vaccination in SARS models in this module,

2
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,580
I will present the properties of an essay or model with vaccination.

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:25,430
They're learning objectives of this module are to one, describe the mechanisms underlying vaccine efficacy, and two,

4
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:35,930
to compare the dynamics of an essay or model with and without vaccination to examine the historic impact of vaccines on disease burden.

5
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:43,460
We need to look back to the 19th century where in England and Wales we observed a dramatic increase in life expectancy.

6
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,690
In 1848, a public health act was enacted.

7
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:57,200
These improvements have largely been credited to the improved standards, have been credited to improved standards of hygiene and nutrition.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,460
At the same time that mortality rates were decreasing. There was also an increase in the frequency and magnitudes of epidemics.

9
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:14,310
So more cases, but fewer deaths. This increase was largely attributed to changes in social patterns and growth of large population centers.

10
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:25,890
It was a widespread use of vaccines that reverse this trend, as illustrated by this graph of measles cases.

11
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,560
So how do vaccines work at the individual level?

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:38,110
They directly protect those that receive vaccine. The vaccine, the vaccine decreases, the susceptibility to infection does decrease,

13
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:47,170
can be complete or partial vaccine that's only partially, only partially protects individuals is often called a leaky vaccine.

14
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,130
This protection can be lifelong or temporary.

15
00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:00,700
From an essay, our modeling perspective and individual moves directly to the mune or a covered state when vaccinated.

16
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,510
At the community level, when when enough are vaccinated, vaccination can also indirectly protect those that are.

17
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:16,730
That have not been vaccinated. This because there's a decreased chance that an infected person contacts is up a person, a separable person.

18
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:25,150
And our mass action model of transmission provides a simple and logical explanation of this indirect protection.

19
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,340
Vaccines can have a number of most number of modes of action.

20
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,530
A susceptible, stability based mode of action is what we've just been talking about.

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:43,780
The vaccine can decrease the individual susceptibility to infection. Again, the vaccine can provide complete or partial protection.

22
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:51,720
This mode conveys both direct and indirect protection. That is, the vaccine directly protects the individual being infected.

23
00:02:51,720 --> 00:03:00,910
And if there's a high enough coverage, the vaccine indirectly protects at the community level those that were not vaccinated.

24
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:09,760
Vaccines can also affect the contagiousness of individuals. So even if a vaccinated person becomes infected, they may be less contagious.

25
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:20,860
This mode only conveys indirect protection. The individual receiving the vaccine receives no direct protection due to gey creases and contagiousness.

26
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:31,810
Lastly, a vaccine can convey Pappe pathologic protection by improving the present prognostic prognostic outcome.

27
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:42,400
It can cause less disease. This mode of action conveys neither direct nor indirect effects with respect to transmission.

28
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,910
It's important to know that vaccines can operate through a combination of these three modes.

29
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:57,970
Indirect protection can also call is also called herd immunity, which provides protection to the community, whether vaccinated or not.

30
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,400
As mentioned during the first week in class, Ross was the first to quantify this concept.

31
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:12,070
Applying it to malaria transmission and postulating the idea that if mosquito populations could be decreased below a threshold,

32
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:19,900
transmission would decrease to zero. Herd immunity is achieved if not times.

33
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,540
A fraction of the population that is susceptible is less than one.

34
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,430
A steady state, the fraction is susceptible as a proximal approximated by one minus the fraction that some.

35
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:39,420
That's immune. With a little algebra, we can we can get our arrive at herd immunity.

36
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:49,030
That and more herd immunity is achieved. If the fraction immune is greater than one minus one over our NOT.

37
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,590
We can increase the number in the our state through infection or through vaccination.

38
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:04,500
So here is the derivation of his herd immunity equation for you to look at over to look over at a later time.

39
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:13,260
So what questions can we address with our vaccine model? The first is the most basic and what comes out of the concept of herd immunity?

40
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,610
What fraction of the population must be vaccinated to eradicate a disease?

41
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,750
Spatial heterogeneity and risk group heterogeneity will influence the answer to

42
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,570
this question and generally points toward more targeted intervention strategies.

43
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:36,800
Another question of interest is what is the effect of vaccination on average age of individuals?

44
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:46,190
First, infection in general, you will see that in the labs that vaccination will increase the average age to infection.

45
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:53,150
It does this by decreasing the force of infection and therefore increasing the probability of not being infected.

46
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,900
This feature is relevant for those diseases where it increases in time to first.

47
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:04,250
Infection may worsen disease burden like polio, which can cause paralytic polio or rubella,

48
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:15,770
which can cause congenital disorders from pregnant women that are infected with rubella.

49
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:26,570
Another question of interest is what reduction in disease incidence is expected for a given age specific vaccine schedule?

50
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,650
We can focus on vaccinating all children prior to their first year.

51
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,580
If coverage is good, we can achieve herd immunity efficiently.

52
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,510
If coverage is low, we may want to focus on vaccinating at a later age, letting immunity build through infection.

53
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:51,500
This strategy works if risk in the young children is low. So let's look at an essay or model with vaccination.

54
00:06:51,500 --> 00:07:01,890
The additional parameter is p the proportion that are vaccinated at birth and moving and those people moving directly to the R state.

55
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:09,500
Here is the equation's and the two changes to the model.

56
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,820
How does this change affect the dynamics of our s.a. Our model? To answer this question, we need to calculate the null clines.

57
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,140
These no claims are similar to the base as our model. The one?

58
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:27,170
S no client has one change. It has a scalar one minus P in the numerator.

59
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:36,010
The two I know Clines are the same. Here we see the plot of the null clines where the main difference is that the SNL

60
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:44,960
Klein intersects the Y axis as a one minus P rather than one in the base as our model.

61
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,950
Again, the I know Clines are the same, and these are the two equilibrium points for condition,

62
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,130
for the condition that Delta plus mbewe over Beda is less than one.

63
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:09,260
So the criteria for eradication is the condition that Delta plus me over Beda is greater than one minus the proportion vaccinated.

64
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,120
So this endemic threshold comes directly from the face portrait on the right.

65
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:22,060
This is the condition that there are two equilibrium points where the endemics equilibrium point is stable.

66
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,300
P sub C here is a critical vaccine coverage needed to eliminate the disease.

67
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:39,460
Solving for piece hep C we get the critical vaccine coverage must be greater than one minus one over are not the same criteria.

68
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:47,920
We have four herd immunity. Note that the steady state susceptible population level is unaffected by vaccination,

69
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,400
but the steady state infectious population is affected by vaccination with the added term one minus P.

70
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:06,290
Comparing this steady state infectious term. I. With and without vaccine coverage we get that are not with vaccination is simply one minus P times.

71
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:17,110
They are not without vaccination. What are some of the changes we observe after administering a vaccination campaign?

72
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,630
The first that we we alluded to earlier is the shift in aid distribution.

73
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:31,120
For example, prior to vaccines, 90 percent of the cases of measles were in children under the age of 10 after implementing vaccines.

74
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,750
This number can drop to 40 percent. Second is the observation of a honeymoon period.

75
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:45,950
That is the time to the next epidemic is larger immediately, immediately, and then decreases over time.

76
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:54,370
This is due to the interaction between demographic and infectious infection dynamics immediately after a vaccination campaign starts.

77
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:02,950
There are a greater proportion of older people that are immune due to the higher form of infection prior to the vaccination.

78
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,390
Over time, this proportion will decrease. We will be able to.

79
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:14,320
We will be able to observe this honeymoon feature in the lab.

80
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,510
Now, let's look at data from measles and smallpox for Africa and India.

81
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:25,030
First, we noticed that the mean age to infection for measles is lower than for smallpox.

82
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,650
This is due to the fact that measles is much more infectious.

83
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:35,410
We also see that the average age of infection for smallpox is lower in India compared to Africa.

84
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:49,100
This is due to the higher population density in India. Next, we see that the life expectancy is higher in India than in Africa.

85
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,080
This factory will come together, these factors all come together when estimating or not.

86
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,890
And the critical vaccination covered vaccine coverage needed for eradication.

87
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:08,150
We see that to eradicate the disease from measles in Africa. We need ninety five percent coverage for smallpox in Africa.

88
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,020
We only need 73 percent coverage for smallpox in India.

89
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:21,570
We need 83 percent coverage. So what makes smallpox suitable for eradication compared to measles?

90
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,860
And is it more difficult to eradicate in Africa or in India? And why?

91
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:35,380
These are questions that we will explore in our vaccination lab. The final property of various other models that is useful to know when studying

92
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,530
vaccination is a periodicity of epidemics that an essay or model predicts.

93
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:49,330
Turns out that the essay or model exhibit stamped isolation, a periodic function that decreases in amplitude over time.

94
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:54,580
To model this phenomena more accurately would require a time varying contact rate,

95
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:05,200
which we will not do in this class when we we can derive the period of oscillation by calculating the eigenvalues of the solution to our essay,

96
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,230
our model. This calculation is beyond the scope of the class.

97
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:19,710
But here is the equation for the period as a function of average age to infection a. and the duration of disease.

98
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:26,170
D Therefore, if we can estimate these two parameters, we can estimate the epidemic period.

99
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:33,000
We will explore many of these properties from this video in the vaccination lab.
