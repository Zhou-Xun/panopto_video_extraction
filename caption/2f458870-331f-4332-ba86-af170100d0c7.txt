1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:14,840
I needed something to do. I had to get speaker stability in my life after I finished school and everything start to fall apart two years ago.

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,900
So I was right back here to the Independence Center and they helped me get my life back together.

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,970
Christine She's one of my support workers and reconcile with her about anything.

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:36,720
I really enjoy seeing others thrive with them, their lives and filling their goals and me being able to help them meet their needs on their own.

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,849
Nobody is treated any differently because they have a mental illness or anything.

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:53,790
But really, who is this person? Sorry, this is a funny story.

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:04,710
When I was your age, I was I was a senior in college and my new apartment and nobody's roommates are home.

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,700
And the learn of my major is neuroscience.

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,709
The brain of a and I'm in the center of my apartment.

10
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,900
I start hearing a voice like. Just like what you just heard.

11
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,680
Like, you can't really. And I'm like, Oh, my God, this is it.

12
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,940
This is it. This is my break. Like, this is like a like a psychotic break when they usually I mean, that's the term that's used.

13
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,740
And I'm literally I'm sitting there, I'm like, you know, panicking. I'm like my mother.

14
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:44,350
I have to get to the hospital and, you know, but it's not you know, when people talk about here in the terminal, it's pretty quick.

15
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,209
People talk about the hallucinations of your voices, which are very negative.

16
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,950
They're telling nervous, scary voices. People hear things like kill yourself or the devil.

17
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,919
Like people hear very terrible things. And I wasn't hearing anything terrible.

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:07,740
I was hearing like kind of and then I really sort of like keep going to the sound and it's just like two guys smoking weed on the on the fire escape.

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:15,210
So I don't know where this is because I've just moved of the apartment and it's certain it's like and it makes it I think that's all

20
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:29,639
right thing know so I was like all right so today we're going to see is the last lecture I'm going to give you on the first trimester,

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,200
if you will, of the class. So after this is the setting,

22
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,920
the last thing we're we're going to kind of set up and set up some of the big ideas that we're going

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,159
to talk about in much more detail using specific case examples in the next third of the course,

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:52,500
which is we're going to talk about these six case examples. The you're going to have time if I and I know I'm late getting started today,

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,829
but hopefully I will I will make sure that there's time for you to have a discussion with about your concept map,

26
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,350
which is going to kind of set the sort of the path forward for how you're going to engage

27
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:12,780
with a lot of a lot of these ideas as they relate to your specific interests and yes,

28
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,790
the things you're going to do next week. Well, we're kind of kick it off. We're talking about some specific health mission.

29
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:24,300
So for today, finish up this conversation about how social factors intersect with treatment access.

30
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,960
So the four big ideas I want to tell you that sometimes, you know,

31
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,340
it's hard maybe have an eat lunch I kind of zone out towards the end but like remember this so the first is

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,200
that how mental health care is delivered and who pays for that has changed substantially since the 1950s.

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,620
When I talk about how the expansion of Medicaid specifically or the development of Medicaid changed that.

34
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:54,930
The second is that those changes have occurred alongside and were actually made possible by the advent of affective psychopharmacology.

35
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:04,140
So prior to the development of drugs like Thorazine and chlorpromazine, which are medications that are used to treat schizophrenia,

36
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,210
we basically had no effective treatments for that because there was not a medical treatment.

37
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,400
You know, antidepressants effective. And we get our first couple.

38
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,850
I mean, I'm going to walk you through some of those.

39
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:24,719
But, you know, we get our our first antidepressants, which are these tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,970
These are happening in the eighties. We don't get the SSRI, which are now first line treatment until the nineties.

41
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:40,080
Right. So I think the treatment effective treatment for pharmacologic treatment for psychiatric disorders is a relatively new phenomenon.

42
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,190
The majority of outpatient mental health treatment at Corcoran United States is provided by general practitioners,

43
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,179
not animal specialists have sexual abuse before, but I just want to make make that clear, right.

44
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,970
So when people talk about the mental health system, you might be thinking about specific providers, but you actually need that.

45
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,500
That's a that's wrong, right? We need to actually say like where does care actually happen?

46
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,060
It happens in your own medical it. Why does it happen there?

47
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,180
We can talk about. Right.

48
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,530
But the point is, is when somebody is getting treatment for mental health that usually in general medical settings and across the board,

49
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,120
no matter what we're talking about, what condition we're talking about, how somebody is getting care access to minimally adequate.

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,630
I'm going to define what that is. Psychiatric care is one.

51
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,290
So some important policies that have shaped what today's kind of health care system looks like.

52
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:42,200
So the first is we get the first is, as I'm going to tell you, is that this is occurring alongside 1950.

53
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,180
Who's born this year? It's this it's got to be me.

54
00:05:47,280 --> 00:06:00,950
So this is like. This is important because it makes you wonder.

55
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,660
Stevie Wonder, Bill Murray, Stevie Wonder and Bill Murray.

56
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,290
You know Stevie Wonder. Bill Murray or more. Okay. Thanks. I know.

57
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,970
Right. So. All right. So. Okay.

58
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,940
So you want to go over your board and Thorazine is approved by the FDA.

59
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:27,230
All right, so. So we get prior to this, if you had schizophrenia or a family behind schizophrenia,

60
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,450
the only thing that the only cure that was basically available was inpatient hospitalization.

61
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:39,050
And they were often not going to come out from that. And what was happening while they were inpatient, this was restraint.

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,650
This was crazy ideas like insulin therapy where people would like put people's insulin going.

63
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,280
Yeah. So this is also Freud is alive and well.

64
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,399
So what does what is schizophrenia even called?

65
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,670
It's called like schizophrenic reaction to yada, yada, yada.

66
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:06,110
Like people think like this somehow you can kind of uncover this like sexual conflict that you have with your parents.

67
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:13,790
And somehow that's like literally that's what that's how people are thinking about what is causing schizophrenia and depression and what have you.

68
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:22,309
Right. That's the model that people are working. So we now also alongside this actually, we're coming a little bit later.

69
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,540
Right. We're getting massive social change. We've just come out of World War Two.

70
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,970
Okay. America is doing great. Economy's doing great. The baby boom generation is being born.

71
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:39,500
The you know, the civil rights movements and women's rights movements, etc., are are getting started.

72
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,420
Okay. So we get our first study in 1955 trying to understand the economic and social impacts of mental illness.

73
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,830
So this is Eisenhower, I think is president at this point.

74
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,500
1963. This is Kennedy as our great.

75
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:06,420
Might be dead at this point, but a lot of things that he wanted to have happen happened because of that.

76
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,059
And actually so that became like a rallying cry. But the point is,

77
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,719
we get this this act that's very important that in this is specifically is important because

78
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,760
it funds the construction of not really the staffing for community mental health centers.

79
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,980
Later in this class, we're going to read a book or chapter from a book called American Psychosis.

80
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:36,160
If you are interested in if today's lecture feels good in your heart or you're like, I want to understand why, how they screwed it all up.

81
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,339
I recommend reading that book. Now, that's not the only book on the history of this,

82
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,280
but it's written by one someone whose sister had chronic schizophrenia and actually experienced this system too.

83
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,210
That person is a psychiatrist, so they have like a very good understanding of sort of what was possible at the time for care for their loved ones.

84
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,300
And three, it is like eviscerates,

85
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,889
like essentially like what policymakers were trying to do and some of the ideas they were trying to do and basically how

86
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:08,710
it left people with serious mental illness out of accord with instead refer a focus on prevention where you're like,

87
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,139
Oh, I would love prevention. The problem is we actually don't know how to prevent many forms of serious mental illness.

88
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,959
And so if that's your focus and you have all these people who are now coming out of the state psychiatric hospitals,

89
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,270
which are being closed at this time. If you have a problem,

90
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,910
you know you've got a solution that is not a solution to the problem that you're creating simultaneously through the deinstitutionalization movement.

91
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:37,390
1966. So this is Johnson. We get the Social Security Amendment that creates Medicaid as part of his war on poverty,

92
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,750
and it expands the psychiatric care benefits of Medicare, which we got in 1965.

93
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,010
Okay. So fast forward 25 or 50 years.

94
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,280
So the civil rights movement is in full swing, right? We've got deinstitutionalization movements, etc.

95
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:02,160
And part of what's happening now in this is the Warren Court. The Warren is the chief justice Warren of the Supreme Court.

96
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,139
We where we get an expansion or maybe not an expansion,

97
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,990
but at least a a adjudication of specific rights that you have that the state has to protect you.

98
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:21,599
And so this is one Wyatt versus Stickley precinct synchrony for me that addresses involuntary detention without treatment that essentially sets up

99
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:29,880
the three the three core pillars of adequate care that if you are going to be involuntary detained or involuntarily hospitalized in this case,

100
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,380
you must have it must be in a humane environment. You must have an individualized treatment plan.

101
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,100
And it must be in a place is adequate. So. You know who could be against this.

102
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:46,090
The problem is with the Supreme Court. So even today, I mean, there are many.

103
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:55,569
So, for example, many nursing homes, even though they are not for people with serious mental illness, that is not their their place,

104
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:02,110
because there are oftentimes people with serious mental illness end up in nursing homes,

105
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,420
which, by the way, 98% of them are understaffed, according to our government right now.

106
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,860
So. All right. So in 1977, we this is Carter.

107
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,530
We get the president's commission on Mental Health, Rosalynn Carter. There still is the Carter Center, which is this.

108
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:29,319
Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn had been very strong advocates for mental health, which was really trying to understand what what was it?

109
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,070
Because now we knew the hospitals that hospitals have closed.

110
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,100
I'll show you this in a second. So now we know we've got a problem, right?

111
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,290
The institutionalization has happened or is almost done, and we know we've got a problem.

112
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,999
So now we're trying to figure that out. 1983.

113
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,500
All right, is born. We get the new DSM and we so this is showing this new changes here.

114
00:11:53,500 --> 00:12:04,299
But then we also get this really innocuously named bill this budget reconciliation act which we get lots of different acts like this every year.

115
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:11,260
But the problem is, is that it negates the Mental Health Systems Act and it converts government supported mental health care into block stress, which.

116
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:19,220
Is a large part of why we have a problem with the way that this is funded and the American psychosis.

117
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,150
But he goes into a lot of detail about what exactly that meant.

118
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,140
But. 86 happened. So this has got to.

119
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:48,570
It also is born again Prozac, right, which is Fluoxetine is the generic label.

120
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,200
It's a variable medication for the first time. This is first line treatment. Now, as is this.

121
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:59,519
This is the first SSRI that's approved. Your SSRI is a first line treatment for any anxiety disorder, any depressive disorder or any major depression.

122
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:05,309
But they are not a first line treatment for bipolar disorder. 1990, we get the Americans with Disabilities Act passed.

123
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:12,270
This is going to be very, very important. We talk about autism in a few weeks because the Americans with Disabilities Act gets requires

124
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,950
institutions that receive public funding to provide one it provides must provide accommodations.

125
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:26,999
But it's also coming on the heels of providing places that receive government funding must provide appropriate accommodations in appropriate settings.

126
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,840
Right. This is this is going to come back up when we talk about autism.

127
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,580
99, we get this another Supreme Court out that rules that people with intellectual disabilities have to be housed in community settings.

128
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,380
This is again, this is the idea that we're trying to continue to not have institutionalized settings.

129
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:51,270
2008 We get the Well Stone Domain Mental Health Charity Act, which sets forth that group health plans with at least 50 employers on them that

130
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,950
provide both mental fit or that provide physical mental health care coverage,

131
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:02,480
which is what they should be providing with their health insurance, have to provide parity with mental health care.

132
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,420
That is. So if I if my insurance will pay for 100 days of art,

133
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:16,829
100 visits of like rehabilitation for my knee, they have to pay for 100 visits for rehabilitation,

134
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:24,930
for my brain health plan to respond to those by changing the 100 visits for my knee to 20 visits for my knee.

135
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,260
And now you're going to 20 visits for your knee and 20 visits for your head, and that's equal.

136
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,159
So this is also only now getting implemented fully.

137
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:41,010
So it's it's literally taking 12 years to 2015, 15 years of questions about these kind of big.

138
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,570
And of course, a lot of stuff is I'm skipping other questions about these how this timeline.

139
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:56,900
Okay. So I told you that for the state psychiatric hospitals prior to the advent of effective psychopharmacology.

140
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:04,610
So places where people, particularly people with serious mental illness, that is severe depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder.

141
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,690
Where are they getting care? They're getting care in state psychiatric hospitals.

142
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:16,160
But this is going from 1950 to 1998. This is the number of state and county psychiatric hospitals and their senses.

143
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:25,249
So in 1950, we have a half a million people in a state or county psychiatric hospital in the United States in 1996,

144
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,879
which is the last year that we have data on here.

145
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:38,970
We have 61,000 people. So the U.S. population is a lot bigger now than it was in 1950.

146
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,709
And, you know, some of these people did not necessarily need to be seen in a state psychiatric hospital.

147
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,580
And certainly now that we have effective pharmacology, they don't need to be.

148
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,960
They can be treated safely and effectively outside the hospital setting.

149
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,530
But this is probably not the right number.

150
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:09,960
And actually, it's much lower now. And I think I'm going to look at how much I need to get to Traverse City.

151
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,550
Yeah. What is that big moral thing there? You may know. What is it?

152
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,640
There's an old psychiatric hospital. That's why it's abandoned.

153
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,780
It's like they. There's businesses in it. Yeah. Yeah. So.

154
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,889
So so that it's a it's a beautiful kind of like shopping area.

155
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,340
And you can have dinner and you can shop. And it used to be a psychiatric hospital.

156
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,030
Right. And so there's there's a nice book.

157
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,209
I can bring it in if anybody is interested in reading about the like one of the

158
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,200
psychiatric providers who was there and was responsible for that that that place.

159
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,270
But we have one more in the state of Michigan that's in the process of being closed on Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital.

160
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:55,660
There's advocacy groups are trying to keep this thing open is an example of, you know, sort of like where where are these places?

161
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,320
So what an example in our you know, if you're if you're up here but.

162
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,490
What? Where where are those hospitals involved?

163
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,759
I told you earlier in class that Medicaid is the largest payer of mental health services for all age groups.

164
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,520
And I gave it showed you this graph already. So, again, Medicaid is the blue, the dark blue here.

165
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,540
Okay. So private insurance is this is older adults.

166
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,170
Private insurance is the the blue or the light blue.

167
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:29,750
And then out of the out of pocket is this kind of white under the middle color blue here.

168
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,630
So that's going from 96 to 27.

169
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,820
So that's who's paying for. So what?

170
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,860
So what this means I have to tell students if they're interested in doing policy work in mental health and they want to know,

171
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,759
like, should I get a crutch, I get a of public health degree for grad school.

172
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,610
My answer is usually no. You should go get a degree in public policy because those are the people where you're at.

173
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,499
That's those are the settings where you're going to learn about Medicaid and not like how Medicaid is and what is possible.

174
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:06,000
There are many student or or potentially a degree in social work with a focus on macro organizational social work,

175
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,380
because that's also what the people who study Medicaid. So last time we talked about how hard it is to get access to care.

176
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,190
So now you've gotten access. Now the new thought experiment is you've gotten access.

177
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,770
You got it. You called it went through all those all the phone calls, all the people on the list.

178
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,090
And you've gotten an appointment at the providers now to providers office.

179
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,440
Now, what is going to happen? How much care you're going to get so that let me walk you through this.

180
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,050
So this is this is the things that you might be seeking care for sure.

181
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,380
So, again, this is a community based survey that I'm showing you.

182
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,510
So these are people who meet diagnostic criteria, which, again, we know is not the same as needing care,

183
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:56,090
but they need diagnostic criteria for one of these things or many of these things probably.

184
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,150
And the question is, how about if they got care for it, how much care did they get?

185
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:11,389
So just number of visits. So if you have an anxiety disorder and you've got care in this is a mental health specialty care.

186
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:17,870
So this is psychiatrist non psychiatrist that's going to be psychologists, social workers or any specialty mental health care.

187
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,350
How many visits did you get for your anxiety disorder?

188
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,380
And the answer is 6.4. If you had a mood disorder, how many visits did you get?

189
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,080
You got 9.4. You got a substance use disorder or any substance use disorder.

190
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:41,000
You have 8.5. And anything anything listed here, if you use a mental health specialist, how many visits did you get with that person?

191
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:47,300
In America? That number is 5.7. Okay if you were.

192
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,490
But now, of course, that is not where most people are seen. Most people are even general medical.

193
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,030
So how many appointments did you get if you got care with a general medical appointment for your anxiety disorder, you got 1.7 visits.

194
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,970
So that's like an initial visit and then maybe a second one to see how things are going.

195
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,280
If you had a mood disorder, you had 1.5, if you had a substance use disorder 1.4.

196
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,360
And overall, no matter what's going on with you, it's about 1.6. Okay.

197
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,580
Nobody thinks this is adequate ways to treat.

198
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:23,110
No, it's just. It's. So that's like, okay, well, great.

199
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,430
Like, maybe there's, you know,

200
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,830
literally I was just at a session last night where they were talking about ketamine treatment for depression and like, maybe you just need one.

201
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,660
And like for some people, like, ketamine seems to just like do the trick, especially if you've got treatment resistant depression.

202
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,490
So forget about ketamine. So I'm not sure. It's like, let's say, like quality of care.

203
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,239
So how much? So given that you got care, what is that?

204
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:52,479
What proportion of people get minimally adequate mental health care at minimally adequate as defined by the American Psychiatric Association?

205
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,309
So they have guidelines, which is about how many how how this is the dosage of the pills,

206
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:07,629
the assessment of whether how you're doing, and did they add an adjuvant like or an additional medication if necessary?

207
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:14,380
This is the number of if you're seeing psychotherapy, how many there's a minimal number of psychiatric therapies, etc.

208
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,650
How what proportion got minimally adequate care? So I'll start with general medical and then I'll tell you about the specialty care.

209
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,370
So in general medical, what proportion of people get mentally adequate care for their psychiatric or anxiety disorder?

210
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,729
The answer is 13.4% for their mood disorders, 14.3% for their substance use disorder.

211
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,930
It's 5.3%. And for anything on here, it's 12.7%.

212
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,430
Is it better in the psychiatrist? Sure, but not great for an anxiety disorder.

213
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,450
It's a coin flip.

214
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:48,459
1.51% of people get minimally adequate care for their psychiatric for their anxiety disorder if they're seen in psychiatric specialty care disorders,

215
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,640
52% substance use disorders, 35%.

216
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,100
And for anything out years, 48%. So it's a point.

217
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:03,669
So when when we see this both with the knowledge that you or someone you love may need care someday, okay?

218
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:10,989
So it's important to both sort of have an understanding that it may be this is why I had you

219
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,030
read that that paper about like how many times people had to get care or call to get adequate,

220
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,230
adequate care. And if they kept up with it, they were very satisfied with their care.

221
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,260
But the fact that people have to keep up with it is like this is totally consistent with it.

222
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:33,460
Like, you know, if this is not the provider is not not giving you what you need, your you need to do, you need to get somebody else.

223
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,120
So, so again, so here's what this minimally adequate care is.

224
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,139
So for psychotherapy, minimally adequate care for psychotherapy has eight or more visits lasting at least 30 minutes.

225
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,070
So that means when I say only go back here for mood disorders.

226
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:56,620
So 52% of people get minimally out of her care for their psychotherapy, which means that 48% of people are getting less than eight visits.

227
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:04,750
Or those visits are shorter, right? For psychopharmacology, minimally equate care is at least two months with an appropriate medication.

228
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:13,570
Plus at least more than four visits to any type of physician are going to be assessing progress because oftentimes you need to increase the dose

229
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:24,310
for if you of these medications SSRI are notorious for this they aren't you don't really see therapeutic benefit for six eight sometimes 12 weeks.

230
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,410
Okay so like you really literally we would not expect benefit for three months potentially.

231
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,890
Okay. Oh, and I'll just this is just for me summarizing.

232
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,000
So minimally adequate treatment for people with with major depressive disorder.

233
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,640
So if you saw a psychiatrist, you got 43% of the time you got minimally adequate treatment.

234
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,140
Non psychiatrist, 52%. Anybody. This is the average of those two numbers.

235
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:57,960
General medical care. This is that 15%. Any anybody anybody that you saw in health care, it's 38%.

236
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,330
This is Human Services. So this is like social. If you saw a social worker, for example, that's 22%.

237
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,910
And anything anything on here, anybody you saw anybody for your depression, it's 37%.

238
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:19,000
So. This is going to be a I'm going to tell you some good news later.

239
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,860
But before I tell you the good news, I have to tell you, this is not just a U.S. problem.

240
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,730
So this is Canada, right? Which is the problem.

241
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,610
I mean, you can go to Europe, too, but, you know, certainly Canada has a national health care system.

242
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,610
You know, they have a much smaller population than we do.

243
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,900
So it's easier to do this. But here's the covering.

244
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,210
The same kind of time frame of the data I just showed you.

245
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,780
Only 13% of Canadians with a diagnosis of this type of depression received minimally adequate

246
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,490
psychotherapy defined in this in the way that I think this might be the kind of slightly.

247
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,379
Yeah, I'll tell you I'll tell you how this is defined a second. So 13% receive minimally adequate psychotherapy.

248
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:14,590
48% is a minimally adequate psychopharmacology, and 53% receiving minimally adequate treatment of either type.

249
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:21,350
And that's not that different. So let me be very explicit here.

250
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,649
So in or in Canada, minimally adequate psychotherapy is four or more counseling sessions.

251
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,520
An individual or group in psychopharmacology is that you're getting your

252
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,720
prescriptions actually filled the equivalent of actually taking it for 12 weeks.

253
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,340
Okay. So here's here's where we are, where the bar in the United States for minimally adequate care is higher.

254
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,940
Part of the reason why it looks worse for us is because we actually have a higher threshold for getting minimally adequate care.

255
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:58,090
But even so, if we had applied the Canadian standards to the U.S., that there's the difference between those two numbers might be a lot smaller.

256
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,060
Okay. So let me summarize.

257
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:11,650
So this is data from the national morbidity. So the data I've just showed you, the U.S. data is from the National Comorbidity Survey.

258
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,920
This is a large survey that's actually connected here at the University of Michigan of almost 10,000 adults.

259
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,090
That is some of the best data at the time on trying to understand the prevalence of psychiatric disorders,

260
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:35,049
correlates of psychiatric disorders and service use. I also showed you on Monday that the numbers that I have not really moved in the last 15 years.

261
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,570
So, yes, this data is a little old and I understand that.

262
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:43,630
But if you went out and did this today, you would not see orders of magnitude different, one addition.

263
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:52,240
So just as a reminder, 41% of people with any mental health condition in the DSM received some sort of treatment in the past 12 months.

264
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:59,280
And overall, there are the people are if you saw mentally mental health specialty providers,

265
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:06,300
you had more visits and you also were more likely to receive minimally adequate care for your mental health problems.

266
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:13,740
And if you see the German medical center, government insurance,

267
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:20,070
that is Medicaid is the particularly is the single largest payer psychiatric care for all ages in the United States.

268
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,780
And, in fact, people with psychiatric and substance use disorders are the most common uses of health services under Medicaid.

269
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,899
Now, some states and we're going to learn we're going to hear from Tricia Cortez,

270
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:43,229
who is the executive director of community mental health in November, about what is actually happening here in Washtenaw County.

271
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,380
Because I told you that they released these block grants while the idea of the block grant that,

272
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:59,310
you know, this is very much like devil's in the details. So the idea of the block grant is that states, you know, both can.

273
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:07,440
But more importantly and this is like kind of like the federalism kind of argument should be the best there is.

274
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,760
They should be the deciders about mental health care for their populations.

275
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,780
Right. So like what works in California won't work in Alabama.

276
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,220
Right. That's this is like the federalism argument. Okay.

277
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,070
So the notion that the states are going to get this money from the government and they can spend it however they want.

278
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,350
The promise. States can spend the money however they want. Okay.

279
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,400
And so whether or not that, you know, in the bar for like out of providing like there's nobody who does it.

280
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,150
Well, it's not like there's some model where it's like, Oh, Oregon's got to figure it out.

281
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:45,350
Let's just like, do Oregon, you know. So but they're the benefit of the block grants is that they are very flexible.

282
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:52,969
And so what Trish Cortez is going to talk about in terms of what they provide, what that those Medicaid dollars,

283
00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:00,200
how those are used here in Washington County, is to actually provide a lot of wraparound services that provide people with housing support,

284
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,070
transportation support, get you a cell phone, getting you food support, etc.,

285
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:11,960
if you are getting served by Washtenaw County, if you live across the border in Wayne County, none of those things happen.

286
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:22,100
And so one of that, we're also going to hear from Renee here, from a representative from Washtenaw County NAMI,

287
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:29,660
and she'll tell you that when her son has a thought disorder or some sort of schizophrenia or schizophrenic form disorder,

288
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:35,930
when he was diagnosed, the thing her doctor told her was to move to Washtenaw County.

289
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,820
She was living in Oakland County because of the services that he would get care more better.

290
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,380
And she literally started like she moved. She moved to get her son care home.

291
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,810
So this is their website.

292
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:54,440
So again, we're going to you're going to read you're going to read there a strategic plan when we get to that later in the in the class.

293
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,520
But I just want to kind of show it up here so you can kind of take take a look.

294
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:12,680
Yep. Okay. So the other thing just and this is what I started today's lecture with is that these laws so I mentioned that minimum wage for treatment,

295
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,509
etc. but these laws and court cases have really shifted the burden of proof

296
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:23,180
to the state to justify involuntary hospitalization or institutionalization.

297
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:32,770
And so that is you must the state must demonstrate that you are an imminent threat to yourself or others in order to hold you in a hospital.

298
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:41,790
So. As a result. It is, I should say, unintended, because I don't actually know that this was the unintended consequence.

299
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:45,689
But there is a consequence that this may be this is very it can be very extremely

300
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,830
difficult to get someone to do psychiatric care unless they are literally in a crisis.

301
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:57,910
We do not have any mechanism to get someone into care, like without their consent.

302
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:07,070
I guess unless you drive, you know, if you if you're arrested, we can get you into care, even if you're not in a crisis.

303
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:18,719
But beyond that, there is not a way to get people. Almost everybody who's who receives a medical doctor for a common mental disorder.

304
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,140
And I shouldn't say just common disorder, but this is also true.

305
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:28,510
Some people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, are also basically managed in primary care or by a journalist,

306
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,800
by a general practitioner only to a general practitioner.

307
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,370
What that means, general practitioners do not do therapy.

308
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,080
So that means that almost all treatment for common psychiatric disorders in the U.S. is pharmacologic alone.

309
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:48,420
And again, most people who are in the general medical care and see a germinal practitioner are not receiving minimally adequate treatment.

310
00:31:50,980 --> 00:32:00,220
So the questions, yeah, what's the block grant thing and having a stake being able to use money anyway they want.

311
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,970
Are there like restrictions or regulations on like how they can use it or is it like just completely up to them?

312
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,790
So yeah, so the state sets the, the requirements and so they have to be there.

313
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,150
The money is being given to serve this people who have Medicaid so that there's that broad

314
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:26,950
restriction but they states have ability to either get matching funds where they can use whatever.

315
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,399
So for example, the Washtenaw County Mental Health Court, which I don't know if,

316
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,240
will be able to take a field trip in this class because the timing doesn't line up.

317
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,270
But I'm still working on this is funded by a millage.

318
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:47,710
Right. So like we people, we pay more taxes here in Washtenaw County that this passed in 1992 as 18 to 19 just to fund that court.

319
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:55,809
And that court provides all these additional resources and it pays for psychiatric care for people who are in that court, etc.

320
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,920
So but some of that is also because most of the people on the court are also on Medicaid.

321
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,830
Some of those dollars are being matched by Medicaid dollars.

322
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,030
You know, the the other challenges that we talked about this a lot of on Monday, oftentimes policymakers,

323
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,860
they only have like case counts, like, well, how many people have depression or how many people got care for depression?

324
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,130
And so if they're if the proportion of people who got care for depression is like 20% of the people who might have benefited from it,

325
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,399
the state only sees that how many people got care.

326
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:35,710
And so they keep funding that they don't find the rest of it, you know, and the way that dollars are tied,

327
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,390
if we, you know, it's it's literally like it's on a different part of the ledger.

328
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:48,890
Right. So the mental health burden is, is, is an example where you had like the sheriff's department and the psychiatrists on board, you know,

329
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:57,489
and try to figure out how, because the sheriff's department also does not want to be like paying for being a de facto psychiatric hospital.

330
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,059
They don't want that. And but that's on a different part of the ledger from like,

331
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,799
what do you think about like the state legislature where they see that as prisons and the criminal justice system,

332
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,780
they don't see that as mental health. Similarly, social services is not mental health, right?

333
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,480
Like that's something else. And the Department of Health like mental health is not part of the department.

334
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,880
That's a different follow, actually. That's a different line item, right?

335
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,900
So they're like, I just gave a bunch of money for for public health. Why do you need more money?

336
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,580
It's like because none of that public health money that was covered. Money, right.

337
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:35,380
Like that wasn't mental health money because. So Department of public health does not do mental health and is carved out.

338
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,600
It's like your dental care is like carved out of your medical insurance, right?

339
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,940
Because that type of situation, all of these different parts of it all because it's more expensive.

340
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,309
Yeah. She's not going to be heard.

341
00:34:53,310 --> 00:35:02,160
But it would like most people with any mental disorder, benefit from being in a psychiatric hospital.

342
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:10,980
And because of the way media portrays psychiatric hospitals, in my mind, it's kind of reserved for the more extreme users.

343
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:22,440
Yeah, I think that the way that given the infrastructure that exists for them now, the answer is no, that it would not be good for most people to be.

344
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:32,070
But what are there times when living with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or major depression where you would benefit from inpatient care 100%?

345
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:39,840
100%. Right. But is that does that mean now we're actually going to watch a video by Fred Freeze, who's a cop?

346
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:51,089
Actually, I won't disclose that. So the challenge is, without adequate inpatient care and when I say inpatient care,

347
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,620
I mean just so like even number of events like psychiatric, that's like in a regular hospital, right?

348
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,930
Without care.

349
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:05,969
Without that infrastructure, what ends up happening is that people I mean, if one of the advocates that is not able to do our course this year,

350
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:14,280
but I'll share his story of his daughter when his daughter is diagnosed with schizophrenia, she literally spent ten days in a regular emergency room.

351
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,440
Waiting for a bit. Attendance?

352
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,809
No. And the the notion that and, you know,

353
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:33,500
she had a she ended up being treated in a nursing home for the vast majority of her life where she died in that nursing home.

354
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:42,920
And and it's is we do not have the infrastructure for people with serious mental illness to

355
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:50,150
get to even get to a point where the VA living like outpatient treatment is is possible.

356
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,870
Right. Because we kind of allow people to get to this crisis or crisis place.

357
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,680
And if the way you get diagnosed, schizophrenia is.

358
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:07,709
You get arrested and in prison, you might interact with a psychiatrist for the first time in your life or an officer,

359
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,600
you know, they're using drugs, right? They're doing other things that get them enmeshed in the criminal justice system.

360
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,180
And then it makes it harder to get to appropriate care settings.

361
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,129
Not sure if I'm getting my wires crossed on the issues,

362
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:30,810
but like how is the block grant funding like a cheaper alternative to psychiatric hospitals if we do

363
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,840
have like all of these different like carved out systems going on because like the ten days in the E.R.

364
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,930
Oh, yes. Oh, here's how. So that's a great question.

365
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:49,010
So. The federal government does not like those saying those state psychiatric hospitals were being paid by the state.

366
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:56,170
The BLOCK grant is from the feds. And so it literally came from like you would.

367
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:03,549
And the block grant was like, we are not paying for inpatient care because inpatient care is inhumane and you need to close down those hospitals.

368
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,440
And so here's this other money that's going to solve that.

369
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:12,309
And so the states, rather than saying I'm going to keep my infrastructure and have this extra money to help outpatient,

370
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:17,260
you're like, I'm going to cut that out of my budget and just use this block.

371
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:24,820
That's what happened and that's it. So it's literally just you and I and the American Psychosis Book.

372
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,160
I highly recommend it. The following The author's name is Fuller Torrey, and he's, you know.

373
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,470
You know, I'm sure. I actually think he's probably passed now.

374
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,050
But he's a very he's a muckraker.

375
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:45,250
I'm not saying I agree with everything that he says, but it's it is it was very liberating to me where I'm like, oh, I see.

376
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:54,010
I see where these bad and how these good intentions when, when, when it really came down to like follow the money, like why this came out the way it.

377
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:05,360
Yes. Was it truly necessary to shut down all these hospitals trying to restructure?

378
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,510
It's always like a question of like abolition versus trying.

379
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,810
I, i but it just seems like the alternative short answer is no.

380
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,690
It was not necessary that the I mean, and I don't even think that that's what advocates were really trying to make happen.

381
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,820
What they wanted was humane care. You know,

382
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:28,760
and when it when the state saw that they could be checking the box of we are providing

383
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,899
mental health care for our population with this new Fed money because prior to that,

384
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,930
prior to that act, there was no Fed money like it was all states providing inpatient psychiatric care.

385
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,589
But again, we do get pharmacology,

386
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:53,090
which does make these state psychiatric hospitals less necessary for a group of people for whom until that point, they are necessary.

387
00:39:53,370 --> 00:40:01,129
Right. So that's that's the other sort of important point. The problem is we closed the hospitals and there was nothing for them to go to because the

388
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:06,970
centers that were funded through the Community Mental Health Act were focused on prevention.

389
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:13,400
They were not focused on patients with serious mental illness and they were not adequately staffed.

390
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,050
And so it wasn't that the state psychiatric hospital closes.

391
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:24,350
And as you're heading out there, like, by the way, here's your new doctor's name, here's where they are, here's how you're going to get care.

392
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,730
They're just closed. And they're like, we're we're building a center.

393
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,660
And soon there will be doctors like that's you know what I mean?

394
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:37,010
And like, it's just like that. It wasn't like there was a smooth handoff between those two.

395
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,410
And part of this is because, like, you know, oftentimes people with serious mental illness,

396
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,250
like they don't have strong family networks because like their family doesn't understand what's going on.

397
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:54,950
And they may have like, do, you know, stuff like that where they're ending up in homeless shelters and prisons, you know?

398
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,510
So. Here's a new good news.

399
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:08,270
Okay. And so understandably, this situation is untenable for people who live with serious, serious mental illness.

400
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:14,569
So let me tell you about what advocates how they have been working to address that.

401
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:21,410
So this is I want to play video is a very short video, but I encourage you to look this guy up.

402
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,850
So he passed away a couple of years ago.

403
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:32,720
His name is Fred Freeze and he is he is sort of the idea of like for us, by us, like, you must involve us in mental health service.

404
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:52,130
I'm a person with schizophrenia. I was hospitalized mostly in downtown Las Vegas.

405
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,510
Once I was hiring Shane Holloway.

406
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:17,460
I mean, these are the rest of my life. And when I was able to worm myself out of that situation, I decided things needed to change.

407
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:29,160
Matt and I kind of like normal family. I like to refer to us with derogatory terms like wackos and nutcases and ghettos.

408
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,160
And this is something that we have that channel.

409
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:42,390
We have modern immigrants, the ability to recover from well, we carry a document with us, but we also have a cognitive abilities.

410
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:51,780
You just published an article where I identified ten, a psychiatrist and a psychologist and who all have been hospitalized like I have schizophrenia.

411
00:42:52,080 --> 00:43:02,190
It is about time that we recognize individuals with these disorders no longer need to be locked out of society as they were when I was a young man.

412
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:08,820
I absolutely refuse to be ashamed of this condition and so forth and the whole

413
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,970
shameful one that nobody would have anything to do with people like that.

414
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,540
Well, I'm one of those and I refuse to be ashamed.

415
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:26,520
And I stand by those of us who have various forms of psychosis to my mouth moving here.

416
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:33,599
This is involuntary movement from the medications that I have now that I'm I don't consider myself

417
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,750
recovered and I consider myself as most of my brothers and sisters as being a person in recovery.

418
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:52,350
It is something that we live with and we need to let the larger normal community know that we're not locked away in the hospitals anymore.

419
00:43:52,710 --> 00:44:04,350
We are out there 85% unemployed, but that's mostly because there's such prejudice and discrimination against us that we're not not given a chance.

420
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:09,960
And we really need to change that. That's Fred.

421
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,940
And one of the things that the movement has done again so that.

422
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,270
He's not ready yet.

423
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:35,840
So. So one of the things that advocacy groups have been instrumental for and said so again hospitals close the government alternatives.

424
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,730
Community mental health centers did not go as planned. What else is there?

425
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:51,190
And so what else is there is institutions and structures created by people living with serious mental illness for people with mental illness.

426
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:58,910
So one of the most important models that we still have here, I must show you an example of one is here in Ann Arbor is the clubhouse model.

427
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:06,190
So clubhouses are places where people can go and look at everyone who's in the

428
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,340
clubhouse is dealing with some sort of mental health or substance use problem.

429
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,760
This is different from supportive housing because people aren't living there.

430
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,010
This is a social environment where people are able to learn job skills, where they're able to have friends,

431
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,330
where they happen to play ping pong, they're able to have a social life and develop friendships.

432
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,440
I want you to pay attention to this guy's name, Bill Eaton. So he was my advisor at Hopkins.

433
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,700
He's the guy of this study that I told you about. We're going to talk about him when we talk about schizophrenia.

434
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,590
And so this is entirely developed completely outside of the health care system, has nothing to do with the health care system.

435
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,490
We didn't ask for their permission because I'm not really.

436
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:48,790
Okay. So this is something that they've got to provide for what they would like, which is rehabilitation.

437
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:55,119
And as Fred refers to himself as in recovery. So let me this is not our center.

438
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,799
This is of a different center that is like that.

439
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:10,000
It's a clubhouse. And this one is in Saint Louis. Do I have just lost my job and I needed another stability in my life?

440
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:16,419
Either I finish school and everything started to fall apart two years ago.

441
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:23,470
So I recently came back here to the infinite center and they help me get my life back together.

442
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:28,750
Christine She's one of my support workers and I can talk to her about anything.

443
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:38,260
I really enjoy seeing others thrive within their lives and fulfilling their goals and me being able to help them meet their needs on their own.

444
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:46,060
Nobody is treated any differently because they have a mental illness or anything, but they're treated just as you are.

445
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:54,250
I come here, I know no one says, Well, you have bipolar, so that's why you act the way you do.

446
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:02,590
So when I do slough off the handle, they already know I'm have on my episodes, but they don't judge me for that.

447
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:12,070
They basically come to me and ask me, you know, is this something that we can do to help you through your situation?

448
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,909
And I think that's more helpful to me.

449
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:22,180
This is a membership. You are able to do whatever you can to make the community run.

450
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,750
So if you belong to something and that's the very unique part that the clubhouse has.

451
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,329
So that's an example of some of these experience.

452
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,000
So this is ours here in Ann Arbor. It's called Fresh Starts.

453
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:47,350
You can go to our website about how to is a proud sponsor of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.

454
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:56,320
Sorry so so this is and there's having a5k actually in a couple weeks so if people are in October.

455
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:03,970
So I just wanted to let you know that this is why I'm here, that you're able to show this is not a place you would volunteer at.

456
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:10,150
You make that clear. This is all right. So if unless you yourself are living with a serious illness, right, then you can join this clubhouse.

457
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:18,760
But this is not a place for like other people to come and help. Is is like the safe place for people to develop their own agency and help themselves.

458
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:24,280
Right. But you could give them money and walk three one miles.

459
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,560
Okay. So the other thing I want to tell you about before I let you lose to talk to each other about your concept maps,

460
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:35,829
our criminal justice diversion program. So as I mentioned a little bit earlier, we have one here in Washtenaw County.

461
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,670
This is a that is we have a mental health court. And so this is, of course,

462
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:50,559
in recognition of the fact that the police and emergency responders are often the people who get called when somebody is having a

463
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:56,260
crisis because they're having a crisis because there's no way to get them into care involuntarily until they have that crisis.

464
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,459
There are other types of things like crisis intervention teams,

465
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,350
and I know some of you are interested in doing that carefully because those are relatively new.

466
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:09,060
We have some data on them, but not great data on mental health support.

467
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,580
We have a little bit more data. They've been around quite a bit longer than 2011.

468
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:22,389
So we and what they show in general is that people who are these are of course, not randomized controlled trials,

469
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,140
but they're sort of like before the courts are around, after the courts around.

470
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,109
I guess the last thing I'll say is that people opt into this court. This is a voluntary court that you opt into.

471
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:36,220
So nobody is forced to enroll in a mental health court.

472
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,940
And the mental health court here was. Not counting. It is a yearlong program.

473
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:46,770
Most of the things that people get arrested for that is you are basically on probation for a year.

474
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,720
If you enter a mental health club, okay.

475
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:56,640
But during that year long period, you are getting supportive housing, you're getting occupational housing, you're getting treatment, etc., etc.

476
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:01,860
But from most of the things that people have been arrested for,

477
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:07,110
which makes them eligible for mental health support, they might only serve somebody in jail or something.

478
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:12,240
Right. So it's not like they are committing to a much longer engagement with the court.

479
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:16,799
But the records are also private. They're sealed records.

480
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,430
And so people don't know if you fit in. So they're trying to kind of balance it.

481
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:26,759
But the point is that it still is a court. Again, this is you're going to read this when we talk about mental health and the law later on.

482
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,640
But this is how this and if you're interested in this or you're doing a project on this, I encourage you to check out this.

483
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:36,540
What, you're going to read it later anyway, but you can check out this reading. All right.

484
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,250
And I think this is my last slide before I let it loose.

485
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:46,140
So mental health services, again, in health care system we have today, the majority don't receive minimally adequate care.

486
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,900
Keep this in mind with the reading that you did this week, that getting, you know,

487
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:59,850
when people persist in working to get to a care provider that is effective, they do do well.

488
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:06,000
Right. So it's both. The challenge is, is that when you have a serious mental illness, it's often very difficult to persist.

489
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,560
And oftentimes, as far as like a strong social support network or family members to help you with that,

490
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,100
you've had substantial changes in the past 50 years about how mental health care is delivered.

491
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:24,420
And yes, inpatient hospitalization still occur, but the shift is because of the way that Medicaid is funded.

492
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,920
This is really shifted the burden from state roles to federal roles, etc.

493
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,560
And we have had these more recent advances like the Mental Health Parity Act and the mental health supports.

494
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:46,680
So before I looked like it illness. Let me ask if there are other questions here about like the clubhouse model or anything else.

495
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:59,110
Okay. So for the next 28 minutes, we'll do this show through the end of class.

496
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:05,110
And I'd like you to get with a partner or two and share your concept map.

497
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:11,620
So this is all this is an activity on canvas. And so what I'd like you to do is give a each sort of take turn.

498
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:22,570
So set a timer, take turns. You're going to have maybe seven or you have time, but maybe say like 6 minutes each.

499
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:26,500
So set a timer so everybody gets a chance to.

500
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,620
And if you're in a group, a three but two presenter to give a little brief understanding of like,

501
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,840
this is what I'm trying to do as my main elements and then just discuss it.

502
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:41,830
So give the kind of feedback I want you to give is like, is the project to follow, does need to be more focused, is it too narrow?

503
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,800
Are there things that you think are missing?

504
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:51,390
And also, like, do you know, resources or stakeholders that might be helpful for this person who's doing this project?

505
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,510
Right. So so I will give you a two minute warning when we're ready.

506
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,120
Well, I'll give you a warning that you should switch if you haven't already.

507
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:11,740
But either get with a partner or you can take 10 minutes or get with a larger group and you can take a little bit less if you were trying.
