1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:18,070
So once a public health issue is identified as a priority, that needs to be addressed, how do we decide whether it's appropriate to intervene?

2
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,470
To help us think about how to make this decision.

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,310
You can use a balancing framework to determine whether a policy intervention is actually appropriate to undertake.

4
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,990
Let's look at the framework together. The framework has six different components.

5
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,250
The nature of the abridgment. The extent of the abridgment.

6
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,590
The nature of the public health benefits. The costs of the intervention.

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,770
Any alternatives to the intervention. And the extent of harm to third parties.

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,900
If no intervention takes place at all. So I think it's a good idea to step through this with an example.

9
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,870
And let's use one that's frequently discussed. Tobacco control.

10
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,930
Let's say the city council enacts a new ban on smoking in all public places.

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,250
This ban, then, is the abridgment. All public places.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:19,690
No smoking allowed. So the city council is restricting your right as the individual to smoke in any public place.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,000
So the extent of this abridgment is that it actually infringes on your right to smoke wherever you want.

14
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,830
Moving forward in the framework, then what is the nature of the public health benefit?

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:43,100
Is the city's interest compelling? Is there a reasonable relationship between what is being proposed and what the health outcomes will be?

16
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:52,460
Thinking about evidence, then does banning smoking in public places actually prevent the negative health consequences or not?

17
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:01,970
And if you think about that idea of those core principles of public health and going back to our discussion of science and evidence,

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:10,160
how do you prove it? What's the evidence? Moving beyond defining the abridgment and the nature of the public health benefits.

19
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:16,400
We have to think then about costs. What does it actually cost to implement this intervention?

20
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,570
So let's think about some examples of costs that might apply here.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,140
So if I enact a ban on smoking in all public places, how do I signal people?

22
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,450
Well, I might need to install some signage indicating that no smoking is allowed.

23
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,760
Maybe you can think then about some other costs that need to be considered.

24
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,600
If someone walks into a public place and tries to smoke,

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:48,010
maybe we need to train those people who are working in those environments, in those public places on how to handle that person.

26
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,460
What do they need to say? How do they handle the situation?

27
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,880
And that training process likely has a cost associated.

28
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,570
So moving then beyond costs, what are some alternatives to the intervention?

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,240
So maybe smoking can be banned in a certain grouping of public places.

30
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,570
Or maybe we can ban smoking in certain rooms inside of those public places.

31
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:20,340
But at this point, what we're thinking about in the framework is what's the least intrusive way to achieve our goal?

32
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:29,670
Now, in Michigan, as an example, a smoking ban was put in place in public places, but the casinos were actually exempted out of the ban.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,870
So you can see here how the intrusiveness of the public health intervention was considered very carefully.

34
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:45,600
And certain places were found exempt. So if we then move beyond that component of the framework into our final component,

35
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:53,460
we have to think then about what the actual extent is of the harm to people if there's no intervention at all.

36
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,470
So how are citizens impacted by smoking in a public place?

37
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,180
What are the actual health consequences if we don't intervene at all?

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,360
And that's a very important part of the balancing framework,

39
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:13,620
because you need to really think about what the intervention positives are in terms of those health consequences.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,680
And then you need to consider how intrusive it is into the rights of individuals.

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:31,110
So if you take this framework and then step through it on other public health issues like obesity, gun violence, distracted driving or bioterrorism,

42
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:39,600
you'll see that there are a lot of questions that we need to consider when we're introducing a policy oriented public health intervention.
