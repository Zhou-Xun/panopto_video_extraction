2
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:11,031
Now let's talk about what we mean when
we refer to disease prevention in

3
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:12,352
a technical sense.

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:14,700
Here's a definition.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,650
Disease prevention is the anticipatory
action taken to reduce the possibility

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,730
of an event or
condition occurring or developing.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,940
Or to minimize the damage that
may result from the event or

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,780
condition if it does occur.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,812
Generally we talk about
three levels of prevention.

10
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:40,010
I'm gonna define each of them and
then I will turn to some examples of them.

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,410
Primary prevention is for
individuals who are free of symptoms.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,400
But could be susceptible to
a disease that can be avoided.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,190
Secondary prevention is an individual
with symptoms, but they're asymptomatic.

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:03,390
Secondary prevention can prevent or reduce
the severity of health consequences.

15
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,810
Tertiary prevention means that
an individual is symptomatic.

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,290
They need to be treated for
a condition and

17
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:17,090
that treatment is intended to
reduce complications or disability.

18
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,790
As you'll see as I go through a couple
of examples here, primary and secondary

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,010
prevention are what we're really talking
about when we talk about prevention.

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,000
Tertiary prevention is really treatment.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,490
It's generally medical treatment.

22
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,290
So let me give an example
with motor vehicle injuries.

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,240
One mode of primary prevention
is to build divided highways.

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,580
When you have cars travelling at
great speeds in opposite directions,

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,010
if you divide the highway, then they're
much less likely to have collisions.

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,300
That's primary prevention, no symptoms,

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,340
you're avoiding the problem
from occurring.

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,390
Secondary prevention
requires safer cars for

29
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,530
example having airbags or
requiring the use of seat belts in cars.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:10,105
In this instance, if there is a collision,
two cars crash, a car runs into a tree,

31
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:17,130
or what have you, these measures
may well avoid a serious injury.

32
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,530
So the accident occurs,
in effect the symptom occurs if you will,

33
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,700
but you manage to avoid
adverse consequences.

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,130
Tertiary prevention in this instance would
be an emergency medical services system.

35
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,560
Somebody's in an accident,
they are injured seriously,

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,810
and they have to be treated.

37
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,600
So we have an EMS system that comes,
picks them up, takes them to a hospital,

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,342
and hopefully, makes them better.

39
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:49,340
Let me give you another example
that's actually a very prominent one,

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,020
when we talk about the different
types of prevention.

41
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,080
Specifically, I wanna take
the case of high blood pressure.

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,980
Primary prevention involves
dietary education and exercise.

43
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,927
If you eat a good diet,
you exercise regularly,

44
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:08,211
you may never have high blood pressure.

45
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:13,282
Secondary prevention takes people
who have high blood pressure,

46
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:19,760
but they're not ill, and puts them on
blood pressure control medications.

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,890
These medications bring
their blood pressure down.

48
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,960
And hopefully will
prevent the occurrence of

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,220
high blood pressure-related
diseases in the future.

50
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,010
Tertiary prevention would involve
the treatment of a disease

51
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,160
that has resulted already
from high blood pressure.

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,390
So as I noted, while we have these three
levels of prevention, we tend to think of

53
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,330
prevention and public health as
referring to primary and secondary.

54
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,620
Tertiary prevention is really
medical care treatment for

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,485
conditions that have already occurred.
