00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:16,899
Joanna Kovacevich: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for coming this morning. Can you all let me know if you're seeing my slides

2
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:32,399
Joanna Kovacevich: thumbs up? Thank you very much. Some, yes, is in the chat. Thank you. Welcome to this tech talks for Gsi theories we're doing today.

3
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:45,879
Joanna Kovacevich: We are recording each of these sessions. So if you have to pop out at any time, or if you miss any, we will share these out after today.

4
00:00:46,319 --> 00:01:03,249
Joanna Kovacevich: So our schedule for today is we're starting with a resilient teaching, talking about um resilient teaching in these times, where things can change at any moment, every day, every class period, and teaching with canvas is following that

5
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:08,668
Joanna Kovacevich: we're going to talk about grade scope, a tool that's integrated into canvas to help with grading.

6
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,508
Joanna Kovacevich: And then in the afternoon we'll talk about tools for engaging your students.

7
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:25,759
Joanna Kovacevich: We're going to talk about put recording with panopto, for In-person classes and Then we're going to talk about zoom teaching with zoom for remote classes.

8
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,759
Joanna Kovacevich: My name is Joanna Kovacovic, and I am part of the instructional services team, and we will be leading these sessions today.

9
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:50,038
Joanna Kovacevich: Um, starting with Frederick Lopez, the our assistant Director of Instructional services. Um! She will be doing a session today, Monica Rosen, an instructional designer on our team, and then i'll also be giving sessions today.

10
00:01:50,369 --> 00:02:02,238
Joanna Kovacevich: Um! I'll share this out Ah, later in some later slides. But you can contact us at any time at sph instruction at you, Mish Edu, for questions about your course,

11
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:07,489
Joanna Kovacevich: canvas any of the tools we talked about today, and this is the team that you will reach.

12
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:20,198
Joanna Kovacevich: So our first session today is resilient teaching with Frederick, and I will stop my screen share so that she can bring up her presentation.

13
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:51,412
Frederique Laubepin: So for this first hour. Um, you know this is what meant to to teach you how to teach, which would take uh, you know, quite a bit longer. Um, but instead, to give you some uh pointers in terms of um. You know what we're calling resilient teaching um, you know you know more of a sort of like a mindset, a framework for how to approach uh teaching

14
00:02:51,423 --> 00:03:01,542
Frederique Laubepin: in the conditions that we're in these days. So let me share my screen,

15
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,373
Frederique Laubepin: and

16
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,753
Frederique Laubepin: oh,

17
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:24,282
Frederique Laubepin: so feel free to interrupt at any time, or put questions in the chat. I'll try to keep an eye out for them. But do you know, feel free to holler if we're a small enough group that that's totally fine. So

18
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:39,953
Frederique Laubepin: the objective, as I mentioned is to explore how we can use the cdc trauma-informed approach to building a resonant teaching mindset and supporting students needs

19
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:41,543
so

20
00:03:41,553 --> 00:04:11,123
Frederique Laubepin: you may have been exposed to the Cdc. Um trauma informed uh approach it wasn't designed for teaching, but it um. It works very well in a a teaching uh context. Um, because it's it's got me quite a bit of uh uh exposure over the last two years. Um, and it's something that uh here in the school we've tried to implement um from the beginning of the pandemic as sort of a uh, you know, a way to implement or reinforce

21
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,372
best practices in in teaching.

22
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:26,733
Frederique Laubepin: So what would you say is different about teaching drawing, or in the aftermath of a pandemic, and you might, you know, speak here. Ah, also from your personal experience as a student

23
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:32,513
Frederique Laubepin: it's. So funny already is it Fang or fame-frang.

24
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:37,383
Fang Fang: I'm: Sorry. Yeah, it's fine. It's fun.

25
00:04:37,423 --> 00:05:03,662
Frederique Laubepin: Okay, I had a feeling I was this Ah mispronouncing your name So as as you mentioned earlier. Ah, you know something that is different is has to do with the uncertainty around certain things like, what format am I teaching it right? Is it going to be in person. Is it great to be online? Is it going to be a hybrid today or this week?

26
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:14,783
Fang Fang: So uncertainty is definitely part of the picture. Is there anything else that is different about teaching and learning

27
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,423
Frederique Laubepin: today?

28
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:25,273
Frederique Laubepin: Well, maybe you found that your own needs as students have changed.

29
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:29,264
Frederique Laubepin: That could also be um a way to get it. This question

30
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:50,651
Cheukying Rosita Szeto: uh, I guess it's not necessary. Um me teaching, but more like on a learner, and uh sometime I find it um going back to inversion will be difficult or sometime uh, if the class is online, I might not be as motivated, and that kind of like

31
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:51,751
Cheukying Rosita Szeto: um.

32
00:05:52,081 --> 00:06:08,961
Cheukying Rosita Szeto: I feel somewhat like maybe the same way, I'm in person as well, not as just motivated as before after the pandemic. Just we got ready online for so long or like, if you're a little bit out, we're about in person. Yeah,

33
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:39,090
Frederique Laubepin: Yeah, no. There's not really, uh, you know, a lot of. Uh, you know this is all resilient teaching, but I feel like our resilience. Our collective resilience has eroded quite a bit over the last two years. Um, and this is due to, you know. So everybody is uh is pretty exhausted. Uh, you know, being a line all the time is exhausting, uh, emotionally going through a pandemic is a stop thing. Um! And uh, you know, as you were mentioning receipt, there is uh

34
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:48,601
Frederique Laubepin: uneasiness sometimes, and you know, going back to doing things in person and motivation engagement.

35
00:06:48,611 --> 00:07:05,661
Um, as you can tell right like even today, just uh whatever one, two, or three, or just the six of us right? Um sort of, you know. Engaging is not necessarily uh as easy as it used to be right it. It takes a lot more to kind of

36
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:34,850
Frederique Laubepin: bring people into things to, you know. Get people to um to start talking, and this is something that you um, as you know, uh teachers, um might also encounter. Uh, you know, as you're teaching your uh your section. Um. So everything that you're feeling as students sort of like the the difficulty in motivating yourselves. Uh, you know, every uh every morning. That's something that everybody is feeling in that

37
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:48,321
Frederique Laubepin: is, uh struggling with. So there's you know, in a way teaching Hasn't changed much, and in another way it's changed tremendously.

38
00:07:48,331 --> 00:08:08,821
Frederique Laubepin: So we'll talk a little bit about how we can uh what we can do to try and address uh some of these things, and hopefully, the tools that um will present you. Um in the other sessions will also uh give you some uh, uh, you know, some tools to uh to help with some of the issues.

39
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:10,931
Frederique Laubepin: So

40
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:34,460
Frederique Laubepin: part of what we need to do is remember to ah keep things as student focused in how we approach teaching, whether it's designing, of course, designing a discussion section or how we you know what we do during our sessions, keeping things as treated and focused as possible, so that we can support People's success.

41
00:08:34,471 --> 00:09:02,580
Frederique Laubepin: Um! We can help. Ah, we can help them stay. Ah motivated, which ah, as we were just mentioning, is a challenge. Um, there's lots and lots of stressors that people are still going through right? So the the pandemic is abating. But um! People are still very much ah stressed out, and things haven't necessarily eased everywhere. So you know, we find ourselves also having to help um

42
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:13,860
Frederique Laubepin: students navigate through stressors as well as helping to rebuild connections. Right? So while we've been able to stay connected,

43
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:40,671
Frederique Laubepin: um, you know, in a remote fashion. Um. The pandemic also has, uh, you know, at the same time very much damage our ability to um, you know, build networks and mean on each other. And uh, um, do this kind of, you know, build community. So part of the the you know. Part part of our task is to help the students to build that network and build that community

44
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:55,190
Frederique Laubepin: as I was mentioning, what can help us do? This is the Cdc's trauma-informed framework, and this framework has six guiding principles.

45
00:09:55,201 --> 00:10:13,040
Frederique Laubepin: Um, which you know will, as we'll talk about in a minute, we should try and use in everything we do right. So the the name of the game here is going to be. How can we infuse these principles in everything we do when we, when we teach

46
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:39,840
xueting tao: so? Um the principles, range from, you know, establishing safety. And here we mean not just ah physical safety. Um, but also emotional and psychological safety. So um, you know, we can talk a little bit about how that might happen in a in a classroom. Um Trustworthiness and transparency transparency is um is hugely important. So um!

47
00:10:39,851 --> 00:11:09,370
xueting tao: And there's many different ways where we can enhance um transparency, and in teaching so um anytime we can do this, we should. We should do that um, making sure that we build um pr support um. The idea of collaboration and neutrality um is also important as well as the um empowerment and choice, which is not something that we typically think about when we are Um, you know, when we teach

48
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:29,830
Frederique Laubepin: um, the students don't necessarily have much ah of a voice or a choice. Um, but um! This is an important part of the of the framework. And then there's this um last piece. Last principle that has to do with cultural, historical and gender issues which we also need to be

49
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:49,100
Frederique Laubepin: ah mindful of and uh, you know, try to address um explicitly, and this is also tied to. Of course. Uh you know Dni initiatives um as well as um anti-racist um teaching um initiatives at the at the school.

50
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:51,961
Frederique Laubepin: Sorry

51
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:55,271
Frederique Laubepin: Um, actually

52
00:11:55,631 --> 00:12:02,760
Frederique Laubepin: so. Just a Sec. Put in the chat

53
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:06,010
Frederique Laubepin: we're going to

54
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:24,241
Frederique Laubepin: ah use this ah board to try and brainstorm some ways in which we can infuse these principles into our teaching. So if you click on the link

55
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:38,830
Frederique Laubepin: um in the chat that should take you to um this idea board where you should be able to click on a little green plus side and start adding sticky notes. So the idea here is, you know.

56
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:53,131
Frederique Laubepin: How might we infuse you? You know, transparency into the class, for example, what does transparency look like in teaching or safety, or, you know, collaboration and mutuality?

57
00:12:53,471 --> 00:13:03,390
Frederique Laubepin: So if you want to take a few minutes and start jutting down some some notes. There.

58
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:07,131
Frederique Laubepin: We can

59
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:11,851
Frederique Laubepin: talk about those in a little bit,

60
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:25,409
Frederique Laubepin: they could have a a good start here. Um! Anybody want to contribute something to the category of empowerment, voice and choice? What, what,

61
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,320
Frederique Laubepin: ha!

62
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,820
Frederique Laubepin: What could that look like?

63
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:39,249
Frederique Laubepin: And then in the is the encouraged students to speak their mind in the employment voice, And I think it is

64
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,010
Frederique Laubepin: very good, so there are some um,

65
00:13:49,020 --> 00:14:18,309
Frederique Laubepin: you know you. You have some good ideas here, and some you know you're touching on some um important uh important topic. So feel free to um to keep adding to this Um! As we keep talking. Um, we'll definitely talk about uh grading, because that's one of the uh, most important areas uh where you can make a difference. Um, and you can implement uh, you know. Uh, you can make things more transparent and uh and

66
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,740
Frederique Laubepin: make a difference for the for the students

67
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:32,710
Frederique Laubepin: safety. I was wondering if i'm not sure who added the sticky on modeling in the open environment. But I was wondering if you could. Ah say a little bit more about what you led here.

68
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:53,080
Frederique Laubepin: So that was me. And I thought as

69
00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:05,989
Frederique Laubepin: just size modeling an open environment of safety where it's okay to speak openly and share it may go better in a different category. But

70
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:35,869
Frederique Laubepin: no, it's um. It's actually part of safety. And um, Some of these things can actually fit in categories, and that's really fine. Um, but um Jonah makes a a really great point, which is that? Um, you know we need to think of safety very broadly. So um, you know. I I think uh somebody had a sticky earlier that about, uh, you know, not making people come to the building in extreme weather, you know. That's one of the

71
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:44,989
Frederique Laubepin: of Michigan, you know. Sometimes the the weather does get kind of extreme, and the the temperatures get pretty low,

72
00:15:45,030 --> 00:16:14,830
Frederique Laubepin: so you know Ah! Ensuring everybody is safe. Ah, physically is. Ah is important as well as you know, following whatever Cdc recommendations might be, for you know the evolution of the of the pandemic. That's also Ah, you know physical safety, but creating um, you know, an open environment and inclusive environment. A supportive environment not only goes to some of the other elements of

73
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:29,340
Frederique Laubepin: the you know the framework, but It also helps to build psychological and emotional safety for people so definitely a very important piece of the of the framework.

74
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,999
Frederique Laubepin: Um.

75
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,589
Frederique Laubepin: So let me see. I'm trying to um.

76
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:51,239
Frederique Laubepin: You know we can talk a little bit about the you know the peer support, like I said, we'll definitely touch on the assignments and grading, because that's so important for people. And

77
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,510
Frederique Laubepin: yeah, communication as well, so excellent. So let me go back to

78
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,140
Frederique Laubepin: to the presentation.

79
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,879
Frederique Laubepin: Um,

80
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,519
Frederique Laubepin: all right. So

81
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:30,180
Frederique Laubepin: the idea like I mentioned earlier is for us to think about. Um all the different ways we can um infuse these principles into what we do, and it can be um, it can be big, or it could be small, but um, you know they should uh inform all the decisions we make. Um as we approach teaching and our relationships with the students.

82
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:46,030
Frederique Laubepin: So one of the places where we can implement some of these principles is in the syllabus, and I understand that you are not the instructor of record for the course that the syllabus is somewhat determined by the

83
00:17:46,120 --> 00:18:15,469
Frederique Laubepin: uh. You know the faculty who's teaching the class? Um, but you may. Um, you know you may have a say um, or you may be able to. Uh give some input into the syllabus. Um faculty are not always um, you know they're a little bit removed from the student experience. So uh, you know it's. It's not necessarily easy to not to be aware of uh places where they could improve things. Um, And you're in a very uh sort of position because you are.

84
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:26,260
You will be teaching, but you are also still students. And so you're You're a lot closer to the student experience than the faculty are in some cases

85
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:47,760
Frederique Laubepin: The Gsis also have, you know, make their own discussion. Section Syllabus. And if that's the case, then it's going to be especially important for you to utilize, to leverage the principles of the trauma informed approach. So one thing that we

86
00:18:47,770 --> 00:19:07,520
Frederique Laubepin: we need to sort of ah part from is to think of the syllabus as a as a contract which is the widely accepted approach to building. So by um. You know everywhere. Um! What this usually sets up is. You know the idea that education is a transaction.

87
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:21,979
Frederique Laubepin: Um, It's usually written in in really cold, impersonal language. It kind of implies that professor and students are on two different sides, as opposed to being collaborators in the learning um in the learning experience.

88
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:50,119
Frederique Laubepin: So there's some sort of like this um antagonistic uh sort of relationship that is set up in syllabus as a as a contract. It also implies that students will break the rules so already, and the profess isn't even started, and we're already setting things up. Um, you know, with language about sanctions. Ah, when the students don't abide by the by the rules. Um

89
00:19:50,130 --> 00:20:12,589
Frederique Laubepin: it ten stupid things in pretty strong terms. Ah, you know. If Ah, if rules are broken. Um, there's no room for ambiguity and flexibility. So speaking of um, you know, employment, voice, and choice. For example, the syllabus is usually given to the students. Um, and nothing in it is up for for discussion. There's no um,

90
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:41,399
Frederique Laubepin: you know there's there's no room there for a collaboration. There's no room for input from the students into anything in the in the course. And then one thing that you know we don't usually think about is that the expectations for the students are usually very clearly, but there's no mention of what the students can expect from their um instructor.

91
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:51,579
Frederique Laubepin: So again a very one-sided approach to building this relationship between the instructors and the and the students.

92
00:20:51,590 --> 00:21:01,930
Frederique Laubepin: So already you can see here that just looking at what's on the slide here and thinking about the framework I just presented you,

93
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:15,989
Frederique Laubepin: You might already be seeing many different ways in which you could change something in the syllabus to include some of the principles we were just talking about.

94
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:44,969
Frederique Laubepin: Like I said, you know not. Everything has to be a Ah, you know, drastic change to what we do or how we do it. Some things can be very small tweaks, so you know whether the whereas the syllabus is a contract, and to use very cold and impersonal language, we can change the language to be more warm and supportive. So, instead of saying things like students shall Ah, you know, do X.

95
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,550
Frederique Laubepin: To talk about you, and we, as a as a class, already makes a difference

96
00:21:52,580 --> 00:22:06,060
Frederique Laubepin: for the students and helps to create a more inclusive environment, you know, for the for the students

97
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:34,870
Frederique Laubepin: something that often comes up in, you know, in course, evaluations. And um, you know, as a as a pain point for the students is either not feeling comfortable, going to office hours or the faculty not holding um office hours or not building them regularly, so that the students, ah, you know, feel like they. They have some place to go um to get some help if they need to.

98
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Frederique Laubepin: So this is a very small tweak, So, making sure that you, you you set aside some time to meet with your students. You are available,

99
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:55,679
Frederique Laubepin: and that's clearly. You know It's made explicit to them, you know, when that's going to be, and where they can find you, is one of those

100
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:14,859
Frederique Laubepin: tweaks that can already start to make a to make a difference. Um, a bigger tweak and something that you might think about, especially in terms of the you know how you handle the policies for your own interactions with the students,

101
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:44,780
Frederique Laubepin: you know, instead of dictating how things are done in your discussion section, for example, in your lab Um, is there a way to include a a student voice in there. Is there a way to build in more flexibility? Um! Is there a way to empower? Ah, students a little bit more instead of having the course. Um, you know, happening at them um to, you know, as I, as I mentioned, make this a

102
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,709
Frederique Laubepin: collaborative um teaching and learning experience.

103
00:23:48,920 --> 00:24:18,870
Frederique Laubepin: And then, if you you know, if you want, you can move toward more extensive. Ah, revisions! Um! And one of those. And this is something that you touched on in the idea Board um is ah is to work on the assignments, and to make the the grading criteria um a lot more explicit than we usually do, so as you can see. Um, you know the you know impact is kind of related to effort.

104
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:24,960
Frederique Laubepin: Since your bio statisticians. You know, Don't, this is just a you,

105
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:48,679
Frederique Laubepin: you know this is an actual, You know math representation of the relationship. But there is a correlation between effort and impact. Um, in this case, and it sort of looks like this. And, like I said, the goal is always in everything we do, including the syllabus to aim for increasing safety, increasing transparency,

106
00:24:48,690 --> 00:25:17,499
Frederique Laubepin: figuring out if there are ways to, uh, you know, build in more collaboration and mutuality. Um empowering students um, and paying attention to cultural uh historical and gender issues. So it could be as simple as uh, you know, being mindful of the examples that you use to illustrate um a concept, making sure that um. These examples come from uh, you know different places and represent different

107
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:42,139
Frederique Laubepin: um experiences. Um! Ah! Letting the students bring in ah resources. Um is also a good way to not only, you know, give empower them, but also in in this way, you know, help to to bring, maybe different cultural historical gender um

108
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:58,270
Frederique Laubepin: issues to to the table. So um, you know, in everything we we do, we should, We should think about this, and think of ways where we can. We can bring in some of the principles.

109
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:10,420
Frederique Laubepin: Um. Before I move on to assignments. Do you have any questions about the framework, or about the syllabus or anything. I was just explaining.

110
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:29,579
Frederique Laubepin: All right. Feel free to throw things in the chat, too, if you'd like so a huge piece of

111
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:41,640
Frederique Laubepin: of a huge area where we can make a a big impact, we can have a big impact and make a big difference for the the students is when it comes to assignments,

112
00:26:41,650 --> 00:27:11,199
Frederique Laubepin: and this is a place where you can have a big role to play, especially because, as I was mentioning uh faculty. Don't always remember what it's like to be a novice, so they don't they're not always in the best position to identify um gaps in assignment instructions, for example, or um, You know they they can. They can read between the lines and figure out. You know they know what they want. Um. But if students may not Ah be able to do that.

113
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:22,179
Frederique Laubepin: So in your particular position you have an important role to play here as somebody who can give them feedback and say, Hey, you know

114
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:35,520
Frederique Laubepin: I don't think the instructions are very clear, can we, you know. Can we work on this a little bit, or can we make it clear how we are assessing the the students?

115
00:27:35,530 --> 00:28:00,289
Frederique Laubepin: Um! And this is something that Ah comes up a lot. Um, these are all student quotes from Ah, course evaluations, and you can see here that Ah, you know the the lack of clarity in and ah, you know expectations and assignments. Um is a big big pain point for students, as I'm sure you've probably experienced um yourself.

116
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,789
Frederique Laubepin: Um As a as a student

117
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:31,720
Frederique Laubepin: it's uh it means that people are wasting time uh figuring things out. It means that Um, we're creating a lot of anxiety that doesn't need to be there. Uh, you know, when you know they're starting to understand what uh they need to be uh what they need to be doing. Um, you know. And then we're definitely not helping them to be successful. If, uh, you know, people cannot understand uh what is expected of them in these assignments.

118
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:42,260
Frederique Laubepin: Right? So whether it's vague instructions, big wording. You know, unclear rubrics,

119
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,229
Frederique Laubepin: it's just not a good uh a good situation.

120
00:28:47,700 --> 00:29:17,229
Frederique Laubepin: So one thing that we can do to help with this is to use a transparent assignment design framework. And this is really not rocket science. It's just a systematic way to be very transparent, very explicit about when the purpose of the assignment is what the task is, and what if the criteria for the assignments are so? The purpose is often confused with the task.

121
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:27,360
Frederique Laubepin: They're not the same thing. So the task might be for those students. I'm gonna take a by a statistics example, since you you all are

122
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:39,800
Frederique Laubepin: that field. But the the task might be for them to, you know. Take a data set, and I don't know,

123
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:58,840
Frederique Laubepin: create some descriptive statistics, and then run a regression, analysis, and interpret the results right? So this would be the task, you know. Step one,

124
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:28,649
Frederique Laubepin: run the you know, create something district to statistics. Ah, run a regression analysis. Ah! Would be stuck to and interpret, the results would be step three. That's the task. What is the purpose of the assignment? Why would we want students to run a regression analysis. How is this connected with um? You know what they're doing in the rest of the class? What they're doing in,

125
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,939
Frederique Laubepin: you know, in the program. And how is that even connected to

126
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:49,409
Frederique Laubepin: what they would be doing in the you know, in the professional world? So the purpose and the task are two different things to think about. The purpose is a bit like

127
00:30:49,420 --> 00:31:19,090
Frederique Laubepin: Ah, you know, thinking about the the, the why as it was. Ah, ah! To the what of the assignment, and often we, you know we do a pretty good job about finding the task. Um! The purpose is never explained, so the students are never given sort of the the larger picture of how this assignment fits in what they're learning, and why they're they're learning it so outlining the purpose might be. Ah, you know

128
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:30,330
Frederique Laubepin: explaining how doing this will help them, you know. Consolidate some skills they will need in order to do. You know something else.

129
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:39,459
Frederique Laubepin: But you know we should. We should try as much as we can to elucidate the purpose for the for those genes.

130
00:31:39,470 --> 00:32:09,340
Frederique Laubepin: Um! When you think of the task. You can also think about whether the task is clear, although that's the part of the assignments that people usually. Ah, you know, do okay? Um, the piece that's always almost ah missing is the criteria. So how would a student know that they're doing a good job with the assignment as they are completing it if we don't give them. Ah! You know some grading criteria, as you can see in some of these quotes

131
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:26,600
Frederique Laubepin: right? So the lack of rubric was really frustrating and frustrating clearly as instructors. We have ideas about what we're looking for. But when this is not made explicit to the students, how would they know

132
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,909
Frederique Laubepin: that, you know we are looking for certain things

133
00:32:31,420 --> 00:33:00,300
Frederique Laubepin: so as much as possible. Um outlining criteria for assignments. Um, sometimes. What works really well, too, is to give people examples of Ah, you know. Ah! Completed assignments and discussing them with them. So what made this a good assignment? What made this a good lab, um, you know. Write up or homework as opposed to somebody who maybe didn't do as good of a job.

134
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:25,000
Frederique Laubepin: Um, but you know sort of, you know, unearthing sort of like. Ah, what we often leave ah implicit in the in the teaching um will really help the students, and i'm not going to get into sort of the whole literature on transparent assignment design. But there's quite a bit of evidence in the literature that this is

135
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:54,490
Frederique Laubepin: a very effective framework for students that it's um. It levels the the playing field. So for those students who come in um and some of you are international students, and i'm guessing, you know. I was also an international student. Um, when I came to this country. Um, I didn't necessarily know how to read um an assignment. Um. You know things i'm from France, and if things are done differently over there, so I you know

136
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:12,020
Frederique Laubepin: you're not necessarily in the best position to sort of like read between the lines, and, you know, try to figure out what the instructor is is getting at, or if you come from a you know

137
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:39,370
Frederique Laubepin: sort of underprivileged ah background for one reason or another, where you don't have that training of reading between the lines, applying a transparent assignment design framework levels, the playing field. It puts everybody on, you know, on the same, on the same level, with the same ability to complete the assignment successfully, and the evidence shows that this is a very

138
00:34:39,400 --> 00:35:09,390
Frederique Laubepin: an impactful framework, and it's even more impactful for the people. We need it the most. Um. So anytime you can work forward um, making the purpose of the test the criteria of the assignments. Um explicit. Um, You're going to be helping people to be successful, and you can do this, you know, for big assignments for small assignments, right? So it can be just a weekly homework um, or it could be uh, you know something That's more.

139
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:19,349
Frederique Laubepin: Don't know term project, for example, and anytime you can push the instructor. You're working with

140
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:47,670
Frederique Laubepin: forward implementing transparent assignment design. You're going to be helping your your students out. So if you find that the purpose is missing in the assignments that have been designed for this course, then maybe you can have a conversation with the instructor and say, can we? What is the purpose of this assignment? Can we make that more explicit to the students? If you think, if you put yourself in the student shoes or the tasks

141
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,080
Frederique Laubepin: um clearly outlined, is there? Um,

142
00:35:51,120 --> 00:36:06,580
Frederique Laubepin: you know Um! Is there something that's missing? Um, for example? Um! And can we, uh let the students know how they will be assessed? How would they know as they're completing the assignment that they're doing a good job that they're going to be successful.

143
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:14,080
So anytime you can work toward this. You're going to make a big you're going to have a big impact on the students experience.

144
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:40,619
Frederique Laubepin: Um. Another place where you can implement some of the principles that we were discussing earlier is in the canvas site and in biostatistics. You guys might actually be able to help your instructors. Ah! Create better canvas sites. I will not lie to you. The by, the statistics, canvas sites are some of the worst at the at the school.

145
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:50,249
Frederique Laubepin: So this is a place where you might actually be able to really make a difference, especially in your department.

146
00:36:50,480 --> 00:37:18,850
Frederique Laubepin: So we know from you know, from the the literature that what works for people is when sites are organized, clear, easy to navigate and consistent. And this isn't, just for you know, learning management systems, of course. Size um any site you look at You're going to have yourself a better experience navigating it if it's organized if it's clear if it's consistent

147
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:30,270
Frederique Laubepin: when it comes to course sites. What this conveys to students is that the instructor cares about the student experience that's what comes out in in surveys. For example.

148
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:59,340
Frederique Laubepin: On the other hand, when canvas sites are, you know, confusing, inconsistent and disorganized. Not only is that ineffective and inefficient, but we know from the you know, we we conduct surveys of students every year. We know that this is a source of anxiety for students, and you know it gives the impression which may be completely false. But it gives the impression that the instructor doesn't care,

149
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:08,880
Frederique Laubepin: or that they are really struggling to use canvas. So this is a place where we can, you know, fairly easily make a difference,

150
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:20,560
Frederique Laubepin: and and you could have a big role to play here, either in giving, you know, instructors feedback on the quality of their canvas sites, or on helping them

151
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:34,580
Frederique Laubepin: create better candle sites, and there will be a session later on to talk a little bit about how you work in canvas, and this isn't that. But this is just to give you some principles.

152
00:38:34,590 --> 00:39:00,010
Frederique Laubepin: Um. The first principle is to make the landing landing page a good um home page. So the you know the the first um place where you can make a difference is to create a home page. Um! That has everything the students will need, and it's available right that you know right there. So what came out in

153
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,519
Frederique Laubepin: a lot of our surveys is that it's very anxiety provoking when you have to

154
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:34,070
Frederique Laubepin: keep clicking around to try and find ah information in the course. Um. So that means that everything um as much as possible. If ah! When everything we need is available front of the homepage, it's just one click away. Um, then we're already providing a a better experience for the for those units. So that means pairing down the the navigation um, and if you find yourself.

155
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:49,410
Frederique Laubepin: It's so gassing for a course where the the navigation is, you know, full of things that are not used in the course, and maybe have a conversation with the instructor about pairing that down to just the features that are used in the course.

156
00:39:49,810 --> 00:40:09,589
Frederique Laubepin: Um, it means, uh, you know, uh giving easy access to the the for syllabus. Um, but by providing both the text of the syllabus um, you know, right on the on the course side, as well as uh links uh to the syllabus if you want to download a print

157
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:29,589
Frederique Laubepin: um, and we can even help you. Ah, ah! Add some tabs to a canvas page to make it easier to find the information on the page. Um! That's not something that's necessarily a ah a skill that everybody has. But we can help you with that.

158
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:58,420
Frederique Laubepin: Um! And then uh a good uh way to provide information. Um, also is to have these weekly pages where everything the students need for that week is listed on the page, so that includes um, you know. Lecture slides um if they are used. Um any with our readings. Um Any links to assignments also all within um the weekly page

159
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:11,100
Frederique Laubepin: in terms of assignments, you know. Take also what I was just telling you about the transparency, I'm. In design, and

160
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:39,769
Frederique Laubepin: Ah transfer it here as well. So, too often we see assignments in canvas that have just a you know, a link to a file, for example, or the most Bare-bone. Um instructions um as much as you can, if you can flush out the assignment so that the students know what is expected of them. What they need to do. Um! Why and how they will be.

161
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,280
Frederique Laubepin: That is a a good thing.

162
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:49,490
Frederique Laubepin: So the the take away from this is that

163
00:41:49,500 --> 00:42:19,000
Frederique Laubepin: to be effective at four site needs to be organized. It needs to be clear, and it needs to be consistent. So at the end of the day, whether you follow a a weekly page model or a module uh model for building the the canvas site. Um, it doesn't matter as long as things are organized to me. Label um, and consistently utilize um, and we are definitely a resource when it comes to canvas. So um, if you have,

164
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:25,629
Frederique Laubepin: you see that the the course you're gassing for the in the site, could you some?

165
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:44,259
Frederique Laubepin: I could do some more work, some help um, and maybe the instructor is either not willing or not able to do this work themselves, feel free to come to us, and we'll be happy to work with you, to work with them to help improve the the canvas sites.

166
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,160
Frederique Laubepin: It's.

167
00:42:46,170 --> 00:43:16,000
Frederique Laubepin: I am just at time. So um! There's many other ways uh that you can infuse. Uh, you know the principles of trauma informed uh pedagogy into what you do. I could only touch on uh sort of. You know, the some of the most important ones as you go through the the sections. Um the rest of the day when it when it comes to the tools, for example. Um, you know, if you attend the tools for engagement, for example.

168
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:30,840
Frederique Laubepin: So think about how these principles mesh with, or how you can leverage the tools in order to enhance the application of these principles in your in your teaching.

169
00:43:30,850 --> 00:44:00,840
Frederique Laubepin: Um. So as I was mentioning earlier um, the goal here is to make things as to focused as we can um as opposed to what I mean by student focus is, you know, in contrast to content focused. Um. So sort of like paying attention to the student experience, so that we can ensure that they're successful. We can help um keep them uh motivated um, which we know is something that's uh a challenge

170
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:12,679
Frederique Laubepin: um if we can help them navigate through stressors as well as you know, in um in our own teaching, helping them to build community and pr networks.

171
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:30,010
Frederique Laubepin: So i'm gonna stop here. Um, I know that, you know we have more sessions coming right up. I just wanted to make sure that there's maybe a a minute for you to ask any questions you may have,

172
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:36,609
Frederique Laubepin: and or maybe take a bio break, because i'm sure we're all

173
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,619
Frederique Laubepin: drinking our teas and copies, and you know we need to

174
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,350
Frederique Laubepin: a little bit of a bathroom. Break it,

175
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,640
Frederique Laubepin: will, you know again. This will be mentioned

176
00:44:54,110 --> 00:45:17,059
Frederique Laubepin: over and over. Ah, today. But this is the email address where you can reach us. This puts a ticket in our system. It really reaches all of us, and we're here to support when it comes to technology, or you know whether it comes to whether it's about pedagogy. So never hesitate to reach out to us

177
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,510
Frederique Laubepin: for anything.
