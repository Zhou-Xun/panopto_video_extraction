1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,920
So today we are going to a pug group.

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,770
And how about module F? This is module in regression testing.

3
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:28,530
So this is a deeper look at using our past to test hypotheses in module e.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,120
Towards the end of tomorrow we actually looked at the context,

5
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:43,470
but there was sort of introduce the concept and also we learned briefly what happened, what an impasse was and how we carry it out.

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:52,980
And and also that he has. But here we're going to take a much deeper look at the app test for monitoring this module.

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,210
That module and this module is have in particular because of the algebra you're going to see.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:14,760
You know, we tried to, you know, show a rigorous approach for a rigorous approach like why the app task work, what our task is and why it works.

9
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:26,640
Of course, in order to be rigorous, we didn't really do matrix notation to show you guys that, but that's the argument behind why our tests work.

10
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,090
So this this module is just a little bit heavy in terms of algebra matrix out here.

11
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,710
So we're going to hopefully be able to cover all the all the necessary details.

12
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,370
And also,

13
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:52,590
I'm going to try to slow down a little bit if you have questions or feel free to raise your hand so that we can we don't need to rush towards the end.

14
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,800
Okay. So we're going to talk about in more detail detailed look at some of square hours in our testing this module.

15
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,880
So here is a sort of a cover reason.

16
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,070
I mean, these are the the facts listed on this slide.

17
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:24,730
We're using them as results. We do not need to worry too much about why these results are true, although, you know, this can all be proved.

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:34,740
So using a disputed theory and using matrix algebra, but we are not going to do much about why these results hold.

19
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,010
We are just using these as facts. So let's take a look at what they are.

20
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:51,990
Now, suppose a. So A is an inbox and matrix of concerns.

21
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,430
So in other words, the matrix say all the elements.

22
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,700
They are numbers. They are. They are. They are number. There are no number.

23
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,140
There are fixed numbers and so is a constant matrix.

24
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,240
And Y is in my one body better than normal rather than natural.

25
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,919
You can still think of this y as our response, y as our life.

26
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,360
So it's not. And by one, a vector column Bactrim is is a drug that involves.

27
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,270
Well, it has mean while we do not by move and a various covariance matrix.

28
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,510
Let's see, we are past the energy matrix.

29
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,450
So in other words,

30
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:45,360
the real variable y follows normal distribution with the mean moon and we are as cold as matrix C mind a single square side in the matrix.

31
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:57,080
So here about again. So why is another matter in a is just a constant matrix and then we call this guy of already for

32
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:05,729
we have we have seen this let me give an example in volume D I think of course this is a scalar.

33
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:16,469
If you look at this, this is a scalar because here we have y transpose, you know, y transpose on y y is in by y right?

34
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:25,110
So y transpose y transform this is one by n with a this is an by n matrix and one is is an by one.

35
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,720
And so in the end you will get a one by one matrix within the same.

36
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,650
Is cooperative law. Because. Because we have. Y to allow y for the right.

37
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,830
So if you look at a final expression, it will depend on each component of why as a contracting function.

38
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:53,770
And that's why it is called any form of power if a matrix is symmetric.

39
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:02,530
And I thought it was an absolute means that a transposes equal to a visiting Los Angeles

40
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:11,290
and item hotel that means on a square is equal to an opponent with asymmetric opponent.

41
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:19,430
And if the rank of A is P. Then if you look at this column writing for.

42
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,910
Learn for content form and normalized by see my square record.

43
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:35,560
I see my square is the there is a white if the background is the bear as we are assuming why it has a there is just too much where times are.

44
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:45,000
And of course then we are assuming each of the components why they are independent and a reference is given by similar square.

45
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,500
So if we normalize this quadratic form by Sigma Square,

46
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:55,460
then it turns out that this normalized the standardized form follows a Chi Square distribution.

47
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:02,339
But this is not Central Chi Square distribution. So we talk about several kinds of what we talk about.

48
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,020
Catchword, is we are usually well, we mean use a Central Coast word extrusion,

49
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:17,600
but it turns out well there but the cusp maybe easier if we just should have a Google.

50
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,070
Wrong. We have no central chi square distribution scene, depending on the degree of freedom.

51
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,950
This is what it looks like. Yeah.

52
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:50,220
This is what the density look like. Here is the central parameter in case that you're afraid of.

53
00:06:50,250 --> 00:07:00,420
So depending on the degree of freedom and the mode centrality parameter, we have different shapes of Chi Square distribution.

54
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,860
So this is my central chi square intrusion. You can.

55
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:15,450
Consular distribution. And these are the central.

56
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:22,130
Well, when we say customer, does you really mean not U.S. Central Chi Square decision?

57
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,980
No, no, no. I try to counter is equal to zero. Can see that they have similar shapes.

58
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,750
So depending on what you are afraid of, they have similar shapes on.

59
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:44,239
But part of my point is that while no Central Chi Square distribution is actually generated by the recall

60
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,080
that the Central Chi Square decision is generated by taking the sum of standard normal running variables,

61
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,300
right? So anyone understand among the narratives?

62
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,209
Then if you take the assignment, you have Chi Square distribution, but no Central Chi Square distribution.

63
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,840
That's where you take one type of some of the normal running intervals.

64
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,620
This no run variables do not have a mean zero.

65
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:19,720
They have little. If the MEU, if each MEU is equal to zero, then in the end, central of this prompted them to have a central customer distribution.

66
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,790
But if that's really horrible, as high as I mean miserably new.

67
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,980
And again, if you take inside squares, then, you know, central chi square.

68
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,870
So that's what no central square distribution is.

69
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:46,430
It turns out that this community forum, the Centralized Banana Forum, has a non central chi square discussion with a non central center.

70
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:54,739
You go through this, this is what we do, not how to improve the process rigorously.

71
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:02,630
I mean, we are just going to use this as a result. But this is not hard to to to follow to understand the reason is that.

72
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Because why follow normal? Well, I thought it was normal.

73
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,590
So, I mean, is it a component of why I follow normal as usual and each component of why for a normal the future?

74
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,160
And then here this is a radical form of why.

75
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:25,659
So it's sort of a function of different components of why I'm taking my son, waited in, waiting to some of the squares on each component.

76
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:32,170
What this generalized plan while this this van will likely follow Chi Square as usual.

77
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:41,380
So this is how Chi Square distribution is defined. But it's just that now the components are why they have non-zero or meet with the parameter.

78
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:48,790
So that's why we have none. Central Chi Square distribution with that no central parameter lambda equal drawn by the same quantity of form.

79
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,000
By here we have mute and divided by C muscular. Okay, so this is one result.

80
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,720
Again, we are. Let's not worry too much about where this come from, but let's just take this as a fact.

81
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,130
Later, I'm going to use this.

82
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:13,120
And then if B is a, p by p, p by and matrix, then this karate for this karate form, of course, is to run a variable because it depends on y.

83
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,930
So it's run up and this becomes times. Why this is also random.

84
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,510
And this and this. Well, this is. Well, this is a scale.

85
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,899
This is one by one scale. But this one. This is why.

86
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,380
This is a p by end times and by one. So it's a.

87
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,910
So it's a it's a pity. I was in Sarajevo.

88
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm back. And this is my wife and this brother Mirabal and this venture, they are independent.

89
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,760
If the times a this to matrix, the part of history matrix is zero zero matrix.

90
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:05,750
And if B is an NBA and matrix, then if we look at this tool Conradie of works platforms based on a and controlled form based on speed.

91
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,700
This tool informs what both our scale and both our run variables.

92
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,200
One measure whether these two are other variables, they are independent.

93
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,410
If the product of this two matrices, A and B, this is equal to zero.

94
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,009
So these three results, again,

95
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:36,520
we are not this not to worry too much about where they come from and we're going to take these as facts and in applying these results.

96
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:50,270
We will apply those results to show that the total sum of square this is as as a total sum of squares divided by similar split.

97
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,610
This will follow a crossword as usual,

98
00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:06,670
when minus one we were afraid of every last drop of prime to remember y is equal to this and ss are righteous on the square demanded by Sigma Square.

99
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,570
That's all the square with P minus one. Your freedom and this same problem.

100
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:22,530
And as I see divided by similar square has a square with this bigger freedom and with this lesson try branch.

101
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:29,360
Okay. So it turns out that only three well, these three quantities, they follow the Chi Square distribution.

102
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,730
Be careful because of our description and with.

103
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,580
With sadness and troubled grandeur and with more freedoms.

104
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:48,930
And also we are going to show that SSR is independent of SLC and also B, the hat is independent of Sigma Half Square.

105
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,320
So in order to show all these results, we're going to take the following steps.

106
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:05,810
So we are going to write we are going to write the sum of squares in quadratic forms in a call writing for.

107
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,350
So each sample square can be written as a writing form.

108
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,719
And then, of course, for Colorado,

109
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,640
for their small for Colorado for there is a there is a matrix A in the middle there is a matrix eight in the middle.

110
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,690
So after road rage lost some square as a convenient form that we are going to show that in the

111
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:39,020
matrix eight in the middle this is symmetric and I encoded and then I'm going to define the red.

112
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:48,810
And after we find the Rangel aide he called out for about eight years ago, I will put him with a rap sheet.

113
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,419
Now, there's Conrado form from the Coast Guard, as usual,

114
00:13:51,420 --> 00:14:01,230
with this new more freedom with PS equal to the rally so that we are able to find not the least of these three.

115
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,960
Chi Square distribution. So this is the step that we are going to take.

116
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,090
Okay. So now let's let's focus on the first step here.

117
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,610
That is to write the sum of squares as quadratic forms.

118
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,020
So first let's focus on ss y the sum of squares, the total sum of squares.

119
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:37,889
So here, let's please, I'm going to slow down a little bit, but please try to try to follow me.

120
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:43,950
So because the algebra, if you skip west out, then it's hard to follow, you know, that a wrestler steps.

121
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,810
So I want to make sure that everybody follows all the steps here.

122
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:53,490
So that says why? By definition, this is definition.

123
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,520
This is how? As as like. What I mean is like Mark Fujiwara is a central average.

124
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:12,140
And then if we write this, if we just disagree to a square, what our line is to what are and how does low bar busboy bar square as.

125
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,060
If we separate the square, we have we have this.

126
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:30,920
And then we're willing to take the sum of each term so we have y squared minus.

127
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,620
The two times, son. What I.

128
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,950
What I learned than the first son. My father is with.

129
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,060
And this is just to take in the some of each term and then we'll just.

130
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:59,120
Well, the first term I will I'm going to keep it the sum of what I swear, the minus here.

131
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,970
The sack of the sum. Notice that this wine bar is a constant.

132
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,450
So the sub has no effect on this wine bar, is it?

133
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,490
Cause then I can pull it out of the sun. So the sun is only for one eye.

134
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:22,400
Osama what I we know that it's equal to end times liberal and so so that is two times in times like bar at times low bar.

135
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:34,460
And that's some of why I is just equal to that was my bar because my bar is the symbol average plus.

136
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:42,900
Look, this guy here, this is why bars are so constant.

137
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,950
You're assigning it like cops. So you have any white ones who are.

138
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:00,990
And then here this is equal to one or two times in of Bar Square.

139
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:15,660
And then here you have. You have minus two Times Square now, plus you have to leave our square.

140
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:26,520
So that cancels well, in times leave us or counts away as Laplace in terms of our switch this is.

141
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,439
Yes. Okay. So that is this guy.

142
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:45,209
And then the sum of what I square some or square if would write it in matrix notation.

143
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,780
That's why transpose tags y y is the column address.

144
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:57,180
So y transpose and rollback through backtrack times a column action that gives us some white square.

145
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:06,340
Okay. And so this is just the economics and then this and how to keep our square,

146
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:14,110
this white bar square where this white bar let's look at y y bar is the symbol average.

147
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,730
The symbol average. This is equal to the symbol average.

148
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:33,770
For this son of what can be written in matrix notation can be written as y principal's house

149
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:40,700
vector and as I wrote actor y transposed to become a real actor and one is called an actor.

150
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,570
So the character gives us the sum of.

151
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:51,010
By now we still have the one over in the front and then and then square.

152
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:05,170
Okay. So then. This one is why, first of all times why, of course,

153
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:14,889
we can put up an old matrix in the middle that has no effect because the other types and anything is still the same thing.

154
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,870
So we can put out early, we can have the matrix in the middle, it doesn't change the product.

155
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:29,860
And then here there's this one over in inside of the square, we can pull it out of the square.

156
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,690
It becomes one over again square. But one of our arms. Where is going to cancel with this?

157
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,020
Yeah, here. So then what is left is just this one over in the denominator.

158
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,090
You know, in the eyes of the princess, are we still seeing the same thing?

159
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,800
The same thing we must use inside of our inside a square?

160
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:04,080
Okay. And then if we move on, then this y well, here, I mean, if you want to, you can begin.

161
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:13,710
Well, you know, I think there's this n I don't know, measuring size is permitted, but here we still have this matrix in the middle, the minus.

162
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,380
Now, this is the square. This is the this is the square.

163
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,500
The square of this. This is my first post on this scale.

164
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,340
The square I was in can be written as the White House of all times.

165
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:39,219
One can times one transpose times y because each one is a scalar.

166
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,370
So y transpose time one this is going to y one transpose times slide this it's also script.

167
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:54,400
So this become well the same scale. So if you modify them together, get the square and then divided by this in.

168
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,940
Of. So.

169
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:14,240
Each one so. So, you know, so both are the same are on the same scale.

170
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,770
And then, of course, you multiply them together, you get to the square. Okay.

171
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,690
And what have we got here? Notice that the first topic here, this is white.

172
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,580
While we have a white box on the left and a Y on the right and here as well.

173
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,550
So we have a Y transpose on the left and a Y on the right.

174
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,130
So we can naturally call this y transpose in y.

175
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:49,640
So we have y transpose here and y here and in the middle we will have this identity matrix that come from this guy.

176
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,010
Minus this one, minus this.

177
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:07,710
RFE rl. Is that different? So this one.

178
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,480
In times. Well, in times one in transports.

179
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,080
This is one in this is my one manager.

180
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,790
This is my one major one my end factor.

181
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:30,250
In the end, we have a matrix that is a matrix that has all the elements are ones.

182
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:41,830
All elements. There are ones. So this is one of this one matrix meets in the end.

183
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:49,570
And we have this one matrix. So this becomes this.

184
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,690
Okay. So now here is clear. Now that we have written the sample square as a writing for.

185
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:17,720
Someone's got to go someplace where they've written it as the funniest transpose from some matrix and middle time slot from the movies in the middle.

186
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,890
That's usually I minus this one one matrix over it.

187
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:31,280
So this is how we write the total sum of squares as a quadratic for where a y is given by this.

188
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,970
Any questions? Are you okay with the algebra?

189
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,570
Okay. So that's a why. And how about as.

190
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,990
Now let's look at Azhar as it's are now. By definition, it's given by this.

191
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,170
This is just how Azhar is divided and a similar thing.

192
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:12,410
Let's separate the square. Number two, the square.

193
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:24,220
And then. She?

194
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:45,700
With his ensemble each turn. And then we're going to say that this is actually equal to I'm going to claim that this is equal to.

195
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:54,340
And how do I know? Well, the reason is that now this is why hat this is some of the y y hat.

196
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,030
For some y, I had to recall that it use a matrix notation.

197
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:08,110
It can be written as y times vector what I call my first y what is in my what my y principle is,

198
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:15,760
is, is quite funny because this is one times in this machine is an by one.

199
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:26,080
So again will have a skater so this inner part of this Y had transpose times one this is the

200
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:36,970
sort of y hat and then recall that y hat what is y had y had is you have matrix perhaps y.

201
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,790
And that that is that. That is what we have.

202
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,850
Yes. That's measuring how to better extend life and times this nature.

203
00:25:48,860 --> 00:26:01,190
What? And in that if we look at the principals that becomes y transpose times age transpose times what?

204
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,930
But in the matrix we know that exists in actually matrix.

205
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:28,370
So is Y first post times h times one. And if you recall one problem in the midterm exam, one view is problem two for the part of problem.

206
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:39,590
As you guys to prove or disprove this, prove that this is equal to what's right and so this is naturally equal to y transpose times one.

207
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:47,000
This is indeed equal to one so that the proof is actually quite a quite a, quite a quite quite easy.

208
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,280
So we can, we can, we can argue it very quickly here.

209
00:26:53,060 --> 00:27:01,010
So this this is what this is equal to one because.

210
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,600
Because each x is equal to x.

211
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:16,020
If you guys still remember this equality, this is you can look at this by symbol by simply by definition,

212
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:26,840
because h is equal to what ed x plus most people do x times as transpose x inverse of x transpose.

213
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,900
This is what age is, because this is how they had matrices to fight.

214
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:39,600
Of course, even multiplied by age x. If you multiply by x, then this guy will cancel with this inverse.

215
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:46,450
What is left is just one which just acts. So this is a very simple fact.

216
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:55,840
But this annex this is these are metrics has the first but the fourth first column is the factor one because well,

217
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:03,220
if you recall what it was asked, that metric since the very first column is the intercept is the one vector.

218
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,870
So if you just focus on the first column of this pattern, of this Yeah.

219
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:19,750
On this side of this equation or this identity, then that gives you h times one is equal to one.

220
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,950
That's just by looking at the first column of the X matrix.

221
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,660
Okay. Okay.

222
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:48,950
So now what we have shown is that this this song here, this, some of what I had, this is equal to one transpose times what y transpose times one.

223
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,900
This is one. This is equal to some of what I.

224
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,820
Some of what I, of course, is equal to in Toms River is.

225
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:27,850
So then if if here we have an homage to bar and again on here then we have the some of the why I had a square minus two times in one of our square.

226
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:35,290
That plus this is in Homs, 12 hour square. So in the end, we will have this sun minus.

227
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:55,700
105 our square. So the only I think the only tricky part in showing this is is by realizing that in the summer y hat this is equal to incomes over.

228
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:13,360
Any questions about this? Okay.

229
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:19,150
And then. Well, then the following algebra is almost exactly the same as the last slide.

230
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,070
So we are going to write the sum of y had a square equal to y.

231
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,550
I had transpose times like the minus.

232
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,490
Similarly, this y bar squared. We have done this on the last slide.

233
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,440
Right. It. That's why I don't want the end times.

234
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:45,670
What is transport times y divided by it. This is by following exactly the same algebra as on our last slide.

235
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,730
But now for y hat recall y had it. This is equal to h.

236
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,240
They had matrix times y writing this.

237
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,510
How numerous times what the transpose of the times this.

238
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,830
The same term here we just. We have not done accordingly. So we are keeping it.

239
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,020
And then this y transpose times.

240
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:13,870
So this h why fundable? This transforms such a transforms times h times like.

241
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,030
But we know that this is this h is item potent.

242
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,820
So a transpose times H is equal to h h.

243
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:39,590
Well, Peter's angry symmetric because every symmetric so in principle is equal to h that makes a transpose of age equal to a square.

244
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:43,460
But then because age resides important, so square is equal to age.

245
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:54,230
So what is left is just one age in the middle and there is one age in the middle, then minus.

246
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:59,480
Again, we just copy this thing down here, the same thing hitting it.

247
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,700
Okay, so what we got here, but no reason that we have y transpose here on the left,

248
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,709
in the Y for the right in y principles to the left and y to the right.

249
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,520
So we can again, we can pull this to my first question. Why you have y transposed to left y to the right.

250
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,570
In the middle we will have h minus this matrix.

251
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:34,550
Okay. And then, of course, this one in times one and transposed again.

252
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,200
We can write a as a matrix with all the elements information.

253
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,660
So yeah, in the end we have written this SSR Trojans as a canary.

254
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,350
For now, the a matrix in the middle.

255
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,040
That's a are a matrix in the middle that's given by.

256
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,180
So this is how we write and as us are logical.

257
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:24,240
Okay. Any questions in this? Okay.

258
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:30,440
And events as those are. And how about see? Now I see this is a slightly simpler.

259
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:44,620
So SNC by definition is skewed by the residual from types the region itself and of the residual recoil that residual is equal to one minus one part.

260
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:52,760
One is my hat and one hat is a ton of wire over the habitat, it sounds like.

261
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,810
And so is equal to, I don't know, the matrix minus h times y.

262
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,020
So that's why here we have absolutely had a sequel to The Matrix.

263
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:18,140
H and his wife. And when we take the principles, then it becomes more and transpose times.

264
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:24,770
I buy the stage principles and then times are minus h times life.

265
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:36,530
But we know that I minus eight. This is a symmetric matrix because I run the matrix, symmetric and edge matrix kind of matrix, this and that.

266
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:42,590
So the difference is symmetric. So that means this transpose is just equal to itself.

267
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,609
So that's why we got a square. We got this square.

268
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:52,040
So this transpose times, this h times to the south, this becomes the square.

269
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,930
And I want to say, age is an important. We have shown this, I think.

270
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:07,630
You guys have shoulders your homework world having of thought that a square is just equal to this matrix itself.

271
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:21,910
So in the end we have written this as I see as a corollary for The Matrix saying in the middle, that's guidelines change.

272
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:40,780
Okay. So if you look at what we have done so far, we have just written the three sample squares as as wise as our SSD radio work.

273
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:50,710
We have found we have found one of the eight metrics are in the middle of the formatted ones and in the next.

274
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,480
We are going to need in order to apply these results from here.

275
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:07,200
Like the three of us, after we got to this planet forms, we need to show that this pain matrix in the middle of 94,

276
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:13,480
we need to show that there are symmetric and they are quite important in order to apply this result.

277
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,630
So that's what we are going to do next. So for those three matrix, we just we just found,

278
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:28,590
we are going to show that they are symmetric and an important and a symmetric of this matrix is very easy to see.

279
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,440
Let's look at them one by one. So the way of why we have already found a wire is equal to.

280
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,950
Yes. And it's very easy to see this as magic.

281
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,729
So because I add to this matrix, they're both symmetric.

282
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:52,190
Of course, difference is symmetric. So then we're going to show that this is an opponent so that a Y squared is equal to.

283
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:08,030
I am as. Mardi Gras by itself.

284
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:17,270
This is what a square is. And then we're going to separate this guy from this guy.

285
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:30,430
So we're going to ride it as. The first term comes around in the matrix, the minus the first term times.

286
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:39,130
The second the Saturday night. So the other world will be separate to separate this guy from.

287
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:09,110
Okay. And then what we're going to do is okay noticing that, of course, this is a matrix.

288
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,340
So so this has no effect, right? Multiplied by this ideal matrix has no effect.

289
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:23,600
So this becomes in line us you to buy in the same thing then minus.

290
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:30,679
Okay. So the this whole thing here. Now first we have our role matrix modified by this.

291
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,470
We have we have this the minus.

292
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:46,820
Vamanos. Here we have one in bye in time.

293
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:55,760
One in by in divided by square golf club.

294
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,510
And this. That's right.

295
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:07,500
You hear this one in Bosnia. This is a matrix that has all the elements equal to one.

296
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,550
And this can be written as one factor one.

297
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:20,010
True. And what better times one night in Virginia.

298
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:33,530
Okay. So this is a callback and this is rule that if you multiply this tool, you'll get a matrix that has all the elements equal to one.

299
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:41,300
So the other words, this thing here, it can be written as one.

300
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:51,750
We can be reasoned as one in by one actor comes one by one might imagine.

301
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,470
And similarly, the second matrix can also be written as in by one measure times one by ten.

302
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:25,530
So in other words, we are going to write of this whole thing here. Are you guys following me here?

303
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,200
This? That. Okay. And then we're going to keep.

304
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,240
We're just in the first term and then minus all this.

305
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,120
We're going to keep it. Then minus.

306
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:57,620
Okay. So for this product, we are going to focus on, let's first focus on the the two things in the middle for two things in the middle.

307
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,870
This is a one by impact and by one macro.

308
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:06,920
So in the end, it will get a one by one matrix, which is a screen and the scanner is just equal to N.

309
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:15,570
And if you have a row vector like a row of once multiplied by a column once so that you have a sum of once, now you have it.

310
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,790
So this is equal to.

311
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:35,590
Realizing that we have what is allowed is and my one times one man in divided by us the multiply by in so multiply about in and divided by and square.

312
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:44,830
I. And then this in will council just one in here.

313
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:03,200
Okay. Yeah. Then this matrix here.

314
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,810
This is my one time slot, Mark. And this is. This will give us an end matrix that has all elements we want.

315
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:17,330
That's precisely this matrix here. And our matrix with all animals equal to one.

316
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,330
So in other words, this whole thing here, the difference becomes zero.

317
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,910
So then what is left is all right in minus one in the end of the line.

318
00:42:51,280 --> 00:43:03,840
And that's equal to a flight. And so this just shows that a white square is equal to a white oh, what a white matrix.

319
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,620
So of course, this means that a lot of the matrix is either loaded.

320
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:17,510
So this is for and why for, by the way.

321
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,530
So the detailed calculation is on the next next slide.

322
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:24,870
So you can if you get a chance to write everything down here.

323
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:37,680
We can either I mean, watch for the recording again or to follow us on this email calculation, even on the next slide.

324
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:46,830
So this this is. Well, this shows that a y this is how it unfolded, symmetric and important.

325
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:56,250
And then we're going to do the same thing for R for air and a for a, you know, for air.

326
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,050
But yeah, there's a symmetry of a air asymmetry.

327
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:11,580
This is very easy to see because first of all, H is measuring matrix had a matrix is symmetric.

328
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,139
And another thing was this. This one. What matrix?

329
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,790
This is symmetric. So the difference, of course, is symmetric. Now, we just need to show that this is either potential R squared.

330
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:50,940
Let's calculate R squared on that. And to cover this again, we're going to separate this guy from this guy.

331
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:57,200
So we have. Onstage.

332
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:07,230
The miners. Was.

333
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:25,810
This. Okay.

334
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,510
And then here we're going to move this aid inside.

335
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,880
So we have eight square miles. Well, here we have one.

336
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,810
Yeah. Yeah, well, it's in this in showing that this is all these mistresses.

337
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:53,740
They are they are they are the impotent we are because of the use of this fact.

338
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:04,850
We're constantly using this fact. So maybe it's better to keep this in mind because of the use of this.

339
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:16,669
So now we're writing this one, this in a matrix of one, one matrix as a vector,

340
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:26,030
one times a column or one times a rule vector of one, but times h divided by.

341
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,190
And then the second guy is the same thing.

342
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:52,380
We're going to ride both this one matrix and this one matrix as this column of what is called a one time a of one.

343
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:56,080
So we have h times this.

344
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,870
What about in minus? His name.

345
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:18,310
Followed by and square. And now we have to answer we have in square.

346
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,240
Our guys follow me here.

347
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:43,430
So far and so far, we just we're just applying, you know, we're just applying this replacing the matrix of ones by the product.

348
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,270
And it's truly matter of once, okay.

349
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,439
And then we are going to use this match.

350
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,780
So again here, this is another factor where we use old age.

351
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:08,750
We call that age is again our matrix. And the one is by one battery and by one measure by age times, one is equal to one going to have this result.

352
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:18,649
So first, not even know what age is either important.

353
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:22,430
We know that age is an important. So a square is just equal to age.

354
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,850
So eight square is just equal to. The miners.

355
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:34,830
There was a look at this. This guy, this one house H.

356
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:45,260
This one Time's age is actually exactly eight times one by one.

357
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:53,810
The principles are because H transforms AC, H, h is symmetric.

358
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,000
So this guy is actually equal to this principles.

359
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:06,690
This is principles. But we know that eight times one is equal to one.

360
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:19,080
So that what we have is, you know, one by one times and two times one, that's one, you know, one transport that becomes one in.

361
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:43,570
Okay. And then divided by. Okay.

362
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,880
And then here are similar to this age times this one.

363
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,759
BAMFORD This is just one one. This is in my one bag times.

364
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:08,150
This one one divided by. In a minus.

365
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:16,040
Here we have again, if we look at it, the two stage, two of the two actors in the middle.

366
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,860
So we have a rollback for a column actor.

367
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:25,880
We have a screen, an investigatory sequence again, because it's rule of times, time, so called words.

368
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:32,690
So this is this is equal to again. And this in we'll cancel the list.

369
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:41,430
Q On the denominator. So what we have is one in by 1.11 divided by.

370
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:06,270
So if you look at this sitting here, this is equal to zero. This whole thing is equal to zero because we have the right to reverse the same thing.

371
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:10,260
So this is equal to zero. And then what we have is h minus.

372
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,040
Now, this, this got this one.

373
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:19,200
This is a column of once multiplied by a rule of law.

374
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:25,600
We have. The Matrix was divided by two.

375
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:49,750
And this is a just aren't matrix. Again, what we have shown is that r squared is equal to air.

376
00:51:50,290 --> 00:52:04,560
National air is identical to. And if you look out of the algebra in the middle as well, we, we, we kept using, you know,

377
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:20,600
the counter using this fact kind of writing this matrix was as the product of this took up to two matters of ones and also we

378
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:30,490
have a using that h times one measures equals yes if can be using the series out in the end we're able to show that this works.

379
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:43,950
Any questions so far? Okay.

380
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:54,060
So now let's take a seven minute break and we will we will resume at 905.

381
00:53:13,243 --> 00:53:18,903
So all of that slightly more detailed you in coming out of the calculations.

382
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:29,203
So for instance well so if you're, you know how to point out this fact we have the we use this for this fact right over eight times.

383
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:33,402
This one back is equal to the one that general speaking.

384
00:53:33,403 --> 00:53:37,063
But it's actually a special case, though, of this result.

385
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:41,143
This H times X is equal to what is equal to X.

386
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:51,163
So if you just take the first of all, x is that is our matrix, right?

387
00:53:51,163 --> 00:53:58,963
So it's it has the first column equal to one. First, if your model equals intercept, then the first column is equal to one.

388
00:53:59,263 --> 00:54:08,713
If you just take a look at the first column, focus on the first column of X, and then what the result of you have these H times what is equal to you?

389
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:21,493
See what? So where one is done is the first column of okay, so that is well, air square is equal to air.

390
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:30,613
So air now is important and then we'll show that.

391
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,253
Well, I think he is either important while you are here.

392
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:39,333
I mean, there is no legitimate a,

393
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:49,783
he is equal to or minus H I think you guys have shown that wholeheartedly that I might as h this is what is symmetric,

394
00:54:49,783 --> 00:54:54,162
first of all is actually this is very easy to see because isometric acer's symmetric.

395
00:54:54,163 --> 00:55:03,373
So the difference is symmetric. And then also it's very easy to show that almost age is an opponent.

396
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:08,323
So in other words, he is equal to a square.

397
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:18,273
It's very easy to show that. Easy these. So then what we have got so far is that we have shown.

398
00:55:20,703 --> 00:55:24,333
Yeah. In summary, you take a look at what we have done so far.

399
00:55:25,203 --> 00:55:35,513
We have. Now our final goal is actually show these results to show all these results.

400
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:43,553
But so far what we have done is that we have first we have written this three sample squares as called radical forms,

401
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:54,743
and we have found what is a matrix in the middle is for four as as wife our SSR and for as I found those matrix matrix and assignable,

402
00:55:54,743 --> 00:56:05,993
we have shown that the measure is in the middle of a why are all three are symmetric and quite important and that's what we have done so far.

403
00:56:11,793 --> 00:56:15,193
Oh, it's the same slide. So and then.

404
00:56:15,883 --> 00:56:23,833
Okay, so we have well, we have now this already, for example, squares we have found in the matrix a in the middle.

405
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:36,523
And we have shown that the asymmetric and either important for those three ranges and in the next we will need to find the rec of this path.

406
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:43,393
And this uses in our tool in order to find the square distribution of the controlling for.

407
00:56:48,243 --> 00:56:54,423
It's the slides in the same slides. I mean, we just to copy the first lines from the very beginning.

408
00:56:54,723 --> 00:56:59,703
So these are the three results. We really like work. These are the results we like to show.

409
00:57:00,423 --> 00:57:05,863
And we have probably three, three things that are in forms.

410
00:57:07,503 --> 00:57:11,533
And then we need to find the rec of these three images.

411
00:57:11,883 --> 00:57:22,143
A. And in order to find the rent, we need some more facts from matrix algebra.

412
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:31,883
So again, these facts here, we're not going to prove these facts because this these facts are trying to take it from idiotic or matrix algebra.

413
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:37,793
So they are not and they do not involve any statistical thinking.

414
00:57:38,183 --> 00:57:43,433
So we are not going to show these results. We're just going to use the results on the count.

415
00:57:45,143 --> 00:57:52,433
So first, if a is a computer matrix, then the rank of A is simply its trace.

416
00:57:54,443 --> 00:57:59,363
So in order to find in order to find the root of a for the other three matrices,

417
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:06,863
we are going to calculate the trace of those three individuals and the trees of matrix.

418
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:12,023
Well, the trees matrix is different, but this is how it's defined.

419
00:58:13,193 --> 00:58:24,963
It's the sum of elements along the main die. So if you have a m by M, matrix, M and Matrix and all of that,

420
00:58:25,173 --> 00:58:48,413
you have a11a12822a3328 and then you have a12, a one, three and a so for a one in is a21 to 31a and a one.

421
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:53,183
So this right. So this is the end by end matrix.

422
00:58:55,553 --> 00:59:00,803
And a trace is defined as the sun of a diagonal elements.

423
00:59:03,823 --> 00:59:07,563
This is the diagonal of this of this matrix.

424
00:59:07,573 --> 00:59:12,133
If you take the some of this elements, that that's how the twist of the matrix is defined.

425
00:59:12,433 --> 00:59:20,683
Now, of course, trees can only be defined for a square matrix, so they draw dimensions equal to the concentration.

426
00:59:23,233 --> 00:59:31,813
So this is how the trees is defined. And for twins, you know, there are certain facts about the tweets.

427
00:59:32,563 --> 00:59:34,243
Well, certain rules about race.

428
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:45,283
So the tweets of any scalar multiplied by this matrix or matrix multiplied by a scalar is the same as the scalar modified by the trace.

429
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:54,763
This is very easy to see, right? Because C times, a C times like a matrix, like known by a constant scalar.

430
00:59:55,033 --> 00:59:58,153
That's as each element multiplied by a skater.

431
00:59:58,813 --> 01:00:03,103
Then each element is multiplied by school. Now, of course, the sum of the elements.

432
01:00:03,463 --> 01:00:10,843
The sun is modified by this same scalar and so not like traced c times a's equal to see times tracing.

433
01:00:11,503 --> 01:00:20,083
And it also trace of the sum of two matrices is equal to the sum of the trace of both elements.

434
01:00:20,413 --> 01:00:23,623
This is also very easy to see, right? Because that's the matrix.

435
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:32,983
The sun is out of the way, sun. So of course, the valuable elements of the sun is equal to the sum of the 2000 elements.

436
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:40,163
End of the matrix while the trees of product.

437
01:00:41,543 --> 01:00:47,932
It turns out that if you can switch the order so the trees of eight times B is equal

438
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:56,053
to the trees of becomes a matrix as long as both eight times B and becomes A,

439
01:00:56,093 --> 01:01:06,893
as long as both are square matrices, then you can switch the order of the product and y you have multiple matrix modified together,

440
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:12,913
then you have different ways of rearranging the orders and depending on which order,

441
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:20,063
it's a very simple calculation in the end, and this is a trick that is constantly used when dealing with the trees.

442
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:28,073
The trees are products. So for example, the trees of a it happens to be has C, you can actually, for example,

443
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:39,863
look at the part of this so you can look at it as it has the first red hat to see that is necessary to the holder so we can move C to a branch.

444
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:45,293
So then you have this is equal to what they have seen.

445
01:01:46,743 --> 01:01:56,123
This has to be sort of an event of after you switch this order, then you can for example,

446
01:01:56,123 --> 01:02:10,343
you can you can trade C and A as you see on a as as a one matrix and times B then of course it will switch in order to movie to the branch.

447
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:19,803
So you happy times you see the same. This is the is that property true?

448
01:02:20,283 --> 01:02:25,053
Like, if a bee is square, but then A and B are not square.

449
01:02:26,553 --> 01:02:33,513
Matrices so like a could be and by P and and B would be P by N.

450
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:39,873
Oh, yeah. So yeah, definitely. So if if A there's a is N by p.

451
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:43,802
P by n. Right. So eight times B then.

452
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:47,553
This is. This is Emma. Animation's. This is Emma and Beatrice.

453
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:52,713
Right. But then if you sweeten an order that becomes p p by n times.

454
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:57,723
Okay. And by P, this is a p boxy matrix.

455
01:02:58,323 --> 01:03:01,563
Mm hmm. Right. So is it trace still equal or is it not?

456
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:09,653
Yeah, they're stealing. Okay, so as long as both are square matrices, then then you can submitted all of us.

457
01:03:10,103 --> 01:03:13,683
All of that. Or whether I mean, whether the the measure of this is equal to the dimension.

458
01:03:14,163 --> 01:03:20,613
That's. Okay.

459
01:03:22,113 --> 01:03:27,602
So this the second affair here, of course, this is for three images of the model, three images and spatter.

460
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:33,303
But you can first generalize, too. That's true of many the product of many measures.

461
01:03:33,783 --> 01:03:39,692
But this is very useful because then that means that you can actually combine certain images

462
01:03:39,693 --> 01:03:46,503
together and and then kind of switch the order of the images is when you cover the trees.

463
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:53,923
And sometimes this gives you a very easy collision because some images this is basically one inverse matrix is our Ernie box.

464
01:03:53,943 --> 01:03:59,663
So some images is inverse in times. I'm not a matrix. Maybe, maybe you are able to cancel the images.

465
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:05,253
So matrix after speech and order. So this is we're going to see examples of that.

466
01:04:06,863 --> 01:04:12,533
Okay. But these are effects of the trace tracer matrix.

467
01:04:12,773 --> 01:04:19,403
We're going to use these things. Okay.

468
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:24,323
So now let's take a look at the rank of the three matrices.

469
01:04:24,353 --> 01:04:26,483
Let's first look at the rank of a Y.

470
01:04:28,163 --> 01:04:36,863
Come in the red who really is not at that difficult because we are as as we are saying so that for unimportant matrices,

471
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:40,643
the red is equal to their increase.

472
01:04:41,633 --> 01:04:46,883
So the rank of a y is equal to a trace of A1. But A1 we have found a y is equal to this.

473
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:56,183
So these are the difference of two matrices. So the trace the difference is equal to the difference.

474
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:03,503
Of the two trips under the trees of either the matrix.

475
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:08,813
This is just equal to the first one.

476
01:05:09,233 --> 01:05:19,553
This is equal in the trees of. Now, here we have a constant again and we can move it out of the trees of this matrix.

477
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:24,233
And then we have the trees of this matrix of ones.

478
01:05:25,313 --> 01:05:31,433
Both trees on matrix are ones, of course, is equal to F because no trace.

479
01:05:31,613 --> 01:05:36,153
Just it's just the sum of the elements.

480
01:05:36,953 --> 01:05:41,992
And of course the sum is equal and all that enlightenments are or what have we got.

481
01:05:41,993 --> 01:05:49,153
Some of the sum of was. So this is equal to N and a cancel with us.

482
01:05:49,373 --> 01:06:03,563
And so what do we have these? So then in the end we have that that the risk of a Y run, a y is equal to minus one.

483
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:11,553
So in other words, rank a while aways is not a full rack matrix.

484
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:19,833
So this is what a why is this is what a what is this matrix is not full length matrix.

485
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:23,793
This round is a minus one.

486
01:06:26,013 --> 01:06:30,093
Okay. But anyway, so we found in the rank of a Y.

487
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:38,383
And now we can follow the test file to run out of air.

488
01:06:38,403 --> 01:06:48,153
So again, the round is equal to the trees and a R is given by this matrix, they of this matrix.

489
01:06:49,203 --> 01:06:53,492
And again, that's while this is a difference of two matrices.

490
01:06:53,493 --> 01:06:59,493
So it is equal to the trees is equal to the trees over the first matrix minus the trees on the second matrix.

491
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:07,173
Now for the cruise of the set of The Matrix. This is exactly the same as before.

492
01:07:07,453 --> 01:07:11,973
We have just found that it's exactly the same as this one.

493
01:07:12,483 --> 01:07:17,823
So this is equal to one. This trace is equal to one.

494
01:07:22,323 --> 01:07:25,893
What about the trees? H h matrix?

495
01:07:27,003 --> 01:07:32,883
Well, h, by definition, the had a matrix is defined in this way.

496
01:07:32,913 --> 01:07:34,053
This is the matrix.

497
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:47,533
We have had metrics and this is a mixed use product and now that's appliance the the property of the trees of the product matrix product.

498
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:56,293
But here we need to be a little bit careful. We need to be smart, like how do we which measures we should combine as a single matrix.

499
01:07:57,523 --> 01:08:04,873
So here we are going to do this, we're going to actually combine, we are going to treat this guy as a matrix.

500
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:08,953
So it's X multiplied by another matrix.

501
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:20,573
So it's the truth of X multiplied by another matrix. And we know the trace of eight speed is equal to the trace of speed humps.

502
01:08:21,803 --> 01:08:30,743
So then this trace of x multiply by this another matrix is equal to the trace of this.

503
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:38,223
Matrix multiply by x we just switch the order of this to.

504
01:08:43,043 --> 01:08:48,683
I would a sweet little. The outer swoosh on the order.

505
01:08:51,783 --> 01:08:56,703
So everybody follows me, right? Is that right? Follow me. So we switched the order on this room.

506
01:08:57,573 --> 01:09:01,953
Okay. So after switched on the order, then we realized that.

507
01:09:03,693 --> 01:09:06,873
We realized that. Here. Now, if we look at this fusion.

508
01:09:10,543 --> 01:09:15,193
And this becomes the same as this matrix here.

509
01:09:18,073 --> 01:09:22,063
And then we have an inverse. So this two matrix can cancel as well.

510
01:09:22,663 --> 01:09:27,193
So. So this inverse cancel with this matrix.

511
01:09:27,493 --> 01:09:37,933
So what we have left is not only the matrix, but we need to be careful about the dimension of the diagonal of the matrix.

512
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,893
So that's why here we're trying to be explicit.

513
01:09:42,313 --> 01:09:55,723
So to put elimination of this matrix as some sweet so this gets s is she bought in so X transpose and is MRP.

514
01:09:57,553 --> 01:10:03,793
So as his boss is, Peabody says one of his X-rays was quite intense.

515
01:10:04,843 --> 01:10:08,023
So in the end, we have a piece by piece metrics.

516
01:10:09,523 --> 01:10:18,313
And despite the metrics, business identity metrics, business identity politics will be measured.

517
01:10:20,473 --> 01:10:27,543
Now, of course, the trace of this and other metrics is just that, just the just is dimension just equal,

518
01:10:27,553 --> 01:10:33,013
because it's something that a lot of us like, all of that, all that us are equal to one.

519
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:37,423
So then it just depends on how many once you have as people.

520
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:43,483
So in and of all the dimension of the rack is actually equal to people's one.

521
01:10:43,963 --> 01:10:47,583
So that's the rank of air.

522
01:10:52,993 --> 01:10:59,613
So you can see now this is where we know where we apply when calculating this trace.

523
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:03,273
This is where we applied in this role here.

524
01:11:03,283 --> 01:11:12,342
So the the literalism it has been easy to look for is and B times eight and a similar if you have multiple metrics multiplied together,

525
01:11:12,343 --> 01:11:24,763
you can find a similar rule. But yeah, this is a very this could be very useful when calculating the traits of a part of up because precisely here,

526
01:11:24,943 --> 01:11:28,733
because after you switch of order you can you can cancel.

527
01:11:28,763 --> 01:11:33,493
I mean this, this inverse council with this matrix and you have this the matrix left.

528
01:11:41,053 --> 01:11:52,713
Okay. Any questions? So much? Okay.

529
01:11:53,223 --> 01:11:59,803
So that's. The rank of air.

530
01:12:00,013 --> 01:12:04,573
And now let's look out of the round of eight again is equal to the trace.

531
01:12:07,273 --> 01:12:12,102
80 is is this matrix we have found is this matrix.

532
01:12:12,103 --> 01:12:16,633
So the trace and then is equal to phase i m minus the trees of h.

533
01:12:20,663 --> 01:12:26,093
Increase of arm. In other metrics, this is equal to in increase of age.

534
01:12:26,243 --> 01:12:29,453
We just found we just found out that official age is equal to people.

535
01:12:30,563 --> 01:12:40,973
I still get the the difference is an amount of students. So that's the the rank of any metrics.

536
01:12:44,363 --> 01:12:50,243
Okay. So now we have found the rent, the rents of the three major.

537
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:59,993
So I think now we have everything we need in order to figure out the distribution of the three sample squares.

538
01:13:02,453 --> 01:13:06,503
So by using the facts provided to us.

539
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,153
So in essence, why divided by Cinema Square?

540
01:13:12,053 --> 01:13:16,193
This is going to follow a consumer decision.

541
01:13:16,703 --> 01:13:25,853
We are going to be where freedom is equal to the realm of the matrix and why the rank of a why we stand is equal in all of this one.

542
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:35,043
And so that's why here we have minus one B where freedom. And another central parameter is equal to.

543
01:13:36,843 --> 01:13:40,413
If we go back to the that to not fact.

544
01:13:43,313 --> 01:13:47,113
I'm sorry. Oh.

545
01:13:49,983 --> 01:14:00,153
Rizzo this is called Running for this community forum follows comScore to this year with PD Graffito where piece the run of games.

546
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:07,773
PD or Fredo? PS Right away, out of this central parameter, this is equal to mil.

547
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:12,392
Transpose mil is not Asian y, amusing Spanish or white.

548
01:14:12,393 --> 01:14:16,503
So new transpose times eight times new divided by Sigma Square.

549
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:25,223
It has this result now we are applying so here.

550
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:33,603
Because we have written this as a committee for a White House.

551
01:14:33,613 --> 01:14:37,663
I'm white. This is what we have done to.

552
01:14:40,373 --> 01:14:48,493
We have written it as a kind of look into the rug of the rug of a what we have found on the run away.

553
01:14:48,503 --> 01:14:56,463
And that that is immodest. Look, that is distinguished reading here and again for the notes and probably parameter number.

554
01:14:56,873 --> 01:15:04,552
We have mule transpose mule is a Spanish of what we transpose LB the matrix a Y

555
01:15:04,553 --> 01:15:12,263
in the middle and has youth in Spanish and a lot and divide in passing square.

556
01:15:13,783 --> 01:15:21,923
Now this is a direct for publication of the previous result and a similarity this SSR.

557
01:15:21,953 --> 01:15:25,853
We have read the SSR as Y transpose Air Times one.

558
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:39,093
In the air. We have found the rug is equal to P minus one and the solar basin program turns again later

559
01:15:39,113 --> 01:15:46,563
on y transpose times A-R in the middle times use management one divided by three must be.

560
01:15:49,773 --> 01:16:03,323
And if as I see it's the same as a sees equal to y principles times 80 times Y and 80, the rank and file of red is mother's cheek.

561
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:13,683
And so that. That's especially true y transpose times 18 times expenditure y divided by C square.

562
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:33,552
Okay. So yeah, these are the results we are able to get so far based on all the calculations we found, the the distribution,

563
01:16:33,553 --> 01:16:41,623
the three close quarters fusions for this sum of three sample squares for this result is three.

564
01:16:42,523 --> 01:16:46,902
Yeah, well, you might, you might, you might ask a question like, why are we doing this?

565
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:50,623
And it would be clear, you know, a few minutes.

566
01:16:50,983 --> 01:16:58,503
So we are doing this because we want to look at what the most remarkable statistic that that is to compare us.

567
01:16:58,783 --> 01:17:01,613
And as are true and I see, well,

568
01:17:01,633 --> 01:17:14,263
standardized s as our results as as so and and this results eventually will show that of F ambassadors to follow after story.

569
01:17:14,953 --> 01:17:18,043
So that's an estimate of why we are looking at this.

570
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:24,732
We are evaluating we want to arrive at the s the density like of the distribution

571
01:17:24,733 --> 01:17:28,843
of our statistic in the index and why the absolute has to make sense.

572
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:41,053
And but in order to reach there we have to look at the distributions of the sum of squares because because f actually involve both SSR and SC.

573
01:17:46,253 --> 01:17:50,963
Okay. But then the last one probably crimes, remember?

574
01:17:51,293 --> 01:18:00,413
Okay. So first now let's look at. Let's look at SSD first.

575
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:09,473
Let's look at an SSD. Look at the number he's given by this guy.

576
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:17,693
This is what they use. Let's look at when this number in this parameter is equal to zero.

577
01:18:18,983 --> 01:18:23,363
Is equal to zero. So this is equal to zero.

578
01:18:24,203 --> 01:18:28,973
If he's variation, why is equal to at speed?

579
01:18:30,683 --> 01:18:34,773
Because he would act smarter. The reason is that.

580
01:18:37,043 --> 01:18:40,642
Okay. So any. Two years.

581
01:18:40,643 --> 01:18:45,593
So if he's manager, why is equal to Spader?

582
01:18:48,363 --> 01:19:00,263
Then. Lambda is equal to the foundation.

583
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:05,783
Let's let's do the calculation. So he's managing Y transpose.

584
01:19:06,623 --> 01:19:16,573
That's X beta transpose. The multiplied by a year in the meadow that's in minus H.

585
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:27,263
And then time is my reason why that's. That's X Times data divided by CMA Square.

586
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:36,393
Here. I'm simply replacing this evaluation and this expansion by X time to speed up.

587
01:19:42,273 --> 01:19:48,693
Right. And then. I'm going to write it in this way.

588
01:19:48,723 --> 01:19:57,153
So here I am in the middle. I have minus x, then times x, I'm going to move x to the middle.

589
01:19:57,153 --> 01:20:03,963
So I have on times x, minus x, minus h, times x then taxpayer.

590
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:19,173
I'm simply. Moving this and combining this ex with this site.

591
01:20:19,623 --> 01:20:22,853
I'm on this h right.

592
01:20:22,863 --> 01:20:28,683
So then i times x that's equals mass h times then i minus h times x.

593
01:20:32,253 --> 01:20:35,623
But we know that h times x this is equal to x, right?

594
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:41,913
This is because of the protein or the definition. That matrix based on x is equal to x.

595
01:20:45,163 --> 01:20:48,553
So then in the middle you have X minus x, which is equal to zero.

596
01:20:48,823 --> 01:20:52,273
So that makes the whole thing easier.

597
01:20:58,193 --> 01:21:09,693
Okay. So what we do is show that if the expansion or Y is equal to at speed on the lambda, he is equal to zero.

598
01:21:12,173 --> 01:21:15,413
So now let's take a look at the implementation of this.

599
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:19,923
So when does it matter what people get to?

600
01:21:25,273 --> 01:21:30,843
And so under our motto, sangria is always equal given the right expanded who I always viewed as our model.

601
01:21:30,973 --> 01:21:38,923
Recall that our model assumption we assume that is foundation y equal to exponent or the

602
01:21:39,483 --> 01:21:44,113
we have played on plus abs and that's what we assume that's how we based on our model.

603
01:21:44,683 --> 01:21:49,973
That's the linearity. Of the line assumption.

604
01:21:50,663 --> 01:21:54,773
And that's that's what we assume our model is specified in this way.

605
01:21:55,043 --> 01:22:01,763
So this is always true on a linear regression model. This is always true because that's that's how we that's how we are.

606
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:12,263
So in other words, older linear regression model, other linear regression model, this lambda is always equal to zero.

607
01:22:13,633 --> 01:22:17,543
Now we see is under linear regression model expansion y.

608
01:22:18,593 --> 01:22:27,173
It's just equal to X, Peter. That's, that's our model assumption has always been our goal so low is always equal to zero other media model.

609
01:22:27,773 --> 01:22:39,533
So in other words, the, as I see if you look out of the that is this distribution of SC over a seamless square.

610
01:22:40,103 --> 01:22:45,443
Now other linear regression model listeners and try the parameter level is always equal to zero.

611
01:22:46,763 --> 01:22:51,773
So in other words, this actually if you follow a central chi square, this is just follow a customer to this movie.

612
01:22:52,403 --> 01:22:55,823
There's no lambda anymore. And the it's just equal to zero.

613
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:06,543
Okay. So this is a lovely, generous speaking model.

614
01:23:06,893 --> 01:23:10,053
Leslie's equal to zero because of our model assumptions.

615
01:23:10,563 --> 01:23:16,053
So lemonade is easy to zero. Now, this. This is a single customer decision.

616
01:23:18,933 --> 01:23:27,993
So as I see in other words, this as US East Divided by Sigma Square, this follows a central chi square decision with your freedom amount as piece.

617
01:23:30,093 --> 01:23:36,363
So that is validation. Then you just need validation of this customer distribution with the growth rate, those people.

618
01:23:37,353 --> 01:23:44,263
And of course, for distribution, it turns out that things about Asia is just equal to east your freedom.

619
01:23:44,283 --> 01:23:49,472
So is equal to amnesty. So they use non-Asian is equal to amnesty for chi square.

620
01:23:49,473 --> 01:23:57,953
For central. For Central Chi Square transfusion. So in other words, now this guy, the explanation is just equal to most people.

621
01:24:01,043 --> 01:24:12,813
Is you an ostrich? So one implication of this is that, if you'll recall, that's how we estimate Sigma score and see how we estimate a similar square.

622
01:24:13,113 --> 01:24:19,773
A a square is I know as we always as we keep saying, Sigma Square is a parameter that we don't know.

623
01:24:19,863 --> 01:24:20,303
Is that.

624
01:24:20,493 --> 01:24:33,693
So we have to estimate, use estimate in using our data and we estimate it using siac divided by a monastery, if you recall, from previous models.

625
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:40,242
That's how we estimate a, c, my squared B you see my square hat that is as I see divided by.

626
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:51,363
M And then because of this, so as us e divided by sigma squared, this is equal to a minus p.

627
01:24:54,143 --> 01:25:01,383
This implies that. These values, I'll see my square hat.

628
01:25:01,753 --> 01:25:05,803
This is equal to, as I see it, divided by amnesty.

629
01:25:06,253 --> 01:25:15,663
This is equal to see my square. This is you've to steal my swift.

630
01:25:17,623 --> 01:25:22,683
And because if you move less you much more to the right and you divide both sides by minus feet.

631
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:28,613
That gives you an idea. Disparaging as a divider divide among his teammates.

632
01:25:28,883 --> 01:25:32,723
See my script if you look how this works out.

633
01:25:32,783 --> 01:25:36,533
This reads Assassination. See my house square.

634
01:25:37,613 --> 01:25:40,913
That is unbiased. Biased as major of see square.

635
01:25:41,843 --> 01:25:49,672
But it's not easy to see my square. And this is the precise reason that you would be asking me to see a square.

636
01:25:49,673 --> 01:25:56,453
We divided by minus P and previously we always say Oh, M.A., PS the degree of freedom of SNC.

637
01:25:56,813 --> 01:26:02,333
And if we try to explain the word freedom, I'm giving you a number of free parameters in the model number,

638
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:09,062
the total number of observations you have that's in there, minus the number of free, free parameters in the model.

639
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:17,603
That's P right. So we have P banners and a so that your freedom is minus P, but that's that explanation of the so called your freedom.

640
01:26:17,603 --> 01:26:22,923
This is a it's really hard to make a very formal definition so mean.

641
01:26:23,033 --> 01:26:32,723
So is interpretation is it's really hard to explain, especially at the very beginning, exactly what it is like the so-called freedom.

642
01:26:33,323 --> 01:26:38,243
So it's part of. But I think this interpretation here, this is much better.

643
01:26:38,243 --> 01:26:44,273
I have to interpret why we are dividing this SNC by minus the precise reason

644
01:26:44,273 --> 01:26:50,763
that we are divided in by ESP about minus is that after divided by ministry,

645
01:26:50,783 --> 01:26:54,193
if you look at this ask later, it is an unbiased estimate.

646
01:26:54,473 --> 01:26:55,163
See my square.

647
01:26:57,023 --> 01:27:05,873
So if you do not if you do not divided this by ministry, if you just look at if say if you are using as I see to estimate see my square,

648
01:27:06,323 --> 01:27:12,833
then you have a biased estimate of CMA Square and the Factories Ministry Inspector.

649
01:27:14,303 --> 01:27:23,243
Okay, so this is just another way of like understanding why we are dividing it by, you know, if you.

650
01:27:26,373 --> 01:27:33,242
So in other words, this is amnesty y minus y.

651
01:27:33,243 --> 01:27:47,133
I had square. And many of you, especially at the very beginning of the course, might like render.

652
01:27:47,343 --> 01:27:55,833
Why, instead of using like one divided by minus one or divided simply by like by one or in just the sample average.

653
01:27:56,373 --> 01:28:04,262
So why we're dividing the spot at minus P, so we call that a for a simple linear regression.

654
01:28:04,263 --> 01:28:09,693
We have divided by minus two, but generally we divide it by him on his feet.

655
01:28:10,053 --> 01:28:16,053
The reason here that now the reason becomes clear is because dividing it by imminence.

656
01:28:16,243 --> 01:28:19,443
We have a mass. Ask me to see my square.

657
01:28:26,073 --> 01:28:30,873
Okay. So that's a letter.

658
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:39,803
So again, generous. We love that we can simply treat Latin even as a zero because of our mode of assumption.

659
01:28:39,813 --> 01:28:44,673
Because we because for for linear regression, we have made this assumption.

660
01:28:44,793 --> 01:28:48,362
This is our assumption. And then under that assumption, of course,

661
01:28:48,363 --> 01:28:54,963
these values are y is equal to Spain and whether it is valid or y equal to Oxford on the level is equal to zero.

662
01:28:56,013 --> 01:28:58,023
So then generous being lambda easy zero.

663
01:29:00,063 --> 01:29:07,033
But this is not true for for lambda while landmark number one and lambda are they are not necessary zero in general.

664
01:29:08,813 --> 01:29:16,973
However, however, Lambda R is equal to zero under this null hypothesis.

665
01:29:19,133 --> 01:29:30,023
Now things have become a little bit familiar. So if we look at this model, is it this is precisely the normal this is going to f so this is testing.

666
01:29:31,853 --> 01:29:40,643
So f statistic is testing whether I mean, there is a there was a such a problem in the midterm write midterm one.

667
01:29:40,853 --> 01:29:44,843
So asking you want not have others is the F statistic is testing.

668
01:29:45,383 --> 01:29:54,683
So the F statistic is testing whether all of these covariate, all of this betas, all of this collisions are equal to zero or not.

669
01:29:54,833 --> 01:30:04,913
So, in other words, is testing whether none of the X has an effect on or has an immediate association with your life.

670
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:15,443
So that's that's essentially what this means. If all these photos are that the model is specified as beta zero plus beta 1x1 plus beta.

671
01:30:15,623 --> 01:30:18,922
That's true. Plus plus production minus one.

672
01:30:18,923 --> 01:30:27,963
That's P minus one. She's absolutely right.

673
01:30:28,063 --> 01:30:34,273
So if all these fighters are losing or we don't, we don't care much about the intercept,

674
01:30:34,453 --> 01:30:37,963
because intercept really has nothing to do with any of this coverage.

675
01:30:38,503 --> 01:30:40,423
So we don't care much about this intercept.

676
01:30:41,503 --> 01:30:47,743
So if all these beta ones, beta, who's on beta won't be allowed to develop, you know, if all of these are equal to zero,

677
01:30:48,373 --> 01:30:57,833
that means none of these commentaries have a linear association with this Y and so so the Y that's not has no linear associated with X.

678
01:30:59,263 --> 01:31:03,943
So that essentially means that your model here has no power at all,

679
01:31:03,943 --> 01:31:11,313
has no explanation of the variation in Y because no other x is useful to explain explaining why.

680
01:31:11,563 --> 01:31:22,123
So that's what this null hypothesis is says. So this is of course, a common interest, like a few remarkably interested.

681
01:31:22,123 --> 01:31:30,933
It has to whether the motor was specified, whether indeed I mean, at least it can explain part of the variation in Y, but there's not.

682
01:31:30,973 --> 01:31:34,773
Well, this is true. That means your motor is useless if I.

683
01:31:35,053 --> 01:31:38,103
Because it doesn't explain anything, any variation one.

684
01:31:38,623 --> 01:31:43,283
So this is like what kind of.

685
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:53,993
Comment like a commonly seen hypothesis matter what it has and turns out that as the U.S. used to test this null hypothesis.

686
01:31:54,683 --> 01:32:03,593
And it turns out that Lambda R is equal to zero under this novelists and Lambda R is equal to.

687
01:32:07,643 --> 01:32:10,673
Lambda R is equal to this guy. This is.

688
01:32:10,673 --> 01:32:26,243
Well, let Naz. And why that is equal to zero on our list, not just because of the R is equal to its valuation of Y.

689
01:32:26,993 --> 01:32:31,283
I suppose I'm fine. I don't think minus one.

690
01:32:31,613 --> 01:32:37,243
But in the end times transition of white divided by seems square.

691
01:32:37,823 --> 01:32:47,472
That is what the R is. So under no hypothesis under law.

692
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:56,563
However, this is exactly you know why on anomalies is there is no one or these term disappear.

693
01:32:57,943 --> 01:33:02,472
What is left is just the intercept. Beta zero is just the intercept.

694
01:33:02,473 --> 01:33:15,953
Beta zero. So that you're these are metrics you're designed metric has just a single color that is one of the covariates disappear so there's

695
01:33:15,953 --> 01:33:31,913
only column one so that old or not but this is of course is foundational why is equal to this the speed of zero so yeah yeah yeah,

696
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:35,013
yeah. Because all the other capacities disappear.

697
01:33:35,483 --> 01:33:44,813
Okay, so then, now here we have is not even a transpose then that's, that's one times beta zero transpose.

698
01:33:46,493 --> 01:33:51,323
I just heard about the law.

699
01:33:51,353 --> 01:33:58,353
I want us. Times.

700
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:02,713
This is one times between two divided by 17.

701
01:34:03,453 --> 01:34:11,223
And this is this is under under normal, but this is under the boxes.

702
01:34:11,763 --> 01:34:27,593
So all the ballots, all the other papers disappear. So I think I was like, h sorry, that's not a valid metrics to art here.

703
01:34:27,613 --> 01:34:33,753
That's h h. That's Matrix.

704
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:44,423
Okay. And then I have a H matrix here.

705
01:34:46,193 --> 01:34:49,753
I combine this matrix with this one.

706
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:54,143
So in the middle, I have not.

707
01:34:54,503 --> 01:34:59,313
Now I will just focus on. I'll just focus on this part.

708
01:35:00,863 --> 01:35:11,753
Just focus on this part. So this part. This is equal to a minus one in by n divided by n comes one.

709
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:34,393
Okay. So sorry. It's probably just. You know, every time.

710
01:35:34,733 --> 01:35:41,133
So it's probably not the best reason I'm gonna do this.

711
01:35:44,523 --> 01:35:49,443
So this transpose here, I'm going to rewrite this transpose. This one comes below zero.

712
01:35:49,803 --> 01:35:53,333
I can write it as beta zero times.

713
01:35:54,093 --> 01:36:06,763
What? And then I'm going to look out of this matrix in the middle here.

714
01:36:12,763 --> 01:36:25,083
And this is equal to one transpose times eight times one minus one, transpose one.

715
01:36:25,383 --> 01:36:33,853
And in the United States, I ignore the two beta zero on both ends.

716
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:44,413
I just focus on the matrix in the middle. And it turns out that this is equal to zero.

717
01:36:44,743 --> 01:36:50,833
Okay. So if we are at time here now, let's let's do this detailed calculation.

718
01:36:50,833 --> 01:36:54,523
But I think that let's let's cover this in our next lecture.

719
01:36:54,523 --> 01:36:57,492
So this is just one, one line of argument.

720
01:36:57,493 --> 01:37:09,223
But I think the usual admission system here, from the point of view, the main one is that the Lambda R is equal to zero under this novel disease.

721
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:16,123
So that's what we are trying to achieve. Oh, okay.

722
01:37:16,123 --> 01:37:20,503
So I think. Yeah, let's just stop here, you guys first.
