1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:31,440
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So we are continuing with the CDF.

2
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:50,470
And during the previous lecture we first looked at how random variables are defined and these were defined as functions of Omega,

3
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:59,680
such that for any set in the Burrell's Sigma algebra,

4
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,690
that's supposed to be subsets built on the range of X,

5
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:15,460
which is in general for a real line that the pre images of those sets obtained using the function x.

6
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:26,900
They happened to be part of the sigma algebra in our probability space, which is a triple.

7
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:36,440
So it's a good sigma algebra and the probability measure that's defined on it and

8
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,680
it's defined so that it knows how to measure subsets in the sigma algebra half.

9
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:54,080
Right. So all we want from the function x is that I can address those subsets in the F using subsets in the range of X and if that's possible,

10
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,450
then we call it the random variable.

11
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,440
And in general such functions are called measurable functions because we can measure them using the probability space that we built.

12
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:13,740
Okay. Then we're looked at probably the most important characteristic of such functions,

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:26,160
and this was defined as a CDF where we took a probability of a subset in the range of X.

14
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,590
So we used to, uh,

15
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:40,380
we started writing PAX to denote the fact that the argument of these P will be a subset in the range of X rather than the subset in the F.

16
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,000
But then because we have these correspondence and X is a measurable function,

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,380
we said that we will eventually drop the X from the P and we'll decide it based on the context.

18
00:02:52,390 --> 00:03:09,510
Right. And so we looked at those half open pieces of the real line from minus infinity on the left to closed x.

19
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:17,520
We call that being a CDF. So that was F of X, that was the definition.

20
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:27,120
Now, because this is a probability, we found that it's a bounded function.

21
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:38,370
Then we proved its property. Oh, but she's of KDFW.

22
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:10,590
So we proved that there's a limit is x equals to minus Cincinnati of F of x, and that was the probability that x is equal to minus infinity.

23
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,840
And the other limits when x those two plus infinity.

24
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:29,640
X was the probability that X is strictly less than plus infinity.

25
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,170
And we did it in a somewhat more general form like this because we want to

26
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:46,190
allow some probability of mass to sit and both of the infinities just in case.

27
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:55,610
And I also alluded to an example in biostatistics where the second thing is helpful, where the mass is sitting at plus infinity,

28
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,430
namely the event time and losses when there is a probability that event never happens.

29
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,380
This is often the goal if we're treating cancer, for example.

30
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:15,180
Okay. Just a reminder of the, uh, what was the technique to prove things like that.

31
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:25,390
So we use the, uh, we use the formula for the difference between sets when one of the sets is a subset of another.

32
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:34,690
That was one thing we used the continuity of probability and we use a representation for,

33
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:42,850
uh, the uh, uh, limits of some intervals as they generate the limits of s.

34
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,900
And so these are the three ingredients to the proof technique.

35
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,650
Um, then we also proved, I don't remember which was first.

36
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,660
Which was second. That doesn't matter. That F is monotonic.

37
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:27,770
And specifically not decreasing. And today we're going to look at the third property of the earth, which is the the Earth is right continues.

38
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,010
And in fact, so looking at the three.

39
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:53,130
So we didn't have it. So this is coming later today.

40
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,940
We will use the opportunity to establish a somewhat more general result that in fact, the limits will be a particular case of.

41
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:11,160
And we will also get a little bit more than continuity out of this result.

42
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:25,760
And so to do that and we will also discuss the types of those CDs, we will uh,

43
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,340
uh, state, uh, the, the Lubeck theory that there are only three types to them.

44
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:52,910
And we'll talk about discrete, absolutely contiguous cliffs, a mixture of the two and the non-trivial example of this song called Singular CDs.

45
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:05,240
Okay. So we're going to look at a difference between so let's say I have two points.

46
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:17,150
X and Y. So both on the real line and let's say X is less equal y.

47
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:29,180
And they. Wonder if we have a defined left hand on the right hand limits.

48
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:38,560
So just in case, I will do that again. Left and.

49
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:53,550
Right hand limits. So the intention will be so for the left hand limit.

50
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,730
So that's half of X -0.

51
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,790
That's the limit of if left hand limit an X.

52
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:19,100
And this is understood as the limit of when epsilon goes from above to zero F of x minus epsilon.

53
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:35,870
And then the right hand limits. This would be half of X plus zero.

54
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,960
That's the notation and that's the limit.

55
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:47,060
And then when Epsilon goes from above to zero.

56
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,940
But this time it's F of X plus.

57
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,890
So. This is taken straight out of calculus.

58
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,340
That's basically and instead of epsilon, you could consider a sequence.

59
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:14,290
So we previously defined limits as sequences exam and any such, if any such arbitrary,

60
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:21,909
uh, sequence that we put instead of the epsilon in place of the epsilon.

61
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,380
If it gives us this relationship, then this would be by definition, the limit.

62
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:41,370
Okay then. So we have, we previously defined using the properties that we already considered, um, the,

63
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,660
the fact that F is bounded because there is some kind of a probability and then the fact that F is not decreasing.

64
00:10:49,500 --> 00:11:01,950
That was proved earlier in the previous lecture and we will refresh the memory on the properties of the bounded monotonic functions.

65
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,110
So they are supposed to have left and right and limits throughout.

66
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,800
So that means that F has those limits.

67
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:22,440
We just at this point have not proved what they are for any point ex except that uh, uh x being plus or minus infinity.

68
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:30,780
So what we can see the next is proving it for an arbitrary point x from both sides, from the left and from the right.

69
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:46,710
Uh, and so we are exploiting the fact that those limits exists, uh, exist, and then any sequence is supposed to converge to that limit.

70
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,590
And we will be taking specific sequences, let's say one over M instead of the epsilon.

71
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,690
Uh, so then the sequence will be going to zero.

72
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,020
It will be a specific sequence, but because the limit exists.

73
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:11,190
Uh, so in order to find that limit, it takes a specific sequence and finding its limits, because all of the sequences will have the same one.

74
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:26,550
Okay. So having said that, so let's state, uh, the result of our first theorem that's looking at the left hand limits of CDF.

75
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,509
And actually the left hand limit will be a corollary of this theorem.

76
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:49,620
Like I said, it will be a little more general. So we're taking two points X and Y and X, less equal Y and for them.

77
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:57,959
So we are considering the difference between F of Y and F of x -0.

78
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:19,510
The left hand. Leave it at x. And so later on, as a corollary to the statement, I will take x equals y, which I can do if axis less or equal y,

79
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:28,770
and then this relationship will then tell me when I have the left continuity.

80
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:48,000
So let me define left continuities. So function F is left continuous.

81
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:08,790
If approaching this function from the left in the limits gives me the value of this function at the points and is right continuous.

82
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:24,420
If the limit from the right is equal to the value of the function at this point.

83
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:38,470
So we will find out that using the two hearings that I have advertised a couple of seconds ago,

84
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:46,240
that F will be right, continuous, but not necessarily less continuous and will be evident when it is not continuous.

85
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:57,280
So we are looking at left continuity and we will find that these corresponds to the probability.

86
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:07,900
You can write X if you want, but based on the context, this is probability addressed through the random variable x.

87
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:20,290
So that's the probability of a closed of x falling into a closed intervals from x to y.

88
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:32,780
So let's do the proof. Uh, so I'll.

89
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,840
I'll take. I'll start with what we want.

90
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,940
So this is F of y, minus F of x, -0.

91
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:52,110
Then I will replace that thing, uh, by the definition of this limit.

92
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,060
So this is the left hand limit. So it's defined, uh, uh.

93
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,990
Is as, um. I'm right here.

94
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:12,950
Right. So that's the definition. So that's.

95
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:24,309
I've lost the pen I was using. Okay.

96
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,820
There it is. So that's the limit.

97
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:35,500
Uh, is. And goes to infinity. F of x minus one over.

98
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:46,250
All right. So this is what I was talking about, because EF was already known to have a limit because it's a bounded, monotonic function.

99
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:55,340
In order to find data, I need a specific sequence that converges to zero and then choose one over them, for example, as that sequence.

100
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:15,319
Then. So having replaced it, I can say that this is a limit and goes to infinity of half of y, minus half of x,

101
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:22,220
minus one over and this is the first term doesn't have an end so I can put it under the limits.

102
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:33,230
Doesn't change anything then. So this point will replace if by its definition the using p.

103
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,480
Please have. It's the submission using P.

104
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,840
And that would then be the limit. So that carries over.

105
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,430
And then I will have a difference between two probabilities.

106
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:10,320
So one is the probability you can write X because it's addressing it through the random variable x time dropping it.

107
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:23,390
It's clear from the context. Minus the probability from minus infinity to x, minus one over three.

108
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,330
This is straight the definition of what the F was, right?

109
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:35,700
So F must be from minus infinity to whatever they argument of f is closed on that argument.

110
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,010
Okay then. So my x is less of equal y.

111
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,130
So that means that this interval.

112
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,270
Right. Is a subset of this interval.

113
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:18,430
Right. So I could call this guy a this guy and be so I have a part of B and we had an expression that's when this is the case,

114
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:29,640
then P of B minus B of E is equal to P of B without the E right.

115
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,360
The difference between sense, this is what we have last time.

116
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,460
So I'm going to use this formula backwards. Right? I see a difference between sets.

117
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:45,550
One is nested within the other, so I want to write it as a single probability.

118
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,540
And using this relationship, this would be the probability.

119
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:05,990
Of the interval. So I have the interval from minus infinity to y and closed on the Y.

120
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:20,060
Right. I have another one x less equal y and so that's x minus one over and.

121
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:31,380
Without it. Right. So take this interval and I'm subtracting this one.

122
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:41,580
So what I'm left with is open x minus one over an and closed y as a result.

123
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:47,380
Right. When I take the difference between these two sets.

124
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,670
So that would be then the limit of.

125
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,830
The sets x minus one over an or y closed.

126
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,770
Now these SATs are decreasing, right?

127
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:19,220
Decreasing within. Because what happens is that my point X minus one over and it moves right as the and increases.

128
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:28,380
So I have decreasing intervals and I have a probability of limit of the probability of decreasing sets.

129
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:35,900
That's by definition of the limits of sense and by the continuity of probability.

130
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:54,060
I have these as a probability of the limiting set and the limiting set for decreasing sense is the intersection and from one to infinity of sense,

131
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,030
x minus one over and and two y closed.

132
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:11,660
Okay. And then just continue writing that thing.

133
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,180
So this is an exercise similar to the ones you have on the homework and some of the examples we can see that.

134
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:33,140
Right. So the limit of this set is a closed interval from X to Y, and that's what we intend to prove.

135
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,470
So that was the looking at the left hand limits.

136
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,840
So we have corollary that characterizes the left hand limit statement.

137
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:10,310
So we take X equals Y, and then we find that.

138
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:21,510
F of x minus F of x -0.

139
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:33,090
So this is actually a jump of F. And as it goes through X.

140
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:56,629
So the point. So that is the probability of now I'm getting a close interval from X to x.

141
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,770
That's the single x. And it's p x.

142
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:16,350
So it's probability that x is equal to x. And we certainly know plenty of distributions where these would be discrete distributions, right.

143
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,750
Where the probability is that when the variable takes a specific value is actually not zero.

144
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:30,570
So we get a statement that if is left continues.

145
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:47,070
If and only if. Probability equals X is actually zero.

146
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:58,480
So he had. Right. And that's directly follows from the relationship we have here.

147
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:12,050
Right. Because it's in the quality. So left continuous that's looking at the thing at the left would be when when this thing is equal to zero.

148
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:20,690
Looking at the thing on the right, we see that this is if and only if the probability that X is equal to zero.

149
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:29,870
So such points are called atoms. So that means that that the value of x there is some probability mass sitting.

150
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,980
So if. This guy is greater than zero.

151
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:48,040
This is called an eight. Well, probability mass.

152
00:25:50,790 --> 00:26:01,309
So there are different names for it, but. So that was the left.

153
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,600
Continue it. Sometimes they are, sometimes not. If there are items, it's not.

154
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,570
They're at the points of items. Otherwise it could be there.

155
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:19,730
And another theorem looks now on the limit from the right in the same way.

156
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:33,140
And so we keep taking X, less or equal Y, but we now look at F of Y plus zero.

157
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,370
So the right hand limits of F at the point Y minus F of X.

158
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:52,770
So what's this guy? And we will show that this is the probability of the house opening to low on the left and closed on the right of the what?

159
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,460
Now the proof is very similar. So I won't be as detailed.

160
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,890
So we start with what we want with the left part of what we want to prove.

161
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,750
So that's this difference. Then we represented as a limit.

162
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,419
This goes to infinity. So F of y plus zero I represent.

163
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:31,850
There's a limit of probabilities from minus infinity to y plus one over.

164
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:43,230
And uh, then I keep using the relationship that expresses the,

165
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:54,640
that follows the difference between two probabilities for the nested sets into a probability of a single one.

166
00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,580
That would be the one from X to Y plus one over m.

167
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,410
Just like we did last time. This is again decreasing sense.

168
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:18,280
So I have this as a probability intersection and from one to infinity X plus.

169
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:27,080
X to Y plus one over and right.

170
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:35,670
But this time my limit points is on the closed end of the interval.

171
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:47,450
Right. So using the continuity of probability, um, that was the previous statement and the limit of sense.

172
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:55,510
Uh, so it gets in the limit, the interval from X to y y is closed.

173
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,690
That's what we intended to prove.

174
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,240
And then so a similar corollary.

175
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,370
So we said X equals Y.

176
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:26,710
And then we have the other half. Y plus zero.

177
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,780
The right hand limit minus.

178
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:41,570
So X is same as Y minus F of x.

179
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:50,450
So that's equal to the probability of the interval from X to x.

180
00:29:51,680 --> 00:30:02,389
And it's closed on the right and open on the left. So it excludes X because it's open on the left and includes X because it's closed on the right.

181
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,400
And such intervals don't exist. So that that's the probability of an empty set.

182
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:24,200
The probability of an empty set is zero. So we always have for the CDF that the jump when we go through the point X from the right to the left.

183
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:36,920
So that jump at the point X does not exist. So the consequence is that F is always the right continuous.

184
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,150
Okay.

185
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:09,060
So we now have enough properties, so we could call it Property three, just as we did at the beginning of the lecture that there is right continuous.

186
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:19,090
So we have enough properties to show a generic view of how offs look like.

187
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:31,820
So how do you see the. Look like generally.

188
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:51,220
The most typical scenario is that this is something that's going to be well, it may or may not have a limit as X goes to minus infinity.

189
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:57,160
So let's say it's continuous for a while and there's a possible point of jump.

190
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:06,489
Now with no, because these these are bounded continuous functions that there can only be accountable number of jumps.

191
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:15,550
And this is the only type of discontinuity that F may have is a bounded monotonic function.

192
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:24,280
So and this discontinuity is of the right continuous type.

193
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,840
So there's a limit from the right, but there may not be a limit from the left.

194
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:41,500
And the probability that f so this is a point x then the probability that x is equal to x is actually the size of that jump.

195
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,870
Right. And we see that if that probability is greater than zero, then there is a jump at that point.

196
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,900
Then it's again possibly continuous, uh, with a given and perhaps a jump.

197
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,700
There's a countable number of them could be finite, could be infinite, and so on.

198
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:11,920
And then finally it goes to one for it's eventually.

199
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:23,260
So is there some doubt? So I only made two jumps.

200
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:30,670
But that could be accountable number of them. So this is. How CDs look like.

201
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,930
Okay. So we now have we are the construction.

202
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,670
Constructions of probability spaces.

203
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,069
And random variables. Right.

204
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:09,100
So we initially constructed the probability space without referencing any type of functions, uh, any, any random variables.

205
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:20,050
Then we introduced random variables as a way to address some of the sense in the sigma algebra of our probability space.

206
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:30,820
Then having done that, we introduced a characteristic that's linked to probability for the random variable.

207
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:39,520
So now the question is so if I have a characteristic that looks like a CDF and feels like CDF,

208
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,210
can we actually reconstruct or construct some kind of a probability space that would be consistent with it?

209
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,060
And the answer is yes. And so let's do that.

210
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:08,780
So let's construct. Probability space.

211
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,140
If we only have a CDR.

212
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,800
CTF meaning an arbitrary function.

213
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,480
That satisfies the basic properties that we just proved.

214
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:51,080
Satisfying. The one, the two and the three.

215
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:08,120
So with the appropriate limits for minus infinity and infinity, the monitor needs to be known decreasing in the right continuous property.

216
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:18,230
So if I just have a function, that's the that is just like in this picture, for example, can I reconstruct the whole probability space from it?

217
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,430
And the answer is yes. So we first.

218
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:43,180
We generate the sigma algebra. Burrell's sigma algebra using the intervals that were used to define the.

219
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:55,210
So these are internals from e to be open on the left for arbitrary e.

220
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,339
B. It's part of our a lesson.

221
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:07,870
It will be. Wall Street of less than B would be the same thing.

222
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,160
So we had an example right early on. What we consider a Brown Sigma algebra is that, uh,

223
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:24,580
so it actually takes any kind of interval with at least one open end to generate liberal sigma algebra.

224
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,410
So we can do that. So the second thing.

225
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,840
So for the probability space.

226
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:50,890
So we need to define the probability measure, uh, and will define it, uh, for any such interval is the difference between an F of B and F of E.

227
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:07,280
So this is equal by definition. Okay.

228
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:12,260
Then this measure will be accountably additive.

229
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:34,680
And the other axioms of probability are satisfied as well because of the limits of and because of the properties of.

230
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:47,930
Right. So if I take image, if I take this difference for the whole Omega, then I would have f of plus infinity, minus F of minus infinity.

231
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,380
So that that would be a one for the Omega.

232
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:07,660
So how do we show it's accountably edited if we only need to show it for the basis set, which is an interval from A to B?

233
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,379
And suppose I have a partition because all the other cells in my sigma algebra are

234
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:20,380
generated by countable unions and intersections of basis sets and they are complements.

235
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:27,700
Right. So if I show that it's countable for the basis sense, it's also going to be accountable for any such operations.

236
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,050
So suppose we have a partition.

237
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:58,219
Of the intermodal a B that we represent is so union I from one to and of some

238
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:16,640
intervals i b I where the one is A and b am is B and they are not overlapping.

239
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:29,520
Disjoint. So these intervals, these joints, right.

240
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:38,610
So we need to verify that the probability measure would just defined for the

241
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:43,980
interval a b is going to be a sum of the probability measures for these intervals.

242
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,290
Right. And that that happens to be a trivial exercise.

243
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:55,150
So we're taking this some.

244
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,180
Of probabilities of the intervals.

245
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,470
A. I. B. I. Although I.

246
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,610
So that's, uh. So we use the definition of the CDF.

247
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:24,660
So for one, two and then a B half of B I minus half of E I.

248
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,680
It's based on the property that we defined a minute ago.

249
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:42,620
And so if we do this, so we will have all the middle terms.

250
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:54,200
Does the right hand of of each of these intervals is at the same time the left, the end of the previous one, and the right hand will go with the plus.

251
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:04,460
The left hand will go with a minus and all the middle will cancel out except the intervals at the end, which is the A and the B points.

252
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,150
Well, the middle. Yeah.

253
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,840
For all the F of the middle points.

254
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:39,030
Well, cancel out. So we'll just have the endpoints, which is F of B minus F of E.

255
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:46,810
This is what we intended to show. That's the probability of the whole interval as it was defined.

256
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,170
Right. So that shows countable in the tv g.

257
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,410
Okay. So we defined the probability space at this point.

258
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:13,880
So we have what the army in this probability space that's an R, we have the sigma algebra in that probability space which is moral.

259
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:24,620
We have the probability measure that we defined through the arbitrary function f that looks like a CDF that was given to us.

260
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:35,560
So the one thing missing is the random variable that this half corresponds to.

261
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:44,770
And we can say that will take. The identity function for four x.

262
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,160
Equals. I'm in the it's and I'm in our.

263
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:55,450
And we'll say that this X has the Sydney F f.

264
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:04,910
And that completes the definition. So now half the X and it's going to be a sample space that don't justify.

265
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:16,820
Because whenever we have the identity function for the random variable that defines the so called sample space,

266
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:25,160
because there's no difference between the range and the domain of of X.

267
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:34,880
And so by consequence, it's there's no difference between the barrel sigma algebra and the F.

268
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:41,110
So they have the same thing. Okay.

269
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,190
So this is certainly not the only way to define it like that.

270
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:55,089
So you can take a different that's not necessarily an identity function that shows that you can reasonably start with CDF looking

271
00:44:55,090 --> 00:45:02,470
functionally and reconstruct or define the probability space in the right and the variable that are all consistent with it.

272
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:21,150
And this actually justifies the approach of the six alarms when you did not question whether random variables exist if a distribution is given to you.

273
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,670
Right. Suppose they have a normal random variable.

274
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:30,190
So you did not question how exactly the probability space is set up for.

275
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,190
That's what the random variable is.

276
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:41,140
So normal distribution just means you have a normal CDF rate and this type of logic

277
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:47,170
actually tells you that this is always possible to furnish all the other stuff around it.

278
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:00,800
Okay. Then we're about to look at the types of distributions.

279
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:18,780
And the two kind of familiar types to you would be the continuous distributions are absolutely continuous,

280
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:28,770
as we will call them in this course and discrete distributions or perhaps some of you at some point have to look at mixtures of them.

281
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:37,290
And so what I have actually in this graph is a mixture of a continuous distribution and a discrete one, right?

282
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:45,010
So purely continuous would be something like this, right?

283
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:56,850
And the purely discrete would be something that this jumps, right like this and it's constant between those jumps.

284
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,480
Okay. So this would be called discrete.

285
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,210
Well, these will be called absolutely continuous.

286
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:18,350
And these are mixed. Discrete, continuous.

287
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:30,060
So we will define them kind of more rigorously in the next few minutes.

288
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:37,110
And we will also discuss yet another class that doesn't fall into these types.

289
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,270
Uh, just. Just to be aware that it exists.

290
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:51,270
Uh, so it's not like it has any consequences in statistics because you would always assume for your models that,

291
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:56,190
you know, distribution is one is consistent with one of those graphs.

292
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,110
Uh, there are non-trivial cases, the singular ones.

293
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:15,360
Um, and, uh. So let me give a definition that would be instrumental in defining those classes.

294
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,990
I may have defined it already. That's okay.

295
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:26,370
So I'll just restated. So this notion for the support of the distribution.

296
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:46,530
Of a random variable. And this is understood is the smallest subset.

297
00:48:49,580 --> 00:49:03,790
Of our. With notation.

298
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,670
Our X. Example. So we need to know that somehow.

299
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:24,490
Such that the probability of that subset is equal to one.

300
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:39,509
Right. So we take. So perhaps not not all of the hour is needed to define it.

301
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:51,780
Right. So if my distribution distribution if my CD4 is zero for a while there and this period where zero is not part of support drive,

302
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:59,730
I can drop it without changing the, uh, so I can have the probability of one for a smaller step in that case.

303
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,300
And this gives another interpretation for the support of the distribution.

304
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:15,230
So this is a set of points. Where else in Greece is?

305
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:28,750
Right. And this could be an obvious situation where EV just jumps up.

306
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:42,969
So that's an increase. I could be less of this situation where the derivative of F exists and it's non it's not equal to zero so.

307
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:47,550
GDF Yeah. It's derivative of.

308
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:55,310
Exists. Is greater than zero.

309
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:21,850
Okay. And I need this to be able to talk about the properties of the CDF and what classes they belong to because it depends what their support is.

310
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:33,280
Right. So for, uh, if we look at the examples we had, um, so the, the one on the left probably has a support.

311
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,170
That's the whole ah. Right.

312
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:46,660
Because it increases everywhere sometimes simply by way of, uh, existing pdf that gives it a continuous form and sometimes it jumps.

313
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:53,920
That's also an increase. Same with, uh, with this function that we showed, but for the discrete one.

314
00:51:54,610 --> 00:52:01,180
Uh, so we know that if we just sum up the probabilities, some of the sizes of the jumps will get a one.

315
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:08,280
So that would make the support being a comfortable set of points where uh, my CDF jumps, right?

316
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:15,580
Yeah. Like I said, we will have an example of a non trivial function, but we'll do it after the break.

317
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:18,730
This is just the correspondence that, that this, this random variable has the CDF.

318
00:53:21,880 --> 00:54:00,690
This is a serious. Is that the point?

319
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:10,650
Well, if you can drop something from it and the probability of the remaining seven is still one, then it wasn't the smallest.

320
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:26,370
It's. Well, the smallest means you cannot drop any subset of it without changing the probability of the whole subset.

321
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:32,470
Of the concept. Right. So it's a set whose probability is one.

322
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:40,150
But that you cannot draw up any subset from because it will become less than one.

323
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,900
I know it's not a very visual definition. Right.

324
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,560
But yeah, for four examples it will be clear what it is for the specific examples that we consider.

325
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,549
And like I said, you can use any of the other definitions as well right there.

326
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:07,470
Intuitive. Right where F increases and it increases the F F is jumping or.

327
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:16,500
There's something intuitive about it at this point. So the smallest definition, that's that's the rigorous one.

328
00:55:16,980 --> 00:59:14,920
But the other ones are intuitive. Increases.

329
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:19,630
Yeah. So where it doesn't increase.

330
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:27,240
Those points can be dropped. Because they don't change the probability of the whole South, right?

331
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:32,970
If it's so the period where if is constant, that can be dropped.

332
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:45,850
Okay. Shall we continue? Actually, I find it confusing how I gave this definition.

333
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,510
So I'll call it P and I will say that it's given for a sample space.

334
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:15,010
Because the way I'm thinking of the support is the set of points on the x axis of the this graph, not on the y axis.

335
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:22,020
Right. So. So this is related.

336
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:32,500
Some points. The X axis.

337
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:58,020
Yes. Yes. Now it's probably defined in general for, uh, is for the Omegas.

338
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:04,290
Uh, but I'm going to just needed to make an illustration for the types of the distribution.

339
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,470
So that's why we use this narrow definition.

340
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:21,870
Okay. Okay.

341
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:25,620
So let's start with the simplest one. So discrete distributions.

342
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,260
So these are the ones where CDF is piecewise constants.

343
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:57,790
With jumps, possibly. What jumps at the countable set of points.

344
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:33,170
Once again. So this means that I have a tangible set of points where my CD4 jumps may be infinitely many may be finite, like many my CDF looks like.

345
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:42,979
Well, it gets to the point, then jumps so zero before that point.

346
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:53,750
Then it's again a constant and then it again jumps and it's again in constants jobs and then eventually it becomes equal to one.

347
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:06,870
Right. So somewhere. Right.

348
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:19,820
So then we can say that we have points x one, x two, x three and so on and the set of points x pi.

349
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,750
Well, it goes from one to an and these possibly infinitely large.

350
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:40,360
This is the support. Of the distribution.

351
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:51,720
So my CDF only increases at those points, right?

352
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:59,159
Then increases by way of a jump. Now the amount by which it jumps its.

353
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,319
P. P to because it needs to become one eventually.

354
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,930
So the sum of all those pieces of AI is going to be equal to one.

355
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:20,930
And that's the same thing as the sum of AI of the probabilities that x is equal to exercise.

356
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:40,630
So this these guys, the P. Now.

357
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,450
So if I ask you what is the PDF of that that corresponds to this CDF?

358
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:08,420
Does anybody have an answer? Actually, I will accept any answer at this point.

359
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:20,910
Who thinks it doesn't exist? Well, actually, if you just look back at calculus,

360
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:34,480
you have to probably say that it doesn't exist except where it's zero zero everywhere except a accountable set of points where it doesn't exist.

361
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:40,410
Right. Because you can't really differentiate the function at those points.

362
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,140
But will actually take a page from physics and how physicists define derivatives.

363
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,060
So they are sometimes called generalized derivatives in mathematics.

364
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:00,750
So we'll define a PDF or something like this later on just for convenience.

365
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:09,870
Okay. So these were discrete ones. So F of x, that's a pdf.

366
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:18,210
Is equal to zero. Except it.

367
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:31,370
And it's equal. So if I if I do three bars at the equality that that stands for uniformity equal rights for a range of values

368
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:40,640
of acts at the same time simultaneously rather than for just one point except at those points excise rates.

369
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,880
But that's one thing. Right. Discrete distributions.

370
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:07,820
So then we have continuous distributions. And we will call them absolutely continuous.

371
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:24,430
So these will be defined by saying that f of x the pdf.

372
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:35,020
Exists. Everywhere.

373
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,340
Now we may relax the assumption everywhere. Uh, uh, to to almost too early.

374
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:59,180
But I will give those definitions later. Uh, but we do have to, uh, give one specific definition that relates to this.

375
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:05,310
And this is actually where the name for search distribution comes from.

376
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:12,430
So remember, we talk about measures as functions of SATs.

377
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:23,200
So we'll say that measure. That one measure is absolutely continuous with respect to another view is.

378
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:29,360
Absolutely. Ten years.

379
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,850
With respect to another measure.

380
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:58,230
It's a new eve for any city such that its new measure is zero.

381
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:05,160
It follows the the new measure of that same sap is also zero.

382
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:27,220
And now most commonly. Including in our case, new is length.

383
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:55,570
On the back, Marshall. Right.

384
01:09:55,660 --> 01:10:07,239
And that's where the name for the absolutely continuous distributions come from, because they generate the such distributions,

385
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:16,270
define a probability measure through the CDF such that it's absolutely contiguous with respect to length.

386
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:27,460
Right. So now now that I said that, so you should be able to tell me why discrete distributions are not absolutely continuous.

387
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:41,770
Well, if I take the support points for a discrete distribution, what is there for you to measure?

388
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:51,090
It's a one rights. If I take all of them. What is their length?

389
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:57,440
It's a zero, right? South.

390
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:08,190
So I have one measure that gives it a one and the bad measure gives it a zero.

391
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:12,780
So it's not an absolutely continuous measure because by definition.

392
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:19,430
So they should be getting the same thing with the lives matter.

393
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:32,600
While if I have the absolutely continuous distributions, these these are distributions such that PDF exists everywhere.

394
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,710
Right. So it's a differentiable CDV.

395
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:45,630
So that's something like base rates. Let's say normal logistics.

396
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:49,180
So these are all absolutely continuous distributions.

397
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:58,030
Right. So if I take any SATs that has zero, uh, measure.

398
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:03,820
Uh, based on this distribution, uh, this has to be accountable.

399
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:07,420
Set of points. Set of singletons.

400
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:15,970
Uh, there. And as one example, that that's a probability that X is equal to one specific X right.

401
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:21,190
For a normal distribution, that's a zero. And it's also has length of zero.

402
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:32,010
So that makes it absolutely contiguous. So then the we can mix the two.

403
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:46,070
Indiscreet continues. Distributions.

404
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:01,550
Now for those we need to say what? Almost everywhere means.

405
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:19,730
So almost everywhere. Or almost surely.

406
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:30,350
Most of the time this would be the same thing. So.

407
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:40,850
That means something. Is true, except.

408
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,919
Four sets of measures.

409
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:58,760
Zero. Right and using this definition.

410
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:06,260
Uh, well, it's kind of incomplete because in order to apply it, we need two things, as you see from the definition.

411
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:10,760
So we need what this something is. Right. So it's some kind of a statement.

412
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:15,890
And we also need a measure to be defined. So with respect to that measure.

413
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:28,410
Right. And examples would be. So I can say that X is equal to Y.

414
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:33,990
So they are both random variables, almost surely.

415
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:45,540
So that means X is equal to Y of omega for all it is.

416
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:50,200
Except. The ones.

417
01:14:53,390 --> 01:15:24,310
For a set of measures. Zero. Highlights of my Army days on the rail line, for example, and I have my X like this and my Y is I take,

418
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:34,120
for example, this point and this is going to be my Y, so it's equal to X except that at some point they just the.

419
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:39,790
Play with it. Right, and remove that point.

420
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,960
So that's another way. Right.

421
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:58,300
So I'm saying that Y same as X, except that these two points where a change the value of x and I call my new function Y right now because my uh,

422
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:04,490
the length of the set where X is not equal to y is, is zero.

423
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:09,380
So I could say that X is equal to Y almost everywhere.

424
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:21,200
And one consequence of that is that so few remember integrals from calculus.

425
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:26,660
So if you change the function under the integral in an arbitrary way,

426
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:34,130
but at a accountable set of points that have length of zero, that won't change the integral right?

427
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:38,960
So the expected value of X and the expected value of Y will be the same.

428
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:47,720
Right now because of that. Yeah it is linked to the.

429
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:53,780
So this will find applications in integration. That's the topic that we will consider next.

430
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:04,579
And then so. The Mix district continues.

431
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:11,180
So we already have a graph of those. So they look like this.

432
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,450
Part of it is discrete. Parts of it is continuous.

433
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:30,600
Like I said, I will introduce some formalism borrowed from physics that will allow to endow something like this with with a PDF.

434
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,920
And this will be related to Dietrich's Delta functions. So we'll use.

435
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:39,030
We'll do it next time. I'll give you an example.

436
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:44,580
That's non-trivial, because one of the things about these distributions is that.

437
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:50,639
So the point of growth for the points of growth is support for the absolutely

438
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,500
continuous distribution is everywhere where the PDF is greater than zero.

439
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,230
Right? So that's could be the whole realign.

440
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:10,860
Now for this type of discrete distribution, the support is actually a accountable set of points and just singletons for a mixed discrete continuous.

441
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:17,400
It's a combination of the two, but for the singular that we will define next time.

442
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:25,720
So the function will be continuous and so it won't have jumps.

443
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:37,110
The pdf will be zero almost everywhere and it will manage being zero almost everywhere.

444
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:39,570
It will manage to grow from 0 to 1.

445
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:51,750
Despite that, and it's our favorite guy, Cantor, who does non-trivial examples of this will there will be a counter function next time.

446
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:55,800
Okay. That's it for today.
