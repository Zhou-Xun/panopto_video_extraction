1
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,694
Today we like to address four things.

2
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:15,825
We want to describe the role of empathy and motivational interviewing and

3
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:19,823
why it's so important to establish it before moving into the advice and

4
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:21,839
information exchange component.

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,447
Number two, letter described the role of resistance and what drives it.

6
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:30,535
Number three, I wanna introduce the concept of reactant and

7
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:33,940
explain how it differs from resistance.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,002
And finally we'll discuss how important energy is in motivation and

9
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:39,910
how the inverse is true as well.

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,740
How depletion can drive resistance.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,792
Why is empathy so important?

12
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:51,804
Well, think of empathy as the fertilizer that allows the seeds of your advice and

13
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:53,213
information to grow.

14
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:56,337
This phrase on the screen captures it wonderfully.

15
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:59,410
I don't care what you know until I know that you care.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,257
That's a fancy way of saying establish empathy first before you begin

17
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,729
offering advice and information.

18
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,826
Let's take a look at this clip that shows how powerful this a dodge is.

19
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:15,799
I'll see you on the other side.

20
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,539
>> It's just, there's all this pressure and

21
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,482
sometimes it feels like it's right up on me and

22
00:01:23,482 --> 00:01:27,927
I can just feel it like literally feel it in my head and

23
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:32,904
it's relentless and I don't know if it's going to stop.

24
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:37,745
I mean, that's the thing that scares me the most

25
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:42,362
is that I don't know if it's ever gonna stop.

26
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:46,505
>> Yeah, what you do have a nail in your head.

27
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,777
>> It is not about the nail.

28
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:49,797
>> Are you sure?

29
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:52,141
Because, I mean, I'll bet if we got that out of there.

30
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,094
>> Stop, trying to fix it.

31
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:54,476
>> No, I'm not trying to fix it.

32
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:57,538
I'm just pointing out that maybe the nail is cuz you,

33
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:58,585
>> You always do this.

34
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,810
You always try to fix things when what I really need is for you to just listen.

35
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,871
See I don't I think that is what you need.

36
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:07,070
I think what you need is to get the nail.

37
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,801
Okay, fine.

38
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,764
I will listen, fine.

39
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:17,124
>> It's just, sometimes it's, like there's this achy.

40
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:22,500
I don't know what it is and I'm not sleeping very well at all.

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,551
And all my sweaters are snagged.

42
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,314
I mean, all of them.

43
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:32,475
>> Yeah, that sounds really hard.

44
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:38,095
>> It is, thank you.

45
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:41,920
>> Come on, if you would just, >> Don't.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,024
This clip shows that no matter how effective your advice maybe,

47
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:50,437
until your client or patient feels heard.

48
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:55,882
Until you've expressed empathy that I hear this is hard for you,

49
00:02:55,882 --> 00:03:01,228
until you have allowed them to drain there swamp of negativity,

50
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:03,711
advice just doesn't stick.

51
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:07,610
The woman was not interested in removing the nail until

52
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,740
she first knew that her partner understood her struggles.

53
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,440
Well, it's that way with our patients as well.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,464
Until they can express how scared they are about this change,

55
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,110
how much they dread this change.

56
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,140
Until they've been allowed to express their resistance.

57
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,856
Giving people advice and jumping to how, just doesn't make sense.

58
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:31,359
Now, let's take a look at this clip,

59
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,293
it's going to drill down deeper into how we sometimes create resistance,

60
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:41,090
which is something we call reactance when we use controlling language.

61
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,468
Let's take a look at the clip.

62
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:56,635
[MUSIC]

63
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:58,715
>> Dad.

64
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:04,098
[MUSIC]

65
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:05,590
Are you okay?

66
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,394
>> Yeah, yeah, I'm alright, thank you.

67
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,068
>> You alright.

68
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,468
>> Yeah, I'm okay.

69
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,080
>> All right.

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,300
>> Yeah, I think I'm having a heart attack.

71
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,935
>> Is this a trick.

72
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:19,694
>> Trick?

73
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,563
>> Yeah, like the spider in your tent.

74
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:28,454
>> There was spider in my tent.

75
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:35,159
>> Maggie, Trey.

76
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,060
>> Okay, you didn't have a heart attack.

77
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,403
>> Good [LAUGH] >> But

78
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:44,801
you do suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease.

79
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,329
>> Well.

80
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:50,221
>> Otherwise known as heartburn.

81
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:51,115
>> [LAUGH] That's it.

82
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:51,908
That's cool.

83
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:53,707
That's so, I can just change, it.

84
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:54,468
>> No, no, no, no, no.

85
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:55,285
It's not cool.

86
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:57,102
It's not great.

87
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,284
>> Why, do I have a tumor or something?

88
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:01,290
>> No, you don't have a tumor.

89
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,766
But you're obese.

90
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:07,108
It's a very serious risk factor for high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes.

91
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,893
>> Please be candid.

92
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,187
>> You smoke.

93
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:13,612
>> I'll have the occasional pack a day or so.

94
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:16,218
Yeah. >> These are serious problems.

95
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:18,050
You've got to quit smoking.

96
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,712
You've got to go on a diet.

97
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:20,906
>> Well, that's easy.

98
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:26,743
>> Look, I didn't say that changing your life would be easy,

99
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,908
but your life does depend upon.

100
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:41,283
>> Thank you.

101
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:47,723
>> So here we see, the provider did not allow the patient to drain the swamp.

102
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,249
Did not allow the patient to express his fears.

103
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,838
Did not reflect with any empathy.

104
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:54,901
The struggles of this patient.

105
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:58,588
And I'm sure you can guess the likelihood that this patient

106
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:00,735
will make the changes is very low.

107
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:05,666
In particular, it's low because the doc used language like you must you should and

108
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,791
you have to controlling language.

109
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,702
When you use controlling language, you create reactant.

110
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:18,140
We'll return to that in a slider two but let's revisit one exchange in particular.

111
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,019
The patient responded to the litany of changes with a slightly sarcastic, well,

112
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,840
that will be easy.

113
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
How did the doc respond?

114
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,336
Well, what he said was I didn't say it would be easy in

115
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,450
motivational interviewing.

116
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,640
We code that response as argument.

117
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,940
What would have been a better way for the provider to have responded?

118
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,034
Well, probably he should have made his best guess for

119
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:49,231
what is driving that statement and a good reflective response would have

120
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:54,340
been something like you're scared that this will be really difficult.

121
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,090
This feels overwhelming.

122
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,674
That would have been a more empathetic,

123
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:03,540
more productive response than I never said it would be easy.

124
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,140
Let's take a look at this goofy comic for a second.

125
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,914
We have to understand that in public health and in primary care medicine,

126
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:17,688
we are generally telling the person what you're currently doing might be

127
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:22,240
more pleasurable, but it's causing you harm.

128
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,231
We've been called the antibiotic police.

129
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:27,915
No more sex, drugs or rocky road if it feels good, stop it or

130
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,540
at best moderate it.

131
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,740
This is a bitter pill for many patients to swallow.

132
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,240
They don't wanna be told you have to give up your pleasures.

133
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,448
That's an underlying source of resistance.

134
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:43,272
I'm not sure I want to do this and I'm not sure I can do this.

135
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:48,293
Now let's talk about resistance from a slightly different perspective.

136
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:54,390
There are three primary drivers of resistance, dread, depletion and fear.

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,654
What do we mean?

138
00:07:55,654 --> 00:08:00,496
Let's start with dread, when you explain to a patient that quitting smoking would

139
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:04,922
be good for them or losing weight or exercising or taking their medication,

140
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:09,158
when they are dreading that change, it's going to elicit resistance.

141
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:10,800
What do you mean dread?

142
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,960
I've quit smoking before, that was miserable, withdrawal effects.

143
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,461
I tried exercising before.

144
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,070
I just felt pain, I didn't get into that runner's high.

145
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,789
I've tried salad before and boy, is that not filling,

146
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:26,541
the anticipation of negative consequences elicits resistance in part

147
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:30,740
because they're dreading the process of change.

148
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,340
Number two, depletion.

149
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,593
We'll talk about this more in a few slides from now, but we have to

150
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:41,539
establish what they're really saying is I'm not sure I have the energy to do this.

151
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,970
This is a big ask.

152
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,715
You're asking me to overhaul my life to change what I eat my exercise,

153
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,540
how I handle stress.

154
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,340
I'm not sure I have the energy to cope with this now.

155
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,340
And finally, fear.

156
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,060
It could be fear of life without this coping mechanism.

157
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,940
That might be how they're gonna handle stress without alcohol or cigarettes.

158
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,340
I'm not gonna handle stress without food.

159
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,440
How am I gonna handle life with this new person that you're asking me to be.

160
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,170
Now, of course there are other sources of resistance, but

161
