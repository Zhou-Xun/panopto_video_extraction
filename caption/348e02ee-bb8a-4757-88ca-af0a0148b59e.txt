1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:15,420
So I do think that there are some solutions in terms of like thank you personally.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:27,770
I really do try to talk about type ways that we're just is just like, wow, yeah.

3
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,420
So do you do this investigation about yea, yea, yea.

4
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,750
That's that's crazy. That's something people are looking for like during that.

5
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:47,909
So yeah, it's really long hair guy, but that's okay.

6
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:57,120
So today we're lucky enough to have Laura Bauman here to talk about outbreak investigations and what it's like on the ground level.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:06,540
She expressed how she'd be very interested and happy to talk about what it was like to what it is like to deal with the COVID pandemic.

8
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,290
This lecture, she's going to talk more about foodborne illness,

9
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:19,079
which I think is probably the bread and butter of what you're doing or what the most important outbreaks that occur these days.

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,350
Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,240
So Bora Bauman is a graduate of our program,

12
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,080
and she's been working for over 20 years for the Washtenaw County Public Health Department as the lead immunologist.

13
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,470
And so that was great.

14
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,130
Thank you so much and thank thank you so much for inviting me.

15
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,629
It's great to be here.

16
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:52,890
And I just I just want to say I am so happy to see all of you sitting here in this class, interested in this topic and wanting to learn this work.

17
00:01:53,070 --> 00:02:01,020
Because I can tell you from being on the front lines of local health departments, we are tired, we are very, very tired.

18
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:10,919
And we really need all of you who are coming through school and are excited to do this work to come join us, give us some more energy.

19
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,479
Again, I'm busy training three new epidemiologists right now and I'm so happy they've joined me because again,

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,260
I just I've been doing this work for over 20 years. It's fascinating.

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,839
It's great work. It's but we need the next generation to come forward and do this work.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,100
And, you know, health departments during the pandemic have just been decimated by, you know, people being tired.

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,210
Our our lead public health nurses at the health department have retired.

24
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:45,420
So we're just again, we're just training up the next generation to do this work.

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:54,360
And it's really important work. It's interesting. And so think thank you, all of you, for being here and for paying, you know,

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,219
just kind of starting to think about like, hey, is this something I might want to do?

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,100
Is this what does this look like? What would it be like to work at a local health department?

28
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,120
And so, as Dr. Eisenberg said, I sat in these very seats, although they weren't as nice when I was here.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,120
You all are fortunate in that speech.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:27,089
Had a big renovation after I graduated. And so but yeah, this, you know, my time here at the school, public health served me well, you know,

31
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:33,120
taking this course and taking other courses that really focused on local health departments.

32
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,970
My background is in nursing as well.

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,260
I don't practice as a nurse anymore, but I worked as a public health nurse and then now that I've been an epidemiologist over 20 years,

34
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,959
that's really kind of where most of my you know,

35
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:54,090
most of my skill my skill set is I tell my friends that I graduated from nursing school with, which is even more years ago than I was here.

36
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,470
Like if they put me back in the ICU at the hospital, that would be really scary.

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,979
Like I could work with the, you know, infection control folks at the hospital.

38
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,430
But, you know, me caring for patients in the ICU, that's not, you know, not a good thing.

39
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,030
So I am very happy being an epidemiologist.

40
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,739
And I just, you know, here today, first of all,

41
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:24,360
I'm going to walk you through what kind of a a typical foodborne outbreak looks like, how it unfolds, what we do, how that happens.

42
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,680
And fortunately, we don't see these that often, maybe a couple of times a year,

43
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,650
especially these big ones, which is good because we're busy with lots of other things.

44
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,379
I don't know, you know, what Dr. Eisenberg has covered, but, you know, here in Michigan and really across the United States,

45
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,560
there are about 80 reportable, 80 ish, reportable diseases that have to come to the health department.

46
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:55,920
So everything from gonorrhea, chlamydia, of course, COVID 19 injured us monkeypox.

47
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,650
Salmonella. Pertussis. All of those diseases come into us in the health department.

48
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:12,190
And I'm I'm in charge of all of them. So so, yeah, there's just a whole range of different ones that we have to follow up on at the Health Department.

49
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:19,419
And I worked with a huge team, an amazing team of other epidemiologists, public health nurses,

50
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,480
health educators, communication specialists, because there's no way you can do this work alone.

51
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,570
So, um, and I definitely welcome questions as we go.

52
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,290
So if you have a question just in the middle of it you like Laura, what about this?

53
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,090
Please just raise your hand because it's very it's good to, you know, to be as interactive as possible.

54
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,629
And I just oh, I wanted to check to kind of people in the back. Hear me?

55
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:50,650
Am I speaking loud enough? Okay. Because Dr. Eisenberg said sometimes he uses a mic, but usually I'm loud enough.

56
00:05:50,650 --> 00:06:00,220
So so as I said, this outbreak I'm going to walk you through happened over a decade ago.

57
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,170
And I always thought like, oh, I'll remember the details of this outbreak for a long time.

58
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:11,170
It was very memorable for a number of reasons. But this morning I was reviewing my slides again.

59
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,080
You know, I've given kind of talk on this outbreak a number of times,

60
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,409
but my brain has been kind of overcome by keeping track of 100,000 COVID cases over the past couple of years.

61
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:30,459
So I had to just go through it again because yeah, this there's been a lot happening at the Health Department in the past couple years.

62
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,460
So let's let's talk about this this outbreak and then we can talk.

63
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,960
I'd be happy to talk a bit more about what it's been like being in the hospital, in the front lines in the health department who recently.

64
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,310
So so food borne illness. So this.

65
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,460
You know, a lot of people get foodborne illness. And, you know, it's this these are statistics from before the pandemic.

66
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,579
I haven't updated them. And what's just a little side note, what's interesting is that, you know,

67
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,300
the first year of the pandemic in 2020, because of the lockdowns, people weren't going out to eat as much.

68
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:17,519
People weren't traveling as much. We actually saw a pretty big decrease in our reports of campylobacter, salmonella, everything else.

69
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,940
Because because, again, people just people weren't interacting, having big weddings, big parties.

70
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,950
But certainly we are back to kind of as a as a nation, as a human species.

71
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,849
We are social creatures. We want to eat together, we want to gather.

72
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,990
And so we are back to having a lot of our food borne diseases reported to us yet again.

73
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,710
Certainly, foodborne illness can lead to hospitalization.

74
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:55,920
And of course, the you know, the one we worry about the most, of course, is people dying from foodborne illness and, you know, huge economic cost.

75
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:05,640
Two foodborne illness. So let's talk about how how we do outbreaks here in Washington County.

76
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:14,280
So again, like I said, it's a team approach. I've been the lead for the outbreak team for Washtenaw County for again about 20 years.

77
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,690
And I co-lead that with Kristen Hofer, who's our environmental health director, and she's also a graduate of this program the year after me.

78
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:33,989
So and so the two of us, you know, kind of tag team on the different aspects of of outbreak outbreak work and but in addition,

79
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,340
we're really lucky and it's really it's a different kind of model that we have here

80
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,559
in Washtenaw County because we have a long standing relationship here on campus,

81
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,290
on U of M campus with the Environmental, Health and Safety folks on campus.

82
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,150
We've essentially deputized them to be part of our health department.

83
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,230
So some of you may have gotten a call from them from COVID.

84
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,200
They are part of our Koven team. They if there's an outbreak on campus, we work closely with them.

85
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,580
They're part of our outbreak team. We just our health department could not handle.

86
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,420
You know, Washtenaw County has about 370,000 people.

87
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,860
So that's kind of who I'm keeping track of is the Washtenaw County epidemiologist.

88
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,749
And, you know, U of M campus is another 50,000 kind of on top of that.

89
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,980
And it's you know, you guys have a complex campus, a lot going on.

90
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:34,290
And so we are so grateful for our colleagues on campus that work hand-in-hand with us on anything that's campus related, which is great.

91
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:40,680
And then again, I don't know many of all of you are from Michigan, the state of Michigan.

92
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,309
Probably not. I know many of you may be from across the country.

93
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,000
And public health is organized in different ways of different states.

94
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,680
But in Michigan, we have something that's called local rule.

95
00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:02,070
So basically the county, we are the ones in charge of our people, so and so.

96
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,520
And for instance, if the state health department says, hey, Washtenaw County, what's going on down there, we can tell them.

97
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:15,419
But if they say, hey, we want to send some people down to like take over what you're doing, we're like, No, no, it's it's our county.

98
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,220
You you have to be invited. So that's that's how and the same with the CDC.

99
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,730
The CDC can't just come in and say, Hey, Washtenaw County, what's going on there?

100
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,270
We're sending a team to your to your county and we'll say, Oh, well, thank you very much.

101
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,890
We might say, yes, we'd love your help. Please come. Or we might say, hold on, we're we're taking care of it ourselves or we're not ready for you or.

102
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,610
But again, that varies by state. And for instance, the state of Minnesota, if you're from Minnesota,

103
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,840
you don't have local health departments like that and you just have state branches, local branches of the state health department.

104
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,860
So it's just organized in a different way.

105
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:03,990
So I just I just say that just because every every state is kind of organized a bit differently and and that might, you know, affect, you know,

106
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:11,910
if you go into a health department practice after you graduate, it could it could affect where you where you work and kind of how you work.

107
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,340
So let's let's get going in just talking about what happened in this particular outbreak.

108
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,520
So. So, again, this is back in 2010 was in the spring.

109
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,799
April 15th. And this is this is how things typically start.

110
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,910
We get phone calls. And I have to say, I'm grateful this was a Thursday and not a Friday,

111
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:37,660
because many times we joke in public health about we get the call at 3:00 on Friday and then we're like, there goes our weekend.

112
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,010
There goes, you know, anything we were planning otherwise, but we had a little bit of time to kind of get started on this one.

113
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:50,879
But so we got a call from the emergency room at U of M and also university health services here on campus.

114
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,800
Again, who we work with so closely, so grateful for that relationship.

115
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,510
And we've got bloody diarrhea and young adults, mostly U of M students.

116
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:07,020
So and another thing I just want to mention is that U of M students, you all get involved in a lot of our outbreaks.

117
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,799
So if you haven't been involved in an outbreak yet, consider yourself lucky.

118
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,080
But it may be coming to you soon. Who knows? Who knows?

119
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,810
I don't know. So we'll see. But you know, it's just how how things tend to roll.

120
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,700
So, yeah, bloody diarrhea is not much fun for anybody.

121
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,820
So in the way this happens many times as these students who are sick, we're talking to each other.

122
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,299
And again, keep in mind, though, I think this is 2010.

123
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,060
And so this is I mean, texting is a thing back then, but we don't have a lot of social media yet.

124
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:46,510
So this is you know, we're kind of in a different landscape than what would happen now a bit from in terms of how this might roll out.

125
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,639
But and but they, you know,

126
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,959
we're talking to each other because many of them were from the same graduate school and they discovered they'd all eaten at the same restaurant.

127
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,760
We're just going to call it Restaurant P and and it was after U of M law school luncheon.

128
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,969
So again, these law students are chatting, saying, hey, did you get sick after we had that lunch?

129
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,480
Oh, yeah.

130
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:19,450
So then and again, this is super helpful for somebody to pick up the phone and call us and just it gives us an incredible like heads up on things.

131
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,099
So our Environmental Health Department went out to a restaurant for an investigation.

132
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,290
So I just want to stop here for a second and say,

133
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:36,670
how many of you know that all of the restaurants in Washtenaw County are inspected twice a year by our sanatoriums over at Environmental Health?

134
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,290
People know that. Twice a year. So that's it.

135
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,180
So that's just in there. And they have an assignment.

136
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:52,250
So, like, you know, I might be the one assigned to, you know, all the McDonald's in the county, or I might be assigned to all that, you know?

137
00:13:52,520 --> 00:14:01,309
I mean, everybody has you know, we have a team of I think we have five or six sanatoriums and we have I and I don't know what the

138
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,900
count is because it changed during the pandemic of how many restaurants we have in Washtenaw County.

139
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,890
And it's not just the restaurants, it's the temporary food kind of booths set at at events.

140
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:19,490
It's the certainly the food like at U of M football stadium that that investigation is done by the folks here on campus,

141
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:27,710
the UV sanatoriums here on campus. And again, the idea is just like, let's make sure that all of these restaurants are following, you know,

142
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,979
the guidelines, you know, the appropriate practices that we don't have big, big outbreaks happening.

143
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:41,660
And so and so that's our sanatorium who was assigned to Restaurant P headed over there to see what was going on.

144
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:50,290
So and this is what he found, that they had numerous violations, you know,

145
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,169
and again, they get restaurants, get two kind of routine inspections per year,

146
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,100
but then they get special ones like this where you just jump in, you're like, hello,

147
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,390
we're here where the health department, we're going to talk to you about what's going on so you can see.

148
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,489
So we go down this list. They weren't holding their food in the walk in cooler.

149
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,660
It was at the right temperature. That was that's too very much too high.

150
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,640
They weren't cooking things to the right temperature. They weren't holding them at the right temperature.

151
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,430
There was cross-contamination in the walk in cooler. So that I don't remember what that was exactly.

152
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,450
I don't know if it was like the chicken was being kept over the lettuce, which was dripping.

153
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:34,009
And, you know, I mean, again, you have there's ways to, you know, keep your food so that you're not basically contaminating,

154
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,079
ready to eat foods like any of your produce because it's not going to get cooked.

155
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,100
Right. And it's with other things like meat, which typically does get cooked.

156
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,910
They weren't cooling down their black beans the right way.

157
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,170
That just there was all kinds of things going on in this restaurant.

158
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,060
And the p I see we use, of course, lots of acronyms of public health, as many people do.

159
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,320
That's the person in charge. I think they did not know all of what they were supposed to be knowing.

160
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,100
The person in charge is the one who like should know. Like, what are your temperatures supposed to be?

161
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,620
How are you supposed to be doing this person who again,

162
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,830
this was a surprise visit because our sanatorium just showed up and said, I'm here to check things out.

163
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,930
And that person who was left in charge of this restaurant had no idea what was going on.

164
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:29,629
So corrective actions were taken on site. Let's talk about what those were are sanatorium said everything in this walk in

165
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,030
cooler has to be thrown out because it was not kept at the right temperature.

166
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,330
You know, it could already be growing different bacteria. It could be.

167
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,740
And we've you know, we've had a complaint that a lot of people that ate at this restaurant are now sick.

168
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,390
So imagine you're, you know, a restaurant and we're you know, the health department comes in, we're like,

169
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,250
you know, these walking coolers could be big with a lot of food, like, okay, everything's got to go.

170
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,110
They were not happy about that.

171
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:02,180
And not only that, our sanatorium was one of our sanatoriums who's been around the block a little bit and knew that after they told them this,

172
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,960
they needed to go out back and watch to make sure they weren't trying to go back into the dumpster and take the food back out.

173
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,220
Because that happens, too, because they don't want to throw away all that food, right?

174
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,270
So they're like, Oh yeah, health department, yeah, we'll go put it over here.

175
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,490
And then they're like, Oh, they're not watching anymore. Take it. The dumpster put it back in the refrigerator.

176
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,520
So. But you guys, when are you eating lunch? Just yet. And you're like, okay, now, just maybe you've already eaten.

177
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,919
That would be good. But anyway, so yeah.

178
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,440
So that so yeah. In this case, I'm trying to remember if this is one of the ones where they really,

179
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,150
they tried to take the food back out, but our sanatorium was right there like, no, no, no, no.

180
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,920
But before he had them throw it all away, we took a bunch of samples to see like,

181
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:56,240
are we are we going to find out where potentially this all these people got sick?

182
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,720
So you can see the whole range of foods that our sanatorium took samples of.

183
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,320
And then these are going to head up to our state public health lab in Lansing for testing.

184
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,400
So, again, lots of lots of options here for what could be going on.

185
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,410
So here we are on day two. So that was that was day one.

186
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,989
All of that that was happening. Just like we got the call. We got people sick.

187
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,930
We sent our sanatorium to the restaurant. He found out, oh, my God, there's all these problems at the restaurant.

188
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:39,740
So now we're on the next day and first thing in the morning, we've got to start notifying people because this could be bigger than just us.

189
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,700
So we've let people know at the state.

190
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:52,120
And again, back, back ten years ago, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, now called DHHS, was Michigan Department of Community Health.

191
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,090
We change our names all the time. So sorry. That's confusing.

192
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,810
So that was the state health department and MDR, which is trying to think if they've changed their name, too.

193
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,520
That's our kind of the agricultural side of the state that kind of does the food regulation.

194
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,869
So I needed to let them know what was going on, brought our outbreak outbreak team together again.

195
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,529
I've talked about all the different folks that are part of that. And then what we do is we get that three day food history from people.

196
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,160
So we really want to find out, you know, what, what have they been eating?

197
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,850
But again, think about it. This is getting a three day food.

198
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:33,780
Histories from people is tough because just if I ask all of you if I just like said hey,

199
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,080
the second person in the row, like, what did you eat for dinner last night? How about three nights ago?

200
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,229
What did you eat? Did you go out with friends? Did you have any snacks?

201
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:49,890
Did you I mean, it's we it's really hard to remember what you ate and to really kind of think through where you were.

202
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,290
I mean, we have our our folks who do this work have lots of tricks.

203
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,710
They're like, hey, pull out your cell phone. Did you meet a friend?

204
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:02,860
Like, look at your schedule to help prompt your memory of where you might have have gone to eat.

205
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:10,330
Think about I mean, this is just an aside, but when we have to do hepatitis A outbreaks or hepatitis A follow up,

206
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:16,450
the incubation for hepatitis A is typically more in the 3 to 4 weeks range.

207
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,530
And so we don't hear about the case until somebody is like was exposed three or four weeks ago.

208
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:29,559
So again, imagine us coming to us, the health department saying, okay, we need to talk about what you were eating a month ago and where did you go?

209
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,110
And you're like, oh, yeah, right, right. So it just, you know, these are these are really challenging.

210
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:42,520
The other thing that happened on Friday and again, this is this is how things go down in the field,

211
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,550
just like I was telling you kind of what happened a bit at the restaurant.

212
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,170
So we heard about like back to this law school luncheon.

213
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,290
Right. We knew some of the law schools, law school students were sick.

214
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,880
They had this big burrito luncheon on April 8th.

215
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:04,660
And we got rumor that maybe there were some leftover burritos from this luncheon.

216
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:14,860
Again, it's a little bit it's a little sus, as my 13 year old daughter would say, that this is now April 16.

217
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,130
And this lot this luncheon was from the eighth.

218
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,079
So just a show of hands. Who wants to eat a burrito?

219
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,140
That's more than a week old? Not me, no.

220
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:34,000
But anyway, so the sanatorium here on campus, Dave, is his name is still he's still working with y'all.

221
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,810
He's awesome.

222
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:42,670
He calls up the people who are in charge of this lunch and they're like, Hey, any chance you got some of those burritos left in your fridge?

223
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:49,000
And turns out they had just thrown them away the day before the burrito.

224
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,230
So good for them, right? We don't want to be eating like, you know, week old burritos.

225
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,400
But Dave was undeterred. He's like, Where did you throw them away?

226
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,810
They're like, Oh, you're on the dumpster outside of my apartment building.

227
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,300
So he went dumpster diving and he found them. He found those eight day old burritos.

228
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,800
And that's I'm just saying, this is this is where, you know, you go above and beyond and public health.

229
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:18,070
So because, you know, not only that, we have some of the food that was at the restaurant,

230
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,850
you know, they took all those samples before it all all the food got thrown away.

231
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:29,200
But we also have the burritos of three of the burritos that were actually eaten at that luncheon,

232
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,780
although, again, a little bit concerning that they're now over a week old.

233
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,809
Okay. So then here we are again. We're just on day two of this outbreak.

234
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:48,490
And, you know, again, as as the epidemiologist, as the outbreak team working on these, you're like, okay, what's our organism?

235
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:53,560
What are what are we dealing with? Because that directs your incubation period.

236
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,690
What how long somebody might be infectious and has all these implications.

237
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:05,680
And I'm sure Dr. Eisenberg has been working with you on, again, all these different pathogens and that they all behave quite differently.

238
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,030
What was contaminated, what you know, what was it? Was it it just a one time thing or do we have a bigger issue?

239
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,620
What you know, what is it that's going on? And again, is there ongoing transmission?

240
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,890
Is whatever. The bad actor, whatever, the bad food or whatever is going on, is it still out there?

241
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,450
And are we going to still see and get more people coming in sick?

242
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,190
And again, how many other people were affected? Like what? You know, what's going on now?

243
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:44,140
And again, this is where and I think we gonna talk about it more as we as this outbreak unfolds that you know for someone we know that for every

244
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:54,250
reported case of salmonella campylobacter e coli any of our foodborne for everyone that actually gets reported to public health.

245
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:02,300
There's typically another 510 cases out there that we don't know about that don't that doesn't get reported to us.

246
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,840
And here's partly why. So.

247
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:13,760
The things that have to happen for these to get reported to us is somebody has to be feeling sick enough to actually go to the doctor.

248
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:19,150
They have to not just be like, Oh, I'm just feeling kind of black for a day or two, have a bit of diarrhea.

249
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:25,390
I'm doing better now. They have to feel sick enough to be like, Oh, I better go to the clinic.

250
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:32,049
And then they go to the clinic and the and the physician and the P.A., the nurse practitioner has to say, oh,

251
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:38,470
yeah, I think you've got not just say, yeah, I think you have food poisoning, which okay, that's a start.

252
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,920
But that doesn't help us in public health for somebody to just say, oh, you've got food poisoning.

253
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,870
We I need the poop. I need to actually know what the pathogen is.

254
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,999
And so somebody has to be willing then to poop in a cup. They just we can't guess what it is.

255
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,250
You can't just look at somebody and say, oh, I think you got, you know, norovirus.

256
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,240
I think you've got, you know, whatever that thing is, you have to actually test for it.

257
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,340
So so yeah. So somebody has to feel sick enough to get up. Go to the doctor.

258
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,150
The doctor has to actually say, yep, let's test you for it.

259
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:14,040
The person has to be willing to poop in the cup, then the result has to then come to the health department.

260
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,920
So a lot of things have to happen for us to even get these reports.

261
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:28,709
So. So, but here we are already 16 cases on our second day of this outbreak because we're hearing and and right now,

262
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,430
we just have kind of a a working like a working case definition.

263
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,440
I think your lecture on Monday,

264
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,709
you heard about case definitions and how important they are as you kind of figure out who is in the outbreak and who's not in the outbreak.

265
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,530
And you kind of try to get the scope of it and figure out what's going on.

266
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:51,180
So our our working case definition at this point is that you had to have eaten at restaurant P or had Mexican food.

267
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,190
We were kind of thinking, again, burritos, you know, other things and had diarrhea afterwards.

268
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,830
So that's a pretty at this point, that's a pretty broad definition, you know.

269
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,930
But again, we're trying to see what's going on.

270
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,080
And at this point, we've got six Shiga toxin positive cases and we have one person in the hospital.

271
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:20,820
And again, I want to say, these are this is happening mostly on U of M campus with folks about your age who are largely healthy people.

272
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,690
But we already have one person going to the hospital. So this is you know, this is worrisome.

273
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,860
I mean, this is where we are concerned about what's going on.

274
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:36,450
So let's just talk a little bit for a minute about Shiga toxin E coli, also known affectionately as STEC.

275
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,770
It's much quicker to say when we're in the middle of an outbreak not to have to say all those other words.

276
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,570
So it makes these entero toxins, shiga toxin one,

277
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:54,389
shiga toxin two and Shiga toxin two in particular is linked to more severe illness, including another acronym, H.

278
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:59,430
U.S., which is hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is essentially shut your kidneys down.

279
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:09,540
That is why when particularly when children have stec, when they get diagnosed with Stec, they're not given antibiotics.

280
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,720
It's I mean, this shiga toxin equalized bacteria.

281
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:19,290
But when you do not and for pediatric cases and for adults as well, you do not want to give them antibiotics.

282
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:25,259
And part of the reason why is if you give them antibiotics at lysis the walls of the

283
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,260
bacteria all at once and all of that toxin flows into their system like a big bolus,

284
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,979
like a big hit and that. And then we've got kids on dialysis.

285
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:44,430
It is not and it's really scary. So h you asked is one of the severe outcomes that we watch for with Shiga toxin e coli?

286
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:50,280
And typically, again, you're going to see not everybody has bloody diarrhea, but it's pretty it's pretty stark.

287
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,999
You're sitting on a toilet and you look and you're like, that's just not poop.

288
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,850
That's blood. I mean, it's not. Yeah. And that's again, that toxin working on your GI tract.

289
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,610
Again, this is where it's it's like I was saying, really, it's really important to know which pathogen you're dealing with.

290
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,290
So the incubation period for STEC is 2 to 10 days, most often 3 to 4.

291
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,890
So again, it just kind of helps you think about, you know, when you're looking for, you know,

292
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,250
where somebody got exposed, what's going on that helps really frame your interview and what you're looking at.

293
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:31,150
All right. So as I said before, sometimes we do have to work weekends in these outbreaks situations.

294
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,530
Again, just an aside. During the pandemic, I worked for two years straight, seven days a week.

295
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,710
So this so I'm like, Oh yeah.

296
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:50,510
Back in the old days when I only had to work an occasional weekend. So again, this is this is where this is how public health works.

297
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,110
We needed to get the stool samples.

298
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:01,880
The other the other thing I can tell you is so the same sanatorium who works here on campus who went dumpster diving for the burritos,

299
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:11,030
we found out some of those law school students who eaten at the April 8th luncheon had had diarrhea.

300
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,460
But they and but they hadn't gone to UHC yet.

301
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,900
We had to give a sample because they were too busy studying for finals.

302
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,720
So and one person actually told us he's like, No, I've just been sitting on the toilet with my law school books.

303
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,920
We're like, All right. So we're like, How about if we bring the stool kit to you?

304
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:40,200
He's like, Oh, okay. So Dave, my friend Dave here on campus, he's so great.

305
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,070
He's like, it's like, okay, I'm showing up at your apartment at 4:00 on Friday with the little stool cat,

306
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,640
with the little hat that you poop into in the little cup and all this stuff.

307
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:55,340
So and it was like and we typically deliver these in paper bags, like paper grocery bags.

308
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:02,960
So it kind of maybe looks like some other kind of deal is going down, like we pass the paper grocery bag over to them out of our trunk, the car.

309
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:14,180
So yeah. So Dave, on, on Friday afternoon I think had either two or three of the law school students give him samples.

310
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,810
And so then we needed to get those up to the state health department so they could start working on those.

311
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:29,179
And at our health department we have a courier that goes from our health department to the state lab in Lansing three days a week,

312
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:37,520
but it does not go on the weekends. So our nursing director at the time, she happened to be going to a baby shower in Lansing on the weekend.

313
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,680
She's like, Oh, I'll take the stool samples up to the state lab. So yeah, this is just how things get done.

314
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:49,430
So she's, you know, so again, we're passing the paper bags from Dave's car to Jane's car and she drove them up to the state lab.

315
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:58,459
And over the weekend we got five more cases reported into our on call nurse from this outbreak.

316
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,660
But then it started getting even more interesting and at the same restaurant.

317
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,320
P It's a small chain, East Lansing.

318
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,400
They had somebody who ate there and got sick.

319
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,470
So we're like, Hoopoe.

320
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:21,320
This looks like it might not be just this one restaurant in Ann Arbor had some bad practices and led to a bunch of people getting sick.

321
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:31,469
All right. So now so this is this is a, you know, something that happens, you know, as all of this is going on and like I said,

322
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:37,049
remember this, this is occurring in the time before all the kind of social media and everything else.

323
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:41,580
So some of our typical ways that we communicate and we continue to now,

324
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:48,300
but we have many channels for communicating with the public as through press releases, you know, putting out a press release.

325
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:54,750
You know, I also send out notifications to through my epi updates to our hospitals,

326
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,230
our doctors, our schools, other folks to let them know what's going on.

327
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:04,590
But in this situation, we were in the middle of this outbreak.

328
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,399
We're trying to figure out what's going on. You know, we have all these kind of questions.

329
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
We know we need to let the public know what's happening.

330
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,620
But one of the things is, do we name or not name the restaurant? Is it fair to say?

331
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,580
You know, because I can tell you from doing this work for over 20 years,

332
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:29,160
if you name a restaurant in relation to a foodborne outbreak that can sometimes bankrupt a restaurant, it's a it's a real it's a real thing.

333
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:38,610
It's you know, and so we don't we don't take it lightly. We really have to have reason to think that there's ongoing transmission at that restaurant.

334
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,659
And by naming it, it's going to help prevent more illness.

335
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,100
Again, this is all about containment prevention, like trying to.

336
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,579
So, you know, we have to think like, yeah,

337
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:58,760
with and let's say we have a restaurant that's not being cooperative that that in fact, you know, let's say, you know,

338
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,089
went back and like pulled that food out of the dumpster and we know they're serving it again or,

339
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,579
you know, I mean, we can we also have the ability to shut them down.

340
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,130
But but, you know, again, it just you know, we really if if the restaurant's cooperating with us,

341
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,440
we tend you know, we we do our best not to name them, but sometimes we have to.

342
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,120
This is a restaurant that had high volume, lots of people coming through.

343
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,780
We also thought, you know, we need to find out how big this thing is,

344
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,429
how many people are out there who are like that one law student who are just sitting on the toilet

345
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,719
with books in their lap that we don't know about yet because we're still trying to figure out like,

346
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,350
what's the scope of this thing, how many people are actually sick?

347
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:44,280
And like I said, I sent out an email alert to all of our health care providers saying, please, please test people.

348
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,850
Don't just say, Oh, yeah, you got a little touch of food poisoning.

349
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,240
No, no, no, no, no, no. Test them. Give them a stool kit.

350
00:33:51,240 --> 00:34:00,209
We need to know, actually what it is. And so then we did put out a press release on Monday and we did not at that point,

351
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:07,590
we did not name the restaurant because it was really helpful over the weekend because that other

352
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,370
branch of the same restaurant had a case that made us start thinking about It's not necessary,

353
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:24,450
and I hate to say it exactly like this, meaning the restaurants fault, but it makes you think something is coming into the restaurant,

354
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,939
a distributed product is coming into the restaurant, and so it's bigger than the restaurant.

355
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,680
And so that's that's part of our thinking and that we did not name the restaurant.

356
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,600
But again, we wanted people to be aware, the public to be aware.

357
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:47,070
We wanted our our provider, our, our health care system to be aware so that they would be testing appropriately and reporting to us.

358
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:56,579
So here we are on Monday, we also sent out a horn, another three letter acronym, which stands for Health Alert Network.

359
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,990
This is the the reporting system within the state of Michigan.

360
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,690
Most most states have this. This is an alert that goes out to all the health departments across Michigan,

361
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,829
because now we have a case in East Lansing, we've got cases in Ann Arbor is in other places, too.

362
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,810
So again, letting our other health department partners know what's going on and.

363
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:27,940
And then we again talked about was is it some food item that comes that specific to burritos?

364
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,910
Because almost everybody reported not just restaurant pier, but other Mexican restaurants in the area.

365
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,390
You know, people ate burritos as we were doing those three day food histories, trying to figure out what,

366
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:47,110
you know, what might be in burritos that could, you know, be causing all this trouble.

367
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:54,670
But we knew certainly the folks that were at that April 8th luncheon, Mexican lunch at the law school, that a number of them were ill.

368
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:05,860
So we sent them a SurveyMonkey link and to kind of get a sense of like, hey, if you were if you didn't get sick, why did you eat?

369
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,100
If you did get sick, why don't you eat at the luncheon?

370
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,610
And and again, that's the case control study.

371
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:17,620
I think you've kind of you've heard about that already, which is, you know, really helpful to see, you know,

372
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:25,710
what's the difference between the people who didn't eat the suspected bad actor and who and who did?

373
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,740
And so we got ten responses, I think trying to remember.

374
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,550
I want to say there were at least 40 or 50 people at that luncheon.

375
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:38,170
So it was not a great response. But again, we're it's April 19th.

376
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:46,900
We're we're in finals time. Most students are just like, nope, not interested, don't want to talk to, you know, they're busy studying.

377
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,940
I get it. I totally get it. But ten people did respond, which was super helpful.

378
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,139
And what came up from that and doing just some you know,

379
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:01,930
our initial analysis is both lettuce and cilantro were the most frequent items eaten by the people who were sick.

380
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,230
So that kind of like stood out to us.

381
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:16,179
And so we put together another kind of survey again, just based on, you know, the, the menu at this restaurant.

382
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:23,379
P And you know, again, just specifically trying to drill down into getting down to the ingredient level.

383
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:29,530
Like what what did they cause? Because again, we all know you go into, you know, the different Mexican type restaurants.

384
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,979
You can, you know, typically put what you want to do on your burrito.

385
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,750
Right? You can, you know, customize it for yourself for the whole bit.

386
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,720
So we really wanted to see what what people had eaten.

387
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,050
And again, we had people eating at multiple restaurants.

388
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,860
Okay. So that's where we are so far, this outbreak.

389
00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:01,149
Most people ate burritos, but more than one Mexican style restaurant had been named in the food histories to restaurants of this chain.

390
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:08,650
Restaurant P have been named in the food histories. And we're looking for something that might be unique to burritos or to Mexican cuisine.

391
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:19,600
And we're thinking maybe cilantro, because that certainly is something that shows up more in kind of Mexican style cuisine then,

392
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,230
you know, some of our other types of food.

393
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,180
So that's kind of, you know, again, you're kind of always thinking, what's your hypothesis?

394
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:35,409
What what could be going on? Now we're on Tuesday, so we're about four days, four days into this situation.

395
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,190
And our working case definitions have gotten a little more precise.

396
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,339
So, again, this is where, you know, you keep refining.

397
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,770
You know, we started with basically anybody who'd eaten a burrito in the past week and got diarrhea.

398
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:53,140
Like that was the first that's where we started. And now we're now we're, you know, getting it more refined.

399
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:02,740
Basically, if you've actually got Shiga toxin E coli and you've been exposed to restaurant P, we are sure you are in this outbreak.

400
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,700
So that's like this is that's why you're a confirmed case in the outbreak.

401
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,030
So that was, you know, again, how we kind of thought through this.

402
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:17,070
We're like if you have if you got diarrhea and you have symptoms consistent with Stec and you went to Restaurant P,

403
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:26,349
we think probably you're a probable and if you have symptoms consistent with Stec and your exposure to other Mexican style foods at this point,

404
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,410
we're going to put you kind of in that suspected suspect group.

405
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:37,690
So at this point, again, we're at, you know, 2020 for individuals who are part potentially part of this outbreak.

406
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,870
In. And always epic curves.

407
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,259
Always a good thing to have to look at where what's going on.

408
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,720
And so you can see where, you know,

409
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:56,639
you see the where the the the luncheon happened at the the law school on the eighth and then this and these are bye onset again.

410
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,030
So these when people started getting sick so like that first one on the 9th of April is pretty fast.

411
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:08,100
But that's, you know, it's still within range of what could happen with Shiga toxin E coli.

412
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:16,499
And then you see, you know, once we went to restaurant P and R, the cases started falling off after that.

413
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,129
So, you know, again, that's that's why, you know, we weren't trying to be mean to this restaurant.

414
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:30,600
And we said, you have to throw away all this food that, you know, that helps us really save what sometimes, you know,

415
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:36,480
can be really, really an effective intervention right then as we were trying to figure out what was going on.

416
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,020
And these are just symptoms of what we were seeing.

417
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:49,500
Again, this is where, you know, I've been doing this work, like I said, for 20 plus years.

418
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:57,090
And and, you know, there's not that many of our pathogens where you get 80% of the people in the outbreak have bloody

419
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:02,040
stools that just it's pretty it's going to be probably either Campylobacter or Shiga toxin E coli,

420
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,350
but more likely STEC.

421
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:12,780
And at the same time, if I get a call as I have a number of times from either U of M campus or our nursing homes or other places,

422
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,479
and they're like, Laura, we've got 20 people ill. 28 or ten of them are throwing up.

423
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:27,570
They've all got diarrhea. That's norovirus, because norovirus is about the only thing that I've found that where adults all throw up together,

424
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,200
unless I have to say it's after a frat party or something else.

425
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,540
But you know, in typical like for, you know, that's, you know, norovirus, you know, it turns around cruise ships.

426
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:44,879
It's so contagious. That's what we see, that kind of group group vomiting.

427
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:55,260
And these situations where you see in this one vomiting is very as a low is not that significant as part of the the symptom profile of this pathogen.

428
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,340
So again bloody stools are that's that's really what I say.

429
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,680
I know this is this is shiga toxin.

430
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:09,570
And again looking at we talked about before it again it's really important to know that you know what's going on with your pathogen,

431
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,350
the incubation, 32 hours to eight days, median of four days, very similar to what we know about Shiga toxin.

432
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,070
People were sick for, you know, up to a week.

433
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,520
And then again, these are healthy college students.

434
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,360
And and we had two people actually go to the hospital. So, again,

435
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:34,980
it's not insignificant and a lot look at how many went to the E.R. So half of these folks went to the E.R. So people were people were not doing well.

436
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:44,670
And then addition another you see another seven went to another health care provider, probably us or somewhere else.

437
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,420
And then again, like I told you, we got those stool samples in the parking lot.

438
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:56,010
You know, we went to their apartments and got them. So here we are on day eight of this outbreak.

439
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,370
And so now we're having a conference call with the state health department.

440
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:05,309
So we're we're working closely with them and we find out that it's Shiga toxin to positive.

441
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,670
That's the more severe Shiga toxin type.

442
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:15,000
And there the initial stereotyping at the state lab is E coli 0145.

443
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:26,369
So and I'll say a little bit more about that in a minute that you can see with the food was up there and that we had pulled from the restaurant,

444
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,479
everything came back negative, including the leftover burritos.

445
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:37,590
So, again, I don't I'm trying to remember now if think about, you know, those burritos were seven or eight days old.

446
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:43,620
And so maybe there was overgrowth of other bacteria, other things after 7 to 8 days.

447
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,670
So but then we still don't know about the cilantro.

448
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,020
Again, that's one of our like lettuce. And cilantro is up there on what we were thinking about.

449
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:00,300
And I'm also going to say, oh, so I don't know if you all have talked about how,

450
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,769
you know, how these big outbreaks are connected and happen in the United States.

451
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:11,130
So, you know, these samples, like I said, we had to get these all this these stool samples up to the state public health lab,

452
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:18,359
because then they do further basically the molecular epidemiology on those samples.

453
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,929
And so that's now they do whole genome sequencing, which is really amazing.

454
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:29,460
But a decade ago we weren't doing whole genome sequencing yet, but we were you do serotype your your E coli and your salmonella,

455
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,700
for example, there are over 2000 different serotypes of salmonella.

456
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,579
But for E Coli, I don't know if there's probably 20 or 30 at least.

457
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:44,760
And so that helps you really hone in on like, oh, wait, we've got these are all or one, four, five.

458
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,589
And then what the state public health labs do is they post what they're seeing in

459
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:56,100
their lab on the lab intranet for step up public health labs across the United States.

460
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,899
And then other states can say, wait a minute, we're seeing that one, too.

461
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:06,150
And that's how we start connecting across all these different states.

462
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:13,320
And because we live in a global food world, I mean, you know, I mean, I like to eat local.

463
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:20,730
Local food is great. I go to farmer's market. But at the same time, we live in a global food distribution.

464
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,620
And so it's really important to know where your food's coming from.

465
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,670
And if we have a problem that's farther, you know, ups up the chain.

466
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,629
So the other thing that happened this day is all of a sudden, like I said,

467
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:42,010
we find out Ohio is saying they've got a cluster of Shiga toxin, two positive cases on Ohio State campus.

468
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:49,840
So now all of a sudden it's getting bigger. And again, this is this is where our state labs and our state health department,

469
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,920
health departments are talking to each other and saying, wait a minute, what's going on?

470
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,840
So more lots of conference calls during these outbreaks.

471
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,870
We're having a conference call with the state folks and we start doing food traceback.

472
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:12,379
This is, again where it's really important. If you've worked in a restaurant and you you need to know where.

473
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,430
If you're serving food,

474
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:20,700
where is your food coming from that you do you always order from the same supplier or this time did you get it from some other place?

475
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,690
Because when we you know, when we have an outbreak like this, we need to know where it's coming from.

476
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,569
And so we started trace back from restaurant chain to see where everything, everything they got.

477
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,890
And again, our two things that we're really kind of looking at, the lettuce and the cilantro.

478
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,180
The lettuce came out of Sidney, Ohio, this company called Fresh Way.

479
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,910
And the cilantro, I guess, was grown in California and then distributed through Detroit.

480
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:53,870
And now Ohio's telling us not only do they have a cluster of cases like we do,

481
00:46:54,050 --> 00:47:00,800
but they're also matching our cases when they're starting to do that molecular fingerprint of the of the bacteria,

482
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,220
which really helps us, you know, again, connect to these cases.

483
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:10,940
So one of the things we learned this day is that at this point, this is, again,

484
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:17,300
a decade ago, most local labs can't actually test for what we're having an outbreak of.

485
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:29,960
So the first the most kind of famous E coli, I guess the one that, you know, first came to fame in the 1980s was E Coli, a157h7.

486
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,710
That was, you know, people think about raw, hamburger, everything else.

487
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:39,010
Many labs could test for that one. But it's it's it's a tricky bug.

488
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:48,080
And so if you have one of the Nano 157, which is what ours was, the regular lab testing wouldn't pick it up.

489
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:52,520
And so this is where, again, we've got even more trouble because somebody,

490
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,150
like I was saying earlier, might have gone to the doctor, actually pooped in the cup.

491
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:05,390
And then that lapse like, no, you're negative because they didn't have the right lab assay to actually pick up what was going on.

492
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:16,310
I'm happy to say that now, a decade later, lab lab science has come a lot farther and a lot more labs now have capacity to test for this.

493
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:21,440
But part of the reason that we picked it up here in Ann Arbor, in Washtenaw County,

494
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:31,070
is that the University of Michigan Hospital Lab, they had the right technology a decade ago to pick up this pathogen.

495
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,600
And so, you know, we probably wouldn't have picked it up otherwise.

496
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:42,739
But they again, we being this is this is where we have a really big advantage being part of a big research hospital,

497
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:49,130
university that get kind of, you know, some of the early adopters of some of the new technology.

498
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,520
And so it's, again, super helpful.

499
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,170
And this this is how we pick up a lot of things here locally is, again, we've got we just have better testing than some other people.

500
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:06,020
So then this is let me tell you how things are supposed to happen in public health.

501
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,160
So you're supposed to now that we know that Ohio State's involved.

502
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:14,069
We in Washtenaw County, we're a local health department.

503
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:22,590
We're supposed to tell the state health department in Michigan like, hey, we want to have a conference call with that county in Ohio,

504
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:26,850
because, you know, we need to figure out like, maybe we can just talk about it, figure it out together.

505
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,990
And but that's what we're supposed to do, go up through the state health department.

506
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,200
They talk to the Ohio State Health Department to talk to their local.

507
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:42,240
But our environmental health director at the time was friends with the environmental health director in that county in Ohio.

508
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:51,120
So we just made our own our own conference call. That was, again, just just telling how it's supposed to happen and what actually happened.

509
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:56,610
So but it was really helpful because we just called up Columbus and had a little chat with them.

510
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:01,890
And at that point we find out we've got to work with they have to match us into our cases.

511
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,730
But they were like, We're not talking burritos. No way.

512
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,940
This is not they had no Mexican, nothing.

513
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:15,300
So like these were all deli and wrap sandwiches. We're like, Ooh, no cilantro to be found.

514
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:20,610
But shredded lettuce was very common in these wrap sandwiches.

515
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:30,330
And could this be the smoking gun? The lettuce supplier for Ohio State was also fresh way out of Sidney, Ohio.

516
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,139
So this was a situation where we it was really good.

517
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,070
I mean, we quickly kind of figured out like this.

518
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:41,220
This may be where this contamination is coming from.

519
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,300
So now we start more case control studies.

520
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:53,110
We're now day 13 into this outbreak. Again, we're trying to get M students who are in the middle of finals to respond to us.

521
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,840
Not easy, but some some very nice souls actually responded to us.

522
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,450
In the meantime, we hear from New York.

523
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:08,130
They've got college students with bloody diarrhea and three are hospitalized and they use fresh weight for their shredded romaine lettuce.

524
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:16,110
So, again, it's getting bigger and bigger. The CDC now the CDC is involved.

525
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:21,900
Now, now when you get multiple states and yeah.

526
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,200
That it's bigger, then it's not just Ann Arbor here on campus.

527
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:34,470
Washtenaw County, we're managing this thing. It's now big. And so now we're having these big conference calls and lots of people.

528
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:40,920
And we've got Ohio marching in. We've got New York matching in, and now we've got the FDA going to fresh way.

529
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:48,060
And to see what's going on in that in that factory that processes the shredded romaine lettuce.

530
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:57,059
And again, we're putting out press releases trying to kind of keep people up to date on what's happening now.

531
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:04,110
Day 16, CDC confirms that this outbreak, you know, we already kind of had preliminary on this.

532
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:09,490
It's it's a14 or five Shiga toxin two, and then this is where it gets.

533
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:17,430
Now, the CDC has kind of taken over in a way, I'm not in charge anymore because you and I'm in charge of our local thing.

534
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,700
So they come up with their own case definitions. All right, that's fine.

535
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,919
CDC can do that. So, you know, but we have to follow now what's what's going on there.

536
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,489
And so under these new definitions, we now have ten confirmed cases, three probable and 15 suspect.

537
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:37,680
And the 15 suspect, we're sure, are part of this outbreak. But they maybe didn't turn in a stool sample.

538
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:44,640
They didn't you know, they didn't. There are lots of things going on, but we're we're keeping them all in because we know that's what's going on.

539
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:51,240
So the other thing that's going on, so they look at where the lettuce is processed in Ohio,

540
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:56,520
but then they're like, is something going on in the lettuce fields down in Arizona?

541
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,700
And during this outbreak, I learned more about what's called big lettuce than I ever want.

542
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:08,520
I know I didn't even know I needed to know about big lettuce. So, you know, we have this whole lettuce production in the United States.

543
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:14,580
And how many of you knew that it moves from it's in California for much of

544
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,750
the year and then it moves to Arizona for three months from January to March,

545
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:28,920
it moves to Arizona. And so it had just gone from Arizona back up to California in the midst of all of this.

546
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:41,130
So but back when the lettuce that the suspect lettuce when it was growing, it was part of the Arizona the Arizona growing time.

547
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:46,650
So that's where the FDA and Arizona State got involved to go head down to these growing fields.

548
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:53,010
So we're busy still trying to show that, you know,

549
00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:01,260
we've got really good evidence around eating lettuce and doing a case control study, working working with my state that she's doing,

550
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,140
we're doing, you know,

551
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:09,930
Fisher's exact and we're getting I mean that's a really good p value come on now you know 0.031 that's the lettuce come on anyway.

552
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:16,410
But that's you know so and nothing else is statistically associated with illness.

553
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,809
But the CDC is like, that's not good enough that p values not good enough.

554
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:25,410
We need more controls. I'm like, Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

555
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,970
Come on. You know, and again, look at what time of year it is.

556
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,840
A lot of students have already left. Right? You know, it's May 4th.

557
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,990
People have either graduated, they've gone. They're like watching the county find more people like, all right.

558
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:46,020
So you mean we literally sent out this survey to the School of Public Health, to school social work,

559
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,810
like all the different schools who might be around, like, please, we need you to answer this survey.

560
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:56,250
So anyway, in the end, we we got 25 controls.

561
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:01,350
So again, thank you to all of your former students who answered the survey for us.

562
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:12,090
And again, the lettuce still was just by and large, you know, the it was the bad actor with a very strong p value.

563
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:19,020
So because again, this is the CDC and the FDA did not want to act.

564
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:27,149
They do not want to say we're going to recall lettuce from across the United States unless they've got really good evidence to do so.

565
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,979
And so that's that's partly why I mean, I'm kind of making kind of poking fun a little bit and saying,

566
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:36,690
you know, why do we have to get all this extra information? But they want it to be as sure as possible.

567
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:42,510
So there is that. And then literally, I think it was the day after or the next day, the New York lab,

568
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:50,610
they actually isolate the E coli 0145 from the shredded romaine lettuce sample that they had taken from their college students.

569
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:59,790
So now and and interestingly enough, it was the same bag lock code that we had had at restaurant P that we had sent up for testing.

570
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:05,760
But this is what happens when you do food does not get contaminated equally.

571
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,970
You can eat just as again as an example,

572
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:18,210
you can have a pound of hamburger and this corner of it over here is full of E coli and this corner over here is not.

573
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:24,509
And so if you get a hamburger that was made over here and it's only cooked to 140

574
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:30,250
or 145 because you want to rare your hamburger and you get the corner of the hand,

575
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,500
you know this over here, it's full of the E coli. So sorry for you.

576
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:43,170
But you know, if you eat raw hamburger from this corner over here, you got lucky because that corner of the ground beef didn't have the E coli.

577
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,729
So and that's the same with the lettuce was not equally contaminated.

578
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:52,800
But we're so happy with our lab colleagues in New York because they found it.

579
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:57,180
So that's like, boom, we found it. We know what it is.

580
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:03,030
So and this is the first time I had been part of one of these big national recalls.

581
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:11,280
And I was a little bit surprised because the FDA encouraged fresh way to voluntarily recall the lettuce, I guess.

582
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,370
So they give them a chance to do the right thing. So I'm like, Oh, okay.

583
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,510
Because I just thought they'd be just coming down like, all right, get this lettuce off the shelves.

584
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,690
Because again, think about lettuce doesn't have that long of a shelf life.

585
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:32,819
We need to move. And if there's anything still out there, we want to make sure people are not still eating it so they fresh way they agreed.

586
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:39,389
And you can see how big this lettuce recall was. They voluntarily recalled the romaine lettuce.

587
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:44,520
But look at the date. It's now May six. And this is lettuce that's best if used by May 12th.

588
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,030
You know, and again, a lot of the lettuce had already been consumed.

589
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:56,129
And and and think about, too, I mean, so much in this, again, has changed in the past decade, especially with fresh produce.

590
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:59,250
It's really hard to track a lot of fresh produce.

591
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:06,780
And, you know, if it's a tomato, if it's if it's a head of lettuce, how do we how do we go back and see which ones they were and which?

592
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:14,129
And so that's you know, sometimes my my husband complains about the annoying stickers on fruit and other things,

593
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:19,410
but that is part of the, you know, tracking for keeping track of some of this fresh produce.

594
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:26,130
But anyway, so you can see where the distribution of where this lettuce went.

595
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:34,440
And again, keep in mind, only 5% of labs back in 2010 could even pick up this pathogen.

596
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,300
So think about how much bigger probably this issue was than we even knew.

597
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:42,660
But again, we were just picking up the tip of the iceberg.

598
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:53,540
Oh, day 35 of the outbreak. These go kind of on and on as we still work to kind of figure out everything else.

599
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:58,250
And so, yeah, another big conference call with the CDC working on our case, you know,

600
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:04,700
which cases still are in or out of the outbreak lab issues that came up adjusting the case definition.

601
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:09,560
Again, this is where we landed in Michigan with you know, I'm just going to say,

602
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:16,370
we had at least 25 people in this outbreak for sure, but only 12 are considered confirmed and one probable.

603
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,510
But again, just from all of the great work that our outbreak team did and all of the interviews,

604
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:25,990
we knew we had a lot more who were part of the outbreak.

605
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,860
But if you go it was interesting this morning as I was getting ready for this lecture,

606
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,420
I went onto the CDC website and this outbreak is still posted on the Web site for 2010.

607
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:38,080
And I went to look I'm like, Oh, how many cases are they saying we had in Michigan?

608
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:45,460
Oh 13. That was it. I'm like, Oh, no, we had many more than that, but that's all that's official on the CDC website.

609
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:55,360
So again, here is this is how detailed the the case definitions get and why, again,

610
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,950
and you can see at the very bottom, the CDC didn't even want to make us suspect case definition.

611
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:02,800
But we did so. We did so we added ours in there.

612
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:09,070
They the only thing that's official as part of the outbreak, again, are the confirmed and probable cases.

613
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,950
So you can see again how and again, they do have you know, you have to apply that,

614
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:18,429
especially when you have an outbreak like this that goes across multiple jurisdictions,

615
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:23,320
states, to make sure that we're all counting things in the same way.

616
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,060
So again, this was kind of the final case counts.

617
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,959
And and again, I just like I said earlier, it was I'm sure this was much, much bigger.

618
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,040
And it just there was not the ability to pick up on what and what happened.

619
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,920
Okay. And just a quick timeline summary. We hear about it on April 15th.

620
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,470
Again, I want to note that we were the ones hearing in Ann Arbor on U of M campus.

621
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,790
We detected this national outbreak. We were the ones who said, hey, this is what's going on.

622
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:04,370
April 8th was when we had pretty big, big exposure at this luncheon at the law school, the 26th.

623
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:08,359
That's when we. So I think it moved pretty, pretty fast.

624
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,850
We determined the common lettuce supplier that that was the likely source.

625
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:23,300
And we had the lettuce production moving back, you know, kind of beforehand, the date range of when they ate at restaurant P here locally May 5th.

626
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:35,230
New York isolates the the stack the a145 E.coli from the bagged romaine lettuce that recall happens on May 6th and May 10th.

627
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:42,740
Another company recalls their lettuce from that same farm down in Arizona that supplied two fresh way because again, everybody's starting to look now.

628
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:48,479
Oh, are we seeing anything else? So this I we I won't go over this at all.

629
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,889
Let's it'll be available to you. After the lecture, this was one of the state epidemiologist presented this at one of the national conferences.

630
01:01:54,890 --> 01:02:00,860
This is what these, you know, very involved kind of timeline outbreaks look like.

631
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:07,340
So let's get down to a little bit more of what we call down on the farm.

632
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:12,510
So I told you so. The FDA went down to this place where the lettuce was grown in Arizona to take a look.

633
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:19,230
And then we heard about it in December. So again, remember, this all happened around April-May, so six months later.

634
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:27,000
So the agency, the initial investigation that there were three soil samples that they did find some shiga toxin,

635
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,490
some stec, but it wasn't the outbreak strain.

636
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:37,049
So like so there was some something in the in the growing fields that was there was definitely Shiga toxin but didn't quite match.

637
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:41,879
But that's like, okay. So, but then this got more interesting.

638
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,630
So according to this report, they said there were six potential sources for Shiga toxin near this growing farm for the lettuce.

639
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:54,780
So concentrated animal feeding operations, but they were 8 to 11 miles away from the growing field.

640
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,830
So that's a bit away. There's a housing development kind of close by.

641
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:05,730
There was some sheep on fields close by, but the one that just like that, we've underlined and I'm like, oh boy,

642
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:14,069
there was an RV park that their septic leach system was going right into the drainage irrigation canal that was used to water the farm.

643
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:23,520
So again, water going into the irrigation canals that then is spread over the lettuce for growing.

644
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:30,000
So it seems, you know, I think that's probably a pretty likely way that this whole thing might have started.

645
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:42,750
And so there are a number of things about this outbreak that were first one is in the U.S. at this time, four again for nono 157 stec outbreaks.

646
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:47,310
Only seven had had a food that was implicated in the outbreak.

647
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:53,790
And since since this time in the past decade, a number of romaine lettuce outbreaks have happened.

648
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:58,080
But but again, this was this was all pretty new back in 2010.

649
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,570
And again, it was the first produce related outbreak of 0145 in the United States.

650
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,340
And we found it right here.

651
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:14,310
So I was proud of the work that, again, that we do as a as a team and in this community of really just being on top of stuff.

652
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,260
So kind of, you know, things that still linger from these outbreaks.

653
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:25,980
So, you know, for for restaurant P, why did they have so many cases connected to them?

654
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,549
Was it because they were just taking care of things in their restaurant?

655
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:34,860
They had a lot of critical violations, again, in how they handled their food, everything going on.

656
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:40,350
We know that they had bad lettuce coming in, so but did something about what they were doing.

657
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:45,420
Did that make it more optimal for the growth and spread of the E.coli?

658
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,950
And again, we've said this several times, how many people were really sick?

659
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:55,800
But we didn't know because 95% of our labs could not test for the pathogen we were looking for.

660
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,140
And why did we see the illnesses mainly at college campuses, but not elsewhere?

661
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,889
I mentioned earlier has to do with college campuses.

662
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:11,970
Many times are associated with a research hospital like U of M and has the latest technology and can actually pick it up.

663
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:20,970
Plus, you know, there's you do have the situation where these big, you know, college campuses like U of M have university health services.

664
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:26,910
And so they're also looking there like, wait a minute, why are we seeing all these college students with bloody diarrhea?

665
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:31,680
This is not you know, and so there's people coming in and kind of looking at what's going on.

666
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,960
But, oh, and why didn't we see some syndromic surveillance pick it up?

667
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:45,000
So I would mention this, but we have out of our emergency department, we have what's called syndromic surveillance, which picks up like,

668
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:51,149
hey, you've got Hey, Washtenaw County, you've got a lot of GI cases going on and you've got a lot of respiratory cases going on.

669
01:05:51,150 --> 01:06:02,010
You've got other things. And I, I have mixed feelings about how helpful this is because even an outbreak this big it that, you know,

670
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:05,729
this outbreak got kind of lost and just everything else coming into the air,

671
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:11,490
we didn't it didn't like send us a signal like, hey, all these students have come to the E.R.,

672
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:18,299
which is why it's still so important with all of our systems that are supposed to talk to each other,

673
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:28,230
all of our databases that that flow into one another, that somebody picks up the phone and calls me, you know, I will take a phone call at any time.

674
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:31,670
I mean, it's again and having those relationships, you know, where, you know,

675
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,379
I talked to the, for instance, the CO the team on U of M campus several times a week.

676
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,800
They they they have my cell phone. They can call us any time.

677
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,070
We're talking all the time. We're talking about monkeypox. We're talking about adenovirus.

678
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:47,010
We're talking about, you know, we're talking about stuff all the time.

679
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,960
And it's so much more helpful than waiting for it to just come across my different systems.

680
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:59,340
Not that all the technology and all these inter relational databases are all great and that's what you all be practicing and that,

681
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,500
you know, with with those. But.

682
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:09,040
It's about the relationships, too, and really knowing who you can call and who you can say, Hey, what's going on over there?

683
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:17,170
And again, this is just an acknowledgment of all of the people that worked on this and how,

684
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:22,090
you know, again, these outbreaks come together with many, many, many, many people.

685
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:27,579
So I will stop there and see if anybody has any questions about the outbreak.

686
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:35,500
And then I'm also happy to answer any questions about just being on the front lines of COVID for the past three, almost three years.

687
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:39,500
So. Any anything come to mind. Yeah.

688
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:44,810
So I guess kind of based off of, like what you said was like what happened?

689
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:50,840
So how much do you think, like the way we process food in the United States has to do with like foodborne illness here?

690
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:58,010
That's a great question. And I you know, because I don't work as much on that food regulation side.

691
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:05,600
You know, I think I think there's probably a lot to that, you know, because we have big, you know, big production, big.

692
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,830
And, you know, part of that is, you know, of course, we have a lot of people to to feed.

693
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:18,350
But I know, you know, just and this is, again, just kind of an aside on a on a personal note, I have a an exchange sister in Finland.

694
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:24,139
And I remember talking to her at one point about salmonella, you know, that we have in Washtenaw County.

695
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,740
Again, my job as the local epidemiologist is does know what's normal for us.

696
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:32,780
You know, we have maybe between 30 and 50 cases of salmonella per year.

697
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:37,010
And I was talking to her about this. She said she just looked at me. She's like, you have how many cases?

698
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,799
And she's a pharmacist, how many cases of salmonella here?

699
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:45,140
And I told her she's like, we see like one per year in Finland, like the whole country, you know.

700
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:54,080
And so it to me, so I'm like, oh, there must be a different way that you all handle how your food is processed and what you do.

701
01:08:54,500 --> 01:09:04,760
Because I have to say in this country, that's why we have all of those instructions on our chicken, on our beef, saying,

702
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:12,530
wash your hands, cook to these temperatures, everything else, because we acknowledge and we're not willing to do anything about that.

703
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,370
It's all contaminated with campylobacter, salmonella, everything else.

704
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:22,040
We've again, we've managed in many ways, we've just accepted that that's what it is.

705
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:30,950
And we're putting it on personal responsibility that you and the cooks here in this room, those of you getting ready to make Thanksgiving dinner,

706
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:36,049
are going to do the right thing and wash your hands, sanitize your counters,

707
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:45,080
do everything you need to do so you don't get sick with what's we know is on all of our many of our raw animal products.

708
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:53,260
Yeah. Other questions or or thoughts about when I when I shared.

709
01:09:55,330 --> 01:10:02,350
Yeah. Period. Like right now, with COVID surveillance, morale and resources are like diverted to that.

710
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,670
How do you make sure you stay on top of things like this that aren't the fire that's burning as hot?

711
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,570
Well, that's that's a really good question, because it's it is really it's really hard.

712
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:21,940
I you know, I can tell you I mean, we. You know, we were still keeping up with, you know, the other diseases coming in.

713
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:31,450
I am so grateful again. Part of what all of the masking and and also there's like a viral ecology or respiratory ecology thing that happens.

714
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:38,710
But before the pandemic in Washtenaw County, we were seeing 80 to 100 cases of pertussis a year.

715
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:42,940
That was taking a lot of our time dealing with our schools.

716
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:50,590
We had pertussis cases here on campus. We were, you know, and so it just yeah, it takes a lot you to figure out, like, who are they near?

717
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,390
Do we need to get antibiotics to them, blah, blah. You know, I mean, 80 to 100 per year.

718
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:01,030
We have pertussis cases. I have seen zero since the pandemic started zero.

719
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:06,489
And that is at first you say, oh, is that because we're not looking for it?

720
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,890
That would be a great question. But here's the thing.

721
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:24,580
The the respiratory panel that is done at the U of M er called up called the R pin covers COVID flu, adenovirus rhino, enterovirus, pertussis.

722
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:32,200
It has this whole thing and it's done multiple times for looking for when people are either negative for COVID or something else.

723
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:36,090
You know, hundreds and hundreds of those have been done over the pandemic.

724
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:40,959
So if so, because, you know, you think like, oh, that we just missed a bunch of pertussis and yes,

725
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,900
we may be missed some pertussis, but I think I mean, mostly it it decreased.

726
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:54,490
So it's a little bit of a side note to say, yes, it's been difficult to stay on top of all these other kinds of things.

727
01:11:54,490 --> 01:12:03,340
And you all might have seen in the news that there was another E Coli outbreak this summer that was connected to Wendy's and eating.

728
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:07,060
They were looking at lettuce again, but they were not able to prove that one.

729
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:10,150
They were thinking it was lettuce coming in on the sandwiches.

730
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:18,520
And we had one case here in Washtenaw County that was connected to that outbreak, and there were more on the western side of Michigan.

731
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,100
And then again, it was a national outbreak as well.

732
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:30,459
So that one, you know, but again, it's and and what's been difficult is, as I was saying earlier, there was a core group of us,

733
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:37,570
about 8 to 10 of us at the Health Department that I started working on COVID in January of 2020.

734
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:44,859
And it's because of you all. I just have to say that it is it's because of, you know, students on campus,

735
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:49,990
because some of your fellow students were coming back from Chinese New Year and China.

736
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:55,780
And so we were already putting people into quarantine in January of 2020.

737
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:00,460
At that point, the only place to get COVID testing done was the CDC.

738
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:12,130
Can you imagine? So we had to work with you to just get people tested and then get their sample down to Georgia, down to Atlanta, get them tested.

739
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,390
And, you know, we were already busy.

740
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:22,240
I was already guess if this tells you anything, I was already sick of COVID by February of 2020.

741
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:25,809
And we I mean, I was I was like, oh, I'm so done with us, you know?

742
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:30,879
And then, of course, we had even had our first case until, I think March 10th anyway.

743
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:41,080
And now we're at over 100,000 cases. And as I said earlier, it's what I, I literally I just got my weekends back in April of this year.

744
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,979
That's that's what's been going on at the Health Department.

745
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:52,059
And there's a group of 8 to 10 of us that have just worked around the clock on this pandemic.

746
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,180
And then, of course, you know, monkeypox has shown up.

747
01:13:55,180 --> 01:14:00,250
We're about I think we're at 20 cases in Washtenaw County now. We've just had a couple of cases in the past week.

748
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:05,440
So that's still happening. We're actively giving monkeypox vaccine at the health department.

749
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:12,900
We have two phenomenal nurse practitioners who are busy vaccinating people doing all the follow up.

750
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:17,950
One of my health educators that works with me, she's doing all the contact tracing for monkeypox.

751
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:22,420
That fortunately seems like it's calmed down.

752
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:27,310
I mean, not come down, but it's at a much, you know, is not rising exponentially.

753
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:37,030
You know, we're you know, right now, just just so you all are aware in Washtenaw County, we're running at about 75 cases of COVID per day.

754
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:40,390
This is reported to us. This does not count.

755
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,510
We know there's a lot of home antigen testing going on out there.

756
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:45,520
We don't hear about that. That's okay.

757
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:54,100
We're this is 75 cases are getting still reported to us every day, about five hospitalizations and two deaths per week.

758
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,700
We are still this is not we are not over.

759
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,940
We're not even close to over. I still have a whole team where I just, you know, ran had my team meeting this morning.

760
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,950
We have outbreaks with ten of our long term care facilities, have outbreaks of COVID.

761
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:16,120
Right now we are looking at the new BQ, two variants that are rising exponentially.

762
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:20,500
You're going to overtake probably be a four by five, which is currently, you know,

763
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:27,870
what we have has been dominant in the past bit and you might know maybe you know this, maybe you don't.

764
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:40,680
Just this past week, I just got the report out of U of M hospital lab that RSV has just taken over the number of positive cases in,

765
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:51,059
you know, this past week that COVID here locally so more than 200 positive RSV cases, positive labs and over 200 COVID.

766
01:15:51,060 --> 01:16:00,630
But RSV is more than COVID right now. So and RSV for those we don't know, is particularly worrisome for our our kids under five,

767
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:04,500
a lot of hospitalizations and kids under five and for folks over 70.

768
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:09,390
So that's those are the two groups that we look at. But we don't have a lot of interventions.

769
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:17,820
I mean, we don't have like with COVID, we've got antivirals, we've got vaccine, we've got, you know, in public health, we've got something to offer.

770
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:23,069
Be like, okay, let's we actually have some tools RSV they're working on.

771
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:30,300
I think both GSK and Pfizer are in the midst of finishing up a vaccine, which is great, but it's not out yet.

772
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:36,750
And it's mostly I think there's some medications for pre-teens, for small babies that they're in the hospital.

773
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:42,750
But yeah, we don't we don't have a lot for for RSV.

774
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:50,490
Any, any other questions about kind of what what's happening now or for public public health?

775
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:57,959
So how is how is flu looking? So how's flu looking? So you might have heard in the news it's called the triple, double, triple.

776
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,590
I mean, it's being so that's, you know, COVID, RSV and flu.

777
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:09,600
So flu we've had since the beginning of October, about ten or so cases maybe.

778
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,679
No, not more than that. We've had more than ten cases reported. I mean, we've had some flu.

779
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:21,600
It's I would say it's sporadic right now, but already two hospitalizations, which is kind of early for for that for the flu season.

780
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:27,720
And if those of you anybody was anybody here last year who's I don't know who's anybody here last year.

781
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:37,470
So you all had a huge outbreak of influenza November last year, but we pulled the CDC in for that was that was a lot of fun.

782
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:43,889
So yeah, you guys have again, like like I said earlier, you guys are part of like a little time.

783
01:17:43,890 --> 01:17:49,260
So anyway, the CDC came up last November to help us with the flu outbreak here on campus.

784
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:54,750
And that unfortunately showed us that it was a crappy match to the vaccine last year.

785
01:17:55,050 --> 01:18:00,180
So influenza a H3N2 is notoriously difficult to create a vaccine for.

786
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:06,870
We did a bad job last year that was like, I don't know if it's a 0% match.

787
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:13,499
Maybe it was a 10%. When people complain about COVID like that, the efficacy is dropping to 60 or 70.

788
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:16,680
I'm like, Oh my God, that would be a phenomenal flu year.

789
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:22,799
I mean, you know, COVID vaccine has just knocked it out of the park compared to, you know, compared to flu vaccine.

790
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:29,400
Not the flu vaccine isn't worth getting because I'll take a 40 or 50% protection over zero.

791
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:37,080
But unfortunately for H3N2, which is what was circulating on campus last November, it was a bad match.

792
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:45,510
So just saying and we're just waiting to see, like what? As everybody goes home for Thanksgiving, there's all that mixing.

793
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:49,890
And I you know, personally, I can say I'm having a big gathering with family.

794
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,229
I mean, we're all vaccinated. Some of us have had COVID, too, you know, and but we're people are gathering again.

795
01:18:55,230 --> 01:19:02,220
And it is going to be a big old mixing melting pot as you all come back for finals.

796
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:06,929
So please don't call me now. I'm just getting on. I feel you probably will be calling me.

797
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:13,350
But as you come back and things start happening after work in December, it'll be a nice birthday present.

798
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,040
So but again, thank you so much.

799
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:28,650
And I really again, I'm so happy you're all. Otherwise.

800
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:53,380
Thinking about. I don't like. You know, I feel like I saw no matter.

801
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:57,860
Know.
