1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,380
In this module, we're going to be talking about traumatic stressors and collective trauma.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,120
And so this is kind of a subset of what can affect mental health,

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,980
and then the skills to deal with it.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:26,380
When we're talking about trauma, that can be kind of a big topic and it's important to know that, again, this kind of has a continuum.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:35,560
So traumatic stressors are just anything that happen in the moment that kind of overwhelm our ability to cope.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,560
An example of this might be, if you were backing out of the driveway and didn't see another car coming really quickly.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,660
And let's say you didn't even hit them, but you slam on the brakes, and your heart is racing like your body went into fight or flight, which we'll talk

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:01:02,290
a bit more about, and getting out of the car, you might feel kind of shaky in your body and you might feel a little like your nerves are kind of on edge.

9
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,570
And that, like a fuzzy feeling might stick around for a little while.

10
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,800
All of us experience traumatic stress or some people call these small t traumas.

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:20,150
And often our body just kind of resets itself, it has a way of moving through these things where doesn't stay stuck in our bodies,

12
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,770
and sometimes things do stay stuck in our bodies. We're going to talk a little bit about the difference.

13
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,430
We're also going to talk about the difference between something like what I just talked about, where it affects one person,

14
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:41,060
and then something that affects a lot of people. So examples of this would be things like a major hurricane, and it affecting everybody in that area.

15
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,190
COVID-19, and how it's affecting everybody around the globe. Violence against racial groups,

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,940
violence against people based on sexual orientation and gender identity,

17
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:01,390
these affect largely a specific group and sometimes religious groups also experience that kind of targeted violence,

18
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,700
and so those are collective traumas.

19
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:13,240
And what we know is that these things are happening and they often happen right in the middle of our professional and academic lives,

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:24,750
and so how we take care of ourselves and move through them becomes really important. So any time we're talking about any kind of trauma,

21
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,070
these are some of the major impacts. It changes our sense of self and the world around us.

22
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:43,890
So whether it's an individual one, like if somebody experiences a sexual assault or somebody breaks into their home or they lose a family member,

23
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,690
it often makes us wonder things like, am I safe?

24
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,550
Did I deserve this? Did I do something wrong? Are other people safe? Can I trust them?

25
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,640
Can I trust bystanders to even be of any help? Can I trust people to believe me

26
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,010
when I share my experiences? So those are some of the things that happen there.

27
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:16,110
Also physically depletes us. So if our body mobilizes because it feels afraid or threatened or is just worried about something like COVID-19,

28
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,790
that's happening globally, it kind of goes into high alert. A lot of us have heard about fight or flight.

29
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,690
There's also lesser known ones freeze, fawn.

30
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:33,740
These are all ways that we just try to survive the moment, and that we go into kind of high alert.

31
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:41,680
And in the aftermath, our body usually feels very drained, because of all of the energy that we kind of rallied to deal with it.

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,350
And sometimes we're dealing with chronic stressors. So when you see acts of violence happening against a group

33
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:56,120
chronically. When we're experiencing COVID-19 over more than a year, we can kind of stay in a place of depletion,

34
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:07,510
and this is really important to address too. Trauma also alienates us, so usually in the moment in which the trauma is happening, we often feel alone.

35
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,910
And we often feel vulnerable and sometimes even in the aftermath,

36
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:20,690
we don't always feel like we can talk about it, and like people aren't with us to support us through it.

37
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:30,740
Trauma robs us of our agency and our voice. So, even something like COVID-19, where we don't necessarily see a direct culprit,

38
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,150
our normal sense of like, oh, I've got this under control, I know what to do,

39
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,500
I know who to tell or talk to about it, can feel diminished.

40
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:52,280
With our voice, even, for example, in terms of protesting things or being able to speak our truth without worry about how people are going to respond,

41
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,480
often in trauma, it feels like that is lost in something that's a part,

42
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,720
healing is part of regaining that. Trauma dysregulates our body.

43
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,600
So if you think about it, we have kind of what we call our

44
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,050
window of tolerance. This is like where we're at most days,

45
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:18,570
where we feel like we're functioning fine, and trauma tends to send us into a kind of hyper arousal where just, we're really vigilant,

46
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:25,020
we're really on guard, it seems like a lot is happening. This usually is when we're in fight or flight.

47
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,510
Also send us into hypo arousal. So it's just it feels like there is no energy.

48
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:39,450
It feels like there is no motivation. And a lot of people, for example, throughout COVID-19, have felt like they've gone from one to the other, day-to-day.

49
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:45,700
And so with the prolonged stressors, often you'll see that you're just like fuzzy, I feel not motivated, I feel like

50
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,500
I can't sit still. All of that is a dysregulation that's happening in our bodies.

51
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,610
And sometimes in the moment of trauma, we kind of disconnect from our bodies.

52
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,370
Mentally, we kind of check out because it's too much, and in the moment, sometimes that's helpful.

53
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,650
But when that stays over long periods of time, it usually isn't helpful.

54
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:14,900
And so, but it can often feel difficult, scary, unsafe to check back in.

55
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,450
The last piece of this that we're going to talk about is that it overwhelms our ability to process information in the moment.

56
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:29,900
Sometimes we have difficulty remembering what happened. But also, again, in COVID-19, we were in Zoom meetings all the time,

57
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,660
and we're worried about all kinds of different things. And it can often just feel like I can't think straight,

58
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:45,030
I feel fuzzy. Too much information is coming at me at a time and it's hard to process.

59
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,220
So let's look specifically at COVID-19 and let's think about this in terms of

60
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,060
kind of sometimes layers of trauma that can be happening at the same time.

61
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,380
We can be having individual traumas, different difficulties happening in our life,

62
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:07,080
and then something like COVID-19 can come along and be effecting a lot of people at the same time.

63
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:16,010
At the beginning of COVID-19, most of us were kind of taken aback by how quickly life had to change.

64
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,060
And even then, we were continually getting new information. So, you know, are we sheltering in place?

65
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,110
Are we wearing masks? Are we not wearing masks? Where do we get toilet paper?

66
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:33,150
There were just all of these investments that we were not used to that we had to make suddenly. And that kind of keeps our our nervous system on high alert.

67
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,760
And that can be part of the trauma. Another part was the uncertainty.

68
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,850
And I want I want you guys to see in this image we have a continuum at the top because while all of this we're experiencing

69
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,640
COVID-19, it was impacting people in different ways.

70
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,630
So some people were worried about how they were going to meet their basic needs, if they were going to have a job.

71
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:06,120
And some people were worried about how long this is going to last? So different types of worries, different intensity of worries.

72
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,480
All of us were also experiencing loss and grief. So some of us were experiencing the loss of just our normalcy,

73
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:20,370
our routines. And some of us were experiencing the loss of loved ones due to COVID-19.

74
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,900
So that was part of the trauma.

75
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,340
We're also experiencing isolation, so some of us were just alone in a house by ourselves, and that was, we didn't have much of a pod,

76
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,520
and so feeling isolated in that way.

77
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,360
Others of us, might have been in a house with people that we were spending entirely more time with than we wanted to,

78
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:49,390
but we didn't have access to the outside world at the same time. And so that reduced freedom of movement, created stressors.

79
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,970
Some of us were overstimulated, too much to do, too many people in the house, too many people trying to use the wifi.

80
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,900
and others didn't have enough to do, maybe they were off work,

81
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:08,310
and you saw people picking up new hobbies and trying to keep themselves busy while they were in the same space.

82
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,220
And a big thing was that we often didn't have access to our normal coping strategies,

83
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:19,750
so gathering with other people at church, at brunch, going to workout, these things were suddenly not accessible.

84
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,220
And we had a lot of stress and not our usual ways of coping with stress.

85
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,830
And so that was a difficult piece of it.

86
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,920
Another important thing to know is that sometimes you don't even see the full symptoms of trauma until our body feels safe again.

87
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,170
So if you're noticing, even now as people are getting vaccinated and starting to be together more,

88
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,710
that you're you're still feeling signs, and just kind of all over the place about it,

89
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,180
that's completely normal.

90
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,860
We've been nervous a lot of us to be gathered, and so as we gather and, you know, we've been isolated, and now we're interacting

91
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:06,170
again, you can expect that that's going to hit all of our nervous systems different and be difficult and be an adjustment, and for some of us,

92
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:15,890
It may be easy, breezy. We want to keep in mind that different people are experiencing this in different ways.

93
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:25,470
I'm now going to talk about racial trauma and I'm going to use specifically violence against Black people,

94
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,550
but it's important for us to know that racial trauma is just one form of collective trauma.

95
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,630
So there are a lot of different marginalized groups, and they experience this in different ways,

96
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:46,910
and we've seen this recently with Anti-Asian racism and violence, we've seen this in regards to violence against LGBT communities, trans communities,

97
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,190
and so we just want to keep in mind again that while all of us might be experiencing COVID-19,

98
00:10:52,190 --> 00:11:04,020
some of us are experiencing even more layers on top of that. One example of that was early in COVID when Ahmaud Arbery was killed,

99
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,680
a lot of people, their coping, was to get outdoors and to run.

100
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,900
And all of a sudden we were being, it was being recommended to wear masks and a lot of Black people were all of the sudden feeling unsafe

101
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:21,120
to be outside and run. And they were feeling concerned that if they were wearing masks,

102
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,510
would that lead people to be more suspicious of them and possibly incur more harm or violence against them?

103
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,910
So in a time that was already scary, there was added stressors,

104
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,290
and trauma that Black people we're experiencing.

105
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:41,230
And so this is just a piece of this to keep in mind, and so I'm going to explain what racial trauma is by reading these quotes,

106
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,810
because I think they're helpful to hear in people's own words, what this can feel like.

107
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:55,130
There's a heightened sense of fear and anxiety when you feel like you can't trust the people who've been put in charge to keep you safe.

108
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,880
Instead, you see them killing people who look like you, combined with the everyday instances of racism,

109
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,760
like microaggressions and discrimination, that contribute to a sense of alienation and isolation.

110
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:15,400
It's race-based trauma. Recognize that if you're numb, that means something. If you're breaking down in tears,

111
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:24,330
that means something. It affects you more than you know, and there's nothing wrong with saying that this pain you.

112
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,080
And so the underlined words,

113
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,270
are the cause. Seeing people killed

114
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,470
that look like you, starting to think about how this could happen, when

115
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,990
the people that you care about, along with just the everyday experiences of microaggressions and discrimination,

116
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:52,290
takes a toll on people's mental health, and wellbeing. Some of the symptoms that we see are highlighted there in yellow.

117
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,810
Fear, anxiety, difficulty, trusting people, or feeling safe.

118
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:07,950
Alienation, isolation, numbness, tears, sadness, anger, all of these make complete sense.

119
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:14,840
And when you're experiencing them, it's important to know that they make sense.

120
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,090
One more quote. To be Black in this America is to scream,

121
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,540
I am on fire and hear in response, no you're not.

122
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,810
It's just warm today, as the flames engulf your body.

123
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:38,990
What is it like to to never have to worry about the day you become the reason a protest starts? As these thoughts circulate through my mind,

124
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,040
my alarm goes off for work. It's time to put on a mask.

125
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,740
Time to enter the manufacturer utopia, where everyone shuffles around making copies ever-so-carefully,

126
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,280
avoiding the big, Black, bullet-ridden elephant in the room.

127
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:02,040
And there's a lot in that quote, and even as I read it now, and as you're listening, I encourage you to just take a deep breath,

128
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,570
and notice how you feel in your body. The fact that these things are happening is not normal.

129
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,930
It's not good for any of our nervous systems.

130
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:22,160
And even talking about it and hearing about it can take a toll. We want to check-in and notice that.

131
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,590
We also want to acknowledge that not talking about them makes it more difficult for people showing up in

132
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:34,780
academic and professional spaces, where everybody is acting like it didn't even happen.

133
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,180
And so being able to have these conversations, being able to know that it's normal

134
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:46,310
if they are impacting your ability to show up academically, that that's normal.

135
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:53,780
The worry, the thoughts about it, feeling like you sometimes have to pretend because other people can't

136
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,890
hear or respond well to what you're experiencing. All of those things are really normal.

137
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,400
And so we want to take, we want to have a conversation about how we

138
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:15,360
address these things. And so we're gonna stop here and we're gonna talk about what  to do in the next module.
