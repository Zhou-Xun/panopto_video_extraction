1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,595
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,855
you will be able to use

3
00:00:12,855 --> 00:00:15,645
PROC SURVEYREG and PROC
SURVEYLOGISTIC to run

4
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:20,730
linear and logistic regression
models with survey data.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,365
Let's go back to our example,

6
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:24,090
remember our design is

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,470
a complex design and

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,930
therefore we have to use
weights and clusters.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,030
Our outcome now is going to

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,770
be the continuous
weight for a height

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,945
z-score and now
we're going to run

12
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:37,080
a linear regression model to
test the following question.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,985
Is the age of the child

14
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:42,075
associated with the weight
for height z-score?

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,870
PROC SURVEYREG is very similar to

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,045
the normal PROC
REG, but of course,

17
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:48,679
because it's a SURVEYPROC,

18
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,575
you will still use the cluster
and weight statements,

19
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,745
although I will discuss more
on this in the next video.

20
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,765
The model statement
is exactly the same.

21
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:00,440
Here our outcome variable
is the weight for

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,940
height z-score variable and

23
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,035
independent variable is
age of the children.

24
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:07,575
The output is very similar too,

25
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:09,120
we get an intercept and

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,730
a slope in our estimated
regression coefficients,

27
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,490
and interpretation of our data

28
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,895
is the same as we
have done before.

29
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,195
For every month of age,

30
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:21,000
the weight to height
z-score increases

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,965
by 0.016 and this increase is
statistically significant,

32
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:28,470
so piece of cake again.

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,475
Now if we go back to our
binary outcome, Overweight,

34
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,630
and our previous
exposure, Bottle-fed,

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,255
we can run a logistic
regression model in SAS.

36
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:42,575
Once more the syntax is
similar to PROC LOGISTIC,

37
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:45,455
but with the weight and
cluster statements.

38
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,810
Note also that you can
put the statements in

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,900
any order you want and this
is true for all SAS PROCS.

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,280
I put the weight and

41
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,990
cluster statements
at the beginning in

42
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,640
previous code and now I'm putting

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,150
them after the model,
it doesn't matter.

44
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,740
Now note an important thing
for PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC,

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,990
there is no descending option,

46
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,100
so you will have to use

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,600
the event option in

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,660
order to model the
correct probability.

49
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,255
In this case, the probability
of being overweight,

50
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:13,270
which is coded as 1.

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,500
The output is also very
similar to PROC LOGISTIC,

52
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,630
so let's go straight to

53
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,955
the parameter estimates
and odds ratios.

54
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,130
Again, you already
know how to interpret

55
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,085
this odds ratio and you
should feel very comfortable.

56
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:28,790
The odds of having overweight
is 64 percent lower among

57
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,619
children who were bottle-fed

58
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:33,190
compared with children
who were not.

59
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,850
Now know that you could still

60
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,340
run up PROC LOGISTIC
with weights,

61
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,520
it happens that almost
every PROC in SAS can be

62
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,000
weighted The only
difference between

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,640
these two pieces of code
would be that in one,

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,025
you will not have the cluster
statement and in the other,

65
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:51,160
you do have the
cluster statement.

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,755
But if you run those two,

67
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,145
you can see that the also
odds ratio still the same,

68
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:58,300
the point estimate will
be correct in both,

69
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,820
but the standard errors are

70
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,210
incorrect when not taking

71
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,860
into account in the
cluster statement.

72
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,730
Your confidence interval
is too narrow and wrong.

73
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,470
In summary, in this video we used

74
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,070
PROC SURVEYREG PROC
SURVEYLOGISTIC to run

75
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,070
linear and logistic regression
models with survey data.

76
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,470
In the next video,
we will learn how

77
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,197
to apply weights in
survey data analysis.
