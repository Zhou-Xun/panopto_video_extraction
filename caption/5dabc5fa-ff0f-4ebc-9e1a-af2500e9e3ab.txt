1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,390
It's what we do.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,070
This is morning, everybody.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:22,410
So since we're on a holiday and so forth, a class that is large part of the mood.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,120
I've been teaching American politics in this building for 17 years now, and the number of things that I have had,

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:36,510
I've never heard of and then had to learn and then had to explain for a couple of years and then forgot is is a strikingly long list.

6
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,050
The moral that you should take away from that is the obvious one.

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:47,680
The legislation and budgeting is really complex, but when you're faced with something that is complex and challenging and stuffed

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,830
with lawyers and specialists who built their lives on manipulating these rules.

9
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,370
It's not a great errand to try and get more than the broad outlines of what's going on.

10
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,930
The broad identification of who's powerful, what the key things going on are.

11
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,620
Instead, what you want to do is practice your skills at figuring out what's happening in a given situation.

12
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,260
So instead of trying to memorize how every single iteration of the legislative process works,

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,910
which also changes over time, what you want to be doing is thinking about this as a skills class.

14
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,940
It's about getting into the right mood, trying to figure out what could look like in poetry,

15
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,230
the complicated things where your knowledge of what happened last time doesn't necessarily carry over.

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,809
So I can explain in depth what ping pong is and what cromnibus is, are,

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,360
and so forth from the bus stop where you got to love the American political system for that one.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,299
That's when you combine a continuing resolution of an omnibus, but instead view.

19
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:53,300
This is skills, right? It's not about memorizing. CRomnibus is an omnibus continuing resolution.

20
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:02,600
Instead, it's about trying to take apart some actual legislative activity that happened quite recently in a very consequential for

21
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:09,620
the country and the planet and for health care policy and understand and develop your ability to figure out what's going on.

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,040
Okay. So it's going to be a very heavily exercise based class.

23
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,630
Now, I know what you're all interested in is strategic analysis.

24
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,680
They were good.

25
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:25,670
We've been trying to give very precise feedback about, you know, what can be done better as well as if it was good if you should continue doing it.

26
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,160
We're going to be posting the grades pretty soon.

27
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:35,990
We're going to have a conversation about general patterns of good and bad things, room for improvement that we saw across the class on Monday.

28
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,940
And obviously, Sara Rosenblum has left the office hours to speak with you.

29
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,139
And there's policy salon on Thursday to which you're welcome to come if you have questions,

30
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,560
because this is the kind of assignment where one person has a question that's a pretty decent approach.

31
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,570
50 people have a question. So look for your grades and think of it as an opportunity like this.

32
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,380
This class is built on sort of development of skills, and if you did it well, carry on doing it.

33
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,049
The policy memos and in some cases there's advice about something that was good enough

34
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,530
for the strategic analysis that you want to do a little more for the policy memo.

35
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,209
Okay. So if you're not too worried about your grade, wait for Monday.

36
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,200
And if you are, we can look up Sarah or from the policy slot.

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,640
All right. With no further ado, let's go to the legislative process exercise.

38
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,650
We're going to have basically two different kinds of structured conversations today.

39
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,200
One is unpacking some issues about the legislative process of the Inflation Reduction Act.

40
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:40,130
As somebody who used to study Ireland, I still can't quite get my head around discussing the IRA in such a poor context,

41
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:47,550
and then we're going to try and back out and draw some lessons about what happens, how it matters for policy.

42
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:55,770
Okay. And the point is to understand the outlines and how it shapes what is possible and also start to get a sense of when it's malleable.

43
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,310
When Joe Manchin is the most important politician in the United States and what he is and why and how it changes.

44
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,180
So here's the big exercise. Around the room is without.

45
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,360
So stop there and count. One, two, three, four, five.

46
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,740
Okay. What? Three, four.

47
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,610
Well. To.

48
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,520
500. Two, three, four, five.

49
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,180
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

50
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,550
One. Okay.

51
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,280
Everybody have a number. You would not believe the debacle when I did this with the master students.

52
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,350
There are some as he managed each other. Half of them ended up with no group. Was brilliant. Okay.

53
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,450
One, two, three, four, five.

54
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:17,970
Go hang out together. You've got to move on.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,520
So you have to move through this whole time.

56
00:05:29,850 --> 00:06:01,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:15,030
Okay. So. Each of you, what we're going to try and do is move fairly quickly.

58
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,960
So take one and two. One is here.

59
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,160
And trying to do it is, I think, right there. Okay.

60
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,830
I want you to fairly quickly because you're in big groups so you can be very efficient.

61
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,000
As for each of these questions. So it's going to be 5 minutes group 5 minutes.

62
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,460
Report out with an answer. Okay. So take 5 minutes to answer what is the Inflation Reduction Act?

63
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,149
And then we're going to bring it out and have the conversation to make sure we're all agreed on that.

64
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,750
That's the easy one. It gets harder. So.

65
00:06:49,020 --> 00:07:07,920
Take it away. 5 minutes. Starting now. Question one and then we'll discuss in class in the context of this article and some questions.

66
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:16,700
Yes, the number of questions.

67
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:25,600
We're all in those together.

68
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:41,260
Yeah. I a of.

69
00:07:48,790 --> 00:08:18,780
Your answer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,710
It's. It's it's it's.

71
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:33,330
It's it's. It's it's.

72
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:53,750
Yeah. I'm just saying that, you know, we've had this job.

73
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:03,680
Oh, yes, this is great.

74
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:20,550
Some people think that it's the.

75
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:45,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:09:46,240 --> 00:10:10,440
Because, you know, that's what I'm hoping to do what I want.

77
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:40,920
That gives you a sense this is just reading like because they're going after topics that I wasn't trying to use.

79
00:10:42,190 --> 00:11:03,700
So it's just it was intended to be a question, one of the issues.

80
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:12,880
Okay. Okay. So question one of the the easy one.

81
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:25,690
What was it? Well, it's a very long time at the other.

82
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,890
So it did have some things to address.

83
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:41,000
That's the economy. Corporate tax rate is higher taxes for $50 million by 2050.

84
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:50,700
That there's also some of the stuff regarding prescription drugs before also we

85
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:59,350
had a profit forecast for Medicare is an effective negotiating process and stuff.

86
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,660
Exactly. So this is this is gigantic legislation.

87
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:15,669
And one of the interesting questions is whether Y whether it's going to have visual acuity legislation,

88
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,370
which is backlash in November, which is typically what happens.

89
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,900
The public independents always think that what is the government party other direction.

90
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:29,170
But at the same time there was the raid on Mar a Lago and Trump is busy solidifying control of the primaries.

91
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,290
So most of the headlines were about Donald Trump, which meant that the public largely did not vote some of the largest and most transformative policy

92
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:42,670
packages to license Donald Trump's ability to attract media agendas always is never to been investigated.

93
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,530
Okay, next question. It's getting harder. How was it passed?

94
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,770
The answer is not a bill become how a bill becomes law. Right. Scrub.

95
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,070
Schoolhouse Rock. How did this thing actually pass? And why does everyone have to pay attention to Joe Manchin interest in cinema?

96
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,340
5 minutes. Yes.

97
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,640
That's what I imagine. Oh is whole.

98
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,430
And I think it's of.

99
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:37,490
There. That's how I ended up.

100
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:45,070
I was going to be a student of something like this.

101
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:55,330
Listen to what? Let's see if there's a logic to it.

102
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:17,370
So that's why it's good that she's with the GOP leadership in the House and Senate.

103
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:40,180
Oh, it does. Yes. Which is good, because I just I just heard other.

104
00:14:43,700 --> 00:16:07,580
It's. So for me. I was looking at some I read about this, but I just kept saying, oh my goodness, those of us just wait for the government to do it.

105
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,110
So that's what it is.

106
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,340
So what does it say about this government?

107
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah. So that had to be a sliver of evidence.

108
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,370
Yes. Yes.

109
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,410
I think it does make sense. And it was really worded very.

110
00:16:48,760 --> 00:17:15,030
Yes. You know, there's been a number that happens every day, heard 39%.

111
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:25,960
And, yes, they had some sort of.

112
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,450
Like. Such.

113
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:53,040
This is just a few years.

114
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,390
Yes. So you just have.

115
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:34,100
It seems to me that it should be fairly straightforward there and that what's been said likes to say, don't create a tax because you're out of luck.

116
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:54,070
It's just like it's in support of all things.

117
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,590
Right? Yeah.

118
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:07,170
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

119
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,600
I said this one was hard. The Senate is the crazy making.

120
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,849
Does anybody want to take the first step toward explaining why it can even ask how it was?

121
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:22,660
It sounds as if that was a hard question. The magic word begins with our.

122
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:33,380
You have to play this [INAUDIBLE] out, but you should allow it without a filibuster.

123
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,979
Yes. Reconciliation, which is at the end of the word, is a filibuster.

124
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:55,260
Okay, what's a filibuster? Is it a sign of weakness?

125
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,010
And if one side doesn't want to pass.

126
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:10,420
Okay. So. I think it's just taken in the center of disease for very long in the Senate for sort of passing the bill.

127
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,900
So it's not just a really long speech or really long speeches, the pretext for a filibuster.

128
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,440
Anybody else? It. Okay.

129
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,360
So the Senate has a glitch in the rules introduced by Aaron Burr, who tried to clean up the Senate rules.

130
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,900
And as you will, I know the law whenever you try to clean up a body of rules is probably causing more trouble than initially you.

131
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:44,560
So Aaron Burr said in the matter of the Constitution that you have supermajority of votes in the Senate.

132
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,840
Reasonable doubt, obviously.

133
00:20:47,980 --> 00:21:01,540
However, you forgot to include in the Senate rules a provision saying that the same allowing for the Senate to vote to stop discussing the question.

134
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,690
Okay, so Senate votes are a majority of those present,

135
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:12,639
but there's no rule to stop talking and actually vote in the Senate now because the Senate has overlapping terms.

136
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,299
It has been in continuous session since every two years.

137
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,910
It wants to keep itself as the new rules. The Senate has been in continuing session for two years.

138
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,390
Let's. Which means Aaron versus think.

139
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,710
Is still getting the sense. Because it works to the interests of certain people.

140
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:37,850
So what do you do if you have no provision in your rules to allow yourself to stop debating, actually vote?

141
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,570
You do what they call unanimous consent, which is if we all wanted to do something and everybody agreed, we've got to do it not.

142
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,110
All right. Well, they did that for a long time.

143
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,550
And all you have to do that is say, no, I think you should continue to pay your bills.

144
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,350
So they started to clarify the filibuster.

145
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,850
As a rule, it used to be a two thirds vote, and that was in the pressure of passing civil rights legislation.

146
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:10,170
They needed 60 over 40. So the Senate cannot stop debating without a 60 vote supermajority, which can be achieved with the votes of help.

147
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,670
27% from all over the country is enough to elect a blocking majority in the Senate.

148
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,850
So less than one third the population of the United States can elect enough senators to prevent any legislation.

149
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,190
So the Senate has the same 60 vote supermajority to pass legislation,

150
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,510
which is technically a 60 vote supermajority to stop talking and pass legislation.

151
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,719
Do they actually block mail?

152
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,000
Because the flow of it is, say, I would filibuster it, they have votes and they say, all right, go through it, succeed or not.

153
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
Going to waste time is a major reason this old legislation passed in the United States.

154
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,739
But you need to have a budget, right? Like fundamentalism.

155
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:59,300
It is about money and power. So we get to to. So we create the word amendment named after Senator Harry Byrd from West Virginia.

156
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:06,620
Today's West Virginia is a classic. And Harry Byrd price the rules with a simple 50 vote.

157
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,340
Majority of those present. Like democracy.

158
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,810
You can end the debate. They call click here for closure and actually pass the thing.

159
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:21,650
If it's about the budget and if it reduces the deficit, the United States will retain your.

160
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:30,220
There's a very specific rule. And then in the world, they say you can't legislate, right?

161
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,959
You can't use this to smuggle in actual functional legislation.

162
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,370
Right. So it has to be about reducing the deficit by fooling around with money.

163
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,750
The parliamentarian, therefore, says all of the use of that provision is there.

164
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,350
That's the place that's actually taking a look at that reconciliation.

165
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,050
And so the Senate would be talking about.

166
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,640
So the parliamentarian goes through and gives us what they call a birdbath and memorial center for the strike.

167
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:02,900
So everything this legislation says about. Then it goes to the Senate.

168
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:10,400
Now the parliamentarian works for the Senate. So the Republicans have actually under Bush and Trump hired parliamentarian David wrong.

169
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,879
Legally, the Senate can just overrule the right parliamentarian subpoenas, that sort of stuff.

170
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,870
Supreme Court have spoken as an employee of the Senate who was given the task of saying,

171
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,100
I think you should move parts of this provision because it doesn't reflect the spirit of it.

172
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,880
So it's perfectly capable of lying to say that the parliamentarian was wrong.

173
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,990
We've got a parliamentarian, parliamentarian, and we say this legislation.

174
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:39,260
But the basic thing is we govern the United States, essentially reconciliation to avoid the filibuster.

175
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:46,370
And reconciliation is very specific because it's got to be a lot of money to evolve legislation

176
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:53,390
unless the overriding concern and it has to reduce the projected deficit over ten years.

177
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:04,550
So, for example, the Trump tax cuts were projected to reduce the deficit over ten years and anything out of the American economy since 2013.

178
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,809
So the projection throughout the nonsense and they love scheme manipulation by theater.

179
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:17,700
One is getting old now that George Bush's tax cuts included what we called the pro model

180
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,099
from the Trade Commission in which they eliminated the inheritance tax over ten years.

181
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,530
And they've shot that up to the original level of the 11th year in order to pass the deficit reduction goals.

182
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:37,110
So they create a very substantial fiscal incentive for very elderly parents in particular here in order to satisfy people's reconciliation.

183
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,740
There's no evidence that anybody actually took the bubble and such a structure,

184
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,970
but the fact they created it is a sign that this is a very strange procedure we're talking about.

185
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,440
Why am I going into physical health students? Because that shapes precisely what it and do with shapes.

186
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,919
Why we can do that and try to stay. But we can't spend it.

187
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:01,270
Absolutely. Money subsidizing electric cars. Which takes us into a was it costs.

188
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,720
How do they think through what the ire is? Because the headlines, it's a tough time.

189
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,930
To be more precise, who costs it? And how do they think about it?

190
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,720
Who's responsible for figuring out whether it is or is not projected to reduce the deficit over ten years,

191
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:52,130
which is the goal of American public policy. Just.

192
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:15,010
And that's what it's all. But yeah, the medical teams.

193
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:29,510
That's. So then taxpayers are also funding.

194
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:45,260
Meetings. That may not be the biggest chunk of exactly what he said.

195
00:27:45,380 --> 00:28:13,870
He said that when this happens, this year is subject to change and it's great to get these articles up.

196
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:49,870
Isn't that? So.

197
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,399
That's right.

198
00:29:50,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Because it would be like with the paintings, because it's even super intense to try to see.

199
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:19,060
And then there's nothing. There are people who are paying taxes in this.

200
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,800
This is amazing.

201
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:41,280
Yes, it seems like this. The agencies who have to keep track of all the different students.

202
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:53,730
It's just that there's no word and it's just going crazy.

203
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:14,490
Yeah. Yes. So who decides what this costs?

204
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:41,490
The Congressional Budget Office, the CBO. So D.C., you always are hearing about CBO scores because remember,

205
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:48,450
has said you can't taxes through reconciliation unless it reduces the deficit over a ten year period.

206
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:58,300
Therefore, who decides if it reduces the deficit, right? Because it's like a standard joke in business that everything has a projected three three.

207
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,080
Right. So who's actually deciding and whose rules are being played?

208
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:11,680
And the CBO stats by accountants. Right. So for example, you never say never as a policy be improved in anything.

209
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,719
So if you say we're going to spend some money to improve efficiency, the CBO says we don't believe you.

210
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,810
Everybody says that spending money produces efficiency. Therefore, we're just going to count the rule of law in.

211
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay. First of all, this is all in a legislative proceeding.

212
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:33,450
See, through readings that we gave you across the world that you don't get anywhere near Capitol Hill, you might want to read something.

213
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,040
Nothing has changed. Step back and look at the story.

214
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,840
I'm telling you that the United States has a lot of pressing power,

215
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:51,330
including things like skyrocketing insulin prices and crumbling infrastructure and a very, very tough tax code and an IRS that not only does an audit,

216
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,210
rich people, especially because they're complicated and take time,

217
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,650
the IRS can't even answer the phone if you have the misfortune, has a question about your taxes.

218
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:08,370
How do we address any of these problems? Can we address them in the old school bill or Schoolhouse Rock model in which you come forth with

219
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,629
your piece of legislation and it gets passed out of committee and then it's passed in the plenary,

220
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:18,720
and then it's a law. No, you can't. Because the Senate filibuster be instrumentalized by people who represent the

221
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,240
minority population and love the idea of being sort of have a veto over all of this.

222
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,719
If you offered a piece of other piece for the United States, really powerful.

223
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,180
And you're not going to do that, obviously. So the filibuster is persistent.

224
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,200
However, you need to pass budgets. And therefore we create a reconciliation procedure.

225
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:47,010
Which has these rules that it can't be legislation and it has to involve reducing the deficit.

226
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,420
And over time, you know, not only will.

227
00:33:53,030 --> 00:34:00,109
And that is determined by a combination of the parliamentarian who decides what the law and by the Congressional Budget Office,

228
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,860
which decides whether or not it actually is reducing the deficit over a ten year window,

229
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:09,680
which is why you have all sorts of things that are put in the legislation purely to satisfy the Congressional Budget Office.

230
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:18,380
I think very briefly today, the timing of this Harris hearing, a short, long term care and eldercare insurance system in the United States.

231
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,600
And it was never actually implemented because a lot of its purpose was simply passed the Affordable Care Act,

232
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,380
by saying that it was good actuarial ways that it was going to end up reducing just.

233
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,370
This time in the United States federal government today.

234
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,400
You're not going to get your legislative priority through unless you make it budget, not legislation.

235
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,630
And it's somehow part of a package that reduces the deficit over ten years.

236
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,520
All sorts of absolute mysteries, American health care access at this point.

237
00:34:53,060 --> 00:35:00,950
Why did they zero out the inheritance tax and then suddenly have it shoot back up to its original level one year to get the Bush's tax cuts through?

238
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:10,109
Why do we have all these things that very expensive upper middle class people use to reduce the tax liability on their insurance by, for example,

239
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:14,360
like Roth IRA rollovers and all the things that make your eyes glaze over because they

240
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:20,220
waste increased tax revenue in order to pay for tax cuts elsewhere in the budget later.

241
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,600
It's a ten year horizon and it's based entirely on the tests. So how did that work, in essence?

242
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,380
Because I described something works fine for a public you can't legislate except in its tax cuts and deficit reduction.

243
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,740
Well, other than appointing judges, what else does a Republican senator really need to do?

244
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,940
But Republicans care a lot about fiscal policy. Democrats are much more likely to want to legislate.

245
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,830
Democrats wanted to pass the Affordable Care Act. Republicans want to create health savings accounts.

246
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,890
That's the Affordable Care Act, reconciliation.

247
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,810
But you can certainly increase the value of health savings account, flexible spending accounts and stuff like that.

248
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,250
You can change the corporate tax rate within the reconciliation.

249
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,330
You can't create a new tax on corporations or a new wealth tax or something like that.

250
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,200
So this is shaping everything that is possible in American politics.

251
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:20,450
So if you go to Washington, D.C., I have an idea for legislation. You might be taken as a naive if you go to Washington and you say,

252
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:26,860
I have something that's got papers which you can put the reconciliation and the parts of it.

253
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,430
So if I go in Washington and for example, Medicare for All.

254
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,450
Can it be done through reconciliation? Therefore, for current working purposes, today cannot be done.

255
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,500
You have to get 60 votes in the Senate. There's no scenario currently where you can let what you can find.

256
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,190
60 Democrats were completely on the side of Medicare for All who has.

257
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,799
Therefore, it's a pipe dream. Therefore, if you want to improve health care, access the opportunity.

258
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,540
Reconciliation. Likewise go to climate change.

259
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,390
Cap and trade involves creating a new legal regime in which you basically create carbon credits,

260
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,450
and polluters have to purchase credits for the right to pollute.

261
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,980
That's what it's like. It's what happens in the Senate.

262
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,520
I. So what do you do with the reconciliation in the inflation reduction?

263
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,909
You try to create concentrate. What do you do instead?

264
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:33,180
A lot of you know what was in it with regard to climate change. I hear a lot of people say we've got something else.

265
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,970
Isn't there a subsidy for a subsidy on subsidies?

266
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,650
On subsidies. On subsidies.

267
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:51,570
They'll buy electric car for about two years and then it's going to be a hard copy of Electric Cars because the subsidy points,

268
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:56,430
the subsidies for solar panels, subsidies for public sector organizations to do things like green,

269
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,480
they're building hospitals, subsidies for motherboards.

270
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,770
You cannot pass legislation like The Economist wanted us to, but like I didn't have.

271
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,090
And so you get these American public policy being forced through this budget process.

272
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,830
So Republicans do things through the tax codes as Democrats do things through expenditures.

273
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,230
And everybody has to pretend what they really want to do is reduce the deficit

274
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,380
over ten years with the hands of the committees and take a grip on the country.

275
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,160
So okay. So I've answered the question for right,

276
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,960
because the Senate is one of the least Democratic and most structurally biased legislatures in the entire world.

277
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:44,480
I'm not sure if you anybody from California. All right, one powerful.

278
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,630
Move to Wyoming, you become 67 times more powerful.

279
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,830
As soon as you get that Wyoming driver's license and voter registration,

280
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,840
that's the sale of a disproportionate part of the largest economy in the world.

281
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:07,260
If it were a country who said it's Wyoming, that's about 30% more people than Washtenaw County, Michigan, two senators.

282
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,810
Los Angeles County has more people than Michigan or North Carolina.

283
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:19,810
It's big enough to see California. Furthermore, what are they going to be?

284
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:24,910
Populated, all represented states. Involved states. Why do we have to impose?

285
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,270
Because in the Asian system, we all need to away no longer.

286
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,350
Now we have to see the quotas as a very specific, very,

287
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:40,180
very clearly documented policy to maintain the Republican Senate majority in the late 19th century.

288
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,540
By admitting states that would vote Republican if that was how the Republicans held the Senate for a series of elections and by creating a new,

289
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:55,970
very, very densely populated states, the purpose was to maintain reconstruction in the South, which was a very admirable purpose.

290
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,020
But nonetheless, it left us with an explicit system explicitly designed to represent a certain kind of state which is small,

291
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,970
homogeneous, dependent on resource extraction, coal for Wyoming, for example.

292
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,500
And then we started working out what kind of workarounds we come up with.

293
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,290
Well, for example, it used to be that you filibuster, you could filibuster you.

294
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:27,269
We did get special rules on judges. Because Democrats hope majorities in Congress long appoint judges so the Senate can agree wildly appointed judges,

295
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,500
even if they're all saying that they don't. They want their own business.

296
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:42,130
Likewise, conservative Democrats and Republicans can agree the tax cuts and inflation reduction and as a faction are a good thing.

297
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,670
Progressive Democrats, like legislators,

298
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,149
they're at least willing to go along with this because they finally figured out this basic model of a car for you.

299
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,840
A car for your car for use on electric is something Democrats.

300
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,760
With the result that if you go to Washington, Martin said, you know, it is still a lot better.

301
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,760
It doesn't require any actual legislation. Yeah.

302
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:12,140
I think what we're going to do is jump to the talk about this because you're clearly enjoying legislative process a great deal.

303
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,150
So I want you to think about some of the implications and think about this legislation because it's not I wasn't joking.

304
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,590
If you look at media viewership, it is really,

305
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:29,149
really clear that offered a choice between FBI agents raiding Donald Trump's private

306
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:34,730
residence at Mar a Lago and explaining an enormously consequential area of public policy.

307
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,510
No surprise to you that cable rolling news is going to follow the police car, right?

308
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,340
This is huge, right?

309
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,180
I think I can say with absolute confidence that all of our career is going to be affected by it and quite likely also that all of our.

310
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,150
We're probably not going to need to replace our tires quite as frequently, which is an immediate,

311
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,150
practical benefit because of the sheer amount of money going into green infrastructure.

312
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:05,250
So I want you to do. We start trying to think through what the implications of this are.

313
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:10,989
Because I started giving you forcing everything through the strainer of reconciliation

314
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:17,049
produces very fragmented and expensive policy and absolute paradise for a certain,

315
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:26,480
very precise kind of accountant. Go back to the IRA and specifically think about drug pricing, which is the single most salient thing.

316
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:31,910
And start trying to think about what this means. Okay. Focus on what happened.

317
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:40,180
Chat groups. There's a jam board. And the point is to try and draw some conclusions about how this whole thing works.

318
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,150
And this is kind of a crucial one, because remember I said the parliamentarian works for the Senate.

319
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,129
But if I hired adviser, the adviser says I'm wrong. I'm free to fire my advisor.

320
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,510
Overruled. Advisor. So when do they and when Bill face the question?

321
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,670
So pairs chat insulin.

322
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:18,080
The. Any.

323
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:54,200
Every year that this is what the president used to say, but it's not one of those institutions like socialism.

324
00:43:55,350 --> 00:44:16,150
So even this year, it's a bit of a one sided with all of us because of that.

325
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,850
Yeah. So nothing to renegotiate.

326
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:52,740
So. Yeah. And, and then of course, you know, so we expect to be able to see more.

327
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,100
So it's you to I yeah.

328
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:12,820
I don't have any sense at all.

329
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:18,920
Ever since then, I don't think.

330
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:31,320
It's very interesting.

331
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,420
I think he might tell you this. Yes.

332
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:48,700
It's like I said, yes.

333
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:56,600
It's actually the most important for energy.

334
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:14,790
Oh, I don't know. That's for sure. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:24,470
He said you're having another rush hour and a half.

336
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:37,770
Yeah. Yeah.

337
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:49,430
So we have a few, but we are very tight.

338
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:55,600
All right, that's nice.

339
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:05,610
Well, I think it's. It's good to see this.

340
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:57,190
Because I think it's great that we are here to talk for others.

342
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:26,640
It's like, you know, the thing with all of the driving for the rest of the way, it was pretty much less than half a billion people.

343
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:39,170
And they all maybe it's like a crisis and it really hasn't been done.

344
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:55,910
Yes. Yes. There is a sense of crisis as well.

345
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:12,690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:30,500
I, I, I think that's what would you see so they can go to war.

347
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:38,760
Yeah, y y I think.

348
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:58,790
I don't know if you want more, but I just want to say this.

349
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:07,420
I probably nothing like it.

350
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:21,770
But maybe if more funding for education or private hearings.

351
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:39,000
Here it is. Just so we think this is said biggest breakfast.

352
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:48,330
Things are looking up at your door.

353
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,220
So yeah, this is your career this year.

354
00:50:53,530 --> 00:51:21,300
And then I would say I'd like to be your age.

355
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:36,370
So it's like if you don't like like like I said, I guess.

356
00:51:37,200 --> 00:52:01,000
Yeah. I think the problem is you can participate in the secret meetings and various types of things like this happens.

357
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:26,010
Yeah. I'm not sure if you like at this point because they have against so.

358
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:40,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

359
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:52,540
Yeah. I don't know any of those things you love.

360
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:33,909
So it's not like you're not familiar with this capitalizing on the sources and how it's true.

361
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:52,050
I just don't like, I don't know what it is like here and there, but really the only people who can be like assistant.

362
00:53:52,580 --> 00:54:31,600
And so if it's because there's all these guys and I think that was just because that was the number one thing is just wait here.

363
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:42,460
Okay. So we can start with I hope is by now you know that the territory that precedes.

364
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,489
What's your take on it? First of all, what about the changes in drug prices?

365
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:57,080
Is that kind of to build? Which most of you have already said.

366
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,580
So I know everybody knows it.

367
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:15,470
One of the changes is that other firms will be represented for Medicare and negotiate a certain number of drug prices each year.

368
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:22,920
I think starting maybe two or three years ago, certainly we would like to have this attitude or something along those lines and then but they're

369
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:30,690
inviting the pharmaceutical industry to engage in those negotiations actively is what I write.

370
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:41,130
And the other one I remember what we've talked about is that excluded has an average $35 or so, 100 Medicare hits to negotiate drug prices.

371
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,740
This is. Which is my word carefully.

372
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:54,050
It is insanely unusual that the United States has an enormous drug purchasing program that should not negotiate prices.

373
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:59,680
It was frustrating. This was not a political accident that is being redressed.

374
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:07,670
But as you said, this is very slow. Right. So they going to pick over years a list of most expensive drugs and negotiate them.

375
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:14,380
And the list will very slowly get longer. So those are the two policies, right?

376
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,460
The $75 a month cap on out-of-pocket expenditures.

377
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:24,700
By the way, it's not legislation, but on the other hand, who controls the Senate?

378
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:31,480
So this is actually you can't pay more than five bucks a month for the people we're going to love.

379
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:38,380
And if you have that needs going without insulin is a profoundly harmful attitude.

380
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:44,130
Okay. To be like in the frame of frame of the 3DS.

381
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,900
Equitable. That's not.

382
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:06,360
We are saying all because, well, it's going on out of pocket for us, but that's about it.

383
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,370
Was that efficient? Well, pretty effective.

384
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:17,680
Which is tax efficient based on a separate.

385
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:25,460
Well, it must be able to reduce emissions.

386
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:34,390
There is not much talk in American politics with the deficit reduction commission that question the deficit reduction.

387
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,080
But you can reduce the deficit by not buying a house with a mortgage.

388
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:43,420
It might be a good idea to buy a house. Are you going to deficit by car?

389
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:47,770
Is it good to have debt? Not necessarily have car.

390
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:58,900
One of the things curiosity, though, is like if you eventually end up having very sick or dead before these sorts of things.

391
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:04,510
So if somebody is really not considered because they have uncontrolled diabetes,

392
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:11,280
their contribution to the tax revenue of the United States is going to be quite a lot because putting the resources to work.

393
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,370
So that's the kind of calculation we could make.

394
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:21,940
But the CBO doesn't because they're accounts and accounts that complicated causal relationship for what?

395
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:31,480
Effectively. No, no. But what, for example, do things like the effectiveness of the drug pricing applications?

396
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:45,240
The other side of your commentary is that you make. Sorry.

397
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:51,660
I know you got a few drugs.

398
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:55,680
So why have any given drug rights stuff? For example, are you familiar with.

399
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:02,490
So, for example, there's some insanely expensive drugs, right? One of the drugs on the market to treat hepatitis.

400
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:08,100
Only makes sense if you do the alternative. A liver transplant. It's cheaper than a liver transplant.

401
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,100
But we're talking six figures for basically a five week course of medicine.

402
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,380
So that's very likely to be lost because literally the trustees of Medicare put out a warning that that brother won't,

403
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,880
given the incidence of hepatitis in the United States, might actually be enough to bankrupt Medicare.

404
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,880
I mean, you get to the point in the company, you know,

405
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:31,710
if you bankrupt Medicare and you definitely produce some shareholder value, but that drug is in many ways being targeted.

406
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,250
Now as a little bit of gossip. The top Democrat working for the pharmaceutical lobby,

407
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:43,620
which is from a Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers Association, got fired immediately after this past.

408
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:50,520
Because it was a shock. Pharma doesn't lose. Pharma lost at all.

409
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:54,389
They didn't find the top Republican because the Republicans all voted against it,

410
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,900
but they fired their top Democrat because it constitutes a massive failure from the

411
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,620
perspective of the Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers Association in Washington.

412
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:07,770
To have any price negotiation in Medicare, let alone a cap on out-of-pocket expenditures for insulin.

413
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:19,970
So. What's the date today? If you're a politician, what is 100% of your consciousness right now?

414
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:31,910
The elections. So why did Democrats decide to do the $35 market cap and break Senate rules to do it?

415
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,040
And why would I have all the things they could possibly do?

416
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:40,010
Why don't they run around telling you that if you can just hang on to your car for three years,

417
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:50,590
you could get an amazing range of really good electric cars. But maybe not in two years.

418
01:00:50,600 --> 01:01:03,640
This is not an election, not this, but they're like laundry list to check it off just for the of it.

419
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,250
Yeah, it's fast and it's very, very tangible. Right.

420
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,630
Do you understand the concept, the $35 KAPLAN Insulin prices.

421
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:19,010
Yes, you do, especially if you need to buy. So this is something the Democrats wanted to do because it's a very nice, clean policy.

422
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:22,100
They can say this is a Democratic policy. And we didn't.

423
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:30,840
Everything else is either more complicated. Causal chain, right? People who buy cars generally think car makers design cars, not Congress.

424
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:38,410
The fact that the carmakers are designing their cars 100% to run things coming from Congress is not necessarily to be appreciated outside of.

425
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:47,010
$35. Nice intangible. You can say this is the thing that the Democratic Party did and it could go to the election.

426
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:07,640
So that out-of-pocket cap in the factors that does that take total from 45 requested it's not a patient but it's as short as they make.

427
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:14,410
So I don't know the exact time but basically what they're doing is they're just ordering insurance companies that they have to do that.

428
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:18,660
And it probably that's an interesting question.

429
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,770
So I'll skip on the what should the Biden administration do now?

430
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:30,480
But the reason I ask that question is this is going to become increasingly apparent next week in the United States.

431
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:36,729
Just because an interest in this case pharmaceutical companies have lost does not mean bad stuff.

432
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:42,880
Right. So there will be lawsuits. They're going to be absolutely going after the Biden administration on regulatory challenges.

433
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:50,530
Just like in the same way billing legislation was weak, the Biden administration rewrote it to make it a good deal stronger.

434
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:57,909
They push the regulatory structure as far as they could. Money wrote the regulations and now they get to see quite memorably.

435
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:04,840
The protagonist is an emergency doctor from Long Island who is like exactly what you would ask someone

436
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,870
if you think you could walk around like big lots of little doctors being forced into retirement,

437
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,300
which is something else. Very, very rich guy. It's a slip.

438
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:19,860
Not every time you look. In other words, the battle never stops.

439
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,670
Right. That's how popular interest actually dies.

440
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,800
It goes way round and pharmaceutical industry is not going to die at all.

441
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,660
What you might see is less constant innovation in insulin delivery and insulin production,

442
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:41,570
because the incentive to do that was to keep insulin up at the same time.

443
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:46,050
Why insulin? That is a great question. Why is.

444
01:03:54,450 --> 01:04:04,729
I'm. Like a lot of Americans out there, a lot of Americans have diabetes and or one or some other characteristics.

445
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:08,940
So it's common, right? A lot of people. It is. It's a growing kind of population.

446
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:26,280
Know. I feel like it's a little process, but it's and like a big ask for us to look at, especially for us.

447
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:30,720
Okay. But why is the Democrats so critical?

448
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:50,270
But I think this is a very expensive and there are a lot of Americans who say as a and.

449
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,590
So right now, this is something a lot of people experience.

450
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:02,970
It's hard not to know a person with diabetes to him. I've been harping on the consequences of not having insulin are really, really bad.

451
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:11,100
Right. This is one of these medicines where, you know, the medicine versus registration sitting on the top of this.

452
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:18,140
And it's very easily understandable. You know, the prices have actually been so.

453
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:29,140
And furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry is the absolute best suited to this task that college graduates what industries they like to work in.

454
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:35,120
It just taking industry has good. Pharmaceuticals is number one in the U.S. right now.

455
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,940
It's actually starting to look around in the neighborhood of health insurance.

456
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:44,130
The pharmaceutical companies take that as a leading indicator of popular policy failure of.

457
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,940
So the Democrats went ahead and did it because it has all the characteristics of a policy.

458
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:55,330
The voters will give you credit. $35 is understandable.

459
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:59,240
Insulin is understandable. The problem is understandable. The problem is widespread.

460
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,720
Absolutely impossible. Somebody takes it for you that there was very much difference.

461
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:10,550
And that's how you get this kind of policymaking. They wrote the Senate rules to do it.

462
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:17,230
They did it because they've got the midterms coming up. Otherwise, we ended up having these two health policy issues,

463
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:24,140
one that got the Democrats on fire because the concept of price negotiations is anathema to the brand of pharmaceutical industry.

464
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:32,000
One of the Senate rules that is something that is probably going to pay off in the election is that when they hold a whole lot of people.

465
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,069
Pretty quickly. Takeaways from this I'm going to do it is a skills class.

466
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,580
I think it is really hard and boring and you get lost.

467
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:49,670
But there's a story in Barack Obama's memoir of his time in office that people are more straight.

468
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:58,270
There's a lot of. Where he went around courtesy calls as a new senator because you think you just did the lesson of the U.S. Senate it like you did.

469
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:09,590
And he went to Robert Byrd who supported his. So every and Byrd pointed to the Senate rules that his letter about all these people.

470
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:14,420
And he said, Memorize that as if you have. Now?

471
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:20,440
Well, I had a different plan for getting access to the get out of this hopscotch right out of the sun, which is really good at getting.

472
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:26,520
But don't underestimate it. Right? Understanding and being able to manipulate the rules.

473
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:35,529
Understanding the rules and being able to network is absolutely crucial and shapes the kinds of public policies and health policies that they shape.

474
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:40,040
What we could do, they shape, for example, to go action for most of us.

475
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:46,509
Because what's something? It's a lot like it's something. Last night.

476
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:53,230
He said it was pretty a pretty horrible and very quick death. Having happy times is an absolute fantastic idea.

477
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:58,570
EpiPens are extremely expensive and they're designed to go after about six months.

478
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:06,680
And did I mention that Senator Joe Manchin was the pivotal vote, without which the entire event completely collapses?

479
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,090
His daughter is chief executive of a company that makes other parts.

480
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,630
I don't think he's getting out of the Senate to go back and say one of the price controls on his.

481
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:20,720
Right. But it's. I can see how popular pharmaceutical companies are.

482
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:26,450
I can see how popular keeping people with the this sun.

483
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:43,330
Season through such happy topics is capturing.
