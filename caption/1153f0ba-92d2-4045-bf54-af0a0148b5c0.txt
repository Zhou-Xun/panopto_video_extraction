1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,620
Much. I don't know. What am I missing?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:12,150
Something should be a discrepancy, which is difficult to see what's going on.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:26,040
So hopefully I don't think he's like, yeah, it's like, what is this university.

4
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:34,650
Yeah, that's what I. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:43,760
No, I feel that. Oh my goodness.

6
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,310
How do you feel or how do you think it's like.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,719
Yeah, I try to watch it. I mean, it's currently not even, you know, I don't watch that.

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,890
You know, I think it's because they're so stupid, my friend.

9
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:19,379
She just had a few announcements before we get started on the lecture we have our exam is is Wednesday and I'm

10
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,130
not going to be here no real ideas are my post-doc Jesse Contreras is going to be from during the exam year.

11
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:37,379
And so everything is is pretty much the same exam format very much the same probably a little bit more short answer than last one.

12
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:47,960
But again, the format is very similar and there'll be a few questions on you determine the next year,

13
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,510
which is what Jim Trussell, our guest lecturer, has been talking about.

14
00:01:53,370 --> 00:02:04,650
Okay. So Jim Trussell is a professor emeritus at Trinity College and he and I have been working for over 20 years in Ecuador.

15
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,459
And environmental effects, the transmission team as a medical anthropologist,

16
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:19,320
so much different orientation towards thinking about disease and disease process than epidemiology and ecologists.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,860
And we've talked a lot about social processes in this class.

18
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:32,850
I think Jim will have a slightly different take, but a more nuanced and sophisticated take on this and what we stand for it.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,540
Yeah. So that's another do.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,080
Okay, thanks. How many of you have any kind of social science background?

21
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,999
Raise your hand if you do you some uncertainties.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A little bit of somebody are like straight biology chemistry those kinds of things we're

23
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,610
not getting of gets whether you're very tired or the rest of you or something else.

24
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,780
Man Math. Anybody got one?

25
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,169
Joe Anything?

26
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,130
Any categories we missed like a lot. Come on.

27
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,350
Partnership, arts. Arts, raise your hand. Arts, know it.

28
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,080
All right, if you'd like to raise your hand. Raise your hand right now.

29
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,030
Yeah. All right. I'm just trying to get a sense of what, you know, it helps me as a presenter.

30
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,010
Done field work abroad already. Okay.

31
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,430
On a deep track. There's your hand, hoping maybe what I'm going to say.

32
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:53,510
Probably a couple more. All right. So what I want to do, you know, like I'm the I'm the guest social scientist, so I want to graze a little bit.

33
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,729
And basically, I'm going to give you some ideas about what I'm thinking about.

34
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:05,330
Society and culture matters. Why do I think epidemiologists should do a lot more of that than they do,

35
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:13,460
which is exactly and why this benefits your thinking and your research and your work.

36
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:24,200
But what that means is I have about three or four different kinds of presentations from which I want to give you some highlights.

37
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,170
So I'm going to be frustrated because I would rather just give one presentation.

38
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:39,600
But if I only give one presentation, I don't feel like I'm giving you enough about the multiple ways in which I think society and culture matter.

39
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,499
Let's see how we do. I'm saying this is obvious.

40
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,260
I don't usually apologize for my lectures, but I wanted to try to do it this way because it kind of felt like the right way to do it.

41
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:59,010
I can watch your faces, even if you have an accent. And the more this kind of stuff you do or this kind of stuff you do or that kind of stuff you do,

42
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,700
the better able I will be to calibrate how I'm doing.

43
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,040
Okay. Deal. Thank you. That's a good start.

44
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,770
So let me begin with what I want to do.

45
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,860
All right. First, the theories should do more to influence research than they may.

46
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,650
All research should be based in theory. All research is based in theory.

47
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,050
How explicit those theories are is not always clear. They should be more explicit than they are.

48
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,110
Second. Epidemics are contextual. They're not uniform entities.

49
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,170
Their characteristics matter depending on where they are.

50
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,050
And given my training and experience and interest, a lot of that context is social and cultural context.

51
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:53,870
I don't mean to imply it's the only kind of context that matters. Microbiome or microbiome or context matters.

52
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:06,280
But. Epidemics are not, from my opinion, best studied from the perspective of what you're learning about the pathogen.

53
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,980
From my perspective, epidemics are best studied for how it is that you're learning.

54
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,610
The arrival of the pathogen within some kind of particular context develops.

55
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:26,200
And that context is environmental, it's social, it's behavioral, it's microbiome, it's a whole array of other kinds of things as well.

56
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:37,060
So it are not, from my perspective, isn't just a characteristic of the pathogen, it's also characteristic of the context in which a pathogen lands.

57
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,010
I'll do some talking about ethnography.

58
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:51,340
The tool of anthropology, extended observation of lived behavior in most of the context is useful in epidemiology.

59
00:06:51,460 --> 00:07:00,430
It helps to construct kinds of causal assemblages, the kinds of theory driven rationales for combinations of variables that helps drive transmission.

60
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,190
That knowledge is a useful component of that process,

61
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,740
and it's unpacked in that paper of which I was a coauthor in The Lancet reading that's assigned for you for today.

62
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,910
So if you don't get what I'm saying today, read that again. And it should be pretty clear.

63
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:21,440
It's a short commentary. Finally, science itself is social, and I think it's important to say that.

64
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,180
To an audience because it's too easily forgotten.

65
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:34,110
And the way I want to live it at the end is to say your own ability to disseminate your research

66
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,730
is in part constructed by the social environment in which you're trying to disseminate.

67
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,459
We all know this is a result of COVID, and I'll give you a very quick overview of some of the ways in which the highlights and

68
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,200
lowlights of the ways in which information and misinformation was disseminated during COVID.

69
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,940
But your challenge in your own careers is going to be how do you influence the public, whoever your chosen audience is?

70
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,580
Do you know who your audience will be? How do you adapt your message to the audience that you choose?

71
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,909
So that's the take home message at the end. And prior to that, the Scenography itself is not repeat itself in the theater.

72
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:18,000
Firms themselves are useful participants in this process looking to understand lived experience as it is undertaken by those outside the

73
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,750
cement block walls and also doing the one about exactly because we're doing a study now and it's a graphic study of long term surveillance,

74
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,659
the long term epidemiologic survey. What is it to participate in long term empty logics around and how does that influence

75
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,489
response rates and willingness to continue to participate in research in their project?

76
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,760
For John, I've been working on in Ecuador for 20 years and I want somebody student to help me in doing coding and some

77
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,050
analysis of that data that's now being collected by an ethnographer in lowland Esmeraldas province in Ecuador.

78
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:59,249
That person has to be a fluent Spanish speaker. But if you're interested in the position given you've heard what I say, get in touch with you over.

79
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,600
Send me an email, my emails at the end. So that's just flagging for us doing the system.

80
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,960
So that's why that's in there. Okay. Any questions yet?

81
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,910
So far, so good. So a little bit of really basic background.

82
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:19,260
Why do we talk about social research and oppose it to or join it with behavior research?

83
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:27,180
There's an office inside NIH that's the Office of Behavioral Social, Social Science Research they put together.

84
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:35,280
From my perspective, we need to be careful to be able to differentiate these to talk about is to say we're pertaining our conversation to norms,

85
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,120
rules, expectations of groups. Institutions are really important here.

86
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:49,450
When we're talking about culture, though, we're trying to talk more about ideas and meanings shared understandings, not necessarily shared.

87
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,459
Overall, culture is contested. There are various subcultures inside cultures.

88
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,580
Meanings are constructed through time and they change. So most anthropologists are pretty uncomfortable with that kind of analysis.

89
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,710
I would say this is a cultural explanation. This cultural group believes this.

90
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,780
We don't tend to talk that way anymore. We did it in the 1950s and sixties and seventies, but we don't anymore.

91
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,740
But that doesn't mean we don't pay attention to how beliefs, government behavior.

92
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,230
And again, when we get to the example at the end,

93
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,290
I hope to beat you up a little bit over the head a little bit with the ways in which culture mattered and matters.

94
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:33,140
Like what does it mean to wear a mask? To our willingness to become exposed to exposure or the dangers of becoming exposed to circumstances.

95
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,200
Behavior is a tiny little bit more straightforward in the sense of behaviors.

96
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,320
And defining it in, as many others do, is it's how people act.

97
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:50,090
It's the actual observable actions within which humans interact with and change their environment through some kind of physical.

98
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,200
Usually it's external and verbal rather than motivational and emotional.

99
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,839
But you will find psychiatric and psychological epidemiologists also talking about, you know, emotional behaviors, too.

100
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,739
So it gets weekly pretty quick and then social determinants of health, well, then that gets to find lots of different ways.

101
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:15,780
This Department of Health and Social Services expert group in Social Determinants says it's the conditions in the environments where people are born,

102
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,240
live, learn, workplace, respond age that affect the range of health, functioning and quality of life outcomes.

103
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,270
That's a kind of a fairly not very specific definition,

104
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,290
but I think what's important to recognize is the way they're defining it includes the division into economics,

105
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:38,339
education, health care, access, neighborhood built environments and whatever the social community context is.

106
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,690
I don't know because from my perspective, access to services is more context.

107
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:50,370
But anyway, okay, so understand that these words are complicated, multiple be defined sometimes in competition with one another.

108
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,979
You need to understand what they mean if you're going to use them. And I think they should be used more often and understood better.

109
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,450
And epidemiology. This OBSS, our office says about theories.

110
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:11,160
We'll pay attention. Our theories have improved only incrementally, while the technologies have changed exponentially.

111
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Public health practitioners need to think more concretely, expansively and deeply about how they and their coworkers use theory.

112
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,800
It interests me saying this. It's great. Big an idea up there and up recommending the same kind of thing.

113
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,809
To the extent you are interested, you can look up some of these theories and pay attention to this ladies as in your only.

114
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,680
Because I want to emphasize that there are different levels of theories and different kinds of theories.

115
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:41,600
And since theories, government research, different kinds of theories point to particular kinds of interventions and understandings.

116
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:49,440
So this rational actor model is in large part the success of social psychology inside public health.

117
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:56,129
And a lot of health interventions are designed around these rational actor models health, belief model.

118
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,550
You've probably all heard of that one. If you haven't, you don't pay attention in public school.

119
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,700
There is a reason. Action. Social cognitive theory. All of these privileged individual behavior, mentation and understanding of the world.

120
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:15,930
So if you're using help belief model, you are induced or seduced or led or driven into paying attention to individual behavior,

121
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,640
individual beliefs, individual motivations. That's a very different kind of intervention than the kind you were led into.

122
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:27,610
If you use the kinds of social studies that are listed below unintended consequences of social action, social constructs,

123
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:34,060
reality, social suffering, male power those lead you toward different kinds of interventions than the ones on the still others.

124
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,670
That's the only point I want to make. Obviously, I could spend a whole lecture just on some of these.

125
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,150
That's not what I want to do. The point is to say these are all out there.

126
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,600
These are being used. And they have implications for what it is that you are able to think about and what

127
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,710
it is you're able to think about doing and to induce and help others to do as well.

128
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,670
It's not clear.

129
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:08,080
Leases are also of limited value to adopt a program oriented solely toward modifying an individual's behaviors in teaching, look for cooking methods.

130
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,990
A more productive strategy would include environmental change, expanding availability and affordability of nutritious food choices.

131
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,380
There are many theories of policy and organizational change that complement individually oriented theories, but they're underutilized.

132
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:31,130
So again, which theory you're using, which theory the people you're working with are using is helping to drive your own attention.

133
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,380
And too much of public health research pays attention to individuals.

134
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,650
Even though we call it overkill,

135
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:45,260
we don't pay enough attention to the epidemiology is one of the most public health subdisciplines that really tries to pay attention to populations.

136
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,389
That's why I study it. That's why I love it. But in the calibrations that you inevitably will have,

137
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:57,209
you need to be cognizant of and careful of the ways in which you are going to

138
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,680
be induced to pay attention to individuals rather than populations as a whole.

139
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,440
It isn't easy to think about population level interventions.

140
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,540
If what you're doing is educating everybody, that's not the population level of your pension, really.

141
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:17,180
It's a series of individual actions. Okay.

142
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,360
Exercise. And it wasn't much time.

143
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,580
But I want to try and provoke you and make you frustrated and give a little bit of time to talk to.

144
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,710
Imagine you're in a graveyard.

145
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,290
You have a chance to see the outcome of a pathogen.

146
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,290
Long enduring in a populous. 50 years.

147
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:51,850
This is what you're seeing. The axes are male deaths.

148
00:15:52,810 --> 00:16:02,160
The workers are female. That's. You can see some movement over time.

149
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:13,220
If we think about. When people are dying in the age distribution, a larger proportion is in these years than it is in these years.

150
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,080
Comments yet. What might this be?

151
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,280
That's what I want you to talk about. And rather than just giving you this horrendous thing.

152
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,550
I'll give you a summary of that horrendous thing. Basically saying.

153
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,180
Yes. Started high in the fifties and came down, stopped by the late 2000s.

154
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,780
More kids dying, beginning declining over time.

155
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,400
Higher proportion of females among those just beginning, declining through time.

156
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,070
So sit with a neighbor or somebody else in your group.

157
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,299
I'm only going to give you about 3 minutes to kind of play around with the idea,

158
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,830
but what I want you to pay attention with is not so much what was it as it is?

159
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,610
What questions do I need to ask to try to understand what it might be?

160
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,920
Right. Your goal is not to solve this in 2 minutes, although maybe some of you will, because you know it already.

161
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,390
But people who figured this out. Took about ten years to figure it out.

162
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,740
So it's not a simple question. I don't know the answer. Break.

163
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,850
What questions you need to ask. What do you need to talk about? Trying to understand what this might be.

164
00:17:36,180 --> 00:18:00,840
For some of us, what I was thinking is what is the now is of exactly what I see, at least that which I believe is right.

165
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:27,450
And I thought that's what happened exactly, is what I saw when I was thinking that would just be more for mothers or younger children.

166
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:47,250
Yeah, I think one of the things I was able to do some work on this show, it was like, okay, I'm just going to call that reductive lol.

167
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,560
Even though it really wasn't a low point because I'm trying to jam too much stuff down your throat.

168
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,059
What kind of questions are you asking? Can I hear some of your can we hear some of your questions?

169
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,810
Group somebody one questions. But this one is beautiful.

170
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:13,080
Oh, I'll go with your tone. So first, all the things we're thinking about were why is it disproportionately affecting females versus males?

171
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,730
What is why is it affecting younger kids look good?

172
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,559
What kind of arms? What was causing the decrease?

173
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,360
What why did it all of a sudden just decrease over time? Good. Relevant questions.

174
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,420
Important. Other other suggestions. Different. Different lines of inquiry.

175
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,730
What? What social configurations might drive.

176
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:56,780
I create a context for the transmission of a pathogen that would differentially influence young kids and women.

177
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:05,000
What kinds of social conditions might drive an epidemic that has that kind of outcome?

178
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,210
What might do that in a society? That's what I ask as a social scientist all the time.

179
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,570
Is that a potential answer would be something like Was there a drop in first rates?

180
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,800
So you're seeing older people. Okay. So some of this could be denominators.

181
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,040
I didn't even give you that. Sure. Good suggestion.

182
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,290
Other ideas. What about behaviors?

183
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,680
I guess like one thought I had to. One of the first questions I would like answered is like, where?

184
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,860
Where specifically is this year? And what is the historical context of what's going on right now in this population?

185
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:49,060
Right. Right. Because if this epidemic were someplace else, it probably wouldn't have happened at all.

186
00:20:50,490 --> 00:21:00,060
It's been a unique combination of the pathogen arriving in a particularly receptive context that allowed this particular epidemic to take place.

187
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,260
So you want to know what it is? Anybody know what it is? We didn't know already.

188
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,790
Good. Because you should have figured out with this press to be scared for your intelligence.

189
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,970
It's called Kuru. Oh, okay. Slow virus.

190
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,850
What? It was originally called a serious infection. Prion disease, New Guinea highlands.

191
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,740
About 15 villages where this was an outbreak.

192
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,910
One particular area of a for people in Highland, New Guinea.

193
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:40,000
Slow virus infection. Infection probably from some kind of genetic mutation in about 1930, 1935, 1940,

194
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:55,970
no later than that landing in the brain of a human who lived in a society where the ritual performance of grief involved the consumption of your kin.

195
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:06,590
And sorry for those, Ken. But this pathogen was found in spinal cord tissue and brains.

196
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,070
In the ritual consumption of kinfolk.

197
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,850
People have priority over different parts of the body.

198
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,310
And this happens with human bodies. It happens with animal bodies. It happens with protein consumption in general.

199
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:31,040
We've last. In most societies agricultural and trans humanoid migrant societies who reached last.

200
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,610
Women. And who else these last. Children.

201
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,780
Men and older people eat first.

202
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:48,060
So the preferred parts of these mortuary rituals are the known spinal cord tissue, known brain stuff.

203
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,390
That's what the meaning of the women and kids.

204
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,900
It was the infected tissue and that's why they acquired this low virus infection.

205
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,420
When Australian missionaries and the Australian Government occupied what is now called Papua New Guinea,

206
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:07,089
they outlawed the practice of ritual mortuary practices, also called cannibalism.

207
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,570
But anthropologists hate that word because it has all these other images that come up.

208
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:19,419
And the fact is that kind of funny stuff about getting people to one of the things that was done and we use

209
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:26,350
extended back over to say European we sorry when people had epileptic seizures people would drink their blood.

210
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:33,680
So it isn't only they the did cannibalism needed cannibalism to.

211
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,400
But the point of my narration now is that the government outlawed cannibalism.

212
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,400
So the exposure stopped. But this is a slow virus, so the deaths continue.

213
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:57,000
And so it's the fact that cannibalism or mortuary Indo militarism was ended in about 1960 and is why there was no more explosion.

214
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,020
The deaths continued for decades afterward, and that's the end of the epidemic.

215
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:06,900
There hasn't been a group of deaths, I think, identified since 2013 or 14, something like that.

216
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:12,280
Okay. Wasn't that fun? Sorry.

217
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,270
We could spend a whole class on that. But I move on.

218
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,800
Any important question now? Okay.

219
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:30,380
Can you hear me in the back of my projecting back enough. Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit about causal assemblages.

220
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,450
How do we come to terms with and how do we make sense of the array of features

221
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,740
of these different kinds of contexts in which epidemic epidemics flourish?

222
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,180
To understand what's really driving it, in the case of Kuru, the combination of age and sex, as was pointed out.

223
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,140
Good question. Good point. Cultural rules about death and mourning.

224
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:56,290
If people in that area didn't eat one another, there was no pathogen transmission.

225
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:07,480
But it's also cultural rules about power and priority because there's women and children last that makes the difference in the shape of the epidemic.

226
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:12,100
Okay. Well, let me just show you very quickly something else.

227
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,420
Another outbreak.

228
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:30,210
I'm not going to ask you to talk about this, but this is another profile of an event mortality, high mortality, event, differential death.

229
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,649
All right. I guess I should say differential survival in this case, because that's what we've got in.

230
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,100
Great. More females survive than men.

231
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,030
More children survived than adults. This is the opposite of the Kuru epidemic.

232
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,990
This is. Women and children first.

233
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,280
What's the event for the Titanic? I mean, if you didn't know that.

234
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,200
Good. Thank you. At least one person would survive.

235
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,240
Surprise, but admits. I hope you're not the only one. But it's harder and harder to do this one because of the movie.

236
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,889
But I like it because of that opposite. The point being,

237
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:17,510
this cultural rule about women and children's value in society is really important in shaping the curve of the epidemic and the mortality.

238
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:26,839
So a causal assemblage for mortality and age and sex, again, social things like class and status in the Titanic case,

239
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,560
because that has to do with where you were on the boat, you below water or above water.

240
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:40,570
Could you get above decks or not? And that has to do with what your in fact, paid class was in that case, but also for thinking about the Titanic one.

241
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,410
There's a set of cultural rules about evacuation parties that for women and children, first law.

242
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,049
And then I think it's also important to point out that the design hubris of the

243
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,190
people that put that boat together were part of that causal assemblage as well.

244
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:02,450
The bulkheads didn't go up to the top to the roof. So the water, when it got up to a certain level, slopped over into the next waterproof compartment.

245
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:10,010
The boat couldn't sink because it was designed not to sink. The arrogance of the engineers led them to not include enough lifeboats.

246
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:15,250
So arrogance is in some ways maybe not the best epidemiologic category,

247
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,329
but I think an important political category to consider in the transmission and

248
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,200
the causal assemblage of why the mortality from the Titanic looked the way it did.

249
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:34,110
We got enough lifeboats. That's why so many people died. So think about design and think about that kind of context in epidemic shape.

250
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
Do you think you need to do your studies in your work? Okay.

251
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:45,010
Yeah. So causal assemblages have already introduced the idea.

252
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,360
The point here is emphasizing that beating up with the notion of the importance

253
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,170
of social relationships has manifested in what we call social structure,

254
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:03,730
class distribution, labor opportunities, marriage structures, things like that is influence transmission dynamics through social networks.

255
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,800
How many people you know who you associate with, at what times of the day where you go to do that, how you move, how often?

256
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:14,020
What's happened to your society to increase the probability that you might be moving now, one you never would have dreamed you would previously.

257
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:21,870
Think about Venezuela. Think about Venezuelans in Chile now walking to the United States.

258
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:32,450
That's going on. I saw them. Perceived risk and uncertainty influence transmission dynamics through feedback loops.

259
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,770
Your our collective sense of whether we're still in a COVID epidemic influences how many of us you are wearing masks?

260
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:45,530
I would guess it's about a third of you now. I would guess it was probably a larger proportion than last year.

261
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,620
I would guess it was a larger proportion than that the year before. And I would guess it was nobody the year before that.

262
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,860
And you're understanding our collective understanding of whether we're now at risk influences, how willing we are to wear a mask,

263
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:07,460
which influences how likely we are to transmit, which influences how much transmission areas, which influences our perception of risk.

264
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,830
And these are the feedback loops that we create through these perceptual loops.

265
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,040
So the causal assemblage is, in part perceptual.

266
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,740
Causal assemblages are also helpful in theorizing because what we're trying to do is reduce dimensions.

267
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,500
That was in the Hubbard paper. So you really ought to look at that one maybe.

268
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,540
And these diagrams are all in that paper.

269
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,910
Somebody's going to bother to talk about them very much, except to say that.

270
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,280
Dimension reduction is a large issue in other kinds of health related analysis.

271
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:56,080
It's a tough nut to crack. And part of what the Harvard paper that we wrote together suggests is that ethnography is helpful in that process.

272
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,250
The work included that ten years of work,

273
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:06,960
in part was solved by an ethnographer who was doing very careful genealogical analysis of who was related to whom.

274
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,860
And it was surely Linden Malm, an Australian anthropologist, who actually unpacked that one cotton guy, Michel,

275
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,670
got the Nobel Prize because he discovered the prion concept and scraped the and a bunch of other things that happened later.

276
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,420
But it's really Shirley who figured out how these people got sick and why.

277
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:32,580
And it was based on her ethnographic work that that reduced causal assemblage was finally capable of yielding the understanding of what drove this.

278
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:42,620
Okay. Is this a causal assemblage? This is one of the papers I saw on the reading list for the class.

279
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,210
Like the tropical diseases in the Anthropocene, cases of Zika and other infections.

280
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,700
The articles emphasize the importance of poverty as an underlying commonality a driver of many,

281
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:02,780
many different kinds of epidemics and climate change, deforestation and conflict, urbanization as also contributing factors here.

282
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,490
Is it fair to call this a causal sandwich? Yes.

283
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,290
No, I don't know. What do you think?

284
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,510
How useful is this in unpacking?

285
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,760
Transmission. Right.

286
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,550
How many you think this is very useful impacting transmission. Okay.

287
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,770
How many of you don't think this is very useful in packing transmission? Okay.

288
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,450
I saw some of these, which is always interesting to see. You might be right.

289
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:46,330
You might be wrong. And I might call you out. Comment.

290
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,880
I guess I find it a little reductive because there's a lot of different aspects that.

291
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,480
Impact poverty beyond. Just like what?

292
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:04,360
What's being discussed? This is really big. This is not particularly helpful to try to be to say, what variables do I need?

293
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,060
How do I combine them? How might they be interacting among themselves and so forth and so on?

294
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:14,180
So yeah, this isn't a composite. It's a group of influences, factors.

295
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:22,530
But it's not fair to describe this as a and. So to be a causal assemblage, it needs to influence, contact or exposure.

296
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,090
These influence probability of infection and contact needs influence, duration of infection.

297
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,740
Talking about infectious diseases, causal assemblage, the fractious diseases.

298
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,500
So if you think about causal something for diarrheal disease in a place like Ecuador,

299
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,390
I'm not trying to ask you to unpack all the different components of such a causal assemblage,

300
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:50,040
but what social features might influence probability of transmission of diarrheal disease in an environment like that?

301
00:32:50,100 --> 00:33:02,860
Social factors. Ideas. I'm thinking where you get your water from and how often or how long it might take you.

302
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,850
Or potentially even who picks up that water? Is it the woman of the house?

303
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,990
Is it a child? Is it the man of the house? Sure.

304
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,000
Good. Other ideas? You've spoken to Hopkins?

305
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,980
I'm just going to wait a little bit. It's just sanitation practices.

306
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,330
Great. Like, for example, like where latrines are located.

307
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:29,460
Or if they use latrines. Sure. Or even inside behavioral questions.

308
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,219
Who uses a latrine versus who doesn't? Are the differences among those who go off to the farms?

309
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,340
The men who go off to the fields are defecation practices that are taking place when

310
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,930
people are taking care of the drain outside of the household versus those who aren't.

311
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,680
But yes, absolutely. Another idea. Yeah.

312
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:54,030
Where people are, like, socializing, like maybe kids playing and contaminated water.

313
00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:02,490
Great. Great. So. So in part, then you're starting to think well about the complexity of overlapping and layering some of these different features,

314
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,000
because you might find an environment that's potentially contaminating.

315
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,760
And yet, if human beings aren't there at the same time, you're not going to get that kind of transmission.

316
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,180
Or there might be transmission delayed because there's deposition at this moment and then there's acquisition at a later moment.

317
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,690
Great. Okay. Again, that's all I'm asking you to do for now.

318
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,549
You're going to have lifetime.

319
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:30,420
Well, at least one lifetime to be able to play with these ideas or at least encounter them as you keep doing this kind of work.

320
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:40,380
Okay. Next lecture. Arnott's partners social.

321
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:47,160
I know Joe's been talking with you about our not estimating expected number of

322
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,080
secondary cases produced by a single infection in a completely susceptible population.

323
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,960
I'd say that very quietly. Not all people are equally susceptible.

324
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,610
Obviously, not all populations are evenly mixed.

325
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,090
Obviously, not all individuals are equally infectious.

326
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,190
Obviously, conditions change over time, obviously.

327
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:21,520
So the notion that somehow our non is a category attributable to a pathogen or quality of a pathogen is actually misleading us.

328
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:28,490
Our not is a measurement of the infectiousness of a pathogen within a particular context.

329
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,090
What's the nutritional level of the population in which that pathogen lives?

330
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,340
What's the prior exposure to the pathogen in which the pathogen lands?

331
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,660
What's the age and sex structure of the population where the pathogen level?

332
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,170
Yeah, you can adjust for that one, but not the other one nearly as easily.

333
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,690
Okay. So are not estimates vary.

334
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:07,370
It's not that pertussis decides one day it's going to have an Arnold of five and the next parents can have an hour and not a 33.

335
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,780
It's that when pertussis lands in some populations yields that level of infection, and when lands at others, it yields a different level of infection.

336
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:28,010
So in part. And again, forgive me if I'm trying too hard to beat you up, but in part it's misleading to think about our not as a quality of apology.

337
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,820
It's a quality of a pathogen in a context.

338
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:38,120
So you have to think about the qualities of the context to be able to understand why that pathogen is reacting in that way,

339
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:44,840
in that place at that time. And even here in this one, which wasn't done for this purpose,

340
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,250
the polio estimates of it of 2 to 4 versus 8 to 14 are specified as populations with good hygiene versus population with poor hygiene.

341
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:58,700
So that's absolutely exactly what I'm talking about. These are different kinds of context in which this pathogen needs to so many

342
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,590
different opportunities for dissemination based on that kind of social context.

343
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,880
Because good hygiene and poor writing isn't the quality of the pathogen.

344
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,840
You're not being.

345
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:19,610
And people write about this dilemma or 2019 complexity, the basic reproduction number, because I know it's a function of the effective contact rate,

346
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:25,920
but I know it's a function of human social behavior organization as well as mediated by logical characteristics, particularly becoming.

347
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:34,000
Questions. Does this sound a little bit different from the way Joe was talking about it?

348
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,070
Not. It should.

349
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,390
It was designed to be and that's okay.

350
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,250
And we're still going to be friends after they've been friends for 20 years.

351
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:57,050
We play together in this way and we enjoy kingdom version right from moving right along.

352
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:01,570
Questions on that. Is that? Is that interesting?

353
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:07,719
Is that startling? Is that an interesting idea to play with? Does it help you think a little bit differently about the relevance of thinking about

354
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,410
society in thinking about epidemiology and thinking about epidemiological measurements?

355
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,180
Okay, good. I see some of this and I don't imagine that if you're not doing it, it's like you're asleep.

356
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:24,340
It doesn't look like anybody's asleep. That's good. Okay, then can I do the next one?

357
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,700
I'm scared about this because I do a whole class on or not. But wonder.

358
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,870
Does anybody have any questions right now? I'm like, I'm always halfway through so we can do questions at the end.

359
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,210
But any have any questions? No, no, no, no, no, no.

360
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:54,440
Okay. All right. So now this is what I'm trolling for an assistant, but it's also because the other side of some of this influence society,

361
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,960
from my perspective, is where do we need to come from?

362
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,100
How is it that society influences and cultural practices influence the kind of data we get, the quality of the data we get,

363
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:11,629
the experience of acquiring or providing data itself is another part of this human

364
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,190
experience in the domain that leads to public health research means that research as well.

365
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:29,390
So we have a study now going on in Ecuador, the varied kinds of epidemiologic methods that we've used in these populations over the last two decades.

366
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:37,580
And that's everything from social network surveys. Five different waves of social network surveys, annual census.

367
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,520
Blood draws for surveillance.

368
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,580
They think if you ever exposure.

369
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:56,270
Close an observation of mother infant pairs in the 1900 infants first cohort to look at microbiome development over time.

370
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,410
Ethnographic observation focus groups.

371
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:08,600
I mean, it's a whole lot of stuff that we've been doing for 20 years in the same area.

372
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,880
We worked originally in 26, as many as 26 villages.

373
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,820
Now we're working in about six of them, larger ones.

374
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:23,690
But what's the experience for the populace of having participated in epidemiologic research studies?

375
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,810
And why are they still answering our questions?

376
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:42,980
Because if we were here, they would be response rates on the mail surveys, 1971 to 2017, dramatic reductions from 75% in the seventies.

377
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:53,920
40% of the teens projected 2025 30% response rate on meal servings.

378
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:01,740
2020, 2035. Forget about it, but probably won't exist by then anyway because we won't pay for it anymore.

379
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,810
Is that a challenge for epidemiologic research? You betcha.

380
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,420
What's happening, where we work. Well, let me go back.

381
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,790
Why? How come people don't respond to mass service anymore?

382
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,700
They used to. They used to be a great way to get researchers and a much questionnaire to get 75% response.

383
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,280
Not bad. No need for invitation. No need for all this extra weighting of subgroups.

384
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,840
Now you can do it anywhere. You have to do all this extra. So the population waiting.

385
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,330
And that's part of the reason why phone call, phone based surveys are also equally bad.

386
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,270
Not quite as bad as male, but pretty bad. And with cell phones, forget about us.

387
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,010
So we can't rely upon political polling anymore. We get surprised.

388
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,680
Not a good outcome for the polity. So what's going on?

389
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:01,610
Why can't we up a new logic data? Well, I just saw the comment, I guess for like the phone surveys.

390
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:08,059
I feel like people might not think it's just like a survey, but sometimes I feel like like if it's just a survey, like, surely answer it.

391
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,600
But if they're going to ask me like for money or something like, then they may not want to talk to me.

392
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,450
Sure. And they might be lying to you. They might say, we're doing a survey for the University of Michigan.

393
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:21,470
And in fact, they're calling from Kellogg's Cornflakes and they want to send you a bottle renewing order for the next five years of your life.

394
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:27,120
Yeah. So you can't trust who's on the end of the phone. And your time's more valuable.

395
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,520
Wants to waste time telling some researchers some answers to some stupid set of questions were too busy.

396
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,419
What else? We have cell phones. We have unlisted numbers.

397
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,799
It's hard to get to us. And it used to be my landline that I still maintain.

398
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:48,690
I don't know why it costs me $750 a year and I still have. It gives me nothing but spam like five spam calls a day.

399
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,000
Why do I spend $700 a year to get five spam calls a day?

400
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,470
That's like self-flagellation. What do you think is a really bad idea?

401
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:08,280
I keep wanting to cancel my. I can't. But all these things influence how your our work works because the probability of

402
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,210
getting accurate information from a whole population is going down all the time.

403
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,860
Right. It ain't so bad of a worse yet.

404
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,510
But reported trust is declining. And it's one of the things we ask in some of the social surveys we do proportion

405
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:30,270
of reporting people in their village trust each other and 2750 1% in 2010,

406
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:35,730
44%. 1330 3%. 2022 27%.

407
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:42,449
Those are dramatic changes and not much time. We work in an area that's going through dramatic changes.

408
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,370
It's why we're there.

409
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:49,530
A road was built that didn't used to be there, so all kinds of things are moving through this area that never could move through before.

410
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,690
Ideas. Electricity.

411
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,960
Media. Ice. Yeah.

412
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,090
That's a big deal. Cocaine. Guns.

413
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:11,450
Lots of things move waste quickly and people move in ways that they didn't before as well.

414
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,750
And so the kinds of social networks that we've actively measured since, I think our first was 2003.

415
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:27,800
Or changing. We can measure the social environment where we work because we've applied the theories to enable us to recognize that that might matter.

416
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,620
And sure enough, that social space is different than it was 20 years ago and dramatically different.

417
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,260
So maybe this is part of what's going on here. Maybe it doesn't matter.

418
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:46,400
It matters in some ways. Maybe it doesn't matter to response rates. To epidemiologic studies, although refusals.

419
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:57,480
Are going up a little bit. These are data from just a couple of months back, you know, last year, but still recent.

420
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,580
And part of what this is trying to show you also is that what a refusal rate is kind of depends on how you're measuring it.

421
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,480
So you can count really low refusal rates or you can count higher refusal

422
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,470
rates being on how you carefully you are trying to identify your denominator.

423
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,160
So the refusal rates on the rate of 9% to 17%.

424
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,140
Those are higher than they used to be, but not a whole held one.

425
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:29,030
So part of what we're studying in Ecuador is why do people still answer our questions?

426
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,020
We've been asking questions for 20 years. Why?

427
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:43,550
Okay. So what theories might we use if we want to try and understand that really quickly?

428
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,149
We could talk about this for hours. Bowling Alone model.

429
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:50,290
Say social trust and community cohesion is important and waiting and therefore people don't do this kind of stuff

430
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,520
anymore because they don't really care about the social ideals of the values of the scientists that are doing the work.

431
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:01,480
Exchange models would say, Well, if you're providing information, you ought to get something in return.

432
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:06,520
So if you're not getting some kind of incentive from the epidemiologists, it's not worth participating.

433
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,099
So, you know, you expect something for your time.

434
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:14,899
You expect other food, you expect money, you expect some other kind of good, and that induces you to participate.

435
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:20,170
And if you don't get a kind of social construction, greater good models, well,

436
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,189
if you collaborate with the people you're studying to develop the model,

437
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:29,679
to develop the survey, to develop the work, to actually undertake the research they have,

438
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,860
the sense that they're sharing, they cone community that works better.

439
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,080
These are all testable hypotheses. Political economic models.

440
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:45,749
Participants want money. If you're going to be doing cohort studies, you better be able to bring in some kind of money.

441
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,360
The population be making money yourself because that's what's driving your ability to bring in those kinds of resources.

442
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,900
Science and technology studies models, patients and respondents and researchers and the technology.

443
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:04,050
So for that which co-produced participation rates together. These are all ways of analyzing why people might or might not participate.

444
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:08,500
These are some of the pictures of all the stuff we carry and.

445
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:15,340
Places we stick probes. It's amazing to think so.

446
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,720
But as anthropologists, the words we use when we're talking about this kind of stuff matter.

447
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,750
Are we studying subjects? How we study patients? Are we studying respondents?

448
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:29,950
Are we studying partners? Are we working with partners? Are we working with CO participants?

449
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:36,160
Pay attention. The kinds of words that are being used in the studies that you're working within are being asked to join.

450
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:42,520
How do they talk about the people with whom you're working that betrays and portrays an awful lot.

451
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,889
Like everything else, this has also been studied by epidemiologists. Participation rates in studies.

452
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:57,480
There was a good review a long time ago and they suggested that competition by other studies or participant or competition from

453
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:03,030
market research studies and political polling and all those kinds of things are reducing people's willingness to participate.

454
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,459
Declining volunteerism. The Bowling Alone novel low sailings of Research.

455
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,140
Sorry, I don't really care about the questions you're asking me or you want to ask me.

456
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,880
And because so much attention is now paid to consent forms, you know all that in advance.

457
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,770
And so you can decide not to do it because you don't really care about it. In the old days, you didn't know.

458
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,320
So you could be induced into any conversation because you don't have to sign a consent form.

459
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:31,680
I'm not lamenting the presence of consent forms at all. I'm just saying it's different in how you study demands.

460
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,800
Meaning that? Well, it used to be that you would just be asked for 10 minutes time or turn back some kind of questionnaire.

461
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:44,250
Now, you may be asked to go into a clinical study to give blood or to have multiple visits or

462
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,820
to have a follow up questionnaire in another couple of years or something like that.

463
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,300
So to be able to change it from the research to the participants.

464
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:59,180
I have to tell you that these menacing things I did with an A.I., and I hope that was a lot of fun.

465
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:05,470
The other pictures were real. That's another A.I. picture on the right.

466
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:12,260
And Alan Tracy, 15 years old, focused mostly on the U.S. So what's happening in other countries?

467
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,580
That's partly why we're doing this study in Ecuador. You don't really understand some of those differences,

468
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:24,070
but a lot of the stuff that you all know about because you live it yourselves is on this list increasing distrust of science and government.

469
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,870
That's an interesting one in this country. Again,

470
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:35,149
think about Colvin reverberations and echoes and experiences that we've all had and how different it is to hear Anthony Fauci labeled

471
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:43,670
a liar as a liar by the president of the United States compared to what might have been the public treatment of such a figure 30,

472
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:46,670
40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100 years ago.

473
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:56,610
How different is this in other places? How likely is it that the population suffers burnout?

474
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,500
Oh, this is also why they are on the bottom. Right. I asked for a picture of a scary interviewer.

475
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,050
I think it's very scary. It just doesn't look menacing. It's true.

476
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:17,459
I think that here is a gene. You say, what are the differences between those kinds of requests of a population that say,

477
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,890
we want your blood versus we want you to tell us how much income you have versus we want

478
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:27,210
you to participate in a group with ten of your peers to talk about this issue for an hour.

479
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:35,010
How does that differentially potentially differentially influence response rates or willingness to continue to participate over time?

480
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:38,730
In cohort studies like ours? What's personal? What's private?

481
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,860
Where can these things be discussed? How willing are people to discuss what they denote as being private?

482
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:48,590
And how does it differ from place to place? We don't know how much research is too much for a community.

483
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,070
We hope we don't answer that question. We may.

484
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:02,450
Yeah. Summary It seems like participatory methods work pretty well.

485
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:07,580
It seems like methods that are more popular with people, topics that they care about yield,

486
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:12,590
higher rates of participation, and longer term content continuity in corporate studies.

487
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,290
So this is what we're doing.

488
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:21,290
And if you're interested in joining it and learning how to date or already know it, you have to be fluent in Spanish, meaning a reading fluency.

489
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,830
Then give us a call. Okay. When do we end?

490
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,250
Well. I still have 25 minutes.

491
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,260
I'm going to do a whole nother lecture. Right.

492
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:45,219
QUESTION So far, I mean, how have you come up against this in your own work so far, this challenge about participation and responses?

493
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:53,380
Because I assume it's an issue that you will confront and if you haven't already, but it wouldn't surprise me if some of you hadn't already met it,

494
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:57,219
because I think it's really one of the fundamental challenges for population based

495
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:02,220
research these days is how on earth do you work with populations to convince them,

496
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:07,980
induce them, seduce them, join them in deciding that this is an effort worthy of their time?

497
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,410
I don't think it's a small challenge at all, but comments on her travel experiences.

498
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,980
At least one of the researchers think that it's a longitudinal study.

499
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,480
And so there's supposed to be a collection of six waves of data across two years.

500
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:26,639
But with every wave, there's less and less people responding because they're lost to follow up.

501
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,129
And on top of that, this population in particular has like nomadic kind of cultures.

502
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,890
And so like you're just lost to follow up because they can't find you again.

503
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:39,959
You don't have like a solid house to come back to or email or phone till they get back to you.

504
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,060
It's just sort of like you're I don't know, like you just kind of the last two follow up.

505
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,320
It's like real. Yeah. So has the project tried to confront it or address it or something?

506
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:56,249
I think that their main strategy was mainly just to kind of like whoever was available.

507
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,489
Just keep surveying the people who have been available because it's really

508
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,480
difficult to go ahead and find people who are migrating throughout the country,

509
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,920
especially since that takes money and time on their end to be able to actually search for them.

510
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,140
So I think they've just kind of been dealing with the smaller sample throughout the study.

511
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:21,450
Yeah, I did my dissertation at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, data set, and they had a whole office of about six nurses, all these women,

512
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:29,819
elderly women who were tasked with finding people for male epidemiologic cohort studies

513
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,020
because they would take the Rochester residents and their job was to find where they moved to.

514
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:41,070
And they no longer lived in Rochester, but it was six people full time in this office and every phone book in the United States on its wall.

515
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:46,080
Oh, yes, this is back in the day where you don't need to do that anymore.

516
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:51,270
But it is a nontrivial challenge to maintain a cohort over time because of what's to follow.

517
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:59,040
Now, imagine doing that kind of work in a place where. When someone dies, their name can no longer be mentioned.

518
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:07,160
I had a medical anthropologist friend who worked in Brazil in Rondonia, with a group where that was the case.

519
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:13,490
How do you do a census when the name of somebody who's dead can't be mentioned or it gets changed to another name?

520
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:21,890
Yeah. That'll blow your mind, isn't it? Yeah. I worked in Madagascar and it was considered rude to ask why.

521
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,950
So that was quite a challenge. How did you what did you do?

522
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,460
Just kind of like go through this very circular way of speaking, basically.

523
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:36,740
And of course, you know, I had to really, really work on my Malagasy speaking skills amongst all that.

524
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,250
And there's no verb to be, so you have to work around that, too.

525
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:49,100
Okay. But that was huge. That was absolutely huge because obviously building trust means avoiding cultural mechanisms that are considered rude.

526
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,030
Right. But asking is central to obviously everything you do.

527
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,640
You know, we were just having no I was just having lunch with some friends.

528
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:04,340
He's a he's a michigan hospital, runs a cancer communication unit.

529
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:16,090
And Stephen Katz and he was telling me about a study that they just were awarded in the last week to look at 72 relatives of cancer patients.

530
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:23,659
And they got names from the cancer registry. But there were only three states in states where there are legislative frameworks that

531
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,140
allow a cancer registry to share the names of cancer patients with anybody else.

532
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,220
One of those states is California big state, so you get a lot of patients from there.

533
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:38,400
But it put together this incredibly complicated coalition of some industrial partners and legislators and cancer

534
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:46,640
industry people and researchers to be able to follow up a cohort of 5000 cancer patients and their relatives.

535
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:54,290
They have moved from the state in which they were first diagnosed into another state in the United States or Canada or Mexico.

536
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:59,230
And if that was the case, they were able to follow because they'd done the structure work to be able to do that.

537
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,980
That's a five hour project.

538
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:09,290
So being able to do that kind of follow up at the population scale is absolutely a non-trivial exercise and therefore not often done.

539
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:16,280
And that's lost to the science because simply of the sheer complexity and cost of maintaining those kinds of contacts over time.

540
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:22,700
And if you're working in populations where there's a lot of mobility, you're even more fraught in your ability to do that,

541
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:28,070
kind of to employ that kind of a design in your epidemiologic research. So that's an interesting challenge.

542
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:33,770
How is the population structure and rates of mobility influence in your toolkit

543
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,510
of methods because you have a limited toolkit given that kind of population.

544
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:42,140
All right. Let me do the last thing. Any other questions? Comments?

545
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:52,730
All right, so. So this is. This is so what?

546
00:56:53,570 --> 00:57:01,430
Okay, for my final thought about so what I think it's particularly important to talk to students about.

547
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:14,900
So, one, because you are already being socialized into a particular kind of incentive structure and research that says your prowess,

548
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,270
your career is going to be measured by how many publications you produce.

549
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,640
For me, that's a big loss because if all we're doing is producing more publications that are being cited by the researchers,

550
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,880
there doesn't necessarily make any difference to the public's health. So you could also think about other ways of disseminating research.

551
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:38,790
Who is working with? Who's your audience?

552
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:46,159
How do you reach them? If your audience is a policy, let's assume you've gone as far as saying,

553
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,610
I don't care only about other researchers and my tenure committee or if it's not a tenure committee.

554
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:55,640
I only care about other researchers and my bosses.

555
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:01,490
I also care about trying to reach policy makers to try and make some difference in the kinds

556
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:06,440
of legislative or other kinds of social structures that influence behavior of large scale.

557
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:13,090
How do you talk to policymakers? Do they read the literature?

558
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:18,430
The quote, capital t capital l literature. Probably not.

559
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,420
Do you need to write something different? Probably so.

560
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:30,750
How do you write it? Resources on this campus on how to write and how to try and reach other audiences.

561
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:38,570
But it's not a misplaced. Devotion of your time and skill.

562
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,510
To acquire those kinds of techniques. How do you write a policy brief?

563
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:48,020
You all know how to do that. How do you write a press release?

564
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,090
You all want to know how to do that.

565
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:57,330
Because if all you do is worry about getting your name is third author on a publication and getting enough of those to get tenure.

566
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,830
If that's all you do, you may get tenure, but you're not going to make much difference to the public's health.

567
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,870
That's not easy. It is.

568
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:15,760
I'm actually asking you to something to do something more difficult than what it is you actually have to do.

569
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,840
All you have to do is get your degree and then wait. Do a good job.

570
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:25,780
And if you go to the academy, all you have to do is get tenure. And then we have to do that for the rest of your life.

571
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,919
Okay. I don't really mean any word just said,

572
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:40,330
but I think there is a way in which the lockstep progress that you're going to be making is determined by that labor context into which you're going.

573
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:47,620
And unless you take an active interest in departing from and pushing against some of those incentives that you're working with,

574
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:52,540
then you won't have a chance to win those kinds of skills. And that reduces your ability to speak to a public.

575
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,600
It reduces your ability to appear on television or in an op ed or in a letter to a legislator,

576
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,710
or to work inside a committee understanding how things work. Right.

577
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:07,310
So I'm going on too long. I want you to go through some of the cultural stuff because it's fun.

578
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,020
It's recent.

579
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:18,520
And I think it's also illustrative of some of the bumps in the road of some of the ways that we in academic public health schools are kind of.

580
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,640
Induced to think and not necessarily to reflect upon.

581
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:31,110
How many of you know about evidence based research? Who doesn't?

582
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,730
Who's never heard of evidence based policymaking? Everybody's heard of Evans.

583
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:41,870
Everybody's heard about evidence based medicine, right? So what's evidence?

584
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:46,790
And how often does evidence make its way into policy?

585
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:54,170
I actually did a study on this in Mexico for two years with four ethnographers.

586
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:58,430
Mexicans and Argentine agents. We wrote a book about it. We did an article about it.

587
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:04,130
It turned out that the Mexican government was creating health norms for the whole country.

588
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:11,510
And these were the products of committees that were amassing research, that they were inciting norms.

589
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,870
So you can read the norms and say who's being cited and who isn't?

590
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:20,840
Which Mexican and other researchers are appearing in these norms for public health, behavior and practice?

591
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:25,490
And which weren't. We looked at four vertical programs and tried to understand what was influencing.

592
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,050
What research appeared in those made a difference in policy.

593
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,800
So let's go through some of that stuff.

594
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:41,240
Evidence based policies are actually really rare in and vanishingly rare in most in much of what we've only just been through.

595
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:46,790
So there's an awful lot of underpowered research generated during COVID.

596
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:55,820
This is a major study from last year database of COVID 19 trials, 40%, stating they're enrolling fewer than 100 patients.

597
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,640
Oops. I have a general question.

598
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:06,290
So what why are why are there so many studies that are using such a small population?

599
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:10,060
It's just because they want to get something out there about a specific topic.

600
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,430
Yes. Yes. And especially in COVID,

601
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:21,620
there was all that the the pressure to be able to say you're contributing all these archive type journals that

602
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:26,660
are doing the fast turnaround that are actually quite they're more repositories than they are peer reviews.

603
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,170
Those became much more popular in the last three years in the government before.

604
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:37,009
So rapidity of publication, ability to claim to your local institution that yours aren't participating in this endeavor.

605
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,319
I also am joining the fight against COVID because, look,

606
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:46,940
I got a paper published in Rome and I think it was a real sense of curiosity and maybe insufficient

607
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:50,660
knowledge about whether or not your results are actually going to be able to make any difference.

608
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:59,959
For an awful lot of people who are struggling mightily to get tenure having an underpowered study and

609
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,760
it's the publication is more important for not doing it because you actually have confidence intervals,

610
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,540
interest abroad, key to anything which you said. That's the ugly truth.

611
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:15,979
But it's a legitimate question. It is a big problem. I mean, the fact that this is going on oh, my God, what rational world we live in?

612
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,050
Well, sorry. We know the differential results.

613
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:25,370
Understanding of the ways in which it's not rational is probably more and more useful than the other type of approach.

614
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:31,340
Too much research, duplication. Remember hydroxychloroquine?

615
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:40,190
Yeah. 250.

616
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,230
Registered clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine. How many did we need?

617
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,800
I mean, we know the outcome now, so maybe it's easy to say in retrospect, but even then.

618
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:02,540
This was before Copan. This is an anthropologist. British anthropologist.

619
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:09,700
Emotional contagion digitally enabled could erode trust in vaccines so much as to render them.

620
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,499
The deluge of conflicting information,

621
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:19,370
misinformation and manipulated information on social media should be recognized as a global public health threat.

622
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,810
Again. This is what we've lived through.

623
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:33,020
So we talked about knowledge translation W.H.O. Starter Unit Knowledge Translation all through probably 20 years ago,

624
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,810
defined as the exchange synthesis and effective communication of reliable and relevant research results.

625
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:48,800
Sounds great. But given the inequalities in training, in differential distribution of research resources, differential access to publications.

626
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:55,930
How effective can we be? How well can we translate?

627
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,469
Can evidence overcome the faith? Can evidence overcome self-interest?

628
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:09,870
Can evidence overcome lies? My sad conclusion right now is not very well at all.

629
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,730
Bolsonaro lost an election yesterday. He still hasn't conceded defeat.

630
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:21,329
We still don't know how it's going to play that way. Apparently, the Army has signaled they're not going to support him.

631
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:27,120
If he goes against it, then apparently some of his strongest political supporters and also already said, yes, we won.

632
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:31,800
But Bolsonaro hasn't said anything about his three sons or sons of [INAUDIBLE] pardon me.

633
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:36,300
Haven't said anything yet. And so how that all is going to play out is still unknown.

634
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,429
So watch them really carefully.

635
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:45,480
Because even though you can really excited about the fact that he lost, whether or not he accepts that is still under contest.

636
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:50,260
Until then, it wasn't right there, actually. So they don't have a January six.

637
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:57,810
So during Trump's reign. Sorry, I get political here, but I think I have to.

638
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:04,840
You'll see why we already know why. This is what the Centers for Disease Control was saying about their vaccine evaluation.

639
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,010
CDC. The Vaccines Elimination Web content is research written and approved by subject matter experts,

640
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,760
including physicians, researchers, epidemiologists and analysts.

641
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:17,370
Content is based on peer reviewed science.

642
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:23,070
CDC leadership makes the final decision on the words, images and links to best serve the information needs of the public.

643
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:31,210
There are. This is a book on 1918 flu.

644
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:36,459
His conclusion was like the third to the last sentence in the book. Those in authority must retain the public's trust.

645
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,970
The best way to do that? To distort nothing. Put the best face on nothing.

646
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:45,370
Try to manipulate. Know the 1918 flu lesson.

647
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:52,470
Okay. Oops. Governments manipulate statistics all the time.

648
01:06:54,020 --> 01:07:00,290
Starting April 17, India stalling to reach efforts to make global Britain want to reveal their numbers.

649
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:07,670
Kim Jong un actually starts saying we now have a COVID epidemic, when for years he was saying we wouldn't have any COVID here at all.

650
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,310
What's going on there? It just magically appear.

651
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:21,490
Viktor Orban says he needs more political power to fight the virus and so imposes a whole set of draconian measures on free speech in Hungary.

652
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:27,700
Bolsonaro hails the hydroxychloroquine treatment.

653
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:35,760
I think Brazil had the second highest mortality from COVID in the world, says.

654
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,680
Just before the election October one, 2020,

655
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:49,840
White House blocked a CDC order to keep the cruise ship docked so rational policies obstructed by political processes.

656
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,189
Reason politicians CDC wanted this no sale or extended to February,

657
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:01,720
but that was going to influence the election and service pressure was put on CDC to pull it back.

658
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:08,530
Despite that kind of wet page stuff about the rationality and science of epidemiological analysis of their decisions.

659
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,600
Before the election, Trump Overstates Their Virtual Position on lockdowns.

660
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:22,700
October 19 Trump Calls Out a disaster. Foushee and these idiots, all these idiots who got it wrong.

661
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:30,110
So again, keep in mind part of what Barry is concluding from the 1918 flu epidemic.

662
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:40,160
So one of the worst things that can happen to society is when a maximum leader disparages the scientific findings and says,

663
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:46,310
you know, don't pay any attention to that. I'm the one who knows those people are idiots.

664
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:57,170
Most scientists know nothing. It's one of the best ways to ruin the public's understanding that scientific knowledge is worth something.

665
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:03,860
Scientists have done some damage themselves by taking advantage and being a

666
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,459
little arrogant about their authority so that the populace doesn't necessarily

667
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:12,170
understand that scientific knowledge develops over time and the studies can

668
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:15,530
yield inappropriate results and be trumpeted as being true when they're not.

669
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:20,810
And then they change their mind because it turns out they're wrong that science progressing, that science is self-correcting.

670
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,340
But when a maximum leader says these people are idiots because they don't know what they're doing,

671
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:28,550
because they said this thing last week and that study over there said this,

672
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,540
and now this other study over there says that, well, forget the Enterprise.

673
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:37,160
Just listen to me. We need to shine lights inside ourselves because that's going to kill the virus.

674
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,770
I found this one really interesting. There was a study on things from Cornell.

675
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:54,130
38 million articles about the pandemic and English language media mentions of Trump remain 38%.

676
01:09:54,910 --> 01:10:02,290
In that conversation, President Trump. ex-President Trump was the largest driver of the infodemic.

677
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,290
The United States was the largest driver of the epidemic of misinformation.

678
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:18,080
First comprehensive examination of misinformation. They had to use all these techniques to do that machine analysis because that's a lot of articles.

679
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:29,520
So? So maybe we're getting a little better. Maybe not. I mean, W.H.O. continues to tout their evidence based research that he was recent handbook

680
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,420
of Evidence Policy and impact their guide for evidence informed decision making.

681
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:44,219
But again, there are these assumptions about rationality and and good effective policymaking and leaders who are interested

682
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:49,440
in the well-being of the citizenry rather than their own either financial gain or political continuity.

683
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:56,460
And so some of the assumptions inside this this talk I used to work with W.H.O. and some of this kind of stuff 15 years ago,

684
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:02,969
and I was always objecting. They finally stopped asking me to participate because I kept saying, hold on a second.

685
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:09,690
You have all these assumptions about rationality and goodness and, you know, engaged leadership that guide all this stuff.

686
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:16,390
And that's not the real world. So okay, BMJ Global Health Plus Global Health.

687
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,260
Talking about trying to do better work to support evidence and action.

688
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:27,320
How is it that some kinds of repositories of credible information could be created upon which researchers and policymakers.

689
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:35,770
To which researchers are contribute? And then it gets vetted. And and to which or from which policymakers then draw information.

690
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:40,660
So you can begin to say, look, we have internationally recognized sources that have been scientific information.

691
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:44,430
This is where you should be getting your information. Is that sufficient to change it?

692
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,580
I don't know. But again, it's these people job to do this kind of stuff that they do this kind of stuff.

693
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:53,950
I don't think it's irrelevant, but I guess I'm a little less optimistic than I used to be about the likelihood of success,

694
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:58,930
given what's just happened and is continuing to. This is the world you're inheriting.

695
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:09,640
It's the world I'm leaving. This is the world you're inheriting. So in addition to all this rationality and evidence.

696
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:18,909
Think about as you develop your your practices, what networks you have and how social networks distribute,

697
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:21,819
disseminate different kinds of research in different ways,

698
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:27,070
and how to try to mobilize different kinds of networks and different kinds of social movements to disseminate that work.

699
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:32,770
Think about the economic and political context in which you're working and might influence the likelihood of success.

700
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:40,700
Good. I'm doing fine. The likelihood of success of interventions that we might be trying to design,

701
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,940
or the likelihood that the populace will listen to particular kinds of study results.

702
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:52,820
Think about asking the competition from forces that are arrayed against you as a scientist or as a public health worker.

703
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,800
It's really good to know the enemy. It's really good to be able to predict what they might do.

704
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:09,329
We thought a lot of abortion research internationally. And part of what she's been working on is following the right wing and abortion

705
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:14,040
forces in Latin America to try to better understand how they're organized,

706
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,900
how they're spreading, what they're going to do next.

707
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:21,840
What are the next campaigns going to look like and how can they be predicted and therefore worked?

708
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:27,750
With or against at least known about. Rather than ignore.

709
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:31,510
If all you do is pay attention to what message you want to articulate,

710
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:37,660
your abilities to articulate and disseminate that message are reduced because you also have to pay attention to the forces

711
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:45,040
that might limit your ability to disseminate that information or limit the reach of information once you disseminate.

712
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:51,459
Think about competition among different kinds of interest groups. Who's interested in the stuff that you're doing?

713
01:13:51,460 --> 01:14:00,010
Who might benefit from its production and who might not benefit from its production, especially any of you who are doing nutrition based research?

714
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:05,400
What kinds of industrial forces are arrayed against you? Because they are.

715
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:16,220
So in adjusting to producing research, think about collaboration with other interest groups.

716
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:25,430
It's some it's not the standard scientific model to try to be the value for the disinterested scientists doesn't work in the world anymore,

717
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:33,860
if it ever did. You need to figure out who your allies are who aren't in the research community and mobilizing them to help researchers get out.

718
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:42,400
Think about partnering with audiences, not just other interest groups, but the people with whom you want to have a dialog and do that.

719
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,450
What kinds of actions do you need to create?

720
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:55,660
What kinds of works do you need to produce? Is it a lecture to local bookstores in an op ed in a newspaper, in a meeting with a local politician?

721
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:03,730
Local representative. You guys, we all have an election coming up and there's some interesting things on your ballot in this state.

722
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,950
How much did the research community participate in the production of those things?

723
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:18,630
Some good. Didn't. Think about what kinds of knowledge transfer strategies are appropriate for the audience you want to reach.

724
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:22,590
Which means think about who your audience is. I've said that already a couple different times.

725
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:32,400
And remember the policymakers prized ideas over data. So it's not so much that they care about the to buy to the market and constructed

726
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:36,780
but it's what's in store you want to tell them that to make that model work.

727
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:43,550
Politicians tend to talk in cases. That's another reason why ethnography can be useful.

728
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,720
Ethnographers can help produce some of those compelling stories. You don't make them up.

729
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:53,490
They're real. And you adapt them so that you're exemplifying the data that you have.

730
01:15:53,940 --> 01:16:00,930
So for me, again, in combining ethnographic work, there's a combination of saying, we have evidence.

731
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:06,090
We have large of population based movements and trends and conclusions,

732
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:13,950
and we can illustrate them with some really carefully chosen examples that show the lived experience what it is to deal with this issue.

733
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:18,120
Working from Warsaw or otherwise address that particular public health problem.

734
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:32,190
So in conclusion, what I put up as the first slide behavioral theory should be more should live more often in your lives.

735
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:40,240
But epidemics are contextual and it ain't always the past managements where the company wins.

736
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:51,510
Science is a social activity. That awareness enables you to construct better designs and to make a big difference with what we find.

737
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:58,680
And in these days, think about the enemy and other kinds of forces that may have hinge upon your ability.

738
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:03,210
And that's why I want to say thank you and happy Halloween.

739
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:15,179
And questions. Comments. You're clapping to let us beat you up.

740
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:20,330
And I stop. But you feel like I need a chance.

741
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,470
I just want to make sure. No, you're good. You.

742
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:32,470
Okay. Yeah, I just have it because you are obviously very experienced in your field.

743
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:37,360
I know as going into epidemiology, I also think integrating anthropology,

744
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:44,620
I feel like it's really common to experience resistance against some of these ideas from

745
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:51,879
collaborators or people who are in the hard sciences as these ideas are not valid or confusing.

746
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,150
And or sometimes people are like, Oh, this community wants this, and I think that's dumb.

747
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,870
We should give them this instead, even though that's not what they ask for.

748
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:07,210
Like, how do you advocate for these ideas in the face of people telling us that the anthropological or sociological legacy has no validity?

749
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:12,880
Well, I think I think being able to talk about erasure is important.

750
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,590
And I think that there are enough people that are articulating this kind of message these days that it's pretty easy to find,

751
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:23,410
you know, legitimate science, nature, PNAS, blah, blah, blah, what kind of literature to support this.

752
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:31,629
So to show good examples of how these kinds of combined approaches have worked in this country with theoretically informed attention to society,

753
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:39,250
behavior, culture, improve the quality of so-called hard science, as you put it, which is a mistake, but I agree with you.

754
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:42,700
Yeah. So that's one thing too.

755
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:51,250
I think doing good work matters. And so in my experience, I know Jo and I think we do good work together.

756
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:55,660
So part of this is finding partners with whom you can have those conversations,

757
01:18:55,660 --> 01:19:02,650
who are respectful of the differences that you have, because that increases the complexity and the joy actually of doing the work.

758
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:12,160
So, you know, if you're trying to work with some person who really doesn't respect your discipline and really doesn't care about what you do,

759
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:15,999
maybe that's not the best partner to work with. And it's easy for me to say that.

760
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,160
And I don't mean to be dismissive of the question because I'm interested in and I've had some of those partnerships not work in the past,

761
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,840
but I've also had partnerships other than Jo with physicians, for example.

762
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:29,500
I still want to work in compliance. Why don't people take medicines the way they're supposed to?

763
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:35,380
And as an anthropologist, exploring why it might make sense not to take the medicines the way you're supposed to.

764
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:41,240
I wrote a paper called The Logic of Noncompliance. I was at Mayo Clinic. I presented it to the neurology division.

765
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:47,440
They loved it because I was helping them solve the problem and understand it differently than either understood it before.

766
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:51,010
And I think that when you can do that kind of thing, your value given is clear.

767
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:57,825
So some of this is on you to be able to do that work of saying, well, you know, they don't care about it this way or didn't care about it.
