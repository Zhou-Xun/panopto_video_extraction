1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,760
Either Monday or next time.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:20,580
I probably did. I didn't check it, but I thought, Yeah, it's right on target.

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,230
That's what I like that.

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:38,370
So. Oh, I think I was just like, oh, I'll let you read that.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:01:09,100
And it's not actually when you come out because I got the late spring break, I really like pregnancy holidays just like, yeah.

6
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:18,130
I mean, this is really what I need to be.

7
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:25,610
Oh, yeah.

8
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,530
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:54,120
Like secrets is not something that I'd like to have here in New York.

10
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,320
I know.

11
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:15,030
I spreadsheet. Yeah. I am glad I did your homework.

12
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:30,520
And of course, I also. Yeah, I got my son, and I just want to tell my boyfriend, you know?

13
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,749
Right. Right. You know, and everybody is able to enjoy this free fall weather.

14
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,979
I was telling you guys already, I want to have staff up in our class outside, but I'm stuck inside.

15
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,890
If anybody knows how to turn off these lights, I just play with the lights on the other side.

16
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,120
I would absolutely enjoy that that way.

17
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,020
It's you know, it's a big thing outside, which obviously lights it.

18
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:12,420
I get it. Right now we have Reba mcEntire playing country music, but I'm not sure that first class talks about music,

19
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:23,660
but that's going on and ah icebreaker hoping you can see I think you can technically this is about decisions and

20
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,770
decision making class and I know when you were younger you had to make some serious decisions about where you to go.

21
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,530
What's your favorite movie that you would you'd like to attend at one point?

22
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,880
And so I looked up 2015 because I think you might identify with 2050, the year of 2015 with movies.

23
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:53,400
And these were the top ones. And I'm wondering if one. You identify with any of them and where do your favorites and if not,

24
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:02,280
the second question is if you could dine with any one of your favorite movie characters, who would they be?

25
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:11,370
So do you identify with that? So you don't have that, your movie character that you'd like to dine with?

26
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:18,570
All right. Going on this side. What you got? I like Jurassic World and Jurassic World, right?

27
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:26,610
I was also gonna say that. Yeah. All right. I was going to say Avengers, Age of Ultron, Hunger Games, Hunger Get.

28
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,580
Right. Okay. I love them all, but. Yeah. Inside, inside out.

29
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,400
Okay. Because she was okay. Yeah, yeah. I like inside out. Two inside out.

30
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,300
Hunger Games. Hunger Games. As I was going to say, Hunger Games. Hunger Games.

31
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,750
I really growing up was the parent trap. I love the die with its death.

32
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:01,750
I think inside out. Inside out. I liked Avengers, Avengers and all The Hunger Games.

33
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,410
Mockingjay of the same name. Party inside.

34
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,740
Inside, out. No, I'm second room.

35
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,620
Sorry. I thought you were going outside. Right. I'm excited. Inside.

36
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,940
Inside of the Dark Knight.

37
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,830
Inside. Out, inside, out. I'm just having a lot of trouble making any decision right now.

38
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,700
We'll go inside out. It was pretty good. It was really good.

39
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,050
Also, inside out. Very cute. Yeah. Cinderella.

40
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,100
Cinderella. Burning. Inside. Out. Inside, out. Inside, out.

41
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,970
Inside does just get smuggled.

42
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:51,940
Mockingjay inside out. The new Avengers gets inside.

43
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,469
Out. Cinderella. Inside.

44
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,360
Out. Inside. Out. Inside, out. Okay, so for me, Harry Potter was everything.

45
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,310
So I would want to meet Harry Potter.

46
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:11,470
And like I said, if we didn't get something out of this Harry Potter as my character, it's going to get very intense.

47
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,010
And that's why you see Avengers. All right. Hundreds of pages.

48
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,940
Massive. Inside out. Inside out. Cinderella.

49
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,840
Avengers. Avengers. I think The Martian. The Martian.

50
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,680
Some castles inside out was the winner there. Okay. Very good.

51
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:43,090
All right. So I only really allowed one person in the Zoom room, and that was Penny, because she literally asked me weeks ago.

52
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,629
And you knew that I sent the announcement out that you do have the speakers.

53
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,459
So I wanted everybody to be in person. And I didn't check to see that this was in person.

54
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
And I actually see people happening and I don't know how that's possible.

55
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,240
So I am going to invent Rico and she's going to understand how that happened.

56
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,070
See you there. Bless you. Great.

57
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,240
She screams and then get your presentation presentational. That's.

58
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,700
He. Excuse me.

59
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,480
All right. Put your presentation up on the screen and keep going forward.

60
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:48,270
I am pleased to present to you today. My boss, actually, farmers are out of work for nine years.

61
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:55,500
She she has graciously decided to accept a teaching this particular classroom session this fall.

62
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,420
But she actually retired in July.

63
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:04,740
So she and I, Denise and I have been working together for I'm going to just call it ten years and at this point in time.

64
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,650
And so I'm really excited to to share with you.

65
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:17,640
She's going to I will Charles country music and I'm sure he attended attendance she as well but I personally can't introduce her enough.

66
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:23,700
So I think it's important that she sort of starts with, you know, how she got here,

67
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:32,519
all of the yes's that she said to get to this spot and introduce herself and her role and what she used to do and what she was doing before.

68
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,989
But she left as the senior director for Human Resources,

69
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:44,100
Records and Information Systems worked directly in and underneath our Associate Vice President for Human Resources.

70
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,319
When we talk about the data, we talk a lot about the data that this wonderful woman has has produced many,

71
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,270
many, many, many, many things for the university.

72
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:02,430
And it has helped us tremendously make decisions and and sort of guide us as we had to make some hard decisions.

73
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:09,870
So I am going to turn off the music, I'm going to start in attendance, and I will let you continue forward there.

74
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,680
All right. Hi, everybody. How are you? Okay.

75
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:23,549
Why am I teaching this class? I don't know. She made me, but I worked at the university for 20 years.

76
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,330
Before that, I worked Ford Motor Company. I worked in large banks.

77
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,580
I worked at small companies. I did a lot of different things over time.

78
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,060
So that gave me a broad spectrum of all kinds of industries.

79
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,890
Factoring, service just did a lot of different things.

80
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,709
And then I got old and so I recently retired.

81
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:55,290
It was funny, I couldn't find this room. And so this nice young lady helped me and she said, Are you teaching today?

82
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,420
Yeah, no. But anyway, that was just cute and funny.

83
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,050
But I have a human resources and an I.T. background, mainly a business background.

84
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:14,520
My degrees were in marketing and computer science and then my masters was in business administration and I thought I wanted to get a Ph.D.,

85
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,960
but I didn't really know what I wanted to do it in because I love lifelong learning.

86
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,149
So are we still learning?

87
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:29,160
Even though I'm retired right now, I'm teaching myself Italian because I want to go to Italy next year, so it's always good to keep learning.

88
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,620
I had to make I had to give damage to people for many, many things.

89
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,830
We'll go over those examples at the university.

90
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,300
And I had to make a lot of decisions over time.

91
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,020
Plus, along the way, through classes that I went to,

92
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:53,670
I learned about a couple of methods or techniques that we're going to talk about today to help you in decision making.

93
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:03,810
So a couple key decisions that the University DI and I were involved in putting in Obamacare for the university.

94
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:13,410
So that allows it looks like it's been about three or 400 people more each year to be able to get health insurance at the university.

95
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,300
But again, we put that in as a project parental leave.

96
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:27,960
Both did a project to give parental leave to both partners in a relationship gift more to the person birthing the child,

97
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,200
but also to their partner or spouse to give them. So that was a really great project to work on.

98
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,060
A lot of key decisions had to be made. You have to remember to advance the slides.

99
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,429
Today we're going to talk. Here's the part we're going to talk about.

100
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,600
I don't need to go over it,

101
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:54,750
but I wanted to start out with would any of you share an example of a tough decision you had to make and how you went about it?

102
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:04,649
So just a couple of people and it could be related to your personal life, related to your academic career, related to a job you do.

103
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:15,070
But just like to see if a couple of people could. Talk about a decision they had to make and what did you do to figure that out?

104
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,910
Or did you just make the decision following your heart, which sometimes you can do?

105
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,650
Anybody against guy throws the ball. If nobody comes, get ready.

106
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,800
Okay. Come. Coming this way. Hard sitting head to me.

107
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:44,310
What did your son land in? Favorite form of exercise right now is weightlifting, he said.

108
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,210
A hard decision that I had to make or just a decision?

109
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:54,460
I mean, if it's not defined by the word hard, hard just means it's more complicated and hard to figure it out.

110
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,620
But whatever comes to mind, I guess.

111
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,320
Choosing Michigan to go to grad school,

112
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:09,890
it was just like difficult because it's hard to get concrete information and then you don't actually know what you're getting into.

113
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,959
You can talk to as many people as you can, but it's just like taking things at face value,

114
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,680
sometimes difficult because I don't know if I really trying to sell it to you or withholding anything.

115
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,129
It's been great so far. Was there any key thing that you tried to do leading up to that decision?

116
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,360
Like to make it feel firmer? Like you said, you know, all these people trying to sell me something.

117
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:41,720
Was there anything you did that you felt, oh, I feel like I have an honest answer or it gives me more information that helps me with that decision.

118
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,860
I tried to talk to people who are just currently in the program. That makes sense.

119
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,080
I don't know that you just go all the way over to the end zone because you exercise

120
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,600
your weight lifting and you don't know whose hand it's coming to the other side,

121
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,090
guys. Oh, I'm sorry.

122
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:10,070
Sorry. Emily, I have to ask, are you okay?

123
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,960
Okay. I probably will document that by saying we do work in human resources and I will be like much less 11 three, but I'm good.

124
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:28,220
Okay. All right. Tag your question on the ball.

125
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:37,250
Would you like to answer before you can send me great way to spend every free afternoon sleep.

126
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,960
And a hard decision that you had to make as it normally be.

127
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:54,960
When I withdrew from my undergrad my junior year, and then I took a year off and then I came back and then I graduated.

128
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,560
Okay. Now you get a chance to talk about that this year, but please look for the ball.

129
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,120
Please. Um, something you did take.

130
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,350
We're not going to do that. Want me to do list item that most reflects you?

131
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:21,960
That's really boring. Another, uh, a sound that you love.

132
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,260
I really like that. But most people don't like the sound of a turning signal.

133
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,930
I really like that clicky sound. I know it's random, but it's the small things in life forever.

134
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,670
Um, so the question was, what was the heart association and what did you do to make that work?

135
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:49,820
Some of the things you did to try to make that happen. So I had to make a really hard decision to not accept a job from someone that I obviously

136
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,850
was going to accept a job from and take a job from another competing employer.

137
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,170
And the reason I did it was because I wanted to move cities,

138
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,120
but it was still hard because I was leaving behind a lot of really important relationships and people I worked with and,

139
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:10,500
you know, colleagues that I really cared about. And I didn't feel good to the leader at that health care department, but it was what it was.

140
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:17,069
So but I had to think about me and I think about my interests, too, and what I was looking for, for my job and what I wanted in my life.

141
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,930
So. Was there anything key you did to come to that decision for yourself?

142
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
I fell in love with someone who lived in another city that I needed to go.

143
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,260
So I think our biggest thing that we brought up.

144
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:39,170
So it's. Now I'm in a totally different city with a totally different world, so it's all good.

145
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,010
Why is it that sometimes you have to make it by the heart? Exactly, yeah.

146
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,580
After today, we're going to talk. Thank you, everybody.

147
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:59,080
Data and policy and decision making hours, involvement in public health, decision making,

148
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,410
a couple of models, as I mentioned, and we'll close with some group discussion related to our learning.

149
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,340
Okay. Sometimes decisions are easy.

150
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:17,450
They are no big deal. You just make them use common sense or the heart.

151
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:25,040
Sometimes decisions and programs or, you know, environments or a lot of people.

152
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,230
And so they're more complex. And so decisions that are high impact or complex.

153
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,240
Usually you should use a systematic way to make the decisions.

154
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:43,090
In other words, if you're going to affect 20,000 people, you don't just get up in the morning and say, Oh, I think I've made the decision.

155
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:50,720
Right, and just trust what I don't make that decision. So another question for someone,

156
00:17:51,320 --> 00:18:04,399
is it clear and easy for you to understand when you just go ahead and make a decision or versus gathering information and opinions and facts or,

157
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,040
you know, clearly, like, I can just make this easy, like, what am I having for breakfast?

158
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,700
You don't have to consult ten people usually, right? Some people do.

159
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,860
Versus complex. I mean, is it easy for everybody on what to do when there's a decision to be made,

160
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,620
or especially when it comes to a job which you probably had or something in school that it could

161
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:37,610
be more complex and you know what to do or have you learned what to do throughout classes?

162
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,680
So just kind of anything on payoffs, learning about how to make good decisions that you might offer with this question.

163
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,650
Inside, aside from what it was like, you know, that has to.

164
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,210
But as you've made a decision, what what criteria did you use?

165
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,799
I feel like getting like a second opinion.

166
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:10,130
If I'm asking a family member friend, that usually helps me because I can be biased in one way or not be thinking about all the options that I have.

167
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,090
Nothing else. Thanks. The pros and cons list are good.

168
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,550
Yes, and we'll see that in a little bit. Okay. You want to help me with this video so I don't screw it up?

169
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,019
I have a short video that was kind of cute and funny guy.

170
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:35,060
So this thing's quirky, so. Yeah. Okay, so three secrets.

171
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,140
You just have to keep.

172
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,470
You see, the suit is.

173
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,710
Is. Napoleon's instruments sound.

174
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,760
We try not to blow your ears up. And I know we have, you know, what is it?

175
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,090
We've been here for a while. How about we order pizza? Yes, you go to that.

176
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,670
All right. So how do we want to give you that?

177
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:38,319
For all my time. What for all is just total olives at one point, or we do all fleet of pizzas.

178
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,889
Half of those pizzas are African crust, Chicago crust.

179
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:47,970
And they're all right here. One third to make sure we get one veggie pie.

180
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:53,319
Half cheese. That's all I got. Hear me out on each one of those.

181
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,110
Okay, we got one eight cheese, one 821 stuffed cheese crust.

182
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,700
No chance, that's all. Gary sighs.

183
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,129
I got it, I got it. One eight buffalo chicken.

184
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:15,040
No cheese, no sauce, one eight sausage, one eight thin crust, Delaware style, then one a totally blank grotto.

185
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,340
That's what I think. You guys, guys, guys.

186
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,080
We're all executives. Let's just make an executive decision here.

187
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,280
Eight Disney plus with veggie crusts and no sausage before I should tell you.

188
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:48,480
Yes. I don't know who's hungry, but I am in the Chicago style for me now.

189
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:56,730
We should take a vote on pizza. Thank you, Larry.

190
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,990
Oh. All right.

191
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,730
So managing complex decisions often requires a lot more.

192
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,430
You got to consider some alternatives.

193
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:23,250
Allow for uncertainties, like think about the risk because you might not be able to learn all the facts or know everything about it.

194
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,480
Think about multiple stakeholders who you might talk to.

195
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,890
Understand there's financial consequences associated with it.

196
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,890
Consider life or death. Some things are covered. You know, they were life or death decisions.

197
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,670
And sometimes you might have to protect the business perception or reputation of the place that you work.

198
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,399
So, you know, there might be a lot of choices.

199
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,360
There might be ambiguity. Again, there might be significant risk.

200
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:00,630
Just things you have to think about. So it's important to use methods or models to help us address these considerations.

201
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,350
If any of you seen and your do you still comment, externship or your work between undergrad and grad,

202
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:20,250
have you seen where there was a complex decision that you observed or maybe participated in during your during that time?

203
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,580
So maybe again, internships, externship.

204
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,460
Were you ever part of or witnessed something going on that really seemed complex?

205
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:38,160
And just could you talk about that? If you can recall something, show of hands that you were in on a meeting where something was complex.

206
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,330
Yes. Thanks. Hi. I like for one number.

207
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:54,170
So I went in and I forgot and they were in Performance Improvement and operations unit.

208
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,970
And so one of the things that we I was overhearing to the director and like, um,

209
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:07,520
you guys are talking about what the scope of practice for like nurses and mace and um, nurse technicians.

210
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,860
And so they had to define like what their skills are and then like, what is the cap?

211
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,230
So I think that was like a really difficult. Things that they were looking on.

212
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,480
Yeah. Thank you. Anybody else? There's something that comes to mind.

213
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,750
Thanks. All right, I.

214
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,170
Over this past summer, I was working at Hartford Health Care, my summer internship within the Health Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Department.

215
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:37,530
And I was a part of one of their strategy developing meetings that was focused on deciding

216
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:42,000
which projects that were going to stop started continue for the next incoming fiscal year.

217
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:49,530
So for that conversation, it was based on the post that I was working on and it was doing a project in for the department.

218
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,650
I'm assessing all the projects that they were working on for the fiscal year currently, which projects that are high priority,

219
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,130
which ones would be finished by the fiscal year and which ones should be continued on?

220
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,040
So I heard a couple of factors as you created that inventory, right?

221
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,730
Yeah. It was like, what priority are they? Right. That gave it some weight.

222
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,710
Right. Can we get them finished up or not? If not, should they continue?

223
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:21,000
Right. Was there any other criteria that was used to differentiate in the final decisions as a part of that?

224
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:26,670
Yeah, I think time was the biggest thing. Okay. How much time was dedicated to each project and is it worth it?

225
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,290
So the classic time and resources and cost of a project.

226
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,520
Right, were some of the main factors. Yeah. Thanks. That's a great example.

227
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:43,990
Okay. Anybody else? It's. Skip.

228
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,100
Okay, so here's an example of, you know, getting this class trying to tie h.r.

229
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:59,370
To public health. Some of the things that when we look at methods and models, we think about where h.r. intersects with public health.

230
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,650
And I found a good article. It's in the resources for this presentation, which you post this after the fact.

231
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,250
Okay. That talks about key actions during a crisis and things you have to think about.

232
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:19,710
So the first one is human capital and things you might have to think about that are changing due to what's happening.

233
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,180
Our workforce planning to fill the gaps.

234
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,940
So even think about COVID and then think about the great resignation, whatever they're calling it, you know,

235
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,400
they're calling it all kinds of things, but that is really skewed supply and demand of our labor workforce.

236
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:42,389
And so places are having to find that they needed to do a workforce planning.

237
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:51,650
And what that means in H.R., as some of you may know, but it's like, okay, how do we get bodies in the right place when we open?

238
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,370
You know, a few years ago, we opened the new hospital, we opened the location in Brighton.

239
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,909
We needed people to work there, right, to fully staff that.

240
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:11,069
And so workforce planning was a huge component of what has to happen in order to make sure that we could open with both the nurses,

241
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,260
the patient care, the doctors that we needed. So that's a human capital consideration.

242
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:25,380
You might have to manage revenue and cost. Numerous examples at the university happened during that time.

243
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,780
For example, our children's centers. We had to take care of our young children, our daycare centers.

244
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:37,200
We don't like to call them that, but children's centers, they had to close.

245
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,440
Then they had to open and they had to open for a few.

246
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:50,669
Then they had to have spacing with masking and all of that that that because they are under H.R., they had a surplus of $1,000,000 going into COVID.

247
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,120
And by the time COVID was done, they were in the red.

248
00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:04,319
So, you know, a financial consideration. But they had to follow, you know, all of the government and the university policies that came out.

249
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,360
So a lot of policy change happened there.

250
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:13,920
You might have to do training, professional development or retraining again if you're shifting people and you need people in different places.

251
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:23,850
We had to start up several, you know, our testing during COVID again and culverts, a recent example, so can hear me mention it a few times.

252
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:30,510
You might also have to think about corporate culture, our constant communication on what's happening.

253
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:36,570
So especially in our health system. Dr. Ruggie, who runs the health system.

254
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:43,320
He had a weekly mass comprehensive message that went out to all of the employees that talked about the COVID numbers,

255
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,530
the testing numbers, the impact on the various types of jobs.

256
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:54,989
I mean, all kinds of things it constantly helped people learn about so that they felt like they understood what was going on,

257
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,430
even though it was fast paced and and moving fast and constantly changing.

258
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:09,600
You might have to put in new programs we saw during COVID and this continues with everything going on, a focus to mental and emotional health.

259
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,740
There's a lot more focus happening and resources being allocated to that.

260
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:22,319
Another example, Care.com. The university paid for that service so that people could find child or elder care

261
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,340
resources as they needed to come back to work or juggle somebody working from home,

262
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,069
somebody not. You may have to change your benefit packages changes.

263
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,560
There was changes here in retirement, our health benefits time off.

264
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:47,250
We had to implement the several changes. There was a federal time off program, there was a state time off program.

265
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,980
So if you got sick or you had to take care of somebody that got sick, we had new policies.

266
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,640
An additional time for you to take off. So all that had to be put in place.

267
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:07,980
There was legal compliance. We had to make sure we were compliant with all of the guidelines for COVID masking testing, time off, all of that.

268
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:16,049
We had to look at all of our policies and see if they changed unemployment credits or was extra money being given to unemployment.

269
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,340
So the list goes on and on.

270
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:26,489
But so my point there in a complex decision, there's lots of decisions and lots of things that change and lots of impact on policy.

271
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,600
And that one was one that really had h.r.

272
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,630
Was a large presence, but it was a public health situation.

273
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:43,110
Okay. Just looking a little closer at the policies that you about 93 out of one.

274
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,350
Hundred and 80 policies had to change due to COVID.

275
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,780
So all those had to be rewritten and communicated out to the entire community.

276
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:04,639
Regulatory or regional decisions and decisions that drive new or changed policies had to go through a certain process, and that's on a Web website.

277
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,720
If you look up few of our policies, they're called SPG,

278
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,450
and you are bound to see this whole process for how our policy comes into being or how it needs to be changed.

279
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:25,970
So there's a very comprehensive policy. It was a very comprehensive way to put new policy in and and, you know, put those decisions along the way.

280
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:33,889
Examples were pandemic parental leave. There's been a lot in the news about sexual misconduct and a lot of changes.

281
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,640
And the university just announced that under the presence,

282
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:45,590
there's going to be a brand new area of the university that focuses extensively on that, along with bullying and that kind of thing.

283
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,180
So policies related to that all drive new or changed policies.

284
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,950
And if, you know, if you have any questions along the way, just please raise your hand.

285
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:04,540
And then I have a link in the presentation that shows the policies that you around in case you're interested.

286
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,200
This I found interesting in doing my research for the class,

287
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:20,870
I found several articles on what's called EVP evidence based decision making that a term familiar to you with your past classes in public health.

288
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,829
And a question I have here is what have you learned or experience?

289
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:36,320
And again, your jobs or your externship externship where there was a research component to collect and use data or evidence.

290
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,910
So here now is a focus to what does the data tell us?

291
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,849
What do we know? Again, with Colgan, sometimes there wasn't data or data was coming out, so it was really fast.

292
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:52,129
But oftentimes there might be years of data on a particular topic, and even with COVID,

293
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:57,560
they can go back to other pandemics and look at data to see what was going on.

294
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:06,830
But can you think of something that you did where you either needed to collect data through surveys or something like that,

295
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:16,430
or where there were databases existing where you could go in and find stats or information that you needed in order to make a decision,

296
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:22,810
or you heard others that you worked with make a decision where again, data was a huge component.

297
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,390
Can anybody think of anything like examples?

298
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,970
Show of hands when you were in the meetings, was data presented?

299
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,410
Or did you ever have to do or any of you data people where you had to do data yourself going to hand in the back?

300
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,260
Yeah. Nope. Nope. Stripe sweater. Yep. Yeah.

301
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,320
So one of my biggest projects over the summer, I worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield, Michigan.

302
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:55,760
They really wanted to do more initiatives on the commercial side, as most of their initiatives are tailored to the Medicaid side.

303
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,260
So I focus on maternal health myself because that's something I've always been very interested in.

304
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:06,140
And I had to collect data on the populations that PCBs addresses on maternal health outcomes.

305
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,770
I had to interview different areas on the company to see like what services and

306
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:14,210
programs we had available already and kind of assess like what other competitors had.

307
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:21,110
I'm going to come up with recommendations like for the commercial side to kind of fill in those gaps though BCBS does it offering maternal space,

308
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,599
the others do. And did you get to see the outcome of those decisions or are they still working there?

309
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,990
Still working on it? Yeah, I'm actually still working there and we're still following it.

310
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,270
Yeah. Yeah, that is that is a great example of where data's important.

311
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:43,930
Critical. Right. And do they have other areas, Blue Cross Blue Shield, where you went to get that data and access to the databases.

312
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:51,200
Yeah. So like customer reporting does a lot of like the actual like data like who has health outcomes, like who went through what.

313
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,320
So I had to meet with them to kind of learn about that.

314
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,130
The Value Partnerships Area talks about like different provider based initiatives going on like unconscious bias training.

315
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:07,760
So I kind of had to like interview a bunch of different areas within the company to not only get the data on the maternal health outcomes,

316
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,180
but also on like what we have available currently and what we're missing.

317
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,790
Thank you. Great example.

318
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:25,970
I'm not talking about this, you know, evidence based decision making, but like I said, that the circular diagram shows how you need collection.

319
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:34,400
You mentioned all of these evaluation and application of the evidence to decide what's applicable, what's not to some decision making.

320
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:43,309
And some of the key components of evidence based decision making include the best available scientific evidence.

321
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:50,090
So you might have to find that often in a large company like you mentioned, it's their right or they know where to get it.

322
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,580
But depending on if it was small,

323
00:35:52,580 --> 00:36:00,470
you might have to go and look outside the company and try to find it and contact other organizations right to get it.

324
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:06,439
So you know what is the best available using it systematically?

325
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,249
Because again, data can tell you a lot of things that you can even tell you what you want.

326
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:18,600
So you have to be really careful in projects that you're getting sort of that neutral, you know, again, applying this, you know,

327
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,889
in the way that you need to rather than a biased you mentioned unconscious bias you can there's there's articles

328
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:33,770
about unconscious bias and using data right so try not to do that applying it program planning frameworks to it.

329
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:40,550
And again, it sounds like this project did all of that engaging the community and decision making and reaching out.

330
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,520
Maybe you get so far in a project and you say, Well,

331
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:52,940
we got to go out and talk to other people about this conducting sound evaluation and then finally disseminating what is learned.

332
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:59,000
So I just think this is something that probably you'll learn more about and hear more

333
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,540
about and experience more depending what you do with your your graduate degrees and,

334
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,880
you know, the type of interest that you have in in public health.

335
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:21,430
Okay. Now, here's just some examples of data for decision making.

336
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,470
Again, I've mentioned a few in the past year.

337
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:28,159
We did $15 minimum wage across the university.

338
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,110
So we have to study how much that was going to cost us, but we had to find where that money was coming from.

339
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:42,199
So did some financial analysis there. A few years ago we decided to add in vitro treatment coverage to your benefits.

340
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,220
We didn't have that. So there was some work done that sometimes you form a committee at Michigan.

341
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:56,750
We have lots of committees, but they have a medical benefits committee or advisory group that studies different things.

342
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:02,900
Mental health. Several years ago, we moved from so many visits a year to unlimited.

343
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,940
You know, sometimes it needs a doctor's recommendation, but, you know,

344
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:15,200
opening that up for people that needed mental health, we we have some programs for back pain management.

345
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,250
They needed data. There's more and more being done.

346
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:24,350
Social determinants of health. Who needs it more than others?

347
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,640
Who doesn't have the money or the coverage to get it?

348
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,420
How can we help them, especially in our own community of employees?

349
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:40,010
And the data was shared when you're on parental leave to determine the best kind of plan that we could have.

350
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:46,130
And again, what would that cost us and the change in policies related to that in our benefits area.

351
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:53,240
I just want to add that I'm always trying into recruitment, retention and retirements and a lot of this,

352
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,280
as we talked about, you may very well be the hiring person.

353
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:05,330
You know, what what what do you know about that benefit package to make it attractive, to get that valuable resource that you need?

354
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:16,220
And knowing some of this level or being having that accessible can help you recruit what you may or may not need in in your in your leadership roles.

355
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:22,939
And again, where you're fresh in your new role as a leader, where are you going for data?

356
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,810
How do you know where might you want to even i.t.

357
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:36,560
When always they're going to help you technically. But where in the organization does the data sit right as you're looking at from a leader?

358
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:44,530
So in a friend is what I'm thinking and that's trying to make that relationship internally to determine where they

359
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:52,069
where to get that data from because it's going to help you in what you do either to recruit or retain you what it is.

360
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:58,280
You just want to go to the example earlier you got the data, but who are the experts on what it means?

361
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,480
Like if you're not right, if you haven't had experience? So I think you're saying the same thing.

362
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:10,100
So I don't mention it per se, but building relationships across our company in all sorts of areas,

363
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,710
you know, bringing candy or, I don't know, healthy vegetables, whichever way you like,

364
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:22,370
but truly building relationships where people do research and data that you think is going to be

365
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:27,679
related to your job and your need is is a very important thing that can really help you out.

366
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,540
And even if they're jammed, they like you, you've established just they'll help you out.

367
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,319
You know, they'll give you tidbits that I mean, it is amazing.

368
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,950
So I always try to be best friends with the data people,

369
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:46,190
even if you don't fully understand it because I mean, you know, when you need it will really help you out.

370
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:58,280
Okay. A couple other tools and we're not going to go through this I've listed that may be used when you're working on decisions and working with data.

371
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:06,139
I wondered if are there any other tools that you learned about that?

372
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:17,050
Can you that are used to gather data? Have all of you and your previous schooling or some of your work experiences are there, you know,

373
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,469
actually software tools that you're comfortable with and you use yourself or you've

374
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:27,530
learned over time about statistical tools is anybody had to work with statistical tools?

375
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,160
I see a few smiles. So, like, sass and.

376
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:42,280
You know, some of those are often used to to queue through data, again, depending on the role you're in.

377
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,780
You might just go to a different department and they do that for you,

378
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:52,840
but you might have to do that depending on what kind of work that you do and what kind of data you need.

379
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:04,270
All right. I talked about two decision models that I learned about or have used over the years that I want to share.

380
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,650
I'm just going to skim over this first one.

381
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:16,600
It's called the Pro Act model. And a lot of it there's a book, so you can see the resources on the slide.

382
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,870
And we're going to go quickly through the steps.

383
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:27,860
A lot of these will make sense or seem kind of intuitive to you versus something you've never heard about before.

384
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:33,370
But the first step is working on the right decision problem.

385
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:39,970
So making sure, as you're thinking about making decisions, that you're even making decisions about the right problem.

386
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,670
Sometimes there can be multiple problems.

387
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:51,670
I remember on both parental leave and on Obamacare, people would bring into the room a separate problem because they thought,

388
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,770
Oh, it's sort of related and this is my first chance or another chance to get it solved.

389
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,760
And we had a nicely say to people, no, that's a different problem.

390
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,270
Thank you for bringing that up. That's not related to this.

391
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,910
And again, I'm kind of making a joke. You should form another committee to talk about that problem.

392
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:14,200
So making sure you've got your problem scoped out is important.

393
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:19,149
You know, this just talks about defining it. Think about the constraints.

394
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:26,310
What can you do? What can't we do? Is there a workable scope to being able to get to the decision?

395
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:33,070
Ask others how they would see the situation. So the way you frame it is just really important.

396
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:41,029
An example I wanted to use is and I kind of mentioned just mentioned this your company,

397
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:47,079
your institution is going to move from a specific design of standard benefits to

398
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,970
an allowance that can be spent on a bigger selection of more diverse benefits.

399
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,460
Okay. So some of the allowance has to be used for your health care.

400
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,600
So even as a student, we want to make sure you're covered in health care.

401
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:12,670
Right. But you're around. Then we have a set, other dental legal we have for the employees some of the classic kinds of benefits that you're used to.

402
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:19,990
But this company's thinking about shifting from that classic kind of programing to.

403
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,560
Let's open it up. Let's say, hey,

404
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:29,020
let's make sure you have health insurance and then here's X more amount of money and

405
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,330
you can spend it on a whole bunch of different things that's applicable for your age,

406
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,049
where you are in life. Do you have kids? You know? Have kids?

407
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,700
Are you young? If you're healthy, you don't want to spend a lot on health care.

408
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:50,080
Right? And you might want to spend a lot on financial planning because you didn't learn it and you want to learn it.

409
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:56,050
So what is the package of benefits that will be offered?

410
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,010
Using the allowance approach is kind of the problem with the question here.

411
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,740
Okay. So things to think about is what is that exact problem?

412
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,910
What are the constraints to get to a design in two years?

413
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,560
So earlier we talked about, well, what were some of the things you thought about in that inventory?

414
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,829
So if the management says get it in two years,

415
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:25,540
that's already a time constraint because some contracts and things that you might negotiate might take longer than that.

416
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:29,560
So right away, you know, you have a time constraint. What other constraints are there?

417
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,900
Who are the stakeholders to help you? Who should you engage?

418
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:39,700
I'll keep using the word committee. When I went to work at U of M, I didn't even know what a committee was in committee.

419
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,860
There was committees everywhere. So anyway, we use, like I said, a lot of committees.

420
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,589
But who are those stakeholders who often get them together and ask them and go across the university?

421
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:56,530
Especially since we're a research university and we have hundreds of people studying hundred different things,

422
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:01,359
we'll get the best experts in, you know, in the same place so we can talk about that.

423
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,070
So that's some of the things you think about when you're looking at defining the problem.

424
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,809
Specify your objectives, they become criteria.

425
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:19,139
So again, determine what information you need to justify your decision.

426
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,210
So once you've scoped out their problem, talk to others about that and make do you agree?

427
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,530
Go to your sponsors. Go to whoever asks you to do the project.

428
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,470
Is this what you think we should be doing?

429
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:39,810
Kind of tone it down further and make sure that you've got the right focus and then determine how important a decision is.

430
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:47,610
Is this really important to do this right? Because you don't want to spend an inordinate amount of time on something if it's not that important.

431
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:55,740
But yeah, sometimes it's really important to get it right. And again, it was a big example about.

432
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,670
All right.

433
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:10,020
Alternatives, you know, use brainstorming again in the resources or at the end of this presentation, I found a lot of good questions to use.

434
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:16,830
You know, when you have to make decisions. But these are just ways, right, to find good alternatives.

435
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,850
So spending a lot of time in what are all the choices that we have.

436
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:30,340
So back to that benefits example, you would probably get in a room with a lot of your stakeholders and using a whiteboard.

437
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:35,440
It's so funny. There was a chalkboard and I'm like, What is this white stuff all over the chalkboard?

438
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:42,910
You need to use a chalkboard if you had to, but you might have a whole half a day or day.

439
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,290
And guys done this actually, you did this once,

440
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:53,200
leading a whole bunch of stakeholders in brainstorming or using some other methods

441
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,180
to decide what that list of possible things to grant that allowance would be.

442
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,089
So if we went around this room and don't worry,

443
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:07,120
I'm not going to today and ask every one of you what benefit would you like in a benefit package at the employer?

444
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,640
You'd all probably have something different that you'd want to spend your money on, right?

445
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:21,610
So we'd get you all in the room and we'd list all of those, and then we'd go off and do analysis on how much do those cost.

446
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:27,190
But anyway, that would be getting your alternatives and get together and remember this.

447
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,520
This mentions it. Create first and then evaluate later.

448
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,859
So in that session,

449
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:40,750
you'd want to make sure the facilitator kept you on the creation mode and just getting the list and not starting the evaluation yet.

450
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:49,050
Okay, we're going to do that later. We'll figure out the criteria to do that, and that comes down later as you're making a decision.

451
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,399
Okay. And after you've made that list, never stop looking for alternatives.

452
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,240
So you could be into the next steps of evaluation, getting data, all of that.

453
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:04,730
And you somebody may have a great idea. Don't unless you're too far along.

454
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:12,850
Don't say we can't hear that idea anymore. I mean, sometimes it's that scope creep and it's too much and you can't fit it into your time constraint.

455
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:20,770
But if you can tell what a good idea, just go out the door because you're on the third step of your decision making process.

456
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,150
Can I give them an example as well? It's a different kind of a decision.

457
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:34,200
But but it was a real one for for Denise and I weren't more so Dennis in that I want you to think March 2020 again this is Cody

458
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:45,610
and you've already seen the numbers that it was 51,000 staffers here on on campus that we had to protect and really think about.

459
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:55,840
Well, when March 2020 hit with COVID, we had a group of our staff that basically did the unemployment.

460
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,490
And as dangerous as COVID was,

461
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:10,780
we had to make a decision about what to do with that staff because they did thousands and I mean thousands and thousands of records for unemployment.

462
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,100
But we did not have a system. They could do it at home.

463
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:22,450
We knew that the government's going to need this information. We knew that there was going to be external people depending on it.

464
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:29,500
And so in looking at defining what it is we needed to do and who we needed to have,

465
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:39,010
sit and quickly looking at this information and the amount of data we had to protect and or produce, sometimes it's not a system decision.

466
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:45,460
Sometimes it's your people. Sometimes it'll be you and your people that you're making decisions for.

467
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,480
But the data will also suggest what sometimes will drive you.

468
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:59,680
Denise did a lot of looking into diving into what are the alternatives that she could give the staff to make them feel safe and protected.

469
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:08,320
I mean, there's you know, we talk about the culture and the climate and trust and protecting and feeling safe at work and a decision sometimes,

470
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:16,060
yes, can be system in what you're describing, but sometimes it's you as the leader protecting your staff.

471
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,210
And what data do you have to make that decision?

472
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:26,170
And, and we we did our best with that staff times it's emergency and you don't have all this planning, right?

473
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:33,309
So that's a good point. I guess we had to all have a letter in our car that said we can go to work.

474
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:37,420
It was the weirdest thing. I don't know what you all were doing in your life, but it was pretty weird.

475
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,370
Get on the road. No one was there.

476
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:47,829
In fact, I had a few issues when COVID opened up and people were driving again like they were in my way because I was so used to,

477
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,159
like, not paying attention. You know, there was no one.

478
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,280
There was no one in my commute to work.

479
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:59,710
And that's when it got busier and I had to wait. I was like, I'm mad, go back home.

480
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:03,220
I really losses. I mean, I was I was surprised at that.

481
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,169
But anyway, also, I bought a lot of lunches for those people that had to come in every day.

482
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:14,320
And it was very, very stressful. And we had to build a system for the data because the state of Michigan, it's all paper based.

483
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,479
And so we had to build a system to process and then we had massive fraud on unemployment.

484
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,540
So that hit us anyway. It was it was crazy.

485
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,900
But those are key decisions that also you have to make.

486
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:33,490
But you can still use some of these steps. You're just doing it much faster and you're thinking about the risk.

487
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:40,370
And that was true. DI was on the main committee for the university to decide every week if we were Marion, Mass.

488
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:45,159
If people needed to be tested and data was constantly changing.

489
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,710
I mean, they had experts across space. They were a big factor and all of those teams.

490
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:57,100
But you just had to keep at the end of the week and we got to make a decision for next Monday and get something out.

491
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:02,620
And so often you don't have a lot of time for any project work or something.

492
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,690
That's a future strategy.

493
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:13,510
You're going to have more time and be able to do these steps, you know, kind of in an orderly fashion before I move from here.

494
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:20,920
My only Is there anything else you would do to go about getting information for the design of the benefit program I've been talking about?

495
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,809
So I said, okay, we'll get a whole bunch of people that work there and we'll ask them what would they spend money on?

496
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:31,540
But what other research or data might you gather for that decision if you were in charge

497
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:37,960
of getting this done for your company outside of the employees that work for you?

498
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:43,870
Any thoughts? Yeah. Hi. You can look at your competitors and see what they're doing.

499
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,560
Yes, exactly. That's really good. Anybody else?

500
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:56,110
That's probably your main one that you would do. Especially those that are innovative and attracting, like, I don't know.

501
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:03,009
I don't know if you have any friends, relatives or whatever that have gone and worked for the Amazons or the tech companies.

502
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:08,020
But man, they give you food, clothing.

503
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,710
You might need somebody that works for me.

504
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:24,670
Her son graduated from Michigan. He went to work for Amazon and they raised his beginning salary seven times before even started knocking on doors.

505
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:30,720
And again, for me, like just hoteling with other people, it just the list went on and on.

506
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:35,770
And here this person who she retired around when I did, you do not want to go work for Amazon.

507
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:42,100
I just heard that. Yeah. So her whole life he was making more money than his mom, who was also in it.

508
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,370
So crazy. But yeah, the tides are turning on that.

509
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:53,710
You always have to be careful and consequences.

510
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,100
Here's an example. Actually thinking about taking a new job, right?

511
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,950
You when you're alternatives are generated,

512
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:10,599
you have to start thinking about the risk and the consequences of each alternative so you can further align your objectives.

513
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:10,929
Right.

514
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:19,240
And this is a really simple example, but this is the consequences table, you know, be way more sophisticated on most of the projects you work on.

515
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:25,540
But this is just, you know, should I take job A, B or C and pros and cons?

516
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:32,559
Somebody mentioned that earlier. What are the pros and cons of listing them all the individual,

517
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:37,990
then filling them in for what you know, on the jobs and then deciding for you as a person.

518
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:44,740
And you guys have probably done this and picking, you know, places you've worked or picking where you were going to go to graduate school.

519
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,809
But doing something like this and again, way more complicated for big decisions.

520
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:55,959
But it's always good to have a matrix that can help you sort out and evaluate and actually

521
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,120
put numbers so you could go further and put numbers to all these things and weights to them.

522
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:11,950
In fact, I built a priority kind of matrix that we would use in some of our decision making that had definitions and weights.

523
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:17,380
And you can plug all your information in and then go, Oh, this one's scored 50 in this one score of ten.

524
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,800
Okay, just another tool in helping me decide.

525
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:31,030
Don't always use only like values and whatever because again, as we talked about, it goes with the stakeholders and all the other things that you do.

526
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,370
Step five is consider trade offs.

527
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:45,350
Rank the alternatives, as I mentioned, greater risk profile, especially if it's big and complicated.

528
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,630
Again, if it's not a big decision, you don't need to do this.

529
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:54,420
But just looking at the risk sometimes if you're in startups or other things, you can take more risk.

530
00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:02,370
And so risk is okay. But just knowing the risks on your alternatives that your listing and then your sponsors,

531
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:06,930
who's ever charge you with doing this project, what risk tolerance do they have?

532
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,940
And it's interesting.

533
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:17,010
I think this has happened to us a few times when you have multiple sponsors and one is risk intolerant and one is risk tolerance,

534
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:26,210
and how do you build consensus with them to get to decisions that you want to make freedom for?

535
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,469
Right. That often works.

536
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:35,370
Right. Let's see. I have a question here.

537
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,450
Can I inject the example as well?

538
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,380
We also looked at our retirement benefits and you just as an example.

539
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:46,830
So again, two years from now, you're done with your fellowship.

540
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:53,970
You have your job and your boss says, I'm going to put you on a committee, and that's going to look at health benefits for the entire organization.

541
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,770
We feel that you've got what you need to to participate.

542
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:06,870
Right. And you're on the hook for not only the retirement benefits, but but who gets what and why.

543
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:17,070
And we had to go through that exercise and rank all the possibilities with the information and even looking at our peers,

544
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:23,850
but also looking at the trade offs. And I think I shared with you, we landed in Michigan.

545
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:29,460
Medicine employees were getting 9.5 return 2 to 1.

546
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:37,319
You heard me talk about the 2 to 1. But campus employees stayed at the full 10% match or 2 to 1 match, as they called it.

547
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:45,690
And the conversations that went on with that, the information that we had to develop and why and how many people will be impacted.

548
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:48,209
And it just didn't magically appear.

549
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:55,170
It is data that you want to question, you want to ask, you want to imagine, you want to think through how is it going to hit you?

550
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:59,880
What what gender, what age, succession planning, what does this look like from a cost perspective?

551
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,200
All that would would be within you and your team in doing that.

552
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:12,599
So again, is expanding your thoughts around what are we trying to solve, what are the alternatives and what are the tradeoffs?

553
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:21,990
And we knew one of the tradeoffs would be a concern for staff in Michigan medicine who felt like they weren't getting full, what campus was getting.

554
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:31,530
And we had to weigh that and understand that. And I do believe we've been at this for about four or five years with that difference in place,

555
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:36,090
and we are now looking at turning the corner to bring it back up.

556
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:41,310
They made the choice. They made a choice. Okay. Making the choice to go back and equate campus.

557
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,910
So we did it for five years. What did we save? What was the impact?

558
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:50,700
What was the cost? Why do we do it? Do you want your name associated with something like that?

559
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,980
Because people will find out. You were on that committee. You're on that committee.

560
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,270
What decisions are you making as a leader?

561
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:07,439
What's what does it matter for you? Or we just do it because it's cost effective and that's your only option.

562
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,280
You have to justify them to your community in what you're doing.

563
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:16,590
So I wanted to share that a little and I had a I had a simple little example so related to our benefits program.

564
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,690
Okay, let's talk about whether we're going to add pet insurance versus teeth whitening anyway.

565
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,190
Slight improvement or great. Two different benefits you might spend.

566
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:31,620
Maybe you can have both, but let's say we're down and for some reason we got to choose one or the other.

567
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:39,810
What's a few things that you think about? Okay, like if you were doing a matrix or even if you were just having a discussion,

568
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:47,480
what are the what some pro or con for either of those choices anyone see on a committee, right?

569
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:52,110
Yeah. You're on a committee and insurance or we're down to we've got them all paired.

570
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,709
But again, we've got this is our final choice.

571
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:02,820
Let's just say it's kind of silly, but I'm going to catalog one on for you to select or teeth whitening.

572
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:07,980
So what are some of the things that are considerations in that decision?

573
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:18,110
At Bagram Air Base. Oh, sorry. Oh, it just depends on, like, what the group's needs are groups handling pets.

574
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,620
And do they need that insurance or is it just doesn't have pets?

575
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,229
Or like one, two people have pets, so they don't have that.

576
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:32,600
They might want to fight over pet insurance, but if join the group, have pets, they might take the insurance over teeth whitening.

577
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:36,680
So you might go back to data if you collected it from the CFA.

578
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,570
Ranked one higher than the other, right? Right. Yeah. Hi.

579
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:47,540
But yeah, it's just like, you know, I think a lot of people would value the pet insurance more, but not as many people would have the pets.

580
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:52,579
I mean, just kind of going off what was just said, whereas everyone has teething and benefit from that,

581
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:57,290
but the value of the other one's probably more than anybody else.

582
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:04,930
That's. To the pure cost of just any type of insurance in the pension system quite as much as like yes.

583
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,389
Like our health insurance like it still is not cheap as well.

584
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:12,969
Like teeth whitening could be more but more beneficial for like a cheaper dollar.

585
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:16,990
So it could provide more overall value at a lower price point. Yeah.

586
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:22,330
And it turns out a couple of things I listed is teeth whitening programs, at least at my dentist.

587
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:27,470
You could pay $200 for a lifelong whitening. So not a bad deal, right?

588
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:32,020
Pet insurance costs claims could be thousands of dollars.

589
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:40,450
Right. And so it could be much more costly on a per coin basis to go after that cost.

590
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:47,830
Let's say we're going to end state the pet insurance, then at least like a piece don't have pets or wouldn't apply for it.

591
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:53,919
And then maybe then just be like a cash alternative that you don't really like something similar equivalent,

592
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:02,480
but she was willing to spend that money anyway, or at least put it back in the pockets or provide whatever necessary restrictions are needed.

593
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,040
It just make it on par for both options.

594
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,399
Yeah. You might be able to offer it. You were just going to have an overall allowance.

595
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,120
You might be able to offer both. You know, I don't know what the circumstances.

596
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:21,399
Again, kind of a silly example. I had pets provide comfort and companionship, which may be more beneficial for mental health and frightening.

597
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:30,100
But you might argue with me, know my weight is really contributes to my mental health in my face.

598
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:37,569
Oh yeah. The question would have been worth it to look into how many people like how to utilize art in school benefits.

599
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:43,330
Ah yeah, yeah. So you might have already done that when you were doing all the alternatives and the

600
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:48,130
evaluation and you might just be able to go back at that data or if you didn't have it.

601
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:54,390
Oh, could we hurry up and get it? You know, could we quickly call and see if they have that and then again evaluate that?

602
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:01,479
Yeah. So collecting data, looking at data, you're already collected, thinking about the number of stakeholders that might use it.

603
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,460
You guys brought up a lot of good factors that would play into that decision making.

604
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:12,670
Thanks. Okay. Any questions about that method again?

605
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:19,360
Pretty straightforward. I think you've probably used all of those steps and things that you've done and projects that you've done,

606
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:28,209
but it's just a good reminder to go through those, especially if you have to use that framework, maybe if you're involved in bigger decisions.

607
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:37,690
Right, you don't have to do it. Well, maybe sometimes on a personal decision, but the other method is called Leap.

608
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:42,910
I learned this in 2008 from a gentleman that came to the university.

609
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:48,430
I was at a leadership academy that they offer that was really cool for leaders to further learn.

610
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:53,649
And he came and he talked about this method, what this method is about.

611
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:56,680
It's who should you involve in a decision?

612
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:02,740
Like, should you make it on your own? Should you consult with people?

613
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:09,820
Should you ask other people to make the decision and then condone it?

614
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,910
Or you should you have a team do it. So it's just some guidelines that work pretty well.

615
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:21,910
In fact, what he told us is when this method that I'm going to show you is used,

616
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:31,960
the acceptance by the stakeholders is 3 to 1, and you're going to have more acceptance over the decisions because often.

617
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,950
Usually, right. These days, not everybody's all. Yeah, yeah.

618
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:38,620
That was a good decision. Right. You have the dissenters.

619
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:49,689
So you're going to have more people that say, okay, I am for it, or I understand how you made it when you use this method if you need to.

620
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:55,930
And again, this is for complex decisions, not something that you can just decide alone.

621
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:03,700
Okay. So the concepts in this are three.

622
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:09,680
Quality. Acceptance and time.

623
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,850
So how important is it for the decision to be right?

624
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:22,400
Is it important for others to accept the decision? And is there a time constraint that affects the decision?

625
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,420
Example mask mandates. Again, there was no time.

626
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:30,980
Well, yeah, I was of the essence. They had to be made right away.

627
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:36,440
Therefore, in thinking about who made that decision and who you involved,

628
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:44,090
maybe sometimes just one or two people had to say, this is what we're going to do because there wasn't enough time.

629
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:45,920
Sometimes that's what happens.

630
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:53,510
But normally, again, in working on something strategic, there's more time and you can be thoughtful about your approach.

631
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:03,710
So, yeah, yeah. So here's a little bit about decision making guidelines, okay.

632
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:12,200
And what you would think of. And we'll give you a handout that you can just take with you that gets into more detail about how you would use those,

633
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,870
because it's really it's really pretty simple to follow.

634
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:24,280
But you go through these questions and quality, acceptance and time and you answer the questions and then that will lead you to a response.

635
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:30,439
So something that guy's going to give you is she's going to give you both an exercise that you can do.

636
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,790
We won't do it today. It's called Applying for Service Center.

637
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:41,930
And then there's a matrix that you can use and ask yourself these questions that you see on the screen.

638
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:49,069
And then it leads you to you just circle down and it leads you to say, okay, should I use a team?

639
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:52,810
Should I answer it myself? You know, how should I approach this?

640
01:07:52,850 --> 01:08:02,210
So again, this tool that was used just to decide, can I make a decision alone?

641
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:09,080
Should I ask others for help? Should I get a team together and let the team make the decision?

642
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,279
Remember, if you do that, if you say, I'm going to get a whole team together and I'm going to make this choice,

643
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,760
then even if you don't agree with the team, you have to go by the choice.

644
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:23,059
So you give up control and sometimes power when you do that.

645
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,150
But it might be the best to use a team.

646
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:33,470
So again, you can look over this at your region and try it sometimes, you know,

647
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:38,180
again, not on something simple, but on something a little more complicated.

648
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:42,020
And I think I can make it or I'm just going to ask my friend Joe.

649
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:48,260
And then by following the Matrix, you might see, Oh, I really need a team of people.

650
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:56,510
Okay, so this gives us a few minutes to talk about an example I have up here.

651
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:03,260
And again, i ask guys still to use the pandemic, but you're the h.r.

652
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:12,530
Director for a small company. You're asked by your ceo or your president to establish a policy around mask mandates.

653
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,860
Again, all this is in the past, but, you know, it certainly wasn't.

654
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:25,490
Some of the concerns are filtration space and proximity of your employees safety as more employees return to work.

655
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,390
So yeah, even when most of COVID was over and more and more people were returning to work,

656
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:36,350
there was really a lot of discussion on why do they have to come back and wear masks?

657
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:41,810
And truly, in the health system, they're still all wearing masks. So how many years later?

658
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:49,430
Two and a half years later, people that go to work every day in our health system, I'm still wearing a mask as an employee.

659
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:57,499
And I remember even last year teaching this class, it's still to wear it and talk for an hour and a half and whatever.

660
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,239
You know, like we're still honoring if somebody wants to wear a mask, they certainly can.

661
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,920
And there's places that I wear a mask. But anyway, this would have been a key decision.

662
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:14,240
So some things to think about and we can just go around the room and maybe get some of your thoughts.

663
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:20,420
What is the evidence based data that you might collect to help with this decision?

664
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:24,730
Okay. We'll go back to that. Who are the stakeholders right involved?

665
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:33,080
Understand all the implications and assist with the decision making and what are the areas of communication and change management?

666
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:40,610
So three questions here. And again, you know, just kind of what you guys think.

667
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:47,420
So what I'd like to do is we've got three sections and I'm going to call on the first section over here

668
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:52,070
to tell me what is the evidence based data that you might collect to help you with your decision?

669
01:10:53,210 --> 01:11:00,620
My 50 yard line, it's like in zone in here and I stuck what I got this one I got who are the stakeholders?

670
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,990
And we just did stakeholders last week that you might involve to understand all the implications and assist with the decision making.

671
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:10,230
And then here we. What are the areas of communication and change management?

672
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:16,850
Let's start with the first question over here. What is the evidence based data that you would use to make this decision?

673
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:21,820
You are now on the hook. You're the director. Real life situation.

674
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,560
Like real life situation. What are you what are you going to get in place?

675
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:39,450
You probably wouldn't count the case counts called the case counts, but still taking for fact evidence.

676
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,090
To go a little bit further because his point,

677
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:51,970
I think by community level case counts but also case counts within the organization you reside in positive or negative each day and just updated it,

678
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:58,930
looking in to see what does the data show about the type of mask and kind of what mask.

679
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:09,160
And you can also buy food and how is that also been showing up in the research and then and in fact we heard a lot about that or just.

680
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:15,440
Make my own phone call. Any other evidence based data?

681
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:21,650
Because we had to make this decision literally within 24 hours to decide.

682
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:25,220
So we did not have a lot of time. And they look to our public health leaders.

683
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,320
And when people find out who you are and what you do and where you came from and you're the next leaders,

684
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:35,780
you will be pulled in an images looking sort of in-house,

685
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:40,790
kind of what is the air filtration system like and how effective has that been over the years?

686
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:47,480
Is it up to date? Is it like running like on gold standards, like for whatever the language is within that area?

687
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:53,180
Then looking back to just seeing how does that correlate based counselor to the president,

688
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:58,850
anybody else whose own maybe like currency is CDC guidelines based on like what industry

689
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:03,500
were in even if that's your regulators that are telling you anybody else comes?

690
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:08,910
Anybody else want to add to the evidence base? Data that you might look at.

691
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:19,430
Okay. Second question. Who are the stakeholders that you might involve to understand all the implications and assist with the decision making?

692
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:28,820
You are the director general and maybe leaders or members of each different department.

693
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:31,910
I would kind of give a better representation of the whole company.

694
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:43,930
They like, people are going to be affected by the thing. Asian students like frontline nurses like people that wouldn't.

695
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:48,440
Are they going to feel more safe that people are doing it? Is it really enough? Is it more neutral?

696
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:53,720
And like, what are the odds of that kind of deal from like the ground?

697
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:59,340
Front row. Are you going to pull in as a stakeholder?

698
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:06,790
And so I'm still looking at my. Yeah. Yeah.

699
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,780
Which, again, I think that since some of the concerns are filtration and spacing,

700
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:16,880
I think you would want maybe like head of facilities who can speak to some of the HPC

701
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,840
or like office setup kind of situations if there's anything we can mitigate there.

702
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,850
Yep. For purposes of with Daniel Shane, she's the director of Environmental Health Services.

703
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:34,520
Who else is at your table trying to determine whether or not you should have masks of your.

704
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:42,069
Maybe public health experts, either in internal or external.

705
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,910
The organization,

706
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:54,160
which technically would be you graduating from the School of Public Health because the same key areas of communication and change management.

707
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,040
The director.

708
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:07,049
Yeah, I guess like using some of the evidence based data that you've got and communicating that with with your employees to update them on.

709
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:11,730
Like, you know, whether the counts of cold cases of the employee or the company or in the area

710
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:15,110
as to and the kind of using that as to why you might be making your decisions,

711
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:22,670
how are you rolling it out? You should be at the table for how you rolling it out.

712
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:40,840
Called. So when you go to an organization in your fellowship and after and after your getting your new job, somebody is communicating.

713
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:45,280
There's got to be a department of communication. There has to be a public affairs.

714
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,770
Do you know them? Would you want to know them?

715
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,150
Because getting a communications degree is great.

716
01:15:55,810 --> 01:16:02,980
But how are you messaging? What words are you going to utilize to change the culture to say we need to mask?

717
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:06,719
And then in that area.

718
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:17,760
So I turned to my dad, which I will make sure is in the resource is die as is if you ever use this model for who should make the decision.

719
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:22,370
And you see those letters that you're going to circle. What do they mean you don't have that script?

720
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:28,920
Who realized that you didn't look at it yet anyway, so I want to make sure you get it.

721
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:36,660
Basically there are l is you decide a line now I as you seek information and then you decide.

722
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:44,219
So first line you're the decision maker. The second one you're going to get some info earlier on someone.

723
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:49,170
So I asked my friend, okay, so I just checked out with somebody or a couple people.

724
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,800
LC As you consult with individuals and then you decide so there's more than one

725
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,650
individual and you share the problem individually and you ask their opinion like,

726
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,130
Hey guy, what do you think he does? What do you think?

727
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,599
And then you collect all that info, but you're still deciding.

728
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:16,739
So the first three in this line are you're still making the ultimate choice and you're accountable, responsible for the decision then.

729
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:23,790
LCT As you consult with your group and then decide so it's a whole group, it's a whole team and what you're going to do.

730
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:27,540
But again, you're still deciding and then the T is the team.

731
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,410
So really all of them, you make the choice.

732
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:38,580
It's just you talk to more and more people about it and get more and more information and advice and maybe even data.

733
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:43,469
And in the last one, you really say, well, the team's got to figure this out.

734
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:51,030
We want everyone to know that they were a part of the decision, that they had a say in the decision,

735
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:56,100
and therefore it might still be majority rules, but they know that you did it as a team.

736
01:17:56,220 --> 01:18:05,850
So again, we'll make sure you have that. The exercise is is simple and but but try it sometime and use these questions and you'll be surprised.

737
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:12,780
It's like, oh, really? Shouldn't make the decision for myself. So here are these sources before we wind up.

738
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:15,880
Are there any questions about things that we talked about?

739
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,440
Again, as a reminder, we talked about a couple of different models you can use.

740
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:26,200
We talked about some other tools you can use. We talked about some examples that might involve h.r.

741
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:32,390
And speech and things that you might talk about and have to make do decision making on.

742
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:39,069
I found some new resources just before this class that I put in the resource list

743
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:43,210
that I thought were really good and further use that evidence based method.

744
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:48,900
I just really think that's something you'll see more and more as leaders and in speech.

745
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:59,610
So use all these tools. Hopefully there are things that you will be able to use as you continue your education and your careers.

746
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:40,960
And thanks for your time. I love waking up early.

747
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:47,700
I sold my house, and I did. I'm sorry, I.

748
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:57,990
I can't. It's been.
