1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,180
So we used to say how we stock sale.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,860
I don't recall any announcements from anyone.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:25,110
Yes, but this is like the let's take off a somewhat like kind of a funny announcement to make.

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:33,030
I'm part of a club that like community partnership with this daycare center in the South Side

5
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,210
of Chicago that provides free childcare to young parents so they can finish high school,

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,530
get their kids, start the career. And we're having this fundraising event on next Friday.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,610
It's. This is actually a water pong tournament.

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:58,560
We also have like these really cool prizes from local businesses that we can do raffles and we do raffles for.

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,320
And I'll send out a poster in the space class, a 24 hour chat.

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,960
It's a really cool, cool organization because I don't think that there's a lot of like student orgs that have like such a close community partnership.

11
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,759
And like she called us two weeks ago and she was like, Hey, Maya, like, I need 6000 dollars.

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,490
You think you can help me find it? So, yeah, it would be really cool.

13
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,150
Then I can talk for hours and hours about all what she does.

14
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:48,480
Yeah, I think that is waterfall and then the other kind of fluids and are probably pong groups or other announcements.

15
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:58,500
All right. And you all got a flier about the. Fall harvest coming up.

16
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,120
Thank you. All right. Anything else?

17
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:13,810
All right. So last time we started talking about critical thinking and critical pedagogy, this week,

18
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,850
I this is the very beginning of the semester when I talked a little bit about our approach.

19
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:27,150
So just to remind you, you know what? How this class is framed, but then also what you can do in your interventions.

20
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,710
So, you know, a lot of what we do in in public health is there is an educational component to it.

21
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,110
And so when we're thinking about health promotion,

22
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:50,520
we want to think about how ever we're addressing and changing health behaviors that we want to do that.

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,950
Keeping in mind social realities, historical factors, things like that, especially if you're using a critical pedagogy approach,

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:07,260
and then you'll have two assignments where you will be developing interventions.

25
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,770
And in those, we are asking you to do that using critical approaches.

26
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:26,399
So also part of what you do in critical pedagogy is raising students critical consciousness regarding structural oppression and self-examination.

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,910
So we we try and do that in this classroom setting. But you can also do that in your public health interventions.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,730
So when you're working with people, instead of just saying, okay, well, here we're going to do a health screening and help you change your behavior.

29
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,090
You need to really contextualize that. You know, why is it that this neighborhood has higher rates of high blood pressure?

30
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,780
You know, what is it that's going on in your community that may need to be addressed at multiple levels?

31
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,210
So it's more than just that on health, education.

32
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:11,409
So good ol Paolo Frere. Hopefully you've ingested and then integrated it into your brain.

33
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:24,320
And so some of the just the key controls in terms and I know that last week with the killer you watched the videos and chat about this.

34
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,000
So it's been a little bit of a test to see how much of it actually stuck in your head.

35
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:38,150
So a big part of what he talks about is the practices of action and reflection.

36
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:48,770
And, you know, this is a continual process where it's not like you just act once and then it's over.

37
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,790
You know, social problems, social issues don't go away with one act.

38
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,820
So it needs to be this continual process.

39
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,370
You know, like it says here, it's not enough for people to come together and dialog in order to gain knowledge, but they have to act together.

40
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,530
So again, if you just sit around and talk about how [INAUDIBLE] the world is, you're going to get really depressed.

41
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:18,440
But if you talk about how [INAUDIBLE] the world is and identify what some of the causes of that shadiness are,

42
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,510
and then work toward action that can increase your sense of power.

43
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:31,550
And actually you can also gain collective power through that knowledge and that action and also individual power as well.

44
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:41,420
So a big part of our things at the crux or the core of what he talks about is really about this whole process of dialog discussion.

45
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,220
But then action and dialog is a really critical part of what fair talks about.

46
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,580
And so applying this, you know, in this class we have the critical functions are goals.

47
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,240
I try to, you know, engage people throughout questions, have some to have a discussion, having to think about things.

48
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,600
But then also in your public health interventions, again, this is something you can think about bringing into that as well.

49
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:13,580
So we've talked a lot about how in working with communities, we need to go to communities and ask them questions,

50
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:22,250
involve them in the process, see what their needs are, see how they can be part of any change efforts, things like that.

51
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,120
That needs to be a discussion, needs to be a dialog.

52
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:36,740
And I think we have to be really careful that our dialogs are not just two people talking where one is really talking and the other is listening.

53
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,340
You know, that often, unfortunately, is the case.

54
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:48,140
And when there's power differentials, where the person with power is talking and the person without power may be responding,

55
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,200
but not really given a chance to truly dialog.

56
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:02,120
And so when we're thinking about what we're doing with and on behalf of communities, we have to think about how can we engage in true dialog?

57
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:09,480
And often that means change in the way that we do dialog because you know, we have a very academic.

58
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,350
Is that even a word anyway, a very academic way of looking at discussion and dialog.

59
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,109
And if you're working with different communities, they may interact in very different ways, you know.

60
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:30,350
So for instance, I know in some early work that when I was working in Chicago that we were doing

61
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,320
around women that were in high risk for sexually transmitted infections,

62
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,700
that we had living room groups.

63
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,120
So people would identify like community leaders and these different neighborhoods,

64
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:55,820
and they would hold meetings in their living room and they would talk in their living room often, you know, maybe having a drink, some snacks.

65
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,740
And so it was all run by the women in the community and communicating and dialog it in a way that felt comfortable to them.

66
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:13,879
There's been a number of interventions that have been done in barbershops where, you know, the barbers are trained to be health educators.

67
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,600
And so while you're getting your haircut, they may be asking you about cancer screening, things like that.

68
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:29,300
There's been a number done in Beauty Shop, so thinking about where do people have conversations, you know, where do you really discuss things?

69
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:39,380
Because it's really unnatural if you think about it, to like bring people to a, you know, a university room or even like, you know,

70
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,400
I know some interventions we've done like in libraries and communities, at least it's it's closer and saying, but even that's a little artificial.

71
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,060
But think about and talk to the community about where do you have conversations, where do you have dialog, you know, and wherever that is.

72
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:01,340
Then think about delivering your intervention in those spaces because it just, it, it's getting it really.

73
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,129
Breaks down people's resistance because they're there in their home.

74
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,020
They're not in your home, you know.

75
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:18,100
And so many interventions are done where people have to come into a hospital, come into, you know, the university building, all those kinds of things.

76
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:26,140
And a big part of dialog, too, is that each person in the dialog hasn't.

77
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,739
You have to trust each other and that can be hard. And what would help?

78
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:36,790
Because, you know, our field stunts are really [INAUDIBLE] things and so you can't just expect trust from the beginning.

79
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,590
You have to often earn your trust. And so thinking about that, well, let me throw that to you.

80
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:51,340
So if you're working with a community that maybe has been not treated so well by the public health community,

81
00:09:52,270 --> 00:10:01,090
what would be a way that you could earn your trust before you even think about developing interventions, or are other actions?

82
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,960
What are the ways you might earn their trust so that you're willing to listen?

83
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,460
I'm sorry that you're willing to listen. Okay. And how would you do that?

84
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,460
Simply listening to a lot of people. Don't actually listen.

85
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,480
They get defensive. They only need to say back.

86
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:27,240
But if you show that you're willing to listen and actually hear and understand, the other person wants to say, then I think that builds trust.

87
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
Mm hmm. Yeah. We often talk about active listening.

88
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,210
And if you. How many people have I heard of? Active listening? Yeah.

89
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,530
So a lot of folks have. I mean, you know, people talk about it in like communications and and, you know, other people.

90
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,920
So you have to really be engaged. So, you know, making eye contact, looking at your body language.

91
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,590
I mean, I've seen people working in community organizations where they look so damn uncomfortable

92
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,630
that I wouldn't talk to them because they're like really kind of looking around,

93
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,290
you know, you've got your body says a lot and asking questions and doing like the verbal nods.

94
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,800
And I'm like, Yeah, what about this? Things like that.

95
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I think that's that's one. What's another way to build trust by being there, like, consistently.

96
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,209
Like the more you show your face in the community and the more that you show.

97
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:26,460
Like, yeah, to the example I was talking about earlier where only we only had this close partnership is because we go there more frequently.

98
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,380
Yeah. So yeah, with some of my grad students, I said, you need to show up and shut up.

99
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,200
So you need to be there, but you also need to keep your agenda in check.

100
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,909
And you're not there to teach. You're not there to direct.

101
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,760
You need to just be there. You know, with a lot of organizations that I work with before I do any work with them,

102
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,630
I just ask them what I can do and I'll, you know, cut the grass, change the water cooler,

103
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,010
hang out at a drop in center, do all that kind of stuff and just be there,

104
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,520
you know, so they can find out more about me and I can find out more about that.

105
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:11,160
Yeah. And that consistency is really important because unfortunately in some cases,

106
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,959
public health intervention is there are people working in health departments will come in and they're just like coming in to do their thing

107
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,280
and then they're out like they might come in and do like a flu shot clinic and then they're out and they never talk to the agency again.

108
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,420
And the next time they come in the next year, they might be like, Nah,

109
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,070
we'll go with someone else, you know, someone who's who showed a real interest in our community.

110
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:42,190
Who else? Yeah. ADLER And then I mean, I think it goes both ways.

111
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,580
This kind of goes both ways. Like I was thinking of vulnerability.

112
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:52,960
So like. To build of or to be able to be vulnerable, you kind of have to build trustworthiness in the first place.

113
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,740
But also I think that if one is like shows a sense of vulnerability or is not is comfortable in the situation,

114
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,380
expressing things that are not easy to necessarily talk about, it kind of shows that there is a.

115
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,240
Like a sense of trust there. To have serious conversation and how much to do that.

116
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,310
Know I'm a very practical guy. So what? What?

117
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,110
Give me an example. I mean, I agree with you. Yeah. I think just talking more about, like, personal experience, personal identity,

118
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,139
like, really critically reflecting on yourself and putting it into the like,

119
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:36,340
putting it into the perspective of others, like really critically reflecting and kind of like building constructive criticism on it.

120
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,189
Like not being afraid to point out your wrongdoings or things like that.

121
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:46,680
And it shows that you're willing to have vulnerable conversations and build trust with you.

122
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,139
Okay. Yeah. I think, you know, sometimes, you know, as professionals,

123
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,450
we're trained to have this professional distance, you know, with the people with which we're interacting.

124
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,549
I know as a clinical psychologist, you know, I was trained that like they should know nothing about me.

125
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:10,770
I'm just like this, you know, kind of stoic person there to reflect and draw, you know, pearls of wisdom and things like that.

126
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,170
And doing this kind of work that doesn't work.

127
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,220
You know, you do have to sometimes decide, be vulnerable and talk about yourself, that you have to be careful not to overshare.

128
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,220
So you're not there to like have your partner be your therapist.

129
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,730
But I think it's okay to share certain parts of yourself that you feel comfortable with,

130
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,520
because I think when they see that, they see that you're just a human, you know?

131
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,950
And I think you have to be your authentic self, too. You know, and that's another thing where especially, you know,

132
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,670
I've seen this with a lot of white students who go into communities of color and they're

133
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:55,800
trying to fit in and using mannerisms or language or other things that just don't work.

134
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,230
Yeah. Just drop that.

135
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,710
You know, it's I, I think, you know, for a lot of folks, they would probably rather have someone who looks very different than you,

136
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,810
but who's authentic about it and owns it and someone who's trying to be someone that they're not.

137
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,990
And even if we have shared identities with them, we can't assume that our journey has been the same as their journey, you know?

138
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,610
So we can't say, hey, I'm, you know, so and too, you know, that may come through natural conversation or you may have some shared experiences,

139
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:34,100
but you can't paint on that as like, oh, okay, well, you're going to automatically connection me now that.

140
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,370
And I was like, Oh, that cool. Anyone else?

141
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,670
Yes. Well, that's like adding on to that. I was going to say taking ownership of the mistakes, like even a thing that happened in the past.

142
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:49,590
Like you can't just come into the conversation and like negate everything that's happened because no one's really going to trust you.

143
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,470
So you have to take ownership of that and accountability of those mistakes, kind of.

144
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:58,859
Yeah. Yeah. And that ties into some of what you said, too. And I think that's an excellent point.

145
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,070
And, you know, when I first came to University of Michigan, when I was reaching out to different community groups,

146
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:13,860
I did my homework to see how, you know, you had kind of [INAUDIBLE] up, to be honest, in different communities and different ways.

147
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,979
And I came in and talked about that from the very beginning, you know, and said, you know,

148
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,850
if you don't trust me, I don't blame you, you know, because this is the history.

149
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,229
This is what happened. This is who I am and this is where I'm coming from.

150
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,600
And if you choose to let me into your home, your community, that's cool.

151
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:43,409
If not, I totally get it because I think when you pretend like it didn't happen or I've seen some people which will do like blame shifting and say,

152
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,500
well, that wasn't really my department, that was another department.

153
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,500
So I'm all good that that doesn't work either.

154
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:57,030
Yeah, I would say I think a good way to think about it would be like admitting to the shortcomings of your perspective if you don't share an identity.

155
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,900
Yeah, but. If there was something that didn't work in the past, engage in the dialog of how you can fix it and how you can learn more.

156
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,430
Yeah, exactly. And I think you have to. Yeah.

157
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,880
And I think part of that, too, is, you know, and acknowledging your different shortcomings,

158
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:22,530
you also want to make sure you don't engage in any kind of oppression Olympics, you know, where you're like, Well, I know what it's like to see that.

159
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:30,580
So, you know, we need to leave that [INAUDIBLE] at the door because even though you may have oppressed intersectional identities,

160
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,810
the fact that you're still in a power position as someone who is delivering public health services,

161
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,970
that automatically makes you different and you automatically aren't really part of that good.

162
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:50,680
So I think, you know, really when you're working in and with and avoid having communities, that that respect is something again,

163
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,350
keep in mind you have to earn and they don't have to give it to you and sometimes they won't and sometimes you're not the best person for the job.

164
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:04,720
And if that is the case, then you can collaborate, bring other people in or say, you know, you're right, this just isn't going to work.

165
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,160
And I think when First Time's about dialog, some of the things that he talks about is, you know, the issue of love.

166
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,120
And it's funny because again, in public health, we don't talk about love.

167
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,420
A couple of years ago, I was on this campaign to bring love into public health, and it didn't go very far.

168
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,399
But I was especially, you know, when I really tried hard,

169
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,100
I like to talk about in all my meetings and classes and people just don't look at me like I was a freak.

170
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:42,940
But one of the first times I was is dread. But, you know, when we think about love as care and we think about commitment, you know,

171
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,879
because I think people often when you say love, they go to romantic love or sexualized love, things like that.

172
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,980
But I think that if we really you know, if we care about our community and like you were talking about my being committed,

173
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,750
showing up or you being there, then we can really engage in dialog,

174
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:04,690
you know, and, and I would say even with teaching, like if I didn't care about your,

175
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:11,740
your journey, your academic journey, about your careers, I couldn't do a decent job.

176
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,030
And that's why I think there's so many [INAUDIBLE] professors because they don't

177
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,780
care and they're just doing it because they have to in order to do the research.

178
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,350
And and I think that, you know, we need to put more emphasis on teaching and having people in the classroom.

179
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,280
We really do care about what they're doing. I mean, I have fun doing this stuff.

180
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,740
I think it's you know, I love seeing people look at the world in different ways.

181
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,639
And I really do care. I mean, I keep in touch with a lot of my students over the years.

182
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,260
I still, you know, my very first doctoral student. We still collaborate and work together.

183
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,020
And I think that if we're going to really, truly have that level of dialog, we do have to care and we have to be committed.

184
00:19:51,580 --> 00:20:01,930
So those are just important points. And then this last point about question what each person needs and question, I would knock out the he or she,

185
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,219
we need to get rid of all that gendered crap when they know and realize and through dialog,

186
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,100
existing thoughts will change and new knowledge will be created.

187
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:19,149
So, you know, I learn from all of you, hopefully you learn from me so that that's the dialog process as we're always learning from each other.

188
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,110
And when we're working in and with communities, that's what we should be doing.

189
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,530
And to me that's part of the fun. That's the fun part of working with me is I love to learn about you know,

190
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:36,730
I love to learn about, you know, just different ways that people view the world because that,

191
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:44,920
you know, with that, if you're always going in with an eye toward learning and growing and developing, you're never going to get bored.

192
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,610
You know, you're going to have you're going to enjoy your career the rest of your life.

193
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,610
And I've seen people that get a little crusty and they're like, We're going to do this again.

194
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,210
Then you need to retire, get new job, conscientious zation.

195
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,300
I always have a hard time saying this word, but I think I've pulled it off pretty good.

196
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,790
I think that, you know, once again, he's right in development again.

197
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,950
So I should have you pronouncing all these words properly.

198
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,550
Yeah, I tried it when I was working in Mozambique, and it just it didn't really work very well.

199
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:24,370
They just like to laugh at me a lot. So I often become the comic relief, even when I don't need to.

200
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,249
But with this. So it's the process for talked about.

201
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:39,430
This is a process of critical awareness and once it's kind of like an awakening in some ways, you know,

202
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:51,250
it's like seeing the social reality is it's engaging in this critical reflection and action and it really is kind of like,

203
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,020
yeah, an awakening is like seeing the world and through a different lens.

204
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:02,800
And again, action is. A fundamental part of this process and about changing the reality.

205
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,060
We don't have to accept every reality that's out there.

206
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:15,130
I mean, there's multiple realities and there's multiple ways in which we socially construct our realities.

207
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,540
And we have to. We don't have to.

208
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:28,030
But if you are moving toward the stage of comprehensive zation, you are moving toward trying to make the world a different place.

209
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,080
So again, is that reflection, action, reflection, action.

210
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,850
And really, you know, like the last one here is uncovering real problems and actual needs.

211
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,040
And that's so critical to public health, even though forever didn't really need to be talked about education.

212
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:51,640
But in public health, that is so important because we often don't look at the real problems and the real needs.

213
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,020
We often look at what we think or what our funders think or want to see.

214
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,320
CDC see things but not what the community really thinks.

215
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,760
It's. So here's the process of critical consciousness.

216
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:10,440
So first, you need to apply critical thinking skills to examine the situation.

217
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:18,150
Then develop a deeper understanding of one concrete reality and then devise, implement and evaluate solutions to the problems.

218
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:25,830
And next class, I'm going to show you some examples of how we've done this in the real world and how this process works.

219
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:36,300
There's different ways. Some interventions have used different processes called critical consciousness coaching,

220
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,840
where you help people through this process because it's not always a natural process and you can always give people a copy of,

221
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,640
you know, pedagogy the oppressed and say, go read this and then your life will be better.

222
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:58,180
So you often have to work with communities where they are and within their context to help find ways to improve critical thinking,

223
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,430
develop that understanding, and then develop them. But those are real solutions.

224
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,970
So two components of this are anti oppressive thinking.

225
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,730
And so that's why in the beginning of class, we talk a lot about oppression and privilege and power,

226
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:27,720
because in order for critical consciousness to bring about social change, we first have to understand where where's the where, where's the oppression?

227
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,090
While the internalized oppression and also the external forms of oppression and the internalized

228
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:42,270
oppression is a lot harder sometimes to address because like we talked about last time,

229
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,540
that can often be passed down generation to generation.

230
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:52,050
And so finding out the source of that and how to attack something that you've been taught,

231
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,639
you know, for generations can be really hard and then anti oppressive action.

232
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:04,770
So business collaboratively together to overcome dismantle the both the structural oppression but then the internalized oppression.

233
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:10,530
And this is where the importance of community comes in. You know, one person can't do it all.

234
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,660
So we have to really find ways to create collective action.

235
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,190
I mean, that's all this stress or pressure, if you think about it,

236
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:24,420
if you're really trying to work with an individual around high blood pressure and, you know,

237
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:32,459
if you if you look at the connections between oppression and high blood pressure, then ask that person to,

238
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,320
like, dismantle, you know, oppression, you know, that's going to make their blood pressure go even higher.

239
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,860
So that's why this collective action is really critical and really important.

240
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:52,580
Any questions? I'm gonna, like, just breeze through the chapters because you all are experts now, is that right?

241
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,630
Ready to last? Any one of you to chat with me about different concepts, you'd be able to do it.

242
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,220
I just love how some people were just saying my dad squarely not moving part of their body.

243
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,420
And I was like, Yeah, sure, I can do that. All right.

244
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:21,540
So now we're going to have Abigail come out. And how are you so excited about having been able to share that idea?

245
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,840
Yeah. You turn is here. Oh, okay. So and chapter one,

246
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:37,760
this is some of these are just know our topic we've already talked about and that you love the very thing that you all talked about last week can

247
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:46,469
definitely chimed in but you know in as he talks about the difference between oppressors and the oppressed and we talk about that quite a bit,

248
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:56,490
I think, in this discourse and about liberation and about liberation really being this mutual process,

249
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,080
but needing to be led by those that are oppressed.

250
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,160
So I think I think all of these concepts were pretty much talked about.

251
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,590
And them and he does talk about humankind's central problem, the problem of how we affirm our identities as human beings.

252
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:22,710
And I think that we often do think about three different identities.

253
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,580
Well, let me throw it back to you. So when you think about your different identities, how are your most salient identities affirmed?

254
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,950
Think whatever for you your most certain identities are.

255
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:38,040
And then how do those get affirmed or supported?

256
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,220
And you don't have to share with those identities or you can just share kind of how those are affirmed.

257
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:51,510
Yeah, I guess like being in groups of people with the same shared identity or even like kind of bond.

258
00:27:51,540 --> 00:28:04,010
Oprah and like share helps. So from that perspective, to a certain extent, our identity is dependent and reliant on others.

259
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,570
Right? To a certain extent. How else?

260
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,290
No one feels affirmed. I like how you were saying how hard it is for others.

261
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:26,320
Just how you are, how you feel your perceived colleagues throughout the world and how you feel that others person.

262
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,700
Okay. And how do you know that?

263
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:36,250
I agree with you, but what are the different ways that you know how people think of you and see you, how they communicate with you or just like.

264
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,450
I try seen things that like how they treat you.

265
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:53,120
Exactly. So people. So the people's actions, behaviors, words toward you right back can affirm your identity or our harm.

266
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,750
Your identity do right. So it can be affirming, but it can also be negative.

267
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:03,770
How else? Yeah. Being included in certain space can inform your identity.

268
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,570
Right. Okay. Can you give me an example? I guess, just like.

269
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,430
One example could be like politics, like seeing people with your identity.

270
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,790
Being in that space can confirm that you belong.

271
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,870
Okay. Yeah, that's one. Anything else?

272
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:29,350
Yeah. I think like seeing people who look like being in power or even, like, on TV.

273
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,490
Mm hmm. Right. So I think you raise two really good points.

274
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:40,480
One is seeing people that have a shared identity in positions of power and privilege that can be affirming.

275
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,019
But then also television, media, like you said, social media.

276
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:54,790
But that's huge for your generation. I mean, social media is massively tied up in how many people think that social media affirms your identity.

277
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,750
No injuries in their head or it's kind of like I like that nice little, like, kind of wave halfway like.

278
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:13,760
Loud and proud. Ah. And I mean, whether we realize it, I can't say because I'm not whether you realize it or not,

279
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:25,340
social media does impact your identity if you're on it and if you use it because companies rely on that to keep going,

280
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:33,050
you know, they create all these fancy algorithms and things like that that know what to look at and how often you look at it.

281
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,410
And then they feed you stuff that matches you.

282
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:45,500
So there's a lot of people out there making a ton of money off of trying to target things for you.

283
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,000
So if you think about it, if we could get rid of all that. All right.

284
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:56,630
So you were just affirmed in and of yourself and you didn't need any affirmation from outside.

285
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,180
What do you how do you think the world would be different? Because we're social beings.

286
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:10,660
So, you know, we're still going to have to interact with humans. But what if we didn't need affirmation from other people?

287
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,020
We really didn't give a [INAUDIBLE] what other people say. They would be a different world ever built.

288
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,740
Excuse me. There'll be less conformity to society and people would be feel more comfortable and more free doing their own things.

289
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,649
I mean, like, if you don't. I mean, I would say I consider myself like a someone with agency,

290
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,640
someone who does their own thing, doesn't really care about the makeup of others to an extent.

291
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,249
But if they're truly wasn't a perspective of others, then you truly wouldn't even have that idea.

292
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,990
And you kind of would just be like human, human instinct, kind of just what you desire.

293
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:56,069
Okay, what else? I think you brought the word that I was ready to come out as conformity, you know,

294
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:06,300
because when we are reliant on external forces to affirm us, that is a good way to to bring about conformity and obedience at some level.

295
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,170
And so that's how oppression works. If we could get rid of that, we wouldn't have oppression because people I mean,

296
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,960
there would probably still be structural barriers and things like that.

297
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:21,719
But that that's one way that really is kind of at the core and in human beings,

298
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,420
the way we're the way we're made, the way we operate, we are social beings.

299
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:35,390
And so if you isolate humans, there's challenges and your developmental trajectories and processes.

300
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:44,760
Yeah, you know, I'm taking a child developmental psychology course, and you're just talking about affirmation in a completely different context.

301
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:53,400
But you're talking about how even like as young as like four months old, baby seek affirmation from their caregivers.

302
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,770
And so it's very interesting, like the conversation we're having today, of course, in a different context,

303
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:06,000
but that it's kind of like human instinct to seek approval from others, people that you care about.

304
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,379
So yeah, I think that this is really interesting. Yeah, yeah.

305
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,260
And yeah, I mean, if you can.

306
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:21,569
Yeah, that's a really great point because if you again, if you look at things developmentally, a lot of these behaviors will be evidence.

307
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:26,399
And, you know, within the first five, six months of life, you know, a lot of things,

308
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:34,530
even when you don't have the cognitive abilities to process what's going on, there are instinctual behaviors that babies will exhibit it.

309
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,080
And some of those are related to attachment, affirmation and things like that.

310
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,730
So, you know, so yeah, it's a it's an essential problem, I guess, the way, you know, for things, but it's part of how we're wired.

311
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:56,340
So it's not like we can just say, let's get rid of it. So we have to work within that system of what exists, exists.

312
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:03,600
Um, so again, I think a lot of this stuff hopefully you all talked about or we've talked about at

313
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:11,040
some level know we're striving for affirmation that can get disrupted by oppression.

314
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:19,650
So oppression can be ways to block connection to other people or to limit who we can talk with or we can connect with things like that.

315
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:28,770
And, you know, we talk about liberation and about how liberation really needs to be kind of led by the oppressed people.

316
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,030
But as we talked about last time, it's a two way street.

317
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,180
So people who are the oppressors have to have action as well.

318
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,790
You know, people have to give up something in order for that to occur.

319
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:55,530
They see. Yeah, I think the you know, some of his his discussion around the oppressors, I think is really interesting.

320
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:03,000
And, you know, so often in public how we were primarily or think primarily about oppressed populations,

321
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:08,069
but we don't think about working with oppressors, you know, and really at the end of the day,

322
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:15,060
if we're if we're not looking at both sides, it's really going to be hard to bring about long term sustainable change,

323
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:23,730
you know, so we do need to look at different forms of oppression and how oppressors are developed.

324
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,960
You know, I know in different areas, like in intimate partner violence and teen dating violence,

325
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,969
there's been some interventions and work looking at male perpetrators because

326
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,810
most of them have been focused on heterosexual male female relationships.

327
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,240
But I think we you know,

328
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:55,080
I think that we could do more looking and conducting research into the minds of oppressors and really looking at why do people oppress other people,

329
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,290
and then what? How can we change them?

330
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,040
You know, it's a whole thing of like, you know, we don't want to put all the burden on those that are oppressed now.

331
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,460
Again, we want them to lead that change. But that doesn't mean they do all the work.

332
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,890
You know, we need distributive leadership and people need to be, you know, pitching in.

333
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:24,030
But I do think that we could do more. I had a colleague when I was in Chicago who was doing really cool work around.

334
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:32,410
Working with white churches to address issues of racism.

335
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,330
And so working within the structure, the function,

336
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:47,200
the belief systems of white churches and really looking at issues of oppression and racism that are woven into their belief systems.

337
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:57,580
And it was really cool work to to kind of try to dismantle some of the structures within a religious and spiritual framework.

338
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:07,389
And he's still he's now and you're still in our Champaign-Urbana and still continuing to try and work with churches.

339
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:13,110
And, you know, has to sometimes, like we've talked about before, sometimes in people who are trying to, you know, kind of quote unquote help.

340
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:20,080
They can end up being more oppressive because it's like, oh, these poor black and brown communities, we're going to go out and do X, Y and Z.

341
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:27,190
And then they feel good about themselves and and not really realizing that they may be furthering the oppression.

342
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:35,050
They may be building dependance in some communities that are very that's very hierarchical, where they're the ones that are providing everything.

343
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:41,650
And, you know, I think that this part here about leaders engaging in dialog with oppressed people.

344
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,520
Well, let me say so again throughout on to why is that hard to do.

345
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,850
Why would it be hard to get a pressers to be in true dialog and thinking about what dialog means?

346
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,680
It means having trust, having that that love and care commitment.

347
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:03,760
Why would that be hard for some folks to have this true dialog between the oppressed and the oppressive?

348
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,420
Yeah, they could get or feel really defensive like, well, I didn't.

349
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:16,360
I wasn't the perpetrator of those specific actions or I'm not like the other people, shared identities and have done these atrocities.

350
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,020
Like they might just get really defensive and that completely shuts down.

351
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:26,470
Yeah, exactly. Like, you know, kind of like the white fragility of every type of pain it would take them,

352
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:37,120
like having to do a lot of self reflection in order to actually feel like they're on the same level as people are having a conversation with them,

353
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:45,310
even subconsciously they might feel about or not be able to actually engage in like, yeah, yeah, that's good.

354
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,620
And I think, you know, if you're going to if you're going to work toward helping to create those,

355
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,800
I think that you would have to do a lot of preparatory work,

356
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,710
you know, to get people to engage in some of that critical self-reflection before they come there.

357
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,440
Because I can see some people coming into those spaces and being like, Oh, I'm a good person, I want to help.

358
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,980
And Oh yeah, I'll sit down with you and I'll stop. And they're still you know,

359
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,579
they're still sitting on their pedestal and they're still looking down at you and

360
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,110
they're still feeling like they're doing you a favor because they came to the table,

361
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,490
but they're really not that funny. That's a really good point. Yeah.

362
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:27,429
I mean, I kind of feel like it also might put oppressed people in a really awkward position of having to do a lot of,

363
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,140
like, emotional labor and explaining what it's like to the oppressed.

364
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,330
And I feel like that might just ultimately be more harmful than anything.

365
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,150
Yeah, I think that's a really good point. And I think that again, you know, going back to like the pre work that would need to be done is, you know,

366
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:49,180
people need to do their homework and not leave everything up to the people in an oppressed position to explain everything about their situation.

367
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:58,450
You know, like often when I work in different communities that I haven't worked with before or working in different countries, you know,

368
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:04,419
I make sure that every one of my team studies everything they can about that community,

369
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:11,170
about their history so that they're not put in the communities that we're working with at a point of always having to teach,

370
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,999
you know, executive really annoying, if you like, every single time you have to tell them, well,

371
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,920
this is this or this is that and you have to do it in a way where you still come in culturally humble and aren't like,

372
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:30,400
Oh, I read a book about, you know, this. So now I know everything about the history of colonization in your country.

373
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:42,070
So it is that, that, that balance. Yeah, it makes me also think about like restorative and transformative justice work and like a lot of conversation

374
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:50,330
involved with and like situations where like victims like especially in like situations of like,

375
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,470
like, like the fact that like victims and those who, like,

376
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:00,490
suffer from situations like this should not have to be put in through this, like emotionally.

377
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:09,520
Yeah, like that. But at the same time also teaching those the perpetrators and like taking action that centered around the victim.

378
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,190
Yeah. Making sure that like, they know what they did and also still trying to give steps so they can, like, learn, right?

379
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,400
Also like creating kind of like a boundary. Yeah, that's a really good point and a good analogy.

380
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,879
And I think that, you know, one, there's a lot of things that are just really one of the things that are challenging, like you said,

381
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:37,000
is the emotional labor of the person who has been wronged in some way, whether it be through oppression, through some kind of traumatic event.

382
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:45,160
I mean, it's hard after you've lived through that to then re-experience that by talking, and it can be the same with oppression.

383
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,969
So if you've been treated like [INAUDIBLE] by a certain group of people in your entire life,

384
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:54,340
and now you're asking me to sit down with these people, you know, some people are just like, No, I'm not going to do it.

385
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,370
You know, I don't care if you think that it's going to change.

386
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:05,170
And we have to just accept that, you know, we can't force people who've been traumatized either, you know,

387
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:13,570
trauma in terms of actual our own individual violence, but then also trauma related to cultural and historical events as well.

388
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:21,760
But yeah, so getting there, I mean, it's nice for her to say that and you know, an ideal world, it's a beautiful thing.

389
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,570
But just keep in mind, if you're really trying to do this, this may take years to even get to that point.

390
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:35,110
You know, depending on historical trauma, historical oppression, things like that and all that preparatory work,

391
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,690
you know, that we talked about people coming in with the right mindset into this process because this can backfire.

392
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:46,630
Just like in restorative justice, unfortunately, you know, things can backfire if you don't do all the groundwork.

393
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:51,780
And really prepare for what could happen. Okay.

394
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:58,020
So how could prayers teachings in Chapter one help us approach our work and public health?

395
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:04,050
So let's get down to the nitty gritty. How could this be applied to public health?

396
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,889
Well, we're talking about application more. That's class, too.

397
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:17,280
But I'm not expecting to come up with like a full, you know, 17 point intervention ready to be submitted to a grant.

398
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:25,080
But what are what are some ways or components or things that this can help us in public health practice?

399
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:38,490
This is always the hardest part. However, incorporating the opinions and perspectives and desires of the oppressed.

400
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:46,770
And how would you do that? Let's do it. I agree. So, I mean, let's say.

401
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,140
Okay, so you're battling some systemic issue within America.

402
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,750
You really need to get on the front line of the community.

403
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,820
Like maybe like even interviews. Conduct interviews to be like, what's wrong?

404
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:09,140
How how can we help you? What is how is this affecting your community truly getting the perspective of the community that you're trying to help?

405
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:12,510
Because no matter if like I mean, you can be a good person,

406
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:19,350
but like if you don't have the help of the actual people who are in the shoes, of those who are oppressed, like you're not going to.

407
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:26,520
Find a good solution, like you need the help of the oppressed, the people who are truly feeling the effects of what you're doing.

408
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:30,020
Okay, so listening. Yeah.

409
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:35,670
I think going off as was weight and also like the cancer reading.

410
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:44,999
Before you do that, I think it's important to learn about the community members as people and like who they are and like what their values are,

411
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,629
like what they're interested in or just knowing them as people and like form your work example, you can tell them about you too.

412
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:57,120
And so. Kind of like where you're talking about in this fashion earlier, like being vulnerable and sharing about yourself.

413
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:04,680
And I think from then you'll be able to kind of go into conversations about what are the things that are like plaguing your community members.

414
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,160
One of things that we can do. I'm with you. Yeah.

415
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:17,040
Yeah. And I agree with that. And I think that, you know, one thing that I see sometimes in like large public health programs,

416
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,760
especially more research, is more epidemiological in nature because they don't do that learning in the beginning.

417
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:32,190
And so then they're giving out surveys and asking questions that are not forum created, even thought of related to the community.

418
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,879
And then you see that, you know, they find certain findings.

419
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,080
It's like, well, that's all [INAUDIBLE], you know, it's like [INAUDIBLE] in general.

420
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:49,080
So if you got like really crappy measures and they don't apply or even have any connection to your community, you're really just wasting your time.

421
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:55,649
So yeah, that initial process that you were just talking about is really criminal hating and, you know, kind of testing it.

422
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:03,150
But just like having an open mindedness and just like knowing that you might have the education or the resources,

423
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,410
but you don't know what's best for the. Yes.

424
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,610
Good. Oh, yeah. Oh, you. You don't look up here and then is there.

425
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:11,910
Yeah.

426
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:20,370
I was just going to say, going off of what you're saying, like research and stuff like that, I think it really emphasizes how important job search is.

427
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,520
Just like, just specifically as a concept. Mm hmm. Yeah.

428
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:31,460
I agree. Yes, sir. I was just going to say the whole idea of like taking over versus leading different projects.

429
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,450
It just kind of like the introduction of resources as a potential,

430
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,159
but not necessarily like a forcing it yourself or kind of like taking out being like,

431
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,760
okay, here's like a direction we can go in and have more of like a conversation about it, more so than saying like, this is what we're going to do.

432
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,209
Right. Yeah. And it's again, it goes back to that dialog.

433
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:55,880
I mean, the dialog that he talks about in that first chapter and that really gets kind of carried throughout.

434
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:02,920
It's so critical, you know, and so finding ways to truly create dialog in the way that he thinks about it,

435
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,700
you know, and I think the way other folks have talked about to have, again, well,

436
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,890
I guess like once you kind of get past the point of learning community and

437
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:15,379
including them and understanding them for the development of an intervention.

438
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,490
I guess like also thinking about once you get to the point of intervention,

439
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,540
creating one that empowers the community or allows them to kind of grow in a skill set that

440
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,870
better equips them to meet the needs of the community that they understand best already.

441
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:37,980
And then yeah, I guess, you know, working alongside them as well, but.

442
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,379
Right, yeah. Yeah. And, and I think the, you know, the skills and capacity building that is really important to,

443
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:51,620
like you said, I mean, there's different approaches like a lot of the work that that my team does,

444
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,889
we do it's it could be under super committee based participatory research,

445
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:06,710
but a lot of mine kind of moves into the realm of participatory action research where we have a strong action reflection kind of process that goes on.

446
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:13,640
But yeah, one thing that's really important is that building that capacity all along, not just delivering services, but, you know,

447
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:21,050
I always say I want to work myself out of a job, you know, and so if I can work myself out of a job, that's like one of the best things we could do.

448
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,030
You know, we have interventions that we've developed in different parts of Kenya where I

449
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,540
don't have any interaction with them anymore and the programs are still running,

450
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,140
and that's how it should be. You know, it's not my country, it's not my community.

451
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:42,400
I should be building it in a sustainable way so I can just step out to zero and pronounce your name wrong all the time.

452
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:50,850
Or Sure. So I'll just say that a lot of the times I think especially big public house

453
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:58,590
like applications and even looking at the rolling out of COVID 19 vaccinations,

454
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:07,999
there tends to be a default of having the rolling out towards the majority populations

455
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:15,379
in major areas and then thinking about how race like socioeconomic status,

456
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,370
gender, sexuality, that sort of becomes a forethought.

457
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,479
It's like we'll get all the resources to this population first and then we'll

458
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,820
think about everything else after where I feel like this should really become,

459
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:36,470
we're right when the system is being created, it should be everyone.

460
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:46,129
And all of those things are thought of right away because that's really what's creating disparities, because even at the end of the day,

461
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:50,480
if you are thinking about how race and socioeconomic status is affecting it,

462
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,610
if they're not given the resources right away, they're still being put at a disadvantage, right?

463
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:05,540
Yeah. And I think was a great and unfortunate example about, you know, the people with the most privilege and power got access,

464
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:12,650
you know, first, I mean, I know like I get in a lot of parts of sub-Saharan Africa, they didn't get the vaccines until much later.

465
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,709
And even then they were getting the extras and leftovers from multiple countries.

466
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:25,910
So I know in Kenya they had like Russian vaccines and Chinese vaccines and like all different kinds.

467
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:30,469
And people are just like, I just want a vaccine, so give me anything you can you can have that.

468
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,910
You're right. If we think about those, you know, and think about again, what I was talking about,

469
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,770
about the different layers of oppression and who's being oppressed, all those things from the from the get go.

470
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,710
I think we'd have a much better now necessary to overcome it.

471
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,989
And I was going to say that I think a lot of times,

472
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:54,350
like public health professionals try to do it all and kind of being critically aware and knowing when

473
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:59,270
to allocate those funds to other things that are already or initiatives that are already in place,

474
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:06,470
especially like talking about power imbalances, like if you're coming from a university like the University of Michigan,

475
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:14,240
also knowing if communities aren't being receptive to like take a step back and maybe focus on building that partnership.

476
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,960
That's not focused on research. Right, exactly. I agree.

477
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:22,780
And engage in some of this dialog and, you know, having true dialog and find out what's going on.

478
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,430
I was. It's cultural competence and whatever other public health necessary.

479
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:35,299
We talked about a lot about trends, health care, and then one of the readings was saying that like of trans patients have to like tell their

480
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,850
doctor about trans people do adequate care until it leads to a lot of like an article.

481
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,080
And so I think like when it comes to like oppressed groups like trans people,

482
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:51,380
there needs to be like that dialog isn't going to be productive if medical professionals and public health professionals are like competent.

483
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,780
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's a really good point.

484
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:59,420
And one thing we'll be talking about, too, is kind of like taking it even to a next level of cultural humility,

485
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,719
which is kind of beyond just cultural competence,

486
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:09,480
because cultural competence kind of inherent in that concept is that you can become competent in someone else's culture, and we really can.

487
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,739
So part of culture, humility is learning about the culture.

488
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:21,980
But then also also as you're learning about and thinking about issues of power in that process and then a continual process of always learning.

489
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:32,150
Yeah, and I agree. I don't think we prepare the public health workforce the way we should be when it comes to that.

490
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:40,070
And I think that, you know, we don't have mandatory requirements and training around human diversity elements.

491
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:48,320
I know in my training as a clinical psychologist, you have to programs have to be accredited by the American Psychological Association.

492
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:56,269
And there are specific courses and experiences you have to have related to cultural diversity and things like that.

493
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,410
But when it comes to like sexual gender, minority health, it's like total [INAUDIBLE].

494
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,040
And, you know, they took my class.

495
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:14,870
So, you know, we see that, you know, if you look at how much training that medical professionals get and LGBT health,

496
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,730
it's like the equivalent of about 3 hours during their entire medical training.

497
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,740
It's like 3 to 5 hours. And if you look at public health training, it's zero.

498
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:32,360
So, I mean, actually, have you ever had a class that addressed?

499
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:41,180
Not necessarily. In my master's program, I had to take a history of public health course.

500
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:48,500
Mm hmm. Um, and, ah, professor pulled in a lot of non topics, but it wasn't necessarily the original.

501
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,070
Like the origination of that course was not right is. And so yeah.

502
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:58,280
So kind of but it wasn't. Yeah. So I mean there are a lot of different oppressed groups and we still, you know,

503
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,180
I would say, you know, people with different abilities is another huge area.

504
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:07,070
I mean, this building is [INAUDIBLE] when it comes to, you know, people with mobility issues.

505
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:13,940
It's also [INAUDIBLE]. And when it comes to, you know, people with hearing vision issues, other things like that.

506
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,150
So I can't think [INAUDIBLE].

507
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,399
So let's go to oh, let's not go to let's jump into our rooms.

508
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:35,900
But ideally you want to around the room so and I can pause and question do the right number to stay like one, two,

509
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:42,170
three, four, five, six, seven A So we'll figure out when we get to the end of that number like we did before.

510
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:47,090
But there are new groups today, all of the names as well on which groups you're in.

511
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,710
But that's kind of like how the number of two, one, two, three, four, five, six,

512
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:58,400
seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13 right there, the 14 that there, 15 in that order.

513
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:08,240
Okay. So what you're going to do today is you've got three models, sorry, I've got two different issues and you create whatever is you want.

514
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,130
So it's a little narrative about, you know, and then public health issue.

515
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,350
And then what I want you to discuss are what questions do you need to ask?

516
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:24,739
Who will you ask these questions? How will you ask the questions, the different strategies, activities?

517
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,360
What information or data do you need to gather besides the answer to those questions?

518
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,200
And what are some of the possible actions you depend on?

519
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,620
And I want you to do this through this critical lens. All right.

520
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:41,569
So think about this in an integrated way. You're not going to get through all five of those, right?

521
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:47,540
You know, in 20 minutes, you might if you have a really super amazing group and, you know,

522

526
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:32,309
Kind of small. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

527
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:37,130
It's not even the chance to go to make it.

528
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,470
I know. Yeah. Yeah. But then that process getting out of that process that.

529
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:55,700
Yeah. It was like all the time anyway.

530
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:05,130
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, I just know when you're doing.

531
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,580
Yeah. It's not your fault.

532
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,509
You have my team. Yeah, I really am.

533
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:19,580
I'm sorry.

534
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:34,200
I was going to say I really am.

535
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,780
I find your five every other week.

536
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,160
I could have gone under.

537
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,690
That's my job. You know that.

538
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:53,940
You know, it's kind of. Are you on nine?

539
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:57,750
Ten? I just told you.

540
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,890
Yeah. Is there another two? No.

541
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:06,540
Oh, yeah. So could you go up to the top? Hey, what number were you again?

542
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,170
Eight. Actually, we have to go down here. Yeah, the first four.

543
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:13,410
I know. That's right. I'm sorry I brought you here.

544
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,090
Here? Which know, like, 20 degrees.

545
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,550
11. Are you two groups or one groups? Anything from years?

546
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,980
How many people do you have? An age group. Okay, cool.

547
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:41,340
Yeah. If one of them want to know, I like the personal person to gather us.

548
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,680
Do you? Oh, no, I. I don't. Oh, okay.

549
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:52,380
Okay, I can. Okay. Well, our rooms here in the middle, too, if anybody needs.

550
00:58:53,790 --> 00:59:04,470
Yeah, I'm. I'm like I said, you think might be like you and I go to work now.

551
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:16,030
I'm sorry. That's like over the next year or two.

552
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:24,070
You need to ask yourself, I don't like it.

553
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:31,670
I mean, I wonder what it's like.

554
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:50,630
I'm like, Yeah, he's not quite sure.

555
00:59:50,710 --> 01:00:04,170
They're not necessarily like something like.

556
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:39,920
Yeah. So you should you doing what you're doing because I was like people that are like you asked me about like no matter what,

557
01:00:40,480 --> 01:01:08,780
it's like I was like a company is not like something like it is like so I guess like in reality it's like it's well,

558
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:29,390
there's a reason why do you think you're going to get better because you think usually doesn't

559
01:01:30,380 --> 01:02:01,760
reason the me how can I help you know like the times when you were enough like our guys around like.

560
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:16,000
Like. Sure.

561
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:55,780
I mean, I turned out because I was like, what is that like having, like, this white guy?

562
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:20,950
Yeah, like it's like. It's like it's like it's like it's like it's like.

563
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:28,060
I think, like I was like that sort of thing.

564
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:48,730
Like, like, right for them to it's just like, oh, I guess it's like.

565
01:03:53,550 --> 01:04:16,930
Let's see who else has got, like, so much time.

566
01:04:20,720 --> 01:05:21,740
So I just want to say, I tried to get in trouble and it's just, you know, it's like it's like doing it again.

567
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:47,690
I guess the way I see it, like having role models in this industry isn't coming.

568
01:05:48,810 --> 01:06:47,010
At the same time, you want talk about like like it's like I think that's what I like about education is like that's how it works.

569
01:06:47,040 --> 01:07:22,860
Exactly. I mean, I think that's why I think if there's another organization like bringing jobs, like, you know, like, all right, all right.

570
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:32,890
Just want to do everything, you know.

571
01:07:39,770 --> 01:08:27,440
I don't really care about you guys because you don't have to turn them in maybe like that.

572
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:56,990
It's a religious experience as a you know, it's more like you're saying it's going to be somewhere,

573
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:20,430
but not that it's not something that I would follow up like this, like loading.

574
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:31,330
Obviously, in terms of if we get out of here.

575
01:09:33,180 --> 01:10:12,360
It wasn't like, oh, you're like you're not like something you see sitting around, like living somewhere like that.

576
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:59,190
You check out everything in their prenatal homes and economic experience, you know, stuff like that, actually, because that's what I feel like.

577
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:04,979
We have important things talked about all of these discussions by like areas.

578
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:20,040
So Alex actions we talked about it's I'm not going to say my age graduating program which is not two years after and he also

579
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:57,660
said that that there's not always the availability of the same thing that like I would be the one that I have to check out.

580
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:08,980
Just start time on paper is over.

581
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:37,100
It's definitely like I wish there was a discussion about beginning stages of would out about the fact that I'm not get to.

582
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:44,820
Water bottles. It was like that.

583
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:59,770
But I was like, What did you see?

584
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:19,990
I'm just curious, you know, that kind of thing.

585
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:38,180
And now I finally got to tell her that she has never to our garden area,

586
01:13:41,550 --> 01:14:13,030
like I have gotten out of the single take to go outside and I mean and different you know we're discussing

587
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:52,180
with him like all the stuff like that would be like if there was nobody I get to break that down.

588
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,880
My wife and I.

589
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:29,490
I think that sharing ideas like that, they like to really see like we are there right now like that, like, yeah, it's going to be like our last year.

590
01:15:29,950 --> 01:16:08,470
So I really feel like it takes time to do that because like it's not like I have not heard like the Catholic Church on it's like my kids are.

591
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:14,320
So if they go on, it has some of the plot.

592
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,050
So, uh, a lot of stuff you wanted to put.

593
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:30,220
They want if you didn't let us know, but you still want. Boy, if we have enough to want to have a great weekend, you save the joy.

594
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:41,350
You know the difference.

595
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:50,860
I think that that's what we do not want are easily.

596
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:57,930
Oh, okay. I didn't plan. That was like everything.

597
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:02,560
Yeah, there's an Islamic there. We have one in the last. Let me just grab you, like.

598
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,650
Totally. Okay. Oh, I.
