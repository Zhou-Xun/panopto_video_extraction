1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,210
At the start of this course, I considered myself someone really attuned to climate change.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:12,760
This showed up in my six Americas quiz result, which put me fully into the alarmed category.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,030
I understood a lot of the background science of climate change,

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:22,150
and I've even participated in advocacy for national level climate mitigation in the past few years.

5
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:28,510
And I would say I was aware of concepts of environmental justice within my scheme of climate change.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,720
But this concept wasn't really central to my viewpoint.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:40,300
Since I was still really more focused on high level blanket approaches to mitigation, adaptation wasn't really much on my radar either.

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:48,280
I hadn't even really fully connected the dots between the effects of climate injustices and the real world health disparities that I see daily

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:57,130
in my work as a primary care physician and even among my own family members that grew up in environmental justice communities in Detroit.

10
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,710
This class really enriched my understanding of climate justice and energy justice by forcing me to

11
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:09,000
do a deep dove into the state of E.J. in Detroit and the health disparities that we see there.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,440
The majority of the city of Detroit is an edgy community where the effects of flooding heat

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,390
islands and air pollution are major threats to the well-being of the people who live there.

14
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,870
This is a community where you can see the complex interacting root causes of inequities like systemic racism,

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:34,110
income inequality and regulatory failures coming together to produce severe health disparities and high vulnerability to climate change.

16
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,580
What this is also where there's some really dynamic work happening at the grassroots level to

17
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,430
really partner with residents on strategies to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.

18
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,730
Organizations such as Detroiters working for environmental justice and eco works are working directly

19
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:56,850
with the vulnerable residents and projects to improve energy efficiency to reduce household emissions.

20
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:06,060
Save on energy bills. Working with policymakers to represent community voices in climate change legislation and the city of Detroit itself

21
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,560
has committed to inclusive engagement with the community as it constructs its comprehensive climate strategy.

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,470
So there's a lot of great climate justice work happening at the local level. But all of this is happening at a slow pace of change.

23
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,170
And recent climate events seem to show that we need to work more quickly to implement climate adaptation

24
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:34,790
measures to avoid that morbidity and mortality among vulnerable communities that we expect to see.

25
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,410
I think the real challenge going forward will be how to increase our pace of adaptation,

26
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:48,530
how to react to unexpected climate events while still staying true to the principles of community based participatory engagement.

27
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:55,220
I'm looking forward to finding where I can engage at the local level to advocate for E.J. focused climate strategies.

28
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,041
Thank you.
