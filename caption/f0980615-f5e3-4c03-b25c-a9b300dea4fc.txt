00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,110
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,025
I will be covering the protein introduction lecture,

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:10,640
and this is the quick review.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,413
So, proteins are made of amino acids, and we have 20 common amino acids,

5
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:18,340
some are essential somewhere not.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,164
Their sources come from exogenous protein which is the dietary protein

7
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:23,200
that you consume.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,878
So far, the RDA, the recommendations are 0.8 gram of

9
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:35,730
protein per kilogram body weight to be taken up on a daily basis.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,977
So, for digestibility of amino acids, so whenever we break down protein,

11
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:48,740
we get amino acids which are those free tiny molecules over here.

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,843
And so, what's important to keep in mind is when we're looking at a protein and

13
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:59,124
determining its quality or how good of a protein it is and

14
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:04,251
how complete it is, then we need to consider how digestible it is.

15
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:06,078
So, how bioavailable it is,

16
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:10,841
its completeness is to contain all the amino acids which are those over here.

17
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:15,803
You can memorize them by private, P-V-T,

18
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:20,383
Tim, T-I-M, and Hall, H-A-L-L.

19
00:01:20,383 --> 00:01:21,730
There's no A over here.

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,350
A is for arginine, and

21
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:29,040
arginine is considered absolutely essential when a baby is growing up.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,606
But then, as we're adults, we can synthesize it ourselves, so

23
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:38,254
some people go by saying that we have nine essential amino acids and

24
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:40,674
some people say that we have 10.

25
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:45,283
In all cases you can remember it by Private Tim Hall, and

26
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:47,551
also the protein package.

27
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,631
So what else is in this protein?

28
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,526
So, if you're eating steak, for example,

29
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:58,761
then there's also saturated fats in that protein and so on.

30
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,668
So, just keep that in mind.

31
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:10,202
Or how the steak is made, it can also contain other fats and so on.

32
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:12,921
For example, the nutrients over here and the fat.

33
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:20,173
So, this is just something to keep in mind when we're considering the protein source.

34
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,380
The exogenous sources, they come usually from plant products or animal products.

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,461
And the endogenous sources are the amino acids pool that we replenished

36
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:34,624
almost on a daily basis from the breakdown of our own protein in the body,

37
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,140
which is a natural phenomenon that happens every day and so on.

38
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,981
We do not have a starch for protein in our body, so

39
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:48,888
the amino acids pool is kind of the free-floating amino acids in the body,

40
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:51,918
and those are the only source we have.

41
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:58,849
But we do not store it, unlike glucose that we store either or as glycogen.

42
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:04,240
We do not have stores for amino acids or protein.

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,094
Okay, so the endogenous sources, as I mentioned, they can be, for example,

44
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:13,006
the enzymes, the transporters, and transcription factors,

45
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,970
those are all made of proteins.

46
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,636
And we degrade them on a daily basis, and

47
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:22,040
this is how we keep replenishing our amino acids pool.

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,114
So, the structure, we have the primary structure.

49
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:29,796
And basically, initially,

50
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:35,506
we have amino acids that are linked by peptide bonds over here.

51
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:39,671
And we have a terminal end that has the amino group on one side and

52
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:43,440
the carboxylic group on the other side.

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,624
So, this is the amino group and this is the carboxcylic group, and

54
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:52,764
this is kind of the backbone of the amino acids.

55
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:54,203
So, the configuration.

56
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:59,688
Anything with an L is on the left side of the carbon and anything with

57
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:08,240
a D configuration then the amino group would be on the right side of the carbon.

58
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,480
So, the levels of organization, we have four levels.

59
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,254
The primary structure, it has strong covalent peptide bonds over here,

60
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:18,491
it's the most simple structure.

61
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:23,561
It doesn't have any complex integration in it.

62
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:27,878
And the side chains of the amino acids differ to make different amino acids,

63
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:30,940
of course.

64
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,721
The secondary is the more complex.

65
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:37,122
We have the alpha helix structure, which is over here, and

66
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:41,020
we have the beta pleated sheet, which looks like a sheet over here.

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,511
It's stable, it provides strength, and for example, collagen and

68
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:52,850
elastin and keratin, they're all structural proteins in the secondary form.

69
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,154
Tertiary, over here, it has hydrophobic clustering, so

70
00:04:57,154 --> 00:05:01,641
it's more of a globular structure, more of a 3D structure.

71
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:08,465
It has more bonds, it's more elaborate, for sure, as you can see over here.

72
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:11,470
The quaternary as the last structure,

73
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,113
it's the most complex because it has multiple subunits, so

74
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:21,314
multiple proteins connected to each other to make one big protein.

75
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:27,105
So, it does have the same interactions as the previous structure,

76
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:30,572
but it's made up of multiple proteins.

77
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:36,240
So, it requires longer digestion because initially you would want to

78
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:45,640
break down every single protein first and then digest that one protein at the time.

79
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,762
So, the side group determines how hydrophobic

80
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:53,280
the protein is going to be, the charge.

81
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,850
We have also aromatic rings that can make the characteristics for

82
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,790
that protein differ.

83
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,940
We have sulfur atoms and hydroxyl groups.

84
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,971
So, essential amino acids are ones that we cannot make.

85
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:13,899
We have lost the ability to directly make them from one precursor

86
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,096
using an enzyme in our body.

87
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:20,880
Plants can still make the essential amino acids, but we cannot.

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,892
And when we're talking about the essential amino acids,

89
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:25,561
you remember Private Tim Hall.

90
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:29,322
Non-essential, you can make them in the body, so you're good to go.

91
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:33,001
Conditionally essential, you either need a precursor to make them.

92
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:37,608
So, their availability would be contingent on

93
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:41,879
the fact that you have the other precursor.

94
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,533
Or you have a certain disease or

95
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:49,843
a condition that makes a usually non-essential amino acid or

96
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:55,890
a conditionally essential amino acid more essential, for example.

97
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,351
So, let's say a non-essential amino acids, and I can't think of one right now.

98
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:04,263
But let's say you have a non-essential amino acid but

99
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:08,080
you have a certain disease that impairs your ability to synthesize it.

100
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,482
And this is when that non-essential amino acids will become conditionally essential,

101
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:16,040
for example.

102
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,483
So, keep in mind, conditionally essential,

103
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:24,303
you either have a condition that makes a non-essential amino acid

104
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:28,720
conditionally essential or it means a precursor to be made.

105
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,747
And if that precursor is unavailable for a conditionally essential amino acid,

106
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:41,140
then that amino acid needs to be obtained from the diet.

107
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,759
So, for example, PKU tyrosine is considered conditionally essential

108
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,580
because it needs phenylalanine to be made.

109
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,456
But for people who have PKU, they can't make tyrosine from phenylaline because

110
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,410
they have deficiencies on the enzyme over here.

111
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,517
So, we're saying that tyrosine in any individual

112
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:03,590
should be conditionally essential.

113
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,490
But in this case, since people with PKU cannot synthesize it from phenylalanine,

114
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,270
then tyrosine becomes considered essential in their case, and

115
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:18,560
they need to obtain it from the diet.

116
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,035
Okay, so those are just examples.

117
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:28,198
Over here, it might be helpful to remember that L, L, Leucine and

118
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:33,932
Lysine, are purely ketogenic, they cannot be converted into glucose.

119
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:38,403
And PTT, PITT, actually, phenylalanine, isoleucine,

120
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:43,147
tryptophan, and tyrosine are both glucogenic and ketogenic.

121
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:47,438
So, depending on the body's need and ability to make either glucose or

122
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:50,313
ketone bodies, those will decide where to go.

123
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:54,469
S, if you remember which ones are ketogenic L, L, and which ones

124
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:59,245
are glucogenic PITT, then everything by default is the glucogenic ones.

125
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:05,312
So, instead of memorizing the glucogenic ones, this is an easier method.

126
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:11,740
So, we will talk more about this.

127
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,452
So, for example, if we say that we have threonine that feeds into the TCA cycle,

128
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:20,232
it's first converted into pyruvate.

129
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:23,101
Pyruvate becomes acetyl CoA.

130
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,240
And then, acetyl CoA goes into the cycle as citrate.

131
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,250
And this is how we have a three union metabolism through the TCA cycle.

132
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,853
If we're looking at phenylalanine, for example,

133
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,941
phenylalanine and can become acetoacetate.

134
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:43,250
Acetoacetate can then become acetyl CoA and then feed into the cycle.

135
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,874
Argininosuccinate can become

136
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:54,283
fumarate and oxaloacetate.

137
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:57,453
So, just keep in mind,

138
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:02,070
too, know how to read this table.

139
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,857
This is the Urea cycle where you always consume for ATP, and

140
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:11,340
this is that TCA cycle over here.

141
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,112
Okay, so if someone is deficient in protein but

142
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:22,199
has an adequate nutritional and caloric intake otherwise,

143
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:26,629
then they are thought to have kwashiorkor.

144
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:31,162
It shows as distended abdominal area.

145
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:35,770
You have dry skin, hair loss, and failure to thrive if you're a child.

146
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,090
Marasmus is both protein and caloric deficiency.

147
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,395
And that is it.
