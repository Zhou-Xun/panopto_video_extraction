2
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:09,604
Along with population and sample,
sample size and practical and

3
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:13,527
statistical significance, bias is
something to consider when critically

4
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:16,650
evaluating public health studies.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,900
Bias is a result or

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,210
measurement that differs systematically
from a population result measurement.

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,940
Bias can occur at any stage of research

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,360
from the design to
the analysis to publication.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,650
And bias is not dependent on
sample size or significance.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,230
There are many types of bias.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,510
We've already seen one before with
the M&Ms in the convenience sample.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,440
That was a selection bias.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,040
There is also healthy user bias,
recall bias, and

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,740
other types of bias to be careful of and
look out for.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,260
Now let's take a look
at healthy user bias.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,190
Healthy user bias is a type of sampling
bias where those that generally enroll

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,140
in and follow an experimental
regimen in a clinical trial or

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,450
study are unlikely to be
representative of a population.

19
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,210
There are studies that have shown
that people who take vitamins

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,180
are more likely to be healthy.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,710
Is it really the vitamins
making these people healthy or

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,260
is there bias here where people who
are more likely to take vitamins

23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,160
are also more likely to be healthy?

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,200
Another type of bias is recall bias.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,210
And this is why we generally
like longitudinal studies

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,490
as opposed to cross sectional studies.

27
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,160
Recall bias is where there's a systematic
difference of recalling what happened

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,370
in the past.

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,090
There was a study that showed that women
with breast cancer differed from women

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,380
without breast cancer and
they had had higher fat diets.

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,820
That study had actually followed
the women longitudinally and had

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,010
measured their diets, surveyed them about
their diets before their cancer diagnosis.

33
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,840
And found that there was no difference in
their diets before their cancer diagnosis.

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,665
So those women with breast cancer had just
incorrectly recalled higher fat diets

35
00:01:55,665 --> 00:02:01,440
post-diagnosis, trying to figure out
something which maybe led to that cancer.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,330
In addition to healthy user and recall
bias, there's something called publication

37
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,260
bias where generally, we only see
published studies that are interesting, or

38
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,780
have positive and significant results.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,850
We don't see a lot of those which have
negative or non-positive results.

40
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,590
An example of publication bias is
that makers of antidepressants

41
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,110
didn't publish a third
of their study results.

42
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,906
95% of studies with positive
results were published,

43
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:31,638
but only 14% of studies with
non-positive results were published.

44
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:35,601
Therefore, we didn't see a lot of the
studies that didn't have positive results

45
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:40,390
and we only focus on those studies with
the treatments seem to be very effective.

46
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,130
As you can se here, this study from
the New England General Medicine

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,747
shows us the publication bias in
the antidepressant present makers.

48
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:51,670
97% of positive findings
were published and

49
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,000
only 14 of questionable or
negative findings were published.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,660
So bias can occur at any point in the
study and lead to incorrect results and

51
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,970
conclusions.

52
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,850
So when you're critically
evaluating a study, stop and think.

53
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,670
Is there anything that differed
systematically from the population of

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,630
interest?

55
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,820
Are the results valid, or
is there some bias in the study?

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,529
Next, we'll talk about correlation and
causation.
