1
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,240
hi good afternoon everyone. we have such a busy schedule today.

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,620
just wanna try to guess we're gonna try to start right finishing

3
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,780
up and finishing a few of the review for the midterm penalty

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,780
part three eight or you can maybe turn that will talk about the precautionary principle

5
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:46,060
article pretty quickly. just because probably would you know

6
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,160
you know the Germans from that article where then we'll go

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,420
back and talk briefly about a just and there's C because I didn't

8
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,631
quite finish with that. if you remember and then we'll turn to

9
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:06,731
drive drivers and drugs and all that. so we get through

10
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:22,191
everything.

11
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:28,651
what was the question I guess

12
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:33,791
you'll be you'll be asked some questions about the which

13
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:38,991
but it's on here that you're gonna be asked a question about as we go through it. you know be a question about

14
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:44,191
the question principle which is why we're going go through and today. I did and they had I don't

15
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:56,091
think you're directly asked about the meeting. okay. thank you.

16
00:01:56,091 --> 00:02:02,983
okay. and I practically have to screen that whenever they wanna remember ever we were

17
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:08,403
close enough. okay. so

18
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:14,723
now I'm not I had radiation and rate on this.

19
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:21,623
so you should understand some of the properties defined I think radiation and the that fact

20
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:26,863
they were kind biological damage by ionizing tissue and

21
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:32,223
we're gonna talk about issues in relation to the latency

22
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:37,863
for example for cousin cancer. I was mostly for you to start direct effects

23
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:43,323
answers will talk about that. I think I'm sorry I mean how

24
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:48,963
usually different types of ionizing radiation penetrates substances.

25
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:54,023
what happens during the nuclear fission which can change in economic

26
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:59,403
number of a team. if you change something from one element to another change number programs

27
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:04,525
and what element it is and um.

28
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:09,565
we are I'm gonna not talk a lot about the differences and take various measures of radioactivity. I

29
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:15,165
think this is not a five that you do watch your member article

30
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:20,285
for a given amount of energy. this is or are more damaging to.

31
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:25,945
so to shoot and beta particle or camera. so

32
00:03:25,945 --> 00:03:31,045
remember that that there and we'll

33
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:36,125
talk about why I have class are important and then made him go quickly

34
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:41,485
through white powder arises. I don't somebody with the exercises

35
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:46,625
in the health consequences so

36
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:51,905
actually we're sort of bother both talking about what happened in the station. Ross is

37
00:03:51,905 --> 00:04:06,081
typically talking with the side about what happens great. yeah

38
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:12,661
I was trying to go to that. okay. okay. so

39
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:17,861
you should understand what's gonna diagram like that I can actually give you the diagram of dozens of questions

40
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,981
related to it. you think I wanna point out. uranium two thirty

41
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:28,381
eight and that natural substance. it had half life. it's almost exactly

42
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:33,661
the same age. er which means that I mean that happened

43
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:38,741
that that was present when the earth came together. please still present and so

44
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:44,561
that means that when is the case all the same down here below it.

45
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:50,081
so all the time you know today

46
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:55,241
because uranium two thirty eight is in the environment starts in there. what

47
00:04:55,241 --> 00:05:00,881
I watch and noticed is that you can use also obsessed with

48
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:06,357
this we get the radio two twenty six rating to twenty six uh

49
00:05:06,357 --> 00:05:12,397
had they had like one thousand hundred ninety years

50
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:17,977
when the case when the decision is made out of particle

51
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:23,017
particle by the way remember to program the two neutrons in the nucleus

52
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:28,197
of the ceiling without the electronic and then quite great on two twenty

53
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:33,417
two. that's right because it's a big deal because she was great on two twenty two.

54
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:38,577
he will know that. so and

55
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:44,237
it has a half life three to four days. we're seeing if it was created

56
00:05:44,237 --> 00:05:49,297
in bedrock underneath the house or other building. and if there's

57
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:54,777
a negative pressure inside the building assessing the face here to bedrock

58
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:59,917
it had time to move out of the rock and into the domicile

59
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:05,009
part of the building which is why we have a problem for a time so that's important yeah

60
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:10,229
they say enough is important that when radon decay is

61
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:15,249
a is an alpha particle and

62
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:20,249
then if come in when it was anything something missed out article you

63
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:25,529
know become a new element because it just got rid of two protons.

64
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:31,469
so the procedure now no longer a time now loaning I mean two eighteen

65
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:36,589
and this agent of course. so what

66
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:42,431
the issue here is you inhale the radon a vision

67
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:49,391
and then you have a molecular guy. but as politics I

68
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:55,791
think you know you can have got position on rest.

69
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,791
so there and also made

70
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,971
know particle very pretty quickly after three

71
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:11,391
minutes perhaps life I'm glad and

72
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:18,611
sort of added it missing now the particle particle. you gonna see the sun

73
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:23,651
particle won't go through each paper. so that. so you don't doesn't take

74
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:29,651
much to protect yourself. by sitting on the serial cell.

75
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:34,971
also will give up all this energy. you know very exciting.

76
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:41,538
basically cell the right next to again. I joes radiation

77
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:47,378
nature of our radiation for the same level of energy.

78
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:53,038
we're hoping causing damage to shoot and say yeah.

79
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,238
so it's cute. um

80
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:03,258
well I'm pieces when get the picture of it. okay. so there's so there's what how

81
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:08,858
the particle to get ahead and you know this you get down here and these these are all things that happen quickly.

82
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:14,018
have five it's not that long. yeah and again because and I mean to fourteen you get another

83
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:19,098
article off in that same thing. so again this is this is why

84
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:24,178
rate on the issue and progeny in the daughter. this is not under the

85
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:29,318
radar. aren't capable of inducing cancer. usually because they're sitting right there.

86
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:34,638
so solid maybe you know. alright. okay. questions

87
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:39,658
about that. bye going. alright so we are dead

88
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:45,458
now what article is gives up his energy all those energy shortages and.

89
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,638
bye posted by ionizing other molecules.

90
00:08:50,638 --> 00:08:56,298
okay. please DNA damage but it's not very penetrating

91
00:08:56,298 --> 00:09:01,558
paper soft beta or electronic articles. so electronic or

92
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:06,718
Circle out of that what what what why they got a question they analyze

93
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:11,778
them stabilized a reason is because it's highly energetic moving

94
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:17,638
in. okay. so energy you know it's just like trying to

95
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:25,278
knock another about out and stuff and

96
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:31,118
penetrates more than happy particle but it doesn't I might as well

97
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:36,378
that's damage gamma

98
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:42,072
energy not a particle very high energy and they had high penetration

99
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:47,192
which so in terms of protecting yourself from being exposed.

100
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:52,272
you can you more more to keep you away from the storage

101
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:57,612
doors. yeah right. and

102
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:03,192
so this is I think I think I did two diagrams in a row. this is sort of to help you remember

103
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:08,972
who radiation body very spoken the damages to shoes.

104
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:15,012
- hey paper to go through the paper of them go through aluminum foil

105
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:20,872
and gamma radiation will usaa goes the neighborhood and broil. if you wanna stop and you need something like

106
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:26,352
ladder concrete like that. okay.

107
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:31,772
you should be aware that there's basically two types of fact of ionizing

108
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:37,372
radiation on tissues. um threshold

109
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:42,698
is that's the cost threshold effect because yes

110
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:48,478
yeah exposure certain a certain energy for certainly time.

111
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:53,598
basically you'll cross the threshold where you everyone will have adverse

112
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:58,838
effects from that kind of exposure. so why that is not the past they determine

113
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:04,018
that it's predictable. so if you take twenty workers

114
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:09,438
again exposed the very high level of ionizing radiation is

115
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:14,478
to trade entire body. all of them. if tired of all of them are

116
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:19,638
going to have decrease blood cell count because calling their own work

117
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:24,978
as well all have a problem gastrointestinal your station meeting because

118
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:30,038
they can't do so. classes are supposed to do so.

119
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:35,758
so here's an example of the thing she damages wrestlers are that not press shows that

120
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:41,038
are sarcastic or probabilistic we're so. basically talking here about getting cancer

121
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:46,460
from exposure to ionizing radiation so you you develop a cancer

122
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,880
and he stations maybe you can serve to you know change the way.

123
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,580
so um for example

124
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,940
you know if you look at the study being done of the victims are parish and there an was atomic

125
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,500
bomb detonated over there towards the end of World War II.

126
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,740
you would be actually Kenya going up pretty quickly the first two years

127
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,160
of solid tumors later. typically there's more latency

128
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,280
development and I shall understand the physical

129
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,560
half-life is and basically this is John used to go

130
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,180
through that half live you know one percent of the radioactivity

131
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,220
started with but of course as I pointed out that

132
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:49,128
walk to anything around two thirty eight he's only gone through half life.

133
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:54,548
okay. so any questions

134
00:12:54,548 --> 00:13:00,308
about. but I I. a

135
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:08,668
close this loan.

136
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:14,128
- hour. we're talking about this third set of eyes

137
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:19,974
to prepare you for midterm hello we're gonna talk about first of all organic compounds

138
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:25,714
they've Internet gases and stuff whole reference.

139
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:32,154
so you should be aware that type of the sixties essentially

140
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:37,394
a any any gas places

141
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:43,394
and enough of air the oxygen there is which what we need to grieve course and Dale I

142
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:48,554
can actually both I have a concentration it will decrease

143
00:13:48,554 --> 00:13:54,534
the amount of oxygen you're able to you know people who are example direct time

144
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:59,614
because I'm sure nitrogen gas is released you to from

145
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:04,614
something we don't know the oxygen that dissension to

146
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:09,714
mechanism that are that actually chemical that have to

147
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:15,774
do with it parents usually take hostage and you

148
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:21,157
know so what are examples of that. so

149
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:26,717
um hydrogen I think down you know you probably think there's now

150
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:32,357
very low concentration better way destinations that it would take in much lower than

151
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:37,437
same thing like methane displays and all the oxygen you. you

152
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:42,517
can tire sixty Asians and you can't use oxygen. if you have too high. thank you

153
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:47,617
so she's. so you can love you know there's a couple other examples

154
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:53,337
of those things understand the difference between the both the six p.m. and

155
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:58,897
weekdays. is now now. crane to

156
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:04,537
your education information of the respiratory tract night. anyway Asian.

157
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:10,517
are. you're indicating because of their chemical properties

158
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:15,557
and in terms of what's important with respect to that. you should

159
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:20,627
remember that does the course always an important water side abilities neighbors

160
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:26,027
is very important well what I'm talking about. so in example of an agent

161
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:31,227
that had a water soluble ammonia job. I'm experiencing

162
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:37,247
exposed to low concentrations. so if you

163
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:42,447
if you're walking into the room that had high levels of ammonia and that you know not

164
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:47,447
hi. you're going to immediately have feel your education.

165
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:52,987
I know the road and so on because what is valuable

166
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:58,167
to begin it you know there's everything available service is basically

167
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:03,727
so it will dissolve into it and start interacting. so problem.

168
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:09,147
so. so that I need to go high and nobody

169
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:14,167
was out there barely get exposed to high levels of ammonia foreign properties because

170
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:20,355
it's water soluble I'm not a fan so typically people don't get

171
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:25,455
information of the brokerage cash injuries and now I'll be a lot.

172
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:31,375
because a lower concentrations and all ammonia the is actually contracted

173
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:36,615
basically solutions. I would never reach the phone to see if you're

174
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:41,975
situation where say you're working on your work now

175
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:47,075
and only about cute and this - got here along and then you may

176
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:52,735
get huge blast of the money in your face and you don't have the time to react concentrations though I

177
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,415
not all that door and then you actually can't get a

178
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:04,155
one fax. so so does a lot of liability for.

179
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:09,175
so let's contrast this with agents like oh down

180
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:14,315
or nitrogen. 's. so the love doing welding arc

181
00:17:14,315 --> 00:17:19,779
welding. I had a few welding uh and you can find places you know ventilation if they're doing.

182
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:25,499
they can do that for hours and the issues with that high energy you you'll actually react

183
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:30,799
to an end to air form things like total and

184
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,439
nitrogen and what happened in that situation. person will

185
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:42,459
not notice anything. well they're doing the welding and then later. okay.

186
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:47,739
so start coughing and have difficulty breathing

187
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:54,239
and still have information. u.

188
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:59,979
he does imagine those um don't react very quickly with

189
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:06,999
because they know they're very easily reached. u. talk to you for property.

190
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:12,639
but important that you know little bit about don't try to memorize all the

191
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:17,707
not the ones that on are screen chemicals had and they had the mechanism of

192
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:23,207
injury organic chemical in general holidays chemicals

193
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:28,547
or more of an issue and they said and then they tend to accumulate the special

194
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:34,107
case and the next day and keys um

195
00:18:34,107 --> 00:18:39,427
they they form how they talk to a accident

196
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:44,567
I know that right. anyway they farm and they just did it because the

197
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:53,067
creek running around it. so totally dangerous to scribble

198
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:58,147
the system. so you can get a you know take a fax and these that you just

199
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:03,707
from others. bad name. if you are aware very there's already but

200
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:08,987
she was a bending carcinogen. I do have a search engine

201
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:14,147
and then I don't right another established carcinogens you don't know little

202
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:19,401
bit about though with respect to. I don't just make sure you understand

203
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:24,461
sort of the the that makes things happen you know what why did

204
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:29,721
they come up with yeah when they could do the same way

205
00:19:29,721 --> 00:19:34,881
they start producing Asian workers versus posing no problem

206
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:40,041
on that thing all the garbage you alternative persistent

207
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:46,201
organic food and um know you the basic characteristics and patterns

208
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:51,321
like what their cartoons are so some of our Asian made

209
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:56,347
on purpose but others like work historically where other

210
00:19:56,347 --> 00:20:02,027
ones are actually um. five Honda. aren't extended

211
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:07,467
examples of our product is intended to maintain their nervous I

212
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:13,787
two forty two four five TV. you can produce two three seven eight

213
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:18,887
dioxin and that their agent and

214
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:23,987
where but I'm historically CDs are used because

215
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:29,027
of their electrical properties or he's not kinda transform. so and so

216
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:34,887
they were purposely being made distributed and authorization.

217
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:40,427
the reason they're persistent is because they're looking for like don't like a place

218
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:45,587
like that. so I think you know that and they for the most part ended

219
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:50,987
by looking like the food chain to see Texas if you give me a human

220
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:56,555
when a company is it's just you know bigger fish

221
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:02,214
uh and they had to have a very long half-life there. they

222
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:07,955
chlorinated nominated whatever and they they break out much more slowly firemen

223
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:14,714
and so even though no one is never used. they just like

224
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:19,995
are there now. we talked about the fact. you can find a lot of polar

225
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:27,415
bears of these things but all over the world. is this over DC.

226
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:33,195
and her all uses except for a if you know

227
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:38,895
Larry affected strong arguments are about that no

228
00:21:38,895 --> 00:21:46,875
CDs are these are serious in

229
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:52,175
her system and infectious diseases.

230
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:58,684
so first things around on infectious diseases and occupational exposure

231
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:04,324
healthcare workers going to be in the room for burgers and have the largest potential exposure

232
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:09,365
Texas agents where there are other groups that have exposure is probably in terms

233
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:14,564
of numbers of mobile. there is a lot of issues with blood borne

234
00:22:14,564 --> 00:22:19,764
pathogens you know where you get like a needle. okay. give me a chance for something. okay.

235
00:22:19,764 --> 00:22:24,764
with an impatient person is taking care of the patient

236
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:30,484
and major concern hepatitis B hepatitis C

237
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:37,784
if. you could give me a call back and get prices some irises in a Chinese of they course.

238
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:42,865
but you know I never were a lot of actions taking around better control

239
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:47,924
for both corn pathogen. mostly following to HIV and

240
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:53,005
aids epidemic. but um I hope very many times more likely.

241
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:59,010
if they haven't been vaccinated. okay hepatitis C

242
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,510
from Phoenix most of the horn had actually get a check that

243
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,531
my pardon. much credit. that's where you like

244
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:14,891
there's been a dramatic decrease in occupational related

245
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:20,630
HPV infections and so I did read the diagram comedy and probably

246
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,791
results our about passage in the other package in the situation

247
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:32,070
concerning health care workers. tuberculosis easy

248
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,590
airborne exposure but there's a high risk call all

249
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,930
works and all of that. well this is just

250
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:49,090
I think I he had five like this is sort of pretty things up. basically again showing

251
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,551
dramatic drop in the number of cases. have a tendency

252
00:23:54,551 --> 00:24:00,044
long workers in the US

253
00:24:00,044 --> 00:24:05,744
health care workers and his mind out here so many people are getting vaccinated

254
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:10,844
or vaccinated for universal precautions really put in the news where they

255
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:16,004
were reinforcing they are more affected because it was

256
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:21,724
just born passages and all the things contribute to drop off with probably vaccinations

257
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:27,464
and things for. okay. occupational hearing loss

258
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:32,604
you. I was looking picture of a couple manifests understand what diagram

259
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:37,644
measure which is measures. look with that. you

260
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:42,644
should know what a typical pattern of noise induced hearing loss and I hate Jill looks like I don't

261
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:48,204
know I mean graham. we have an example there I mean you should understand a

262
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:53,704
mechanism of damage in common characteristics

263
00:24:53,704 --> 00:24:58,850
in here law and uh so the mechanism is actually affecting

264
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:04,431
cochlea inner year. but I don't know. okay.

265
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:10,191
bye. here you know those bit about how house measuring

266
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:15,850
down and test these measured using PDA and you should know that on a logarithmic

267
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,970
scale. you know you've always if you increase those

268
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,431
certain racquetball the

269
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:33,051
basic facts about is here in law. okay.

270
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:38,191
preventable available avoid having people use those items are to high. but

271
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:43,291
once it occurred irreversible carpet damage because of the cochlea. you

272
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:48,691
can't doesn't repair and you don't have to memorize it this is the

273
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:54,110
weird general fact that there are number a of chemicals that are directly

274
00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:00,221
including I standing nervously to give to humans like them and it's some type antibiotics of

275
00:26:00,221 --> 00:26:05,301
which are out of toxic so you can actually have an interplay between exposure to chemical cooking

276
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:11,541
medication and exposure to high noise levels accelerating

277
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:16,601
hearing loss. so this

278
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:23,481
is a diagram and got um

279
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:28,500
different. okay so this is the threshold

280
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,670
level. basically you're testing online at is

281
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:39,030
that a certain wavelength and you see

282
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:45,030
where when it's the person I mean able to hear the sound intensity.

283
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,530
so typically what happens and this is right here and there can typically what happens is early

284
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:55,710
you're a lot higher pitched down. round

285
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,710
four thousand blockers. so you get this sort of pattern

286
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,750
course some abnormal that sort of these comes goes straight across. I got no here. so

287
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,170
that would be went early. looks like unfortunately this

288
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:16,810
way there's a level down.

289
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,930
has a big impact on people 's ability to understand spoken languages. bye. especially

290
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:27,770
in a crowded room or do something. so early that's

291
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,916
what people often report first. well I can't problem conversation

292
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:37,916
because I came here so here's

293
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:43,756
the example that was taken from a local manufacturing facility and here

294
00:27:43,756 --> 00:27:49,276
you see this is the picture like much more severe

295
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:57,236
hearing loss and I figured your drop levels around four thousand.

296
00:27:57,236 --> 00:28:02,476
okay. so really should you take away about hearing

297
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:07,636
activation here how about artificial skin diseases.

298
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:12,776
so you should know the basic characteristics and some information about travelers allergic

299
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:17,956
to New York and contact. I had just bitten by far the most common type of occupation

300
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:23,016
you need. you should know that um allergic

301
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:28,136
where there's a true. give me a logical reaction occurred but

302
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:33,194
your truck toxic properties in the camp with chemicals can be exposed

303
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:38,654
to more common allergic and uh when you're looking for a

304
00:28:38,654 --> 00:28:44,194
allergic contact and I did you can do to patch testing

305
00:28:44,194 --> 00:28:51,194
where you actually have a set of allergens recently is that the cheese that

306
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:58,014
versus work environment but if you can actually test on skin their and see what the newspaper

307
00:28:58,014 --> 00:29:05,014
pages. so contact area kinda I guess in the

308
00:29:05,014 --> 00:29:10,214
lurch. hey you wanna get it in the very first time you're agent because you

309
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:15,954
filled up an immune response but if was it on the direct here. hey.

310
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:20,974
you can have patience for starters so a big big issues

311
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:26,654
historically especially if historically one the

312
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:32,720
people developing late technologies equipment but especially globs for anymore

313
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,160
as it contains anything just had the complicated

314
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,220
checking. so here's a picture of contact on the time

315
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:50,040
to read feeling bye.

316
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,200
Julie and I look at you can't tell they had allergic

317
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,460
versus directing everything because they look similar

318
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,140
to each other. but you can do ten things

319
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,820
there just certain agent you know. okay.

320
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:17,940
so I would respect workers compensation. you know that about

321
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,220
the storage and workers compensation in the United States they can play in the early

322
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,540
twentieth century and they were sued. there's workers are against their

323
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,578
lawyers injuries or health problems in their work

324
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:38,718
and it was possibly a grand compromise where workers couldn't do

325
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:44,058
except very unusual regions circumstances to do their direct

326
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:49,498
employer but they didn't have to prove that is

327
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:55,058
attached to call our office just. if the problem road from where they should

328
00:30:55,058 --> 00:31:01,438
be eligible for workers compensation and

329
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:06,938
I'm gonna jump down here you should be aware of the fact that workers compensation

330
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:12,778
and pension would do quite a poor job. ask

331
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:18,578
for people that have occupational diseases especially occupational needs and significant latency.

332
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:23,818
so that is exposed craving her along for the show they are

333
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:29,218
have this comedy. my name 's compensation comp cases. you did

334
00:31:29,218 --> 00:31:34,378
and they need to go something like feel the leader and which

335
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:39,798
should be calling about all kinds of other things off from work. so there's a lot of evidence

336
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:45,738
people who I'm based on the doctors compensation they should have

337
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:51,418
that they're hurt and I did just a certain percentage of wages.

338
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:58,098
if you can't go back and kinda work you before. bye. three education certain level

339
00:31:58,098 --> 00:32:03,718
covering the medical costs associated to typical call but the other thing is that there.

340
00:32:03,718 --> 00:32:08,778
face to talk about this later today because all the standards are the state law.

341
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:14,778
so what's around in Michigan yeah order. if

342
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:20,958
they don't count. okay. so

343
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:27,038
any any questions or comments. alright.

344
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:34,275
look quickly thank you

345
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:40,335
at the preview articles um.

346
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:47,075
we don't have time to do that I think is actually very interesting discussion about how people feel about

347
00:32:47,075 --> 00:33:04,915
precautionary type of oh I'm a little bigger.

348
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:10,578
okay. so join the basics not surprisingly

349
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:16,058
are talk about in abstract the and so the has that here were highlighted

350
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:21,198
you know the highlighted version for central components of those who say yes this

351
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:26,838
is all possible that you wanna take preventive action in the face third of a.

352
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:32,178
so if you're not not know whether there's a reason I think in nation

353
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:37,298
I called an adverse outcome but it's not been proven it's not really knows whether it does

354
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:42,798
that I mean take preventative action drunkard

355
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,918
problem. second one is shifting the burden of proof different to on of seven activities

356
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:53,138
the bases same. if a same company wants to introduce a new

357
00:33:53,138 --> 00:33:58,318
chemical commerce and people are gonna be exposed to it.

358
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:04,058
never been used before. argument is made that the company should have food.

359
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:09,437
but this is gonna be safe

360
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:16,397
soon to be safe. so nothing choked up later and then

361
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:21,397
just in the burden of proof home is this activity which is what I'm just saying

362
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:26,817
and it's also looking for a wide range of alternatives for possible harmful action.

363
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:31,937
so you know that this is obvious when you think about it but yeah the nation is very. useful

364
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:37,117
we're not sure that's because can hardly adverse effect to waste you. and if there's not

365
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:42,197
a agent that does the same thing. we're sure is that would be very

366
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:47,577
obvious situations they will not use the first Asian Hispanic background.

367
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:54,237
I'll. bye. this went to that issue

368
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:59,777
other easy but we don't know the newspaper. okay. and

369
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:04,797
today and Charlie are that there should be strong public patient decision

370
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:10,503
I should be just decide to even though was becoming

371
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:15,943
and it should be left just to companies rather than going to put

372
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:20,943
some kind of product. commerce.

373
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:25,963
thank you can you can look quickly at other parts that are highlighted.

374
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:31,263
you know little bit sort of you should all that sort of

375
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:37,723
the central tenets. people are going to be prostate principal things we just one

376
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:43,923
question about that. okay

377
00:35:43,923 --> 00:35:54,023
I don't

378
00:35:54,023 --> 00:36:05,163
know

379
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:10,395
I might need help here and I mean exactly how far we got. this is

380
00:36:10,395 --> 00:36:15,475
I wasn't I wasn't shown you had

381
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:20,515
a time and I think it's a time I'll just sorta go through that can people read on the

382
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:33,275
baggage I mean they get their little bigger.

383
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:38,395
so we talk about the question had

384
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:43,875
disease conditions and clearly established to talk about whether countries exhaust

385
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:54,635
agent. we can talk about whether exposure hasn't demonstrated

386
00:36:54,635 --> 00:36:59,835
know you think we're not sure really talk about

387
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:06,315
the thing 's they wanna remember because I have to confess I don't

388
00:37:06,315 --> 00:37:13,473
know the question about had exposure that Asian and showing to be a sufficient degree duration

389
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:19,613
would we have Casey and you know I think we did talk about

390
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:25,433
this just had the language in case it gives wanna

391
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:30,793
what the exposure was tested successfully and um

392
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:36,633
we we were I mean it sounds like it's probably sufficient but if you don't actually have a

393
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:41,853
quantitative measure the usual situate very unusual that you're any product

394
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:47,333
yesterday. yes. okay. and then um

395
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:52,553
have alternative thinking that are like a differential diagnosis. so we can brightness

396
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:57,953
we got here so we're talking about cigarette smoking. this is Donna have a hamster

397
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:03,013
and expose this is the main concern and um because

398
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:08,233
of that smoke like it is a relationship where you have you if both a heavy

399
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:13,385
smoker and had missing occupational exposure you're

400
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:18,745
markedly increased risk you like not their lives you know maybe five folks that for

401
00:38:18,745 --> 00:38:24,325
exposure we're not at fault for the heavy smoking if you get this something like this if I trouble.

402
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:31,945
so uh I think I was trying to disarm them and us that with diagram out

403
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:37,945
doesn't change probabilities because all parts doesn't change probabilities that we

404
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:43,105
had a call back and it's not hurt in Texas exposure is

405
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:48,105
much more important to avoid if you have a history cigarette smoking because the

406
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:53,645
probability this is that outcome actually

407
00:38:53,645 --> 00:39:04,185
much higher smoking. we talk about um.

408
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:09,212
okay. and then this case you'd have to think about other exposures because

409
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:14,593
later. still working with the same company. you had a lot of exposure to call

410
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:19,653
but it's even debated only have a modest contribution

411
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:24,673
Missus or long answer and also remember we

412
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:29,833
talked about the Chevrolet you have the exposure had been condensation leave long

413
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:35,093
before diagnosed with the disease. have actually impacted the cultivation

414
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:40,113
that the with that. you know that called us came

415
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:45,312
later. so there's no issue about late edition.

416
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:51,385
now this is sort of interesting go back

417
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:57,405
he was exposed later. production is chrome plated offers a different company

418
00:39:57,405 --> 00:40:02,405
and what he was doing was standing the the sponsors and actually there isn't a

419
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:08,465
good description of the work environment and the reason that's important

420
00:40:08,465 --> 00:40:13,485
is that the people that they're doing the actual play. he was doing you

421
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:18,885
know making everything look pretty very yeah they're doing the actual

422
00:40:18,885 --> 00:40:24,805
waiting I was possible for that. have great potential exposure

423
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:30,265
to I think they'll probably call me because they're using

424
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:36,165
it and they can get airborne hours all sorts of different ways. so if

425
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:41,165
there's issues that lady probably isn't long enough because this is later career

426
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:46,196
closer to my diagnosis broadcaster but principal might have been I guess they

427
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:51,476
I don't know which employer or like to be responsible for that somebody for years

428
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:56,516
with no latency in with probably because they are involved with

429
00:40:56,516 --> 00:41:01,516
actual the process. so. so the issue here is I don't know whether they were right next

430
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:07,276
to each other. expose all the time even though he was doing sandy sandy 's okay because

431
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:12,416
by the time it's played elemental problem. so not gonna come out you know even if you

432
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:17,976
you know that was sort of point there. and

433
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:23,116
um another thing when you get to talk about on this case is

434
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:28,156
which we start talk about. 's his chest x-ray and what was

435
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:33,196
notable about that is that did not have any

436
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:38,576
class. if you remember several fact rarely any have

437
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:43,716
symptoms or disease and so they're not they should do it you know they're not they're not

438
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:49,258
a camp by how seemed so

439
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:55,198
at this time but there is very good 's marker

440
00:41:55,198 --> 00:42:00,438
that that's his exposure and intensity exposure. so if you

441
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:06,718
are agreed and decided that you would probably try to argue that well. bye.

442
00:42:06,718 --> 00:42:13,138
you know we can't tell what they sold it was really like you know his

443
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:18,538
his recall and this is Justin his unit is exposed to asbestos

444
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:24,338
was really that highly unlikely maybe call on cancer. give you fax a

445
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:29,918
from. bye. I think kind of thing you might wanna look out if you. if this is your case.

446
00:42:29,918 --> 00:42:34,918
I mean the and again if you look like they're the

447
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:39,918
study I and wasn't up here. look at people and have you.

448
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:45,798
well some exposure to heavy exposure cancer

449
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:51,234
and eighty seven percent of those long cancer after that

450
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:56,254
exposure class. they can make an argument same and so security

451
00:42:56,254 --> 00:43:01,494
is much closer because we just clarify the description

452
00:43:01,494 --> 00:43:07,154
of what's going on. u is a little hard to interpret

453
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:12,854
because it causes minimal generalized into special knowledge or. roses so

454
00:43:12,854 --> 00:43:19,154
as best else was away gone. guys can

455
00:43:19,154 --> 00:43:24,234
show pictures it looks like that but the fact is minimal. again you know were they

456
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:29,334
out there. I keep the thing. so

457
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:35,214
and then I'll get any comments or questions on them.

458
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:40,314
please make sense the reasons I'm giving you why this is your case

459
00:43:40,314 --> 00:43:48,326
make arguments this direction direction. okay

460
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:56,846
hello

461
00:43:56,846 --> 00:44:02,166
Karen you

462
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:13,046
know doing

463
00:44:13,046 --> 00:44:18,606
those go ahead and people are going in groups right. just go ahead and

464
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:25,386
why she might just take a

465
00:44:25,386 --> 00:44:30,626
day about this is Devon managed to talk in your group about which is not about questions.

466
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:35,746
one two and three and then we'll come together and see what people have to say about

467
00:44:35,746 --> 00:44:58,466
that. okay. thank you
