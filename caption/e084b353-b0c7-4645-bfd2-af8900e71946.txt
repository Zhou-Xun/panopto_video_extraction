1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm sorry, but I think some of this stuff is I mean, I was trying to start someone who was just like,

2
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:39,630
you know, in high school that I wanted to be all right.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,870
I decided, everybody, happy Friday. Yeah.

4
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,010
What assignment to for me? Maybe.

5
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,460
Let's start with that. So I'm going to go through our agenda today real quick to talk about.

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:01,030
What you thought about it. I want to give a little bit more on climate change, too, just because it's an important topic right now.

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,540
And, you know, anyway, there's more to that that we could be thinking about and doing a little bit of a first pace.

8
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:15,620
So we'll be assigning the first case this weekend and you can get instructions about why you want to do it has everybody.

9
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,580
But we'll talk about the hurricane pack and where to find.

10
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,220
We haven't looked already. We'll show you how to get those, but that'll be a good first case.

11
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,209
And then you could start working with your groups over. You've got until I think it's due on the 26th of this month.

12
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,120
So I know this is your first full week one and it's getting heavy fast.

13
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,210
So we'll go through this lecture.

14
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,360
We do have the first three chapters of the book, which is really the important parts there are.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,280
Now we're getting into health care systems, right? How important is your mission?

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,920
Does anyone care? What do you do with it? How does that drive culture?

17
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,590
Do we care about how the place is organized or not? What does it mean for you?

18
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:10,159
Your feels that you're going to go into whether you're coming at it as a consultant from the outside looking in,

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,220
if you're coming at it from an administrative fellow in two years,

20
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:20,840
if you're coming at it from a I.T. person or a startup CEO or something like that,

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,390
there's all the different ways to look at our health care systems and how you will be working with them.

22
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,260
So we'll get oriented into that a little bit more in earnest today.

23
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:39,290
And then we're going to flip it over to you and give you competing case studies so you'll see your group assignments for the first case.

24
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,149
You'll also then start working with those groups starting today in class.

25
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,299
That's how we'll do the second half of class today. So lots of stuff, good stuff and exciting stuff.

26
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,110
But I would love to hear from you all when you thought about the first memo.

27
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,520
Who wants to start? It's obviously it's tough.

28
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,600
You have say about it for your second. Go ahead. I think it was hard to not lose whatever it is.

29
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:13,310
I feel like I do that a lot. And so there was so much deleting that I had to do and so lots of deleting.

30
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,150
That's probably fair. Yeah. What did you think about it overall?

31
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:26,140
I thought it was interesting. It's I've never done something like that before, so I thought we should do more.

32
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,550
Just like how to do that.

33
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,190
I have to do it over and over and over again. So lots of deleting in the back.

34
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:48,260
Yeah, I think it was interesting to like approach it from like a health system in one state perspective and involve climate change as a whole as well.

35
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,800
So I was like thinking about the scope.

36
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,190
It was hard for me to see what California in certain formation was, the whole world.

37
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:06,040
So it was interesting to approach. Yeah, I guess it was because I always thought that was something different.

38
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,800
I don't know if that was a good thing or not, but yeah, so I'd say I would do that.

39
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:19,159
So I think your point is well taken that you have to put yourself in the situation that I'm your Haskins, right?

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Because any of you could find yourself in that situation like starting this summer, right?

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,510
So if you end up as an intern at Kaiser, you may very well find yourself in that situation.

42
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,150
So you're trying to immerse yourself, you're on the team, you're working with these key people who that's their job.

43
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:46,879
They do this all the time. You're just here to help. So what are some of the things that you want to come across in a memo like this at this moment?

44
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,830
So here we are, Kaiser Permanente. There are how many hospitals in that system?

45
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,309
I look pretty. Yep, about 39 hospitals.

46
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,950
You're all across the West Coast, for sure. So you definitely cover all of California.

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,780
How is it going out there this week? Yeah, that's good.

48
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:18,200
Right? Right. And so when you're writing a memo like this for you're the leader of your organization to then go tell people the media,

49
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,459
which then gets sorted through a variety of different platforms,

50
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,410
whether it's Twitter or news, you know,

51
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:34,130
L.A. Times and the San Francisco Chronicle or whatever else you're that the words you put together will get quoted over and over and over again.

52
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,560
So every word matters.

53
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:49,219
And what do you need to do at a time like this if you're the CEO of a health system and that needs to be disseminated, is still being provided.

54
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:56,320
Okay, good. Reassure. Locals, your community, that the care that should be provided is still being provided.

55
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,630
Is that always going to be the case? No, not necessarily.

56
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,890
But I think this kind of event, I think telling people that emergency and lifesaving care,

57
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,490
like the things that absolutely need to be done, are being done.

58
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,380
And maybe there's a ramp down of other services in order to support an effort like that.

59
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,410
So I think, one reassuring the public is always job number one if you're the leader of anything.

60
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,290
Right. To be honest about what you're reassuring them about.

61
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:39,940
What else would you add to that? Definitely providing that information and the resources where it's available and how to give in their information.

62
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,020
Right. So what what do you need to know if you're in the community listening to this message?

63
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,800
I think that's a good opportunity, although you do have multiple people and teams and structures in place to do that.

64
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,229
So if you're the leader in a crisis,

65
00:06:53,230 --> 00:07:03,690
which this is your job is to communicate and inspire confidence in your community that you as a health system are doing something right.

66
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,360
You're doing something. We've been here before a few times.

67
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,200
As it turns out, we health care in the US.

68
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,190
We are going to keep being here for a long time.

69
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:27,390
I think. The woman I shared with you the article that Sheri Fink wrote about at my resources availability last year.

70
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:37,860
She wrote this book about the hurricane in New Orleans and what that was like, what that was like.

71
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,270
Did any of you remember the story? Yeah. Tell me a little bit about it.

72
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,020
They the levee broke. So first they thought it was not a big deal.

73
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,540
They survived a hurricane and then the levees broke and the whole city flooded and they were trapped in the hospital.

74
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:58,110
They had a lot of patients in there, actually, a couple of hospitals in the building and a memorial.

75
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:05,250
And I recall when this like a. It's a private hospital.

76
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,240
I don't remember exactly the second, but then the other one was a very old hospital.

77
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:24,270
They had a lot of stuff that I couldn't get out of bed if they were trying to come away and put in more people and then they were ordered to evacuate.

78
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:33,030
And there was some controversy about suicide for some of the patients.

79
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:44,670
And I think that actually she went on with the lady that did it was initially not convicted but prosecuted for doing it.

80
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:53,700
And then she won that battle and went on to be laws in state of Louisiana for unionized positions from that sort of thing.

81
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,420
And we'll talk about that more today, too.

82
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:04,500
But this is a good the story is is actually so when I was working on Sherry with the article on ALMO, I could not read her.

83
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:13,790
I couldn't tell her that at the time. But we were I was so in the throes of the pandemic and getting calls from people who couldn't get remote.

84
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,440
And so it's too much stuff like the latest life stuff, stuff at the moment.

85
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,620
So this is as far as I've gotten in her book and I don't tell her, but it's gotten very close to half.

86
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,490
But this documents one of the natural disasters we've had not too long ago.

87
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,820
We had another one in New York. What happened there? Does anyone know this is a hurricane, Hurricane Sandy?

88
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:48,000
What happened there? That also flooded the city.

89
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,960
And the people were like, thank you.

90
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,799
I mean, like I was watching some news that night and that was amazing to watch.

91
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,010
Every single family and even the rescuers were not able to reach.

92
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,059
That's right. Rescuers weren't able. So Hurricane Sandy happened.

93
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:17,010
It came into New York City area. One of the things so the reason we'll talk about these things is, one, this is definitely going to be on your radar.

94
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,180
You're going to have to start thinking about climate change as part of your job.

95
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:34,250
Two, how you do it matters. So the CEO of NYU Langone sat on the main floor in and with the team throughout that entire crew

96
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,800
and was there physically in a command control crisis center where they had people you know,

97
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,370
how many people are here? Can we take care of them? Can we get up and down the ladders?

98
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,399
What's working? What's not? Generator. Backup generator.

99
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,770
Generator failure vents. Like if you how many of you you've been in hospitals before, right?

100
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,180
How many of you seem in the hospital rooms?

101
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,999
There's usually two different kinds of outlets.

102
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:12,450
So if you look at the outlets here, the white ones, and there's the red and the red ones are all down the generator, that's what they are.

103
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,940
So if you're hooking up your ventilator, you hook it up into the red outlet, have the way,

104
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,270
because should anything happen, that system, everything plugged into that should continue to run.

105
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,090
So these are things we have to train our teams to do. We have to make sure it's done in every room.

106
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:36,110
Because if a disaster does happen and you actually don't have a lot of heads up, like a weather system coming,

107
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,390
and you can you could know about that, you know, but other disasters, maybe not so much.

108
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:50,729
Right. So time is not always on your side, but this is something hurricane wise.

109
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,540
We've got good documented history of that.

110
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,310
What about what other natural disasters or climate change things do we need to be thinking about these days?

111
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,070
Like depending on the location, someplace like Hawaii, maybe volcanic focus.

112
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,099
Yes, but yes. And Hawaii has had recently volcanoes erupting.

113
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,240
And yes, I mean, it is faster tornadoes from yesterday.

114
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:24,660
You know what else? Earthquakes are quakes, droughts or some phenomena with earth, earthquakes, droughts.

115
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:36,960
What happens also with droughts? Landscape disappear as the agricultural landscape makes it more vulnerable when there is flooding and landslides.

116
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,599
Wildfires? Yes. Fires. Wildfires.

117
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,930
And then when you have droughts and wildfires, what's happening in California right now is there's nothing to hold the land in place.

118
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,870
And so you get also massive mudslides when the rains do come because there's nothing to hold the land in place.

119
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,590
This is where we live. This is what's happening.

120
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:02,800
I wanted to share with you while we're on this topic, just to give you a sense of how we think about it in medicine and in health care.

121
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:11,490
My my organization's keynote speaker, not not this 2022 this past year, but 2021.

122
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,040
This is the second year of our organization's virtual annual conference.

123
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,390
Usually have them in person, but nobody. It was during the pandemic.

124
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,070
But I thought I would share with you what John Frazier did.

125
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,760
He lives in Australia, but he's the chapter president of my Asia-Pacific chapter also.

126
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,899
So I wanted to share a little bit of the opening and then a little bit of the climate change piece with you on.

127
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,510
This will take a few minutes, but I think it might be worth sharing with.

128
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:31,080
With. That's trying to get to forgive him a little bit and he's all gone.

129
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,120
Welcome to Australia.

130
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:41,500
As I welcome it, I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land in which we say some of first connections and the greatest innovators.

131
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:48,150
But back on that journey of the last terrible 12 months and see how well we've done,

132
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:58,170
and then stand on the shoulders of the men and women that came before them to look forward to what we might produce and learn over the next 12 months.

133
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,730
Good morning and welcome again to L so 2021.

134
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:16,140
Last year I was honored to be chosen as the LS for 2020 speaker and had to deliver in the height of the pandemic and presentation from my living room.

135
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,510
By no means are we through this COVID pandemic,

136
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:29,950
but at least we can do a little bit of travel even to the great outdoors as not traveled across the seas on set.

137
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:40,249
We all hope that time is coming soon. My hope through today is to look at the innovation that has brought us to this point and

138
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:46,020
will hopefully bring us even further to this the medical disaster of the 21st century.

139
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:56,840
If we look on a timescale of how far we have come in a step forward to the part where he starts talking about climate change,

140
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,340
you are all welcome to listen to this. It's available publicly so happy to send it out after its its worth.

141
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:14,070
He does a lovely job documenting. This and vaccine equity and truly around the world, which is an amazing topic.

142
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,130
So I'm just going to scoot forward a little bit on this, the largest medical crisis of our time.

143
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:33,910
But perhaps that is an even bigger medical emergency, much more insidious, much less visible.

144
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:41,830
But its impact will be felt for centuries to come from climate change,

145
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,480
as defined by the New England Journal of Medicine and all the other medical journals is the medical crisis of our time.

146
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,700
This is not a political statement. It's a scientific statement.

147
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,150
Data across hundreds of journals. Is that a suitable.

148
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:10,390
Unanimous signatures prior to the Glasgow meeting of all the medical journals is a once in a lifetime event.

149
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:19,210
But perhaps this almost empty down. In other ways, Queensland says it's so much more eloquently than any journal could ever.

150
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:27,350
I took him onto this property this morning. We spoke to the following. It only run several hundred head of cattle and this area is down to six.

151
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,070
The world and this crisis is heating up since 2015.

152
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,940
Five of the hottest years in the last hundred have a current.

153
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,700
The ground is drier than ever before and there's some dies with them.

154
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,879
When I watched the bushfires from Australia a couple of years ago, the Amazon, the States,

155
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:56,000
almost every year Siberia, we see countless millions of acres being devastated.

156
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,790
Trees are taking over 200 years to grow, 8 seconds to die.

157
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:09,800
Each year hundreds of species are being made extinct and they will never combine with the animals that exist to drain that,

158
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:17,390
but less and less habitat in which they live. So they move closer and closer into human proximity and into these positions.

159
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,560
But diseases move from the animal kingdom into the human kingdom.

160
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:31,790
It's a growing epidemic of zoonoses. So too, with humans as it becomes drier and there's more and more extreme weather events.

161
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,810
There's inadequacy of food source and people will migrate.

162
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,170
And it is anticipated that climate change will become one of the major causes of warfare,

163
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:50,720
as populations move from dry aided lands to fine lines and communities on which they can sustain their families.

164
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,410
The W.H.O. has analyzed the data. It is clear.

165
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,550
Every year, four and a half to 5 million die of poor air quality.

166
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,400
That's more than is died 18 months from COVID.

167
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:13,470
A study from Monash University is showing that approximately 6 million people die each year from extreme heat events.

168
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,370
Though we're not going to compare mortalities cold.

169
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:24,910
Please. God will go. I hope it goes. There will be no vaccine for climate change.

170
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,360
We have to do better in a similar way with COVID. It is the poorer nations that will struggle more.

171
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:39,070
I'm embarrassed to say that Australia is one of the worst causes of carbon pollution across the world and one of the richest countries.

172
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:47,590
Again, the low middle income countries are crushed between the weight of the carbon that the richer countries produce.

173
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,269
They are more dependent on the land and they feel the burden of climate change more than the rich countries,

174
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,930
in the same way they felt the burden of COVID more than the richer countries.

175
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,790
The economies of the West say it's too expensive for us to change.

176
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:13,650
And yet again, this is showing not to be the case. Prime ministers have again failed in their duty to realize their job is to lead.

177
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,840
Whether it is popular or unpopular. The Prime is leaders across the world for too long have said this is not real.

178
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,270
Science is too expensive. This is going to be right here by Treasury, not as the of trust.

179
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:38,070
It's time it was dug up by men and women who work and live in the electorates of those who see it often.

180
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:45,600
And the climate denialists are, in effect, the anti-vaxxers of the future of our world.

181
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:55,319
We don't have any more time. This is doable. The United Nations and the World Health Organization have all projected that the cost of

182
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:02,490
leaving the climate unchecked far outweigh the costs of reducing carbon pollution in cleaner,

183
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,480
sustainable energy. And farming practices were already lagging behind the many statements of intent.

184
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,250
The time for intent is passed. The time for action is now.

185
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:22,490
What is our role in this? We are the leaders of the medical community.

186
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,830
We're the last bastion of defense employment.

187
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:35,480
We have worked tirelessly with our colleagues across infectious disease, virology, vaccine, producer production and public health together.

188
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,130
The medical fraternity can band together and say, enough is enough.

189
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:52,090
When you think about how far we, the community and you, the people on the battle lines have come from September 2020 to 2021.

190
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,600
It's truly inspiring as she will look back on this time.

191
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,460
And our hope is that our children are inspired.

192
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,930
And I'm proud of what we have done in crushing the COVID count.

193
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:19,320
But the question remains, if they gave us an A-plus for the work we've done with COVID like we got a minus five,

194
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,960
I would've avoided and ignored the global crisis.

195
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,150
Is climate change the change that is not.

196
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,160
This is science. And this is our responsibility.

197
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:44,580
In the words of Muhammad Ali, a man who would always speak out against injustice no matter how unpopular it was at that time,

198
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,030
impossible is just a big word.

199
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:56,340
So they our own by small men who find it easier to live in the world that began and to use the power we have to change it.

200
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,900
Impossible is not a fight. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration.

201
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,120
It's about impossible is potentially impossible.

202
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,040
It's temporary. Impossible.

203
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:28,550
It's not like. That was our keynote speech, 2021.

204
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:38,540
But I thought he did a nice job, really elevating the crisis of the times and also making it science based and quoting the World

205
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,840
Health Organization and a lot of other entities where this will become part of our work.

206
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,220
An important part of your work, probably for your critics and.

207
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,250
So the first memo is now trying to make this real because this other scenario is playing out right now.

208
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:07,380
I don't know what's happening in San Francisco today or Sacramento or the other areas, but you have to.

209
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,280
Communicate with your community when you're leading a health system and you have to think about

210
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,990
what care you can safely offer and how you'll make that available to people and let them know.

211
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:25,640
So this memo is the first exercise of several where you'll get practice at dealing with big things,

212
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:33,230
but learning how to have a leadership caliber message in those big things.

213
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,560
And think about all the pieces and parts you have to put together.

214
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,580
And you have one piece to do it, which is also very real life.

215
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,849
But anyway, I was I'm happy to share that with you all that John did last year.

216
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:52,999
I think it's timely. Unfortunately, I'll probably keep sharing it every year until we fix this problem because that probably won't go away.

217
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,729
But anyway, I hope that was good context and maybe motivating, you know,

218
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:06,200
in the sense that one thing that's changed since a few years ago is that we've stopped acting like this isn't a thing.

219
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:16,190
We don't have to worry about it so much. And that was one thing I really appreciated about CMS putting together with a RFI last year and

220
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:23,780
sent it out to Kaiser and a couple of other big health systems to ask about what their policy,

221
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,890
what their strategy is to deal with climate change. So.

222
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,729
So. Okay, why don't we take attendance now that everyone had a little moment to get in here and get settled?

223
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:43,580
And then we will talk about your first case a little bit more just to get you oriented to the structure.

224
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:51,360
So I'm going to ask for your help again, but I'm going to write down your help on pronouncing pronouncing your names properly.

225
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,820
So help me out again one more time and hopefully I'll get better at this by the next class.

226
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,930
All right. Muhammad Thank you. Is it?

227
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,960
LOUIS Yeah, yeah. Okay.

228
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,850
Pattern setting. How do you say that's emphatic?

229
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:15,930
Okay. Amir Come over.

230
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:28,620
ANDREW Yeah. Joshua Craig and Diana, is that right?

231
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:39,520
Xena. Xena Yeah. Sorry. Okay, Shreya.

232
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,260
Thank you. So lucky indeed.

233
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,440
Right. That's. Cameron.

234
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,110
Fabian. Seven Fabian. Okay.

235
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:05,200
Natasha. Okay. Good. Alexandra and is that Alexandra, Alex?

236
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,790
Either at either. Sarah.

237
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,160
Our sorrow and sorrow. So here is it.

238
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,820
She's Sarah. I'm sorry. Okay. Sarah.

239
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:29,600
Yeah, you're right. Right now, Isaiah, it's great for you.

240
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,760
You know, people are taking on this year great things.

241
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:41,920
Mohammed, Nadia, Yasmine, is it Sara or Sara?

242
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:54,160
Sara too. Sara? Abigail It is Abigail or Abby or Abigail Durrani.

243
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:00,070
Shivani Right. Yeah. Okay, great.

244
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:10,810
Samuel And if you show Jay when and how, you can call me Sylvia.

245
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,370
Sylvia. Sylvia. Sylvia. Okay.

246
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,520
It's. Thank you.

247
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:30,260
Timothy Joseph McAteer.

248
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:37,470
Asia Acacia. Clare Hastings.

249
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,800
Clare Martin. Tim Tam.

250
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:49,800
You're going to say, Tam. Tam. Thank you, Stephanie.

251
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:59,430
Krista. Alexa, you're Eliza.

252
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,660
Yeah, thank you. Is that correct? Matt?

253
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:08,570
Matthew. Alexis. Since he.

254
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,520
Emily. Oh, email. Okay, I'll double check that.

255
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,060
Sydney Thank you. Madeleine. Yeah.

256
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,310
Natalie. Thanks. Jamal.

257
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:29,840
Is that correct? Sharon and Rajon Rondo.

258
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:38,190
Raji I could be wrong. Could be. Thank you.

259
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,930
Zachary. Zack or Zack.

260
00:29:47,700 --> 00:30:07,570
Mikey. Micah. Micah. Thank you for the remember you saying Brandon experiment hunter the streets.

261
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:13,760
I should be shooting Alex or Alexandre.

262
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,100
Yeah. What do you prefer?

263
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:26,460
Oh, and then Sophia.

264
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:34,270
You mean Sophia and Helen? Helen and then space table?

265
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,730
Yeah, because. How do you do that? Far off. What is it?

266
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,390
Sara. Sara or Sara for Clara.

267
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,560
They are. And they are age. You.

268
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,220
Okay. Thank you for bearing with me. Getting your names right is a big deal, and I really appreciate your patience with me on that.

269
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,570
So thank you. Okay.

270
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:13,320
Next thing that we want to do before we get going into the lecture is talk about your first case.

271
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,590
So the first case is a case about COVID.

272
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,640
It's about public health. It's in San Francisco.

273
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,080
How many people have been able to find it? Do you know where to look for it? Just showed up.

274
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:34,220
A few minutes from the atmosphere. Okay, great. So what we'll do this weekend is write the specific instructions.

275
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,650
So you do not have that yet. But what we're looking for, for cases like we talked about last week,

276
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:46,639
but I'll go through it again and then I know you have questions is available to go through specific questions,

277
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,090
but also a little bit more organization and structure on how you get these things to completion.

278
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,130
One of the things we're trying to do with this case is help you do a few things.

279
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,790
One, create a deliverable. Have you heard that term before?

280
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,000
Deliverables. Everybody knows what it means. Okay, great.

281
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,660
So this is the thing you're producing or delivering as a group.

282
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:17,270
You will do this often in health care. You will be assigned teams that you don't always know.

283
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,849
They're from different fields and different perspectives, and that's great. But you'll have to get good at working with teams.

284
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:29,320
On creating a deliverable and different people in real life will have different aspects that they're good at and need to produce.

285
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:35,930
For example, I produce a deliverable on occasion to the FDA on behalf of a device developer.

286
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,510
I have Phil Boonstra, who's a faculty here at Michigan.

287
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,530
He's my biostatistician that I employed to help us with those things.

288
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:55,370
So he creates the statistical analysis. That's his section of that deliverable with the registry that I have as part of also is the data source.

289
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,879
And then my medical team also writes the clinical implications and the comparative analysis and benchmarking.

290
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,120
So there's about five people involved in writing those reports that go to the FDA who are device developers.

291
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:15,890
That's a deliverable in this case. Is this a situation that is another thing you're supposed to learn in this course?

292
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:24,180
How do we put responses together? How do we think about the health resources that are available?

293
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,760
How do we lead, organize, respond to information, get information?

294
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:35,760
And then in her case, she probably also needs to work across and outside of health systems.

295
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,260
This is a public health person. She doesn't own any health systems.

296
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:53,159
She's not the governor and she's not the mayor. And yet you have to work across all of these things to put together a plan for how you're

297
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:59,460
going to take care of that community during something you don't know much about just yet.

298
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:09,040
So that is the context of your case. And what I'm hoping you learned there is to think about how to really get organized.

299
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:16,870
How she did. What would be your recommendations or advice when you think about what she did and how she did it?

300
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:23,320
What could we improve on now that we're a little bit past at least the time frame she was in?

301
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:30,040
And how do you bring that back into how we think about health care systems and organization and public health and

302
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,070
taking care of people and what our responsibility is to them and what we can and can't do and what can we pay for it?

303
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,650
How do we do it and how do you stand it up and take it out when the crisis is over?

304
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,439
Bless you. So that's part of this case, is to then work in teams.

305
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:55,120
You're assigned groups. You're going to get practice with these groups today and they will start working in these groups out in many cases in class.

306
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,290
But what I'm hoping to see with these is.

307
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,380
So I use that for I can use most of you see it.

308
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:17,160
So when we do a case, you'll have a title page.

309
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:26,540
Right. Like you do everything. What is this sentence? So you'll have the name of the case and you'll have the people on your team that participated.

310
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,050
So every name that was on your in your group should show up on the title page.

311
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:37,949
The date should be on the title page to write. These are just some basic things that you'll get good at when you do them over and over again.

312
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,670
But everybody should be able to see that on your deliverables.

313
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,770
So that's the title. Next thing should be your executive summary.

314
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:53,370
What's an executive summary? Yeah, an overview of it all.

315
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,460
Yeah, an overview of it all. How many pages should it be? One.

316
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:03,730
Why not just show some of those?

317
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,760
It's your very succinct, high impact.

318
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,000
This is what's in this report. Right.

319
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:17,040
And when we say executive, the reason we make things short and succinct is because a lot of our executives are really busy.

320
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,240
So if you only get a chance to read one page, that's the page.

321
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,110
And everything important ought to be in that range. Right.

322
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,350
So that's the next page. And then you will go into some backgrounds.

323
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,700
Here you are showcasing your knowledge about this case.

324
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,180
You're demonstrating that you know the details.

325
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:54,209
You're demonstrating that you have the context and you're shaping how you're going to think about your recommendations and the next stage.

326
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,720
This is of all cases that we'll do in this class.

327
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,860
But the next stage usually involves some analysis. How do you know?

328
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,350
You know, bring your bringing me along this path of how do we know?

329
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,890
So here's a little bit of background and then here's a little bit more data.

330
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,090
How we think about this is how we think about this. This is how something's trending.

331
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:27,309
Here's how we know and how we're putting something together, right? Next is recommendations or answers to specific questions that you're going to have

332
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:33,070
a response here that requires some action right up from your recommendations.

333
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,880
Depending on the case, there's usually another couple of things that you want to always have.

334
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:47,800
One of them is, how are you going to do this? So can you give me a visual and implementation plan?

335
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,129
Right. But big picture, one page on a Gantt chart or something like that.

336
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,320
Does everyone know it again? Some of us do.

337
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:02,670
It's basically. It's like a big timeline.

338
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:14,010
So whether this is one year, let's say it's five years or something like that, and then you have flames in here of what your big action items are.

339
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,360
This first one's going to take this amount of time. This one's going to take this amount of time.

340
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,890
You're going to show me overlay and duration visual.

341
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:34,740
Right. That's a beautiful tool to have and get good at is a one page implementation player so that I can see in one page all the big stuff,

342
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:42,360
how long you think it's going to take, which things can happen in parallel, or which things are sequential and dependent on each other.

343
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:47,160
And that's important, right? Here's a lasting here's how we end.

344
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,350
So some clues about how you're going to do the stuff you said you're going to do.

345
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,300
And then what happens if things don't go just exactly as you thought they would?

346
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,300
You have to think about that. Right.

347
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,710
So that's your risk and risk mitigation piece.

348
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,080
And you should think about that when you're putting together a deliverable. You can't predict the future.

349
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,020
You can do a great job putting a plan together.

350
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:23,470
But what we can do is start to think about all the things that could possibly go wrong and take us off track.

351
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,270
And what are we going to do about that? Right. What are we going to do about that?

352
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,280
So those are some other things you should have in a deliverable like this.

353
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:51,450
Things that are awesome to build into this and might show up in your summary, but also some of your details.

354
00:39:52,110 --> 00:40:00,600
How much time many people are we talking about to execute your plan?

355
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,970
Think about that. How many of you are involved in the case competitions?

356
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,820
How many? Show your hands real high, please. Okay. Does this idea sound familiar to you?

357
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,980
Yeah. It's the same format. It's the same format.

358
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:26,710
So the better you get at doing these things well, the better you're going to get at putting together deliverables in general.

359
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:34,959
I'll give you an example of a task I have that I haven't done zero on so far because my board asked me to do it yesterday morning.

360
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:43,300
So I've done what it's supposed to do and do nothing. And we do center certification, can't we?

361
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,750
Certified medical centers in the world about whether you should be able to do eczema or not.

362
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,890
Christine, like. How hard could that be? Just give me a plan.

363
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:59,420
Okay. That's can't be that hard. I mean, it's a big deal.

364
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,930
Well, just put together. I need to do that. I need to put together a plan.

365
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,780
I need to have a timeline. I need to have. What are our risks as an organization?

366
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,000
Can we be sued for that? Oh, yeah, absolutely.

367
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,900
So what are we going to do to anticipate the risk for that? Who's our partners?

368
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,920
How many is it's going to take? How many time? Who are the people that should lead this?

369
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,220
Do this? I have. That's my homework for this weekend.

370
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:28,550
So you guys will do stuff together, right? I'll do my little line of stuff to do yours, and I'll be really fun.

371
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:33,290
And I hope that what you put together by the 26th.

372
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:39,950
I think what's cool, there's a fourth grader test to your deliverable.

373
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,320
What's the fourth grader test you think you can afford?

374
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,390
Fourth interview in which they can.

375
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,620
A fourth grader and also what a fourth grader was will tell you is.

376
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:01,760
Whether it looks cool or not. Does it look cool?

377
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,160
Try to make it look cool. Try to make your visuals compelling.

378
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,280
Try to make it look like something someone would want to look at. And so fourth graders can help you, if you know any.

379
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:20,110
Go find them. And then something like, does a supporting link like this are a little bit more color?

380
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:30,140
No. Yes, I see that a little facetiously, but sometimes we get so caught up in the weeds and the details of what we're doing that we forget.

381
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,910
We all get really busy and it's hard to look at a lot of words.

382
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:41,450
If you put a lot of words in front of me, I thank you.

383
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,830
I'll get to it five years from now when I have time. And by that time it won't matter anymore.

384
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,530
Help me draw me. Every page should stand on its own.

385
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,549
Every page should be compelling. You have about 12 of them, I forget.

386
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:01,700
Exactly. Make sure we get the right number. But 10 to 12 pages to put together for your case.

387
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,170
That's it. Not 40, not 20, not 100.

388
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,569
It's a sense. So build in a lot of stuff.

389
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:17,870
Make it compelling. Do a nice job coalescing a lot of information into something that's pretty succinct.

390
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,500
Even so, at ten pages, it's a lot.

391
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:28,130
As the executive summary, yes. So do you want us to put data and visuals in the actual report?

392
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,560
And then at the end you can put more data into the appendix at the end.

393
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:40,850
When you do that, assume no one will ever read it. But how many of you want to go into consulting again?

394
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,149
There is something that consultants do and actually teams can and should do.

395
00:43:47,150 --> 00:44:00,410
And it sounds like this. What is that about?

396
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,990
Here's my report. Yes, I thought I did here.

397
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,229
But here's our standard certification plan. Here's the detail.

398
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,809
If anyone would like to look at the details,

399
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:17,180
there's 400 pages of the detailed reports where we looked at what the World Health Organization said about this.

400
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,530
We looked at the National Association of Medicine's recommendations around quality.

401
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:27,140
We reviewed every test on obedience paper papers in here. We use that to make the plan for unification.

402
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:31,640
And we looked at blah, blah, blah. Here's all of the data.

403
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,329
This is some test. It should make a sound.

404
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:43,070
When you drop the report on some of these tests, we don't really print things out anymore these days, but that is your test of credibility.

405
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,540
What studies did you read to prepare for that work,

406
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:59,680
which is based on how much expertise is layered into your plan so that we think actually the best thinkers we can find that work is done here.

407
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,740
It's in the ten pages and that's your thumb test.

408
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,309
So you can have a big factor in for anything big and complex that you do.

409
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:20,930
There ought to be one if you haven't read what the National Academy of Medicine says about quality and you're expected to put a report together on it,

410
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:27,589
go find out. Kaiser has a ton of stuff about what they're doing on climate.

411
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:34,190
There's no way you could read it all in 24 hours, so you had to focus and skim and think through it.

412
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,160
But just know that if you actually had that rule,

413
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:45,530
you would be working across the world and expertise related to climate change and what health systems can do, right?

414
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:54,680
So when we do our work, doing it based on the foundation of a lot of other people's thinking is really important to do.

415
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,890
I guess so. That's the first kind of general way out of all of our cases.

416
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,229
We will Eddie and I will be putting together the exact assignment and questions this weekend.

417
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,950
But you have your groups so you can start to get to know them today.

418
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:19,110
All right. We're going to zip through the lecture here really quickly because there's nothing important in here and go from there.

419
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,709
So when we talked about the first, I'm going to go through a few terms that some are important,

420
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,780
some not so much, some actually aren't used in real life.

421
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,600
And so they're in the textbook. It's a reference textbook.

422
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:40,969
But you are well, you're some of these terms yourself as you get into the weeds turns, you should know like really?

423
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,360
No, these are those terms.

424
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,260
How many is there anything on this list that you're unfamiliar with?

425
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:53,600
Heading into this course is your first year in graduate school on this topic.

426
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,350
Anything unfamiliar yet? Well, I don't think I've ever heard of Tyson.

427
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,340
Yeah. Yeah, you got good. Probably the only one that's most different.

428
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,270
Yeah, yeah, that's good. And. Yes. Which one? I know. The last four.

429
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:15,190
So less four things. Okay. Yeah. Mhm.

430
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:24,650
I know. But it this is good because there's a we have our own language when we talk about healthcare,

431
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,190
we have our own language for the finance side, you're probably getting familiar with that.

432
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,459
We have our own language for operations improvement.

433
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,440
We have our own language and acronyms for all the stuff we do because we try to make it easy.

434
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,479
But then if you talk to anyone five years from now, if you talk to anyone outside our industry,

435
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,200
like at a bar, just don't do it, you know, or make it real simple.

436
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,759
Like, we did some stuff today and we're hoping it make some patients better like that.

437
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,610
Okay, cool. I get that now.

438
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,700
Well, we developed the KPIs that we're going to use to do our own because we had a high priority area come up and then we're,

439
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,180
you know, we did a few Kaizen events on that and people are going to just think you're crazy.

440
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:11,150
Yeah. So in the book it explained that offices are just areas where organizations are hitting the words, yes, opportunities.

441
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:17,330
Right. Why in the world do we need that sort of return? We the reality is we don't.

442
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:23,960
Okay. So if you and actually some places brands how they go about doing this work.

443
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,920
The Cleveland Clinic has a team yet another activity.

444
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,190
We're very good to know this one. This is their improvement model and they have phases and it's color coded and they have icons and all that stuff.

445
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:42,229
And if you become part of the Cleveland Clinic system, you'll get familiar with these tools,

446
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:48,020
these icons and these colors, because they'll show up in all your deliverables where you're doing this kind of work.

447
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:55,880
So we don't use that term stuff much. Okay. And at the same time, we have to be careful and thoughtful in health care.

448
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:01,370
Not everything's a crisis, right? People die in our hospitals all the time.

449
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:07,069
They that's part of our work. It's not the outcome we hope for.

450
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:12,320
And at the same time for people that are really sick, if we can provide very.

451
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,180
Dignified human. Palliative care.

452
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:21,799
That's an enormous shift for people for their end of life.

453
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:27,950
Sometimes even better if we can do that at home with our loved ones around and not in a hospital with a bunch of blinking stuff.

454
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:34,550
But not everything's a crisis all the time. And yet, if someone dies and they shouldn't have.

455
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:41,260
And they shouldn't have. That can be an opportunity for improvement.

456
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:49,290
Want to share with you in case. Just to make this a little more real.

457
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:57,080
Not certain how many people are aware of this case.

458
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:02,620
Redondo Beach. Anyone heard of this woman?

459
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:15,550
You've heard of her? Do you remember this case? Yeah. She accidentally gave someone some kind of medication, and then she didn't know exactly where.

460
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,660
And the organization didn't like all the blame.

461
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:25,060
Almost all the blame fell on her. And you people take any accountability?

462
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:30,310
Yeah. So this is a nurse. This is in Nashville, Tennessee.

463
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,879
In her case. She was sentenced in March of 2022.

464
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,440
So that feels recent. But the issue at hand happened in 2017.

465
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:46,680
So this is a nurse that worked at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

466
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:59,380
She was the one that was sued, actually tried and convicted of murder for a patient she was taking care of at Vanderbilt University.

467
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:13,040
She did admit to administering a drug that was more than what the patient needed and led to that patient's death.

468
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:21,739
I didn't follow this case, but my experience hospital has all sorts of checks and balances for that kind of thing.

469
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:27,530
And any time there's a lawsuit for this kind of thing, they name everybody in the patient's care.

470
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,270
So the physician, the nurse, the hospital. Yes.

471
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:36,800
Now we're getting to something here with you all that are going into management of health care systems.

472
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:41,990
The more stuff you managed, the more responsible you are for the stuff you manage.

473
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:51,990
So if you're the nurse manager or let's say you're the chief nursing officer, why isn't the chief nursing officer?

474
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:56,930
The first year. Why isn't the CEO the person here?

475
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,740
Yeah. I remember this was like really controversial in the nursing world.

476
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,950
They just were, like, kind of talking about like the main arguments was that nursing nurses are already overburdened

477
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,479
and they're burnt out and they're the ones that are like taking the responsibility from this.

478
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,840
And it's kind of like impacting people who like, like nurses are like,

479
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,640
why would we go into this field if we're going to be the ones taking responsibility for this?

480
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:26,310
I guess I don't know the details of the case, but when I think about why so many high residents sitting there,

481
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,320
I think the only reason somebody hired would be sitting there is if there was a lack of training or lack of something else they were responsible for.

482
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:42,540
If this was just a one off like bad egg sort of incident where she made the mistake, then I think it's wrong that she's sitting there.

483
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,800
SE Like New York charges were too much. Also fair. Also fair.

484
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,100
That's not how these lawsuits work. But that's not how they work.

485
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:56,670
Right. Right. But yeah, I mean, I don't see any reason that doesn't require up once you have probable cause.

486
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:10,829
Like blacks in training. Yes. Oh, I might be getting the incidents mixed, but there was one where that issue wasn't that it was too much of the drug.

487
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:19,380
It was the wrong drug. And like the nurse bypassed the system in order to get that drug and they got in trouble for it.

488
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:26,579
But in that case, there was also like an out of a lot of outcry from nurses, like it was a mistake, which it was.

489
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:34,200
But the issue was that there were like guidelines in place for how to operate the medication cabinet

490
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:40,890
and they over roll that because it wasn't working properly and that's what led to the mistake.

491
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,440
These things happen all the time in healthcare.

492
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:54,240
So we have on a few sides prior a few terms that look kind of like some nice acronyms that talk about opportunities for improvement and Kaizen events,

493
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,580
which probably somewhere on the unit where this happened,

494
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,860
they might have done a Kaizen event, which is a way to get the whole team in the room and rapidly say,

495
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:06,360
What happened here and what are we going to do process wise to make sure that never happens again?

496
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,890
Those kinds of checks and balances, but also at health care systems,

497
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,680
your drug cabinet thing that is supposed to be super fancy and you can scan the patient's

498
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,879
code in and you can scan your code in as the nurse and get the drug out and document

499
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,380
that you've taken the drug out of the system and then someone will restock it and then

500
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,810
you administer at the bedside based on the exact dosage that was ordered in your E.R.

501
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,160
So all of these things map up any part of that. Technology breaks down.

502
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,790
Your people still have to do stuff.

503
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:47,250
They still have to treat the patient coding in room seven. They still have to administer their drugs in time based on what the plan is.

504
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:55,260
And so we do these workarounds all the time. And part of your job is, well, it's the whole thing.

505
00:54:55,830 --> 00:55:03,720
Okay, so we'll go through the whole system, but you have to have systems set up so people, any person, once they walk onto your property,

506
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:10,170
if you're in a health system, you can deliver safe care for every patient that walks on your property.

507
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:15,430
And so we'll try to talk about what happens when that doesn't work.

508
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,620
That's going to happen, too. And then this review will come in.

509
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:26,770
And whether your health system is in this article or you are sitting in here besides

510
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:33,640
this staff system that you hired will be the difference on how well you did your job.

511
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:42,079
Yeah. They got to talking to this one because, you know, I'm coming from a nursing background,

512
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:50,180
but I can tell that like they they have so much rules, regulation, procedure, policies, everything on place.

513
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,620
And, you know, when they hire, they make you sign like, okay, I'm signing this, this, this.

514
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,130
If you don't sign you, they don't hire. And then when they're it's like, yes,

515
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:07,610
you cannot give care to the person when it is not safe or there are not enough that but like two of them colleagues, they don't have work on you.

516
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,770
You cannot leave your task and go.

517
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:16,910
So, you know, some time it is two months and something incident happened like this because they all expect you to do best.

518
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:23,040
So it falls back on the the nurses and the for liability and unethical for people that love.

519
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,740
But then nobody back you off if any incident happened, that is the reality of them.

520
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,670
So now we're starting to make all these little words and charts and stuff real,

521
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,380
like this is what management looks like, this is what health systems look like.

522
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,300
That is what it looks like and feels like. Yes. Yeah.

523
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:45,110
In my previous role, I worked in a pediatric clinic and we had vaccines for childhood immunizations.

524
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:50,840
Yeah. And obviously after COVID 19, everybody was behind on childhood immunization.

525
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:54,620
So we had a lot of volume in that sense. But there's also staffing issues.

526
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,040
So we had medical assistance and nurses in and out, right?

527
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,060
And so that opened a lot of room for error.

528
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:05,540
We had missed administrations and we'd had to do all the reporting appointments with the CDC and all that good stuff.

529
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:09,620
But we had processes in place, we had trading system in place.

530
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:15,170
We even made it like a two, two person polling system where we had two sets of eyes on everything being removed from it,

531
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,830
but there was always room for human error. So I'd be like, no matter what process you have, people will make mistakes.

532
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:27,170
And it's okay, but not okay when it's something to this extent, of course.

533
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:34,970
Yeah, yeah. No. People will always make mistakes. Your job is to set up processes, policies, procedures, how people sign stuff.

534
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:40,430
People ought to read what you're signing, by the way, because you are then responsible for what you signed.

535
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:45,290
So maybe including all of you that accept a job offer next year,

536
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:51,979
you ought to read what the contract says because there's stuff in there about what your obligation is to the

537
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:58,670
organization and what your rights are as an employee and what you don't have a right to as an employee.

538
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:07,910
So your job getting into health care leadership, health care management is to create these systems to protect the people,

539
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:13,069
your staff, patients you serve, your kids you hired to take care of everybody.

540
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:19,070
They're in every way from environmental services and how well you clean a room after a patient's

541
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:23,660
left so they don't get a hospital acquired infection from a patient who was there before you.

542
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:31,340
Big job seems simple, but very important to do well and communication and all of these things.

543
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,000
So let's go back to the slide deck and see if we can make something boring.

544
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:39,940
Let's move it. Okay.

545
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:52,850
Going back up to basic terms. So just we will use some of these terms, this term, Lean Six Sigma is a term that I mentioned in our first lecture.

546
00:58:53,260 --> 00:59:02,920
What did I say about that term? It's great until something like a pandemic comes around.

547
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,190
We want efficiency.

548
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:12,940
If you want efficiency in our system, we want to make maximum use of all the stuff that we have because the stuff we have is really expensive, right?

549
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,440
To build a new tower, that one that's almost $1,000,000,000.

550
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:24,520
The one just around the corner here, that's in the steel structure phase.

551
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:28,900
So we've Six Sigma, we've done a great job. We this is us.

552
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:34,240
We in health care, people in management roles, in leadership roles have been driving efficiency,

553
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:41,170
you know, toward more efficiency, has been driving waste out of the system for 50, 60 years.

554
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,040
We have a very efficient system. So what we've learned during this pandemic is we need to also be able to efficiently

555
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,870
scale up and scale back down when we have big demands for our services.

556
00:59:54,790 --> 01:00:00,730
We'll get into more of these terms. But I'm just trying to help you kind of see a little bit what we do here.

557
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,199
Criteria for providing excellence in patient care.

558
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:10,420
That's something we should all hold ourselves. To trying to achieve that.

559
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:15,100
Right. And what does excellence mean and what does excellence look like and feel like for people?

560
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,860
So there's some terms here, but doing this work is is our life's work, right?

561
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:25,080
Making sure care is safe. How do you hire somebody?

562
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:30,270
How do you know they're any good? What kind of review process do you have?

563
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,200
How do you do credentialing? That gets to safety.

564
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,390
How do we think about effective and what's effective? My view.

565
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,300
What's effective from the patient's view? Well.

566
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:57,210
Timely. This is timely, actually, even me. If I get a call that my mammograms that I just had actually looks like there's something there.

567
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:07,860
Timely to me means something different than it does to the clerk that it's registering me for a biopsy.

568
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:15,179
And we have to think about timely the different definitions based on the different stakeholders we have.

569
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:20,490
Here's a little map. I've gotten out of chapter one just looking at stakeholders.

570
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:27,240
This is tough. We've got a lot of different stakeholders to align here, and it's hard to get alignment.

571
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:34,860
But that will also be some of your work in health care management and leadership is to think about the very different points of view.

572
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:41,460
Timeliness to me as a patient that may be or maybe not has cancer.

573
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:48,189
Looks and feels different than it does to you as a person.

574
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:57,370
Scheduling a biopsy at a clinic does to a cancer physician and breast cancer specialists that has a schedule to get through.

575
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,260
Those are all the different. What about the AMA?

576
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,490
I've got 40 people sitting in the waiting room here.

577
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,740
Okay, I'm going to check this one in and get the weight and vital signs and get that in the system.

578
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,700
It's this way. You're here today. Make sure you've got that and then get you in there.

579
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,880
Good reminder. The next one, timeliness for that person.

580
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:20,980
These are all layers in our health system of people and stakeholders.

581
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:29,770
And how do we align incentives to help make them all feel good about what goes on here from the patient's perspective?

582
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:35,000
From your environmental services perspective, are you proud of the space that you have?

583
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:39,170
What if you're not proud of the space that you have and the job that you have?

584
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,930
How do you negotiate a new contract with your nursing union,

585
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:58,000
which can medicine just enforce right your job wherever you sit in health care, you need to know about this.

586
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:06,250
You need to know this because you need to have some kind of alignment in here that starts to make sense this way.

587
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:13,160
And that way. And this way. And that way. Your board will have a different perspective altogether.

588
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:22,490
On the metrics that you hold yourself accountable to and what they're interested in, what they want to see reported, how the health of our community.

589
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:26,210
Well, how are we doing financially? Well, okay.

590
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,420
Yes, we need to negotiate the contract with the nurses, but we can't afford to keep paying them what we did.

591
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:37,130
So what did you get out of that contract? Can we afford it?

592
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:50,600
How much turnover do we have? These are some of the questions that employers will be asking about stakeholder alignment.

593
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:54,890
Know, first and foremost, know who the stakeholders are first and next.

594
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:57,559
What kind of organization are you?

595
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,080
And I'm going to ask that question so you can start to think about the different kinds of health care organizations we have in this country.

596
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,520
We went through that last question. If you're a nonprofit.

597
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:15,630
You might think differently about your success measures, or do you?

598
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:27,840
Or do you? What's the difference between how Michigan Medicine plans their budget and their success measures?

599
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:33,330
Verses Centennial and Nashville.

600
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:36,750
Very close to HCA headquarters and an HCA hospital.

601
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,590
And for carrying out the missions of charity care.

602
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:48,330
They providing services for every community so that a little later they're providing services for people in need.

603
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,950
So mostly charity care. But how do you carry out the mission?

604
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:58,950
It's a financial institution. So if I'm Michigan Medicine.

605
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,360
Do I do any planning differently than I do at Centennial?

606
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:14,799
Yes. What do you do? What do I do? You have to make enough money on the services that are being paid for it to know that you can pay for

607
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,330
services that ultimately can't be paid for by patients or insurance companies because they don't.

608
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:28,140
Well, I think Michigan Medicine, an academic medical center, also has the research and the education behind that.

609
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,879
They do. And those are things that don't always make money.

610
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:37,120
And like we talked about in our IFB class this week, you need to make sure that you're like philanthropy and you're like clinical,

611
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:41,380
are able to fund those things that are part of your mission, more like the HCA.

612
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:46,419
They're going to be like more driven towards profits and like informing their stakeholders,

613
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:52,490
sort of like and like making sure they have profits or let's not mention Amazon's like goal.

614
01:05:52,870 --> 01:06:02,050
You're getting at something, but at a foundational level, I would argue that maybe it's not so difference between the two at the end of the day.

615
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:17,020
But let's take a look here first and how things are going for HCA right now, and I'm sure you can use it.

616
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,790
Look, here's HCA.

617
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,990
This is something they'll look at that Michigan medicine will not look at, and that is the price of their stock.

618
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:37,450
How is it valued and how is it tracking?

619
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:47,490
It makes you think a little bit differently because your first commitment as a for profit system is to your shareholders.

620
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:57,379
If you're non-for-profit, it's to your board, which is supposed to reflect the community you serve,

621
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:02,030
which is supposed to have an obligation to provide a certain amount of community benefits.

622
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:10,770
And yet that ACA if you don't do what Lauren was suggesting, provide service, think about financial,

623
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:16,110
what you can afford and how you're going to subsidize some things if you don't do that.

624
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,680
How are you doing here? I just want to point out that that stock price is a lot different than your profitability.

625
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,030
Oh, yes, this isn't profitability, but this is a success measure.

626
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:33,930
And the people that are driving the question about whether there's value here in the people you owe your report to if you're the CEO.

627
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:39,130
This is a measure of the CEO's success or not.

628
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,580
My point is you can be not profitable for sure.

629
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:47,120
Rising stock price. Yes, you can be not profitable. You just have to be relevant.

630
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:54,190
You have to inspire confidence in your investors that you're within range, that you're worth investing in.

631
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,270
Because what your job is here is to make money for shareholder value.

632
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:03,460
And so as long as people can keep doing that and you drive the value up, you're good.

633
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,210
It's not profitability, nor is it profitability in a non profit.

634
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:17,810
But nonprofit and for profit don't mean no, because you still have to be financially viable at the end of the day.

635
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:25,430
And there are some tools we'll go into when we get into capital planning that are at your disposal if you need to do something big.

636
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:32,720
But if you're not in good shape, that you don't have access to those and you can't do big projects,

637
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:37,960
not just buildings, but also recruiting top people to place.

638
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:45,370
Okay. So just a couple more things here to pull out on our lecture.

639
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:52,630
I wanted to share a few other things about the complexity of these health systems that you'll be walking into.

640
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,020
Here's an alternate to the University of New Mexico.

641
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,639
This is not a major health system in the US, but it's a health system.

642
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,430
And you can see that there's the health system side over here.

643
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:10,060
If they're clinical partners, these are all kind of private entities that all have a role with the University of New Mexico,

644
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:13,240
and they all have their own businesses to run, but they're part of your entity, too.

645
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,410
You have the academic side, you have research.

646
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:21,700
That's one health system that's not very big and not very complicated.

647
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,770
Here's one that's a little bigger ascension, not the biggest.

648
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:34,450
It's not for profit, but they have 125 for profit subsidiaries.

649
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:39,940
They have lots of hospitals, and they're a fairly large system.

650
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:50,140
You may find yourself in here somewhere, like you might be that over here of 20, 50,000 people.

651
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:58,360
Right. That's a big system. You need to know how it works, who you're reporting to, what they're interested in,

652
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,990
how they hold themselves accountable and what success looks like they're.

653
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:12,070
Two of our best systems in the United States of America, Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic.

654
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:16,960
Here's a map of where they are. They're not in Cleveland.

655
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:26,030
Only. And they're not in Rochester, Minnesota. And increasingly, they're not just in the United States of America.

656
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:32,810
Right. Last year, Cleveland Clinic opened their hospital in London when they've been planning for a long time.

657
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,530
Years ago, they opened one in Abu Dhabi.

658
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:44,810
Abu Dhabi. And. So they're becoming intentionally, I would say, global.

659
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:52,370
They're picking very specifically where to be. So Abu Dhabi is not a resource constraints area.

660
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:59,680
And how they do that also matters in terms of creating systems and yet in terms of number one,

661
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:07,040
number two top ranked systems in the US often fight for those two top spots,

662
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:14,120
at least as determined by the U.S. News and World Report, which we look at because your brand, your reputation matters.

663
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:21,260
This is a point of comment in the context of climate change. That Abu Dhabi facility is 100% zero carbon footprint.

664
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:26,160
There are some amazing things that they have done.

665
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:34,400
I am not being critical at all. And actually I would I'll often point to the Cleveland Clinic as a model of how to do things well.

666
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:41,960
This is a well-written book. It's a good idea of how to do things well if you haven't done anything like this.

667
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:45,780
The other thing I would say about the Cleveland Clinic and how they create systems.

668
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,940
How many of you know Toby Cosgrove is?

669
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:56,180
He's the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, now retired, but was for a long time.

670
01:11:56,570 --> 01:12:03,890
When I was working with Toby on a new area for him, he's like, okay, Christine, here's your patient selection.

671
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:16,320
They're quite old. But yes, you have five different colors of white that you can pick from for your accent, colors for the interior of the space.

672
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,270
Yes. Thank you. Different times. Thank you.

673
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:29,370
What Toby did was make sure that things not just operate the same when you walk into a Cleveland Clinic facility.

674
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:36,430
They look and feel the same. Not something Henry Ford has done that's been critical of Henry Ford.

675
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:41,110
They've done some great things. But when they acquire a hospital and put a Henry Ford sign up.

676
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:47,280
What they haven't done is make sure that system this is there to the degree that we can access.

677
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:57,700
What Cleveland Clinic also did to stand up the Abu Dhabi Hospital was say you and you and you and find Abu Dhabi,

678
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:06,580
and you're going to be there because you know the Cleveland Clinic way and you are going to create the Cleveland Clinic way in Abu Dhabi.

679
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,140
And they're CEO now. Tom went and did that.

680
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:19,660
So they're doing some amazing things very well. I'm not being critical and to showcasing different things,

681
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:25,629
but the five shades of white that you can pick from are because Tobi, with a team of people there,

682
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:30,130
thought it was important that when you're in a hospital you can see the walls are clean,

683
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:36,610
you see the ceilings, and if you think about being a patient, mostly what you're looking at.

684
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:43,240
If a ceiling tiles this one like I don't even want to know.

685
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,050
But mostly you look at the ceiling. Right.

686
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:52,420
And so the walls that you look at, the floor that you look at, if things are grayish brown,

687
01:13:52,930 --> 01:14:01,030
has also because that means as if I'm not sweeping my computer, I've got things to do for more rooms to get to and no one's even going to know.

688
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:04,450
But if my floors are white, you're going to know.

689
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:13,670
Going to know if the last patient bled out and there's blood and vomit and all kinds of stuff on the walls and the tubing that come off the wall.

690
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:20,690
What she says happened. Health care. You should know that someone has to clean it because you can see it if it's still there.

691
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:29,209
So by design in a hospital, Toby thought it might be important that things look clean.

692
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:38,360
And actually everybody can see that they're clean. So that's a good example and minutia, but a tactical way of how that matters.

693
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:46,549
Innovation in health care. I want to go through this real quickly here so we can get a sense for where that's happening,

694
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:52,900
how many people how many people read the Obamacare legislation and a lot of it.

695
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:57,170
Okay. I just like doing like I'm doing with this one kind of like law.

696
01:14:57,170 --> 01:15:04,069
And I read there's a guy, Emanuel, that was largely responsible for it.

697
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:06,440
And I read a lot of stuff that he wrote about. Right.

698
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:13,040
He actually wrote a cartoon about the legislation, which is brilliant and a good way to kind of go through the details.

699
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:19,100
One thing that came out of Obamacare is the Centers for Medicaid, Medicare Innovation.

700
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:22,850
And this map shows you where innovation is happening.

701
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:26,739
But I wanted to give you a look of today's. Version.

702
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:30,340
This is CMS. So this did not exist before Obamacare.

703
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:35,480
One of the payer innovations that Obamacare achieved.

704
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:37,270
Remember, we talked about that last lecture.

705
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:46,870
Payer was the target of Obamacare innovation and it could reject people access to insurance before Obamacare.

706
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:53,890
You can't now, but also we wanted to make payers more the game.

707
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:59,840
We wanted to make health systems more in the game. And so now we have a bunch of new terms and new acronyms to learn, like Axios.

708
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:06,860
How many of you are familiar with Axios? How are we doing with CEOs these days?

709
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:11,240
We've saved a little bit of money, was not very effective.

710
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:18,860
And part of the reason and part of why we're in this next wave of ACOs is that you could do one sided risk versus two sided risk.

711
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:24,360
So we'll talk about what that means. But basically, you could say I'm pretty sure, yes,

712
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,540
we could save from what we did last year in our Medicare patients and as long as we actually did that.

713
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:35,980
Right. Or you could say, I'm pretty sure we'll deliver on our quality side of things.

714
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,330
And as long as you did that. You were pretty good.

715
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:44,490
The idea is you're more cost effective without compromising quality.

716
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:49,860
This version. Now you're at risk for both sides and you have to pick.

717
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:55,250
If you don't deliver, you actually owe the government money back. So it's gotten a little bit more sophisticated.

718
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,430
But when you get time after class today,

719
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:08,570
there are five pages of different kinds of innovative ways to deliver care and go sign an agreement with the MFI,

720
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:15,420
the Medicare or Medicaid side of things. You can do better and make more money if you actually do better.

721
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:24,410
But there are a lot of options now, a plethora of options in terms of what tools we have available to us to deliver care better today.

722
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:29,990
It's more complicated, but there's more options and governments working with us now.

723
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:35,510
So those of you interested in policy, these are all because of policy.

724
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,560
Right. So that's that's good news.

725
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,020
And this is kind of another way of viewing this.

726
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:50,940
That same chart about all the different kinds of innovative models that are happening around the U.S. today.

727
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:55,110
And you can see some probably bigger bubbles than you'd expect.

728
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:02,399
Even stands out here in particular, I would say about how and they're aggressively going after some change,

729
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:06,980
but they're kind of always have some things there to think about.

730
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,600
Some things skip around here a little bit to talk about.

731
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:17,820
What I mean we'll get you should read these three chapters for sure.

732
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:25,110
But I want to get into a little bit more on how we do our work and what's going on so that

733
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,650
when you think about the tools you have to learn about the systems you have to learn about,

734
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:34,170
we're thinking along the same lines. Yeah. So this might be, I don't know, ahead of.

735
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:42,220
Yes. Where you are right now. In chapter two of the book, there was a graph that I've probably seen, I don't know, 50 times.

736
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,060
Yes. I started the merger here. It breaks down health care expenditures by health care sectors.

737
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:50,280
Right. So it's got hospitals. Yes. Prescriptions, everything else.

738
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:57,540
I don't think it ever quite hit me that everything is pulled out of hospitals that I can think

739
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:02,040
of by the time that you look at the 34% that hospitals make up as far as expenditures go.

740
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:15,340
So I was curious what makes up that category like when we're looking at 34% of hospitals, 27% physicians, I don't know, 8% prescriptions or reasons.

741
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,459
14 And then all the other ones are really small, like public health and everything else and equipment and everything else.

742
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:24,180
So like all the stuff that's pulled out of hospitals that professional costs,

743
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,900
equipment, all of that, and then in hospitals it's still the biggest section.

744
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:32,800
Yeah, because so this gets to the health care finance movement.

745
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:40,530
So one of the things you there's two things you get to charge of a patient is getting care at your facility average for medicine,

746
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:45,389
one is professional fees, one is facility facility fees.

747
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:50,700
But capital is also this is just capital and equipment are both pulled out on that graph.

748
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:57,270
So it's like this hospital equipment is different. The facility, how much does the hospital cost to build and how are you going to recoup it?

749
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,440
Yeah, I mean, capital was out there. It's a different percentage.

750
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:08,100
It's there is a little bit of semantics, I think, in terms of how we're accounting for different things.

751
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:13,910
But the physician side of things, you're right, the physician side there is physicians in general.

752
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:21,419
It's that professional fees component. When you're charging the fee professional side, that all goes to your physicians and staff.

753
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:24,420
And depending on how you contracted with each one,

754
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:32,249
you have very few employed physicians in most health systems and even less depending on how you're organized.

755
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:40,830
They're all according to like Michigan Medicine. They're all under the Michigan umbrella that's different than systems down the street.

756
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,740
And so those those vary, too.

757
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:51,989
But your facility costs are where you get to build in your staff, your environmental services, all the people and things,

758
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:59,970
your i.t system, your infrastructure, your data security system, your all of that stuff as part of your facility fees.

759
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:04,469
And you also have to account for the time value of money that's in a bunch of money upfront.

760
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:09,570
So fire and build all that stuff out of that and the cost of interest and everything else.

761
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,129
Evidence to bonds like that. It's the finances.

762
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:19,890
It's kind of a fun exercise. And if you if how many of you done research ever have you gotten a grant?

763
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:28,820
What's the grant? Indirect expense amount that your institution expects to do with that grant, you know?

764
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:39,050
It's an issue. So if you get an R1 grant from the NIH and you conduct research, you're getting at what we build into some of these costs.

765
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:45,760
What Michigan expects is 66% of your award will go to them, as in Durex,

766
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:54,770
which is just a way for charging for all the stuff that Michigan or any academic medical center puts in place for you to do cool stuff.

767
01:21:55,610 --> 01:22:01,040
Like if you have all the different tools to do research, centrifuge, cellular, molecular kind of stuff,

768
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:08,810
but also safe big places with vaccines to clear out chemicals and all that stuff so no one gets hurt conducting your research.

769
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,830
Those are indirect. Somebody pays for that. Someone builds that building.

770
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,400
And that's then what analysts expect.

771
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:20,030
So you just got a $5 million grant. Fantastic.

772
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:29,450
We're going to just take 66% of that back to the university that you work at to pay for all the stuff that we also give you here.

773
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:40,059
So, yes, there's a lot of hospitals are still a very expensive piece,

774
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:43,660
but it's a lot of the built environment and the kind of their version of insurance.

775
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:48,940
But that's how we staff and that's how we create space places or not to deliver care.

776
01:22:50,290 --> 01:22:54,549
So learning health systems is another term you should think about.

777
01:22:54,550 --> 01:23:03,010
And this gets to what do you think? Most systems aren't touting themselves as a learning health system, but some are.

778
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:08,560
And so what would you say about that? What's the difference, do you think?

779
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:13,479
How do you distinguish yourself as a learning health system or residency program?

780
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:27,520
And trained physicians actually can be. It's not academic, not informing your practice by experience and evidence based.

781
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:33,690
Yeah. So you you take extra steps to make sure you are benchmarking yourselves and you

782
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:39,130
are looking for evidence and you're incorporating that routinely into practice.

783
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:42,840
There's new articles that are produced every day.

784
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:46,570
That's the latest greatest research outcomes findings.

785
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:51,370
How are you as an organization incorporating that into your protocols?

786
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,790
So when you say you're a learning health system,

787
01:23:54,790 --> 01:24:00,640
you're making a distinction among yourself that you're committed to having the latest and greatest data.

788
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,340
You're always looking at it. You benchmark yourself and you keep moving forward.

789
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:15,670
Continuous improvement. I mean, yes, but no, because like insurance would not cover something that's not on emphasis.

790
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:27,190
So there are standards of care that usually some are evidence based.

791
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,600
Asthma, which my organization provides, is not evidence based.

792
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:37,120
And it's the highest one of the highest reimbursed items in the United States.

793
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:43,910
Okay. So a couple other things real quick and then we'll take a break.

794
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:50,150
One is, you know this we've talked about this before, but in terms of what are some of our biggest issues,

795
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:54,110
but also how do you get to quality improvement in those kinds of things?

796
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:58,760
I wanted to highlight this article from the Wall Street Journal from a few years ago.

797
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:06,410
And the situation here is there is a health system. This is in Wisconsin who basically was losing a contract from a payer.

798
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:10,130
You're out of network, you cost too much.

799
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:15,469
And so the leadership of that health system gets the heads up, that holy cow,

800
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:19,100
they're cutting us out of, let's say, our equivalent of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.

801
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:22,550
So all of the people here that have Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,

802
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,860
you're now out of network and they can't go to you anymore because you cost too much.

803
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:31,639
And so they're like, how, how? How could you say that?

804
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:39,530
And then how do we benchmark? And then how do we even know how much it costs for us to do in this case, knee surgeries.

805
01:25:40,730 --> 01:25:47,450
You get a chance to read this article. You should, because if you get a chance to work in health care, you ought to be doing more of this.

806
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:54,140
This is represented in this book. Our costs of care are crazy.

807
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:58,850
We talked about that last lecture. I keep talking about that because it's not going away, too.

808
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:09,350
But what they did was try to figure out what it cost there for this surgery and why those of you

809
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:14,190
that go into consulting some of the advice you might provide your clients might look like this.

810
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:22,070
I'm not saying it would, but it might possibly look like this. Let's take a look at your cost sheet for all the stuff you do.

811
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:26,810
You go negotiate with payers. When was the last time you updated your call sheet?

812
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:30,560
Oh, ten years ago. You know what? We're going to help you.

813
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:35,180
And we're just kind of put a little multiplier here on the scoresheet,

814
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:39,080
and then we'll reproduce your cost for you, and then you can go negotiate on that.

815
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:46,610
What number do you think we should do? Oh, 100%, yes. We're just going to put a multiplier in there of 100% on all the items.

816
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:51,140
So nothing called the multiplier.

817
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:56,540
And now you can take the car seat to go negotiate with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan to say your costs have gone up.

818
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:59,350
Clearly, you can see that because here it is on an issue.

819
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:07,790
And that's about the level of depth that some systems, many health systems have done to understand how much it costs.

820
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:15,650
These guys did it different and they send somebody in this person to go to the O.R. and look at all the stuff,

821
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:23,210
how much stuff they use for knee surgery, how many vendors are involved, how many people are involved?

822
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:28,010
How much does that cost? Do we have a priceless anywhere for this knee implant?

823
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:38,100
Anybody know? Okay, how many? And they were able to reduce their costs quite a bit in just a handful of months because they did the detailed work.

824
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:45,390
If you're a consultant, this is the kind of stuff you're going to do if you're on a project improvement team in a health system.

825
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:52,140
This is the kind of stuff you ought to do if you're in leadership and finance and strategy and operations.

826
01:27:52,440 --> 01:28:00,630
This is the kind of stuff you ought to do. You should know how much it actually costs you to do something.

827
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:04,770
Because what I would say is right now, we really don't know.

828
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,330
We really don't know.

829
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:15,480
I thought that this article brought up really good point about the importance of time, not only supplies, but what operating room time costs.

830
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:22,490
I know that like in this article they mentioned utilizing the same person to help set up the patient surgery.

831
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:28,230
That's something that I did at Michigan Medicine and something that you don't realize how much

832
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:36,270
15 minutes can make a difference over the course of the physician's tenure at of that situation.

833
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:39,300
And yet that can justify entire people's jobs.

834
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:46,470
Absolutely. Yeah. Speaking of that, when you think about resources, when when I watched the surgery, is that a robot?

835
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:48,170
Yeah. Let me go. Yeah.

836
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:55,200
And so I knew that a lot of the orthopedic surgeons there were arguing over the amount that they could use to make up complaint.

837
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:59,940
They only had one at the hospital and the hospital ended up buying a new one because

838
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:04,649
they just needed more people to do or more machines to do the knee surgeries.

839
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:08,340
Because for cardiology, you can only use the summit go.

840
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:15,390
So I thought that was really interesting that it's not only time and over time, but it's the equipment for like $1,000,000 robot that you can use.

841
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,860
Yeah, yeah. There's so many expensive things that go into an hour.

842
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,360
It's your most expensive space to run in any house.

843
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:30,390
Inpatient or outpatient doesn't matter. But million dollar robots are a dime a dozen people.

844
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:34,440
And how many people? How many people are doing any? Ah, depends on the kind of surgery.

845
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:41,340
But if you're doing, let's say, a cabbage, you know, cardiac bypass surgery, you probably have 15 people in that room.

846
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,500
Every one of them makes six figures.

847
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:53,810
Some of the challenges in these situations is you have sales reps coming in from device manufacturers like to make a robot or something.

848
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:58,460
Do you really need a robot to do a knee surgery? No, we've been doing them for 50 plus.

849
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:03,180
Maybe. Maybe not. You will analyze these device reps, going to tell you.

850
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:08,150
You do. They're going to say they're going to convince the physician that they need it because of this clinical data.

851
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:12,589
Yes. And the clinician will go and lobby against what the administrators and the administrators

852
01:30:12,590 --> 01:30:17,479
have to make a decision to use this phone cement that's been used forever,

853
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:22,700
or this fancy new stuff that shows, you know, fewer recurrences of infections.

854
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:26,170
We'll get into that. Actually, you'll be doing that work.

855
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:35,880
You'll be calculating the difference between a fancy robot, why you would ever use one, or just slice the damn thing open and let's get at it.

856
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:39,340
You know, like, you will do that.

857
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:41,319
We're not just in this class.

858
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:47,590
You'll have to do it in real life because there's always going to be a fancy new thing and you're going to have to justify you if

859
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:53,440
you're in health care management somewhere are going to have to do the math and you're going to have to look at actual evidence.

860
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:57,370
What's published? Do outcomes improve? Not the sales pitch.

861
01:30:57,370 --> 01:31:03,040
Thank you for all your material sales person Jones, but I need to go now,

862
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,050
do some homework and see if this is a real thing that we have actual evidence to support.

863
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:12,879
So you'll have to do that work. But they'll argue with less incision.

864
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:18,040
Space means less chance for infection means shorter recovery means less days at your facility.

865
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,790
If you can take a day out of somebody, some patients length of stay.

866
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:29,420
You've got your business case right there. That you will get good at in management.

867
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:37,970
Okay. Let's take a break and then you are going to get a chance to do so many cases based on the responses and we'll see how you do.

868
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:45,260
All right. Let's come back at 1045 and then we'll have an hour to do this work together.

869
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:51,737
So if you can't get can't get rid of me, I gonna say which one.

870
01:31:52,733 --> 01:31:59,273
Oh, it's like, here are your groups or we have ten graphics, your groups in your case.

871
01:31:59,273 --> 01:32:07,843
It'll also be your group for this next exercise. So it's one thing I'll say about you, I hear.

872
01:32:08,543 --> 01:32:19,613
There's challenges working with groups. Think of it this way you are interviewing for your job with your peers based on how you work with your group.

873
01:32:20,963 --> 01:32:26,393
Because five years from now and ten years from now, the people that are here,

874
01:32:26,453 --> 01:32:32,032
all of your cohort will know you very well and they'll know how you worked with them in

875
01:32:32,033 --> 01:32:36,203
your groups and they'll know how you were as a colleague at the University of Michigan,

876
01:32:37,393 --> 01:32:44,632
etc. But just think about how you act with your group and think about it like interviewing for your

877
01:32:44,633 --> 01:32:51,803
jobs for the next 40 years because some of you are going to have a job opportunity five years now,

878
01:32:51,803 --> 01:32:56,453
ten years from now. And some of you are going to when you think about that job opportunity and say,

879
01:32:57,113 --> 01:33:00,743
holy cow, we have an opening for this strategic head of strategic planning.

880
01:33:01,403 --> 01:33:04,583
It would be so cool to work with so-and-so. I love them.

881
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:06,383
What the heck are they doing? I'm reaching out to them.

882
01:33:07,493 --> 01:33:15,293
If things went well here, if they didn't go so well, maybe they don't have that thought about you in their head or you have.

883
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:24,113
So just no pressure. But think about that as you approach group work here at the University of Michigan, these are your group assignments.

884
01:33:24,653 --> 01:33:31,222
So find your where your name is with your group. Group a representative from groups one and two.

885
01:33:31,223 --> 01:33:38,183
Come and pick up. This case and then go work in a little coalesced somewhere.

886
01:33:38,633 --> 01:33:44,363
You'll have 10 minutes to put together what you want to say about this case, your approach,

887
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:49,522
and during that 10 minutes, you need to determine what you're going to say.

888
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:54,713
And then you're going to your whole group come up here and present that group one first,

889
01:33:54,833 --> 01:34:00,233
then group two, three, four, etc. So group, why don't you have the same case?

890
01:34:00,893 --> 01:34:06,263
Group three and four have the same case, etc. So go.

891
01:34:06,263 --> 01:34:10,493
We will start it at 11 a.m. on presentation.

892
01:34:13,373 --> 01:34:26,593
Actually, I'm going to stay here. Thank you. Know, I just going to say this in the rehearsal six right here for you.

893
01:34:28,013 --> 01:34:50,303
Yeah, that's right. And I'm here to tell 36 you because I know every day you try to do some sort of work.

894
01:34:51,623 --> 01:34:58,773
Where is everyone else? I need to meet like a number of other guys.

895
01:35:00,423 --> 01:35:18,843
I was going to say this group and I'm all for harmonization.

896
01:35:23,193 --> 01:35:28,102
I love to see the large democratic society.

897
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:33,833
Yes, you are on them. Okay. Well. But thing.

898
01:35:34,733 --> 01:35:43,223
I think you're just gonna call like that. Oh, yeah.

899
01:35:43,383 --> 01:35:51,973
Oh, I can't make it, baby.

900
01:35:55,473 --> 01:36:15,973
You know, over the world. No, no, no, no.

901
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:31,293
It was just my agent.

902
01:36:31,803 --> 01:36:39,513
What are you saying?

903
01:36:39,543 --> 01:37:16,973
You know, like, I think you're right on the ability to get really goes up there, and she's like, you know, we're not being like in there.

904
01:37:19,023 --> 01:37:28,023
We are a senior member state after the state is concerned because again,

905
01:37:30,543 --> 01:37:57,873
one of the partnership things like how we evaluate our kids are I feel like he was more than just like we can do this, you know?

906
01:37:58,503 --> 01:38:07,673
Yeah, yeah, right, right, right.

907
01:38:09,093 --> 01:38:42,423
Yeah. I mean, there's plenty of things like the right wing around how I feel like I mean,

908
01:38:42,523 --> 01:39:08,883
are they ready for high end intelligence agents also needs to have an underground area.

909
01:39:09,153 --> 01:39:13,263
So say the same thing since we were kids.

910
01:39:14,883 --> 01:39:30,103
Because I think part of is more success stories they have in the last 30 years are going to have records.

911
01:39:30,573 --> 01:39:43,173
Right. So you're kidding me because you're talking about that.

912
01:39:43,193 --> 01:39:46,683
So it really does happen.

913
01:39:47,313 --> 01:39:56,083
I think all are going to be broken down into like said.

914
01:39:56,743 --> 01:40:16,163
Yeah, I think it's if it's okay with that combination, I don't want to see those like losses that are.

915
01:40:16,783 --> 01:40:49,053
You had to figure out something like like I said where his administration I mean, that's what I was when I was a child.

916
01:40:49,153 --> 01:40:54,523
I think I think someone might have supported his friends.

917
01:40:54,523 --> 01:41:25,723
And also, maybe it's time for them to actually say yes or no more than my child.

918
01:41:31,513 --> 01:41:43,843
And I think there are very, very small groups that could be something like counselor, counselor.

919
01:41:45,073 --> 01:41:55,213
So all these cuts to Medicare and resource harmonization, I'm always like the obvious.

920
01:41:55,233 --> 01:41:55,363
Like,

921
01:41:57,853 --> 01:42:16,723
that's why you see like you might also like the community doing research for the right answer is to me a way to mitigate for you even more patients.

922
01:42:20,963 --> 01:42:48,193
So I started writing a plan for the audience to be really something like this.

923
01:42:48,593 --> 01:42:54,113
I think so. I don't think they have a question.

924
01:42:54,133 --> 01:43:09,303
I don't I don't want to give this to you, but obviously, we don't know exactly how much.

925
01:43:09,553 --> 01:43:12,853
So that's not the case.

926
01:43:16,693 --> 01:43:21,363
You get to see the money and then it's like a sister hospital.

927
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:25,453
Yeah, there is no way. So I.

928
01:43:26,703 --> 01:43:36,863
This was directly like, really like I.

929
01:43:41,173 --> 01:43:58,523
Yeah. Saying that's over and over and over again.

930
01:44:00,003 --> 01:44:08,453
I think it really is coming from the point of like that.

931
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:16,873
It is not an outlet for us.

932
01:44:17,383 --> 01:44:23,443
What do we need to have in place with Michael Goodwin and are you going to be sorry?

933
01:44:25,403 --> 01:44:41,293
What do you try to make recommendations and explain why you think you want to have some history or background?

934
01:44:41,303 --> 01:44:49,083
That means more than I thought.

935
01:44:49,203 --> 01:44:58,363
I was writing that kind of stuff that bigger organizations, you could just ship it.

936
01:44:59,653 --> 01:45:13,863
So yeah, it's a part of our acceptance of this stuff we're all supposed to ask about.

937
01:45:14,743 --> 01:45:31,572
So the question is, how do you how we can learn how to brainstorm on the spot, right?

938
01:45:31,573 --> 01:45:58,363
That says there is always kind of talk about how we look at the school excitement that might go

939
01:45:58,363 --> 01:46:06,613
out or that I can't run away because my patients are adamant that they started out with that.

940
01:46:09,703 --> 01:46:17,383
But it's like, Hey, I don't care.

941
01:46:17,533 --> 01:46:29,943
And that goes into something that I was like, okay, ideally according to the headlines.

942
01:46:31,523 --> 01:46:33,613
Yeah, yeah.

943
01:46:35,473 --> 01:46:56,773
I'm saying that it's really like all of the information that you need more and I think we all know, but I think it's still relevant in our values.

944
01:46:56,773 --> 01:47:09,183
We're not going to do it like it's like, wow, I don't really like to, you know, I haven't I mean.

945
01:47:18,263 --> 01:47:24,363
Are you one of my favorites?

946
01:47:26,163 --> 01:47:31,773
I would like. Are you stupid enough to fly?

947
01:47:33,353 --> 01:47:39,333
Yeah. If you could just be like a value in, like, situation.

948
01:47:39,673 --> 01:47:48,003
So what was it like? Oh, yeah.

949
01:47:48,423 --> 01:48:13,633
I would also like to just start consulting like, you know, you know,

950
01:48:14,913 --> 01:48:28,353
their research is really messed up that this is something that would expand your economy.

951
01:48:28,353 --> 01:48:33,513
And actually, I think that's the problem.

952
01:48:36,483 --> 01:48:48,033
Yeah, but I thought that was kind of a sort of other topic because it was one thing.

953
01:48:48,033 --> 01:49:14,273
I was like, Oh, it's like it's going to be like they were like, okay, here's what the next thing I know, I'm a public health person.

954
01:49:14,283 --> 01:49:28,643
So I was like I was like, oh my gosh, you know?

955
01:49:31,683 --> 01:49:40,803
And I don't know, like, I know that you graduated from that.

956
01:49:42,863 --> 01:49:58,413
You would have a lot of like, so I'm not there right now.

957
01:50:00,003 --> 01:50:06,983
I don't think you should know the reason.

958
01:50:19,803 --> 01:50:29,013
But what she was doing right.

959
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:47,943
Yeah. I'm like, I don't know if you.

960
01:50:47,943 --> 01:50:53,523
Are you ready? I just love it.

961
01:50:55,173 --> 01:51:18,193
But that's the thing that you want to know more about.

962
01:51:18,723 --> 01:51:31,563
But I always thought about what I would ask of you to listen to them, think about their case, and then we'll have group to present any advice.

963
01:51:31,833 --> 01:51:37,023
So another thing that I am hoping by doing this over and over and over again is when you leave this class,

964
01:51:37,473 --> 01:51:42,453
you will get really good at being able to present like this.

965
01:51:42,753 --> 01:51:50,403
So any tools or advice you have for people that is constructive and helpful for them to do a better job, please.

966
01:51:50,763 --> 01:51:53,013
We'll ask about that at the end.

967
01:51:53,013 --> 01:52:01,322
So do present for a few minutes and then we'll have group to present and then we'll talk to both groups about anything they may have missed,

968
01:52:01,323 --> 01:52:05,343
but also any advice or tips from you all based on observing them.

969
01:52:05,343 --> 01:52:11,943
And, you know, keep in mind, you're next, so. All right, group one, take it away to go to the back side.

970
01:52:13,413 --> 01:52:17,233
So the main focus of our case is how do we go from idea to exit?

971
01:52:17,363 --> 01:52:28,762
You should whenever we're implementing new policies, technology, etc., etc. the biggest thing that we talked about was having a really good plan,

972
01:52:28,763 --> 01:52:34,553
something that's focused, something that's articulate, and we mostly focused on the technological aspect.

973
01:52:35,423 --> 01:52:40,283
We use the example of epic write. When we're implementing any sort of platform.

974
01:52:40,283 --> 01:52:43,313
We want to do our research, make sure it's super integrated,

975
01:52:43,643 --> 01:52:47,693
learn from other health care systems that might be using it so that we can

976
01:52:47,693 --> 01:52:51,053
avoid any difficulties or conflicts that they ran into when implementing it,

977
01:52:51,263 --> 01:52:57,923
things like that. So we started off by discussing, doing a lot of well-rounded research like that,

978
01:52:58,433 --> 01:53:03,913
and then we also continued by talking about execution, which you guys can replicate.

979
01:53:04,433 --> 01:53:06,293
And that's an execution.

980
01:53:06,293 --> 01:53:12,653
We also and part of our research was understanding stakeholders, understanding our patient base, understanding how we implement it and where.

981
01:53:12,923 --> 01:53:19,763
So we decided we'd execute with a pilot program starting at one of our many health facilities and see how it works with the community,

982
01:53:19,763 --> 01:53:25,553
how the providers like it, and addressing concerns from patients, providers and everybody involved.

983
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:34,533
And we also wanted to make it clear that we need to understand patient safety and a lot of these technology aspects.

984
01:53:34,533 --> 01:53:35,512
So we're going to try to integrate.

985
01:53:35,513 --> 01:53:43,103
It will probably need approval and required a lot of safety efforts to make sure that patients are safe in their data.

986
01:53:43,103 --> 01:53:50,603
Safe, yeah. And then also cost because of course, whatever we're implementing, there's going to be cost to each part of it.

987
01:53:51,353 --> 01:53:56,422
And then when we're looking at the platform as a whole, there's going to be so many different stakeholders involved.

988
01:53:56,423 --> 01:53:59,273
So we want to make sure that we're addressing each part of that.

989
01:54:00,203 --> 01:54:04,433
And so one thing we talked about is this is a patient platform, but the patients we're serving,

990
01:54:04,913 --> 01:54:08,513
how are they going to be able to use the technology and interact?

991
01:54:08,813 --> 01:54:11,963
And then there's also on the other end providers and physicians.

992
01:54:12,803 --> 01:54:21,323
How are we going to coordinate across all areas that would require like an intermediary if you have patients that call

993
01:54:21,323 --> 01:54:28,403
in and then if it's we're outsourcing out a call center and then they have to send messages directly to providers,

994
01:54:28,763 --> 01:54:32,153
how is all of that coordination going to work? And there's cost to all of that as well.

995
01:54:33,113 --> 01:54:39,052
And we are thinking of like learning from other system that is already have like for example,

996
01:54:39,053 --> 01:54:42,923
like patient portals so we can learn from them from their mistakes and then

997
01:54:42,923 --> 01:54:49,613
we can starting to implement in one of our hospital locations and before we,

998
01:54:49,793 --> 01:54:52,063
before we make it like a.

999
01:54:53,173 --> 01:55:02,203
After making all the adjustments that it fits to our patient populations, then we can start to implement it to all of our hospital patients.

1000
01:55:03,863 --> 01:55:07,583
Yeah. So to summarize. Do your research.

1001
01:55:07,613 --> 01:55:13,583
Talk to people who already have experience. And when you're going to execute, start small, then expand.

1002
01:55:14,473 --> 01:55:14,833
Thank you.

1003
01:55:22,163 --> 01:55:52,773
Two because they know and the government has refused to let me start saying, please take your jacket so you can change that, even if it's okay.

1004
01:55:53,243 --> 01:55:59,273
So we had the same case. Sadly, we actually weren't able to attend a health care conference in there,

1005
01:55:59,273 --> 01:56:05,123
so we kind of had to make up our own understanding of what we learned at this conference.

1006
01:56:05,993 --> 01:56:11,063
But basically, the case is focused on moving to a platform model of health care system delivery.

1007
01:56:11,993 --> 01:56:13,613
So from what we understood,

1008
01:56:13,883 --> 01:56:20,513
there are two basic models that people with split health care delivery up into pipeline and platform pipeline is basically service line focused,

1009
01:56:21,113 --> 01:56:23,363
distribution, manufacturing, all those sorts of things.

1010
01:56:23,453 --> 01:56:31,223
Focus on steps one through ten platform seems to be a more centralized and also expansive focus.

1011
01:56:31,253 --> 01:56:39,773
So basically it's the idea of health care systems moving to more complex databases internally and more collaborative databases externally.

1012
01:56:40,553 --> 01:56:44,873
So we've thought about some ways to do that and some basic key points to just

1013
01:56:44,873 --> 01:56:48,443
start out making sure our team is the health care system is moving this way.

1014
01:56:48,473 --> 01:56:55,673
We need to think about how our mission as an organization fits in this world, how we fit locally in this sort of movement,

1015
01:56:56,183 --> 01:57:02,333
and how we can collaborate for better patient care all around our area, not just within our health care system.

1016
01:57:04,273 --> 01:57:09,833
Okay, so few of the innovative ideas we thought which would be possible for this pipeline system is that,

1017
01:57:11,063 --> 01:57:15,623
as it was mentioned, pipelines is that we need external factors to come and incorporate with them.

1018
01:57:15,623 --> 01:57:20,992
So a few of the innovative ideas which healthcare system can adopt first is virtual reality

1019
01:57:20,993 --> 01:57:27,113
or augmented reality and another option as I umpired in the Internet of Medical Things.

1020
01:57:27,413 --> 01:57:33,443
So these are elements where you actually establish a cloud system about all the hospital

1021
01:57:33,443 --> 01:57:37,673
devices they have network patient data and all that so fascinating together with one another,

1022
01:57:37,853 --> 01:57:43,342
which will enable our hospital systems to actually the recovery and then monitoring

1023
01:57:43,343 --> 01:57:47,992
of patients who are having chronic diseases or are undergoing rehabilitation,

1024
01:57:47,993 --> 01:57:53,633
etc. And also it allows vision to have a better access of patient data.

1025
01:57:53,873 --> 01:57:58,823
This also poses risks like cybersecurity and so on, but those can be mitigated in the long run.

1026
01:57:59,183 --> 01:58:06,083
And another aspect which was was virtual reality and augmented reality.

1027
01:58:06,293 --> 01:58:13,963
So this is something which. It's a very growing element in today's world and in health care.

1028
01:58:14,013 --> 01:58:20,253
This can be used for education and rehab and health care monitoring.

1029
01:58:21,113 --> 01:58:29,343
And so with all those ideas, it's very important to, you know, look at the communities around you, what hospitals have done these things before.

1030
01:58:29,453 --> 01:58:33,623
Do your research before really implementing and bringing these ideas to your team.

1031
01:58:33,933 --> 01:58:42,833
You know what has failed? What has succeeded? And since these are this model is bringing in people from outside of your health care community,

1032
01:58:43,403 --> 01:58:47,302
it's really important to kind of understand how your health care system runs,

1033
01:58:47,303 --> 01:58:52,493
what are the missions and the goals, as well as just the way that it's run,

1034
01:58:52,673 --> 01:58:58,793
so that you can bring in people that have the same values and are for the organization.

1035
01:58:58,793 --> 01:59:02,213
And since it is an external model, that's very important.

1036
01:59:03,323 --> 01:59:08,482
Another innovative idea that we discussed was remote consultations or telehealth services,

1037
01:59:08,483 --> 01:59:11,483
assuming that this hospital system does not have that currently.

1038
01:59:12,083 --> 01:59:17,302
And basically, our care delivery platform addresses extension and access to health care by allowing

1039
01:59:17,303 --> 01:59:23,273
physicians to remotely and comprehensively assess patients for cardiac and chronic diseases.

1040
01:59:23,543 --> 01:59:28,553
We can also integrate the telehealth services within the patient portals as well.

1041
01:59:29,123 --> 01:59:34,193
So that was one of the innovative ways to do this. Yeah, it's one of those innovative ideas.

1042
01:59:34,733 --> 01:59:41,033
It's also important to look at where we're looking at the platform care model to understand, like the cost and what that means for the facility.

1043
01:59:42,353 --> 01:59:48,163
It's like for for doctors and physicians and nurses and all the other staff that it goes into making the care possible for the patient.

1044
01:59:48,173 --> 01:59:53,423
It's important to understand how that collaboration with other health systems like you were talking about with that server,

1045
01:59:54,983 --> 01:59:59,243
understanding how well how one system does it doesn't necessarily mean that your system wouldn't work.

1046
01:59:59,243 --> 02:00:02,933
But understanding if you can tweak it in a way that's going to make it work for you,

1047
02:00:03,783 --> 02:00:09,472
that's going to be the best and understanding that that cost is not going to be the same for both places.

1048
02:00:09,473 --> 02:00:14,693
And you have to know how to make it better for yourself and do that research for you.

1049
02:00:14,903 --> 02:00:21,203
So yeah. So all in all, as far as idea of execution goes, we're going to make a plan.

1050
02:00:21,383 --> 02:00:26,603
We're going to we're going to assign teams.

1051
02:00:26,603 --> 02:00:33,333
We're going to hire both database builders and the cybersecurity experts in health systems category

1052
02:00:33,383 --> 02:00:38,303
to deal with database management as far as implementing the Internet of Medical Things model goes.

1053
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:45,143
And ideally, we'll end up having a more effective system internally that can also collaborate with systems around us for doing the same thing.

1054
02:00:46,313 --> 02:00:53,423
And also sorry with that, definitely like risk management if the costs are worth it and just making sure that the

1055
02:00:53,423 --> 02:00:59,123
patients have their satisfaction and the patient experience is also withheld or increased.

1056
02:00:59,133 --> 02:01:08,383
Sorry. Pick one or two and anything they may have missed.

1057
02:01:10,093 --> 02:01:18,293
And it's. I love that everyone on your team spoke.

1058
02:01:19,943 --> 02:01:25,162
Next time we'll get better at not having a computer to read up on because you're doing this fast,

1059
02:01:25,163 --> 02:01:29,813
but you are probably already know what you're going to say before you stand up here.

1060
02:01:29,843 --> 02:01:33,802
So in terms of like presenting, we'll see if the next groups can do this.

1061
02:01:33,803 --> 02:01:38,963
But I think that's the one thing that many like we should all think about is

1062
02:01:39,203 --> 02:01:42,863
there's probably a thousand ideas that you get for any conference you run.

1063
02:01:43,133 --> 02:01:50,063
So if anyone went to the conference that was in Las Vegas recently or a or whatever,

1064
02:01:51,113 --> 02:01:55,133
how do you get your idea to actually be something you're going to implement?

1065
02:01:55,313 --> 02:01:59,193
What do you need to do to do it?

1066
02:01:59,993 --> 02:02:05,003
I mean, I think the first step is make sure that it's possible, given the services that you're providing.

1067
02:02:05,003 --> 02:02:08,163
Right. So it's possible even before then. Yeah.

1068
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:14,723
For then make sure that it's actually a need that's unmet, that you need to do it.

1069
02:02:14,933 --> 02:02:21,843
And how do you do that? A lot of the things that you talked about earlier in the class with the knee where you have somebody going around,

1070
02:02:22,553 --> 02:02:28,043
this is specifically for cost, but you can see, hey, this is something that's actually a problem within the system.

1071
02:02:29,003 --> 02:02:42,233
Even before that analysis, to see if this is something where then the solution can actually remedy the need and the way the payment will come.

1072
02:02:42,413 --> 02:02:47,513
Those are all you're all talking about good action items. Yes. That is to get buy in from people.

1073
02:02:47,513 --> 02:02:54,083
So you have people to support what you're trying to do and why so that you get visibility throughout.

1074
02:02:54,113 --> 02:03:00,933
Why did you give this one thing versus all others? What's the one test we should apply to everything like that?

1075
02:03:02,653 --> 02:03:10,553
It doesn't advance your mission.

1076
02:03:12,623 --> 02:03:15,743
You can tie your things to enable your mission.

1077
02:03:17,033 --> 02:03:21,773
You win. You can't still come to the table.

1078
02:03:23,333 --> 02:03:30,053
And it's good that everybody. That was very good. Let's hear what you got.

1079
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:44,653
Michael Yeah. Anybody has any batteries can.

1080
02:03:56,423 --> 02:04:03,733
He was describing all three.

1081
02:04:03,813 --> 02:04:09,003
I'm like, I'm going to be doing most of the talking. Basically,

1082
02:04:09,003 --> 02:04:18,992
our issue is that which one of our board members is suggesting that we do an audit of some of the disrespectful and discriminatory behavior

1083
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:26,823
that has been happening in our organization and figure out like how this aligns with our values and sort of what we can do about it.

1084
02:04:27,693 --> 02:04:36,242
And so we kind of came up with a step by step process of how we're going to address this,

1085
02:04:36,243 --> 02:04:40,653
like go through the steps to come up with a recommendation for the board.

1086
02:04:41,163 --> 02:04:53,013
So the first step is for us to read through all the reports of discriminatory behavior and sort of figure out like get the lay of the land,

1087
02:04:53,013 --> 02:05:01,953
figure out what exactly is happening. For example, is this like ageism, sexism, racism?

1088
02:05:03,783 --> 02:05:07,802
Is it implicit discrimination or explicit discrimination?

1089
02:05:07,803 --> 02:05:10,413
So just kind of get the lay of the land of what is going on.

1090
02:05:11,193 --> 02:05:20,013
And then our next step would be to meet with those people who have filed these reports and sort of interview them and also interview the offenders.

1091
02:05:20,253 --> 02:05:27,843
And again, just get opinions on exactly what the situation was and what is going on,

1092
02:05:28,173 --> 02:05:32,853
just to get a better understanding of the issue that we're dealing with in our organization.

1093
02:05:34,143 --> 02:05:41,343
And then we'll just go back and compare the statements from our different stakeholders and then start looking for patterns.

1094
02:05:41,613 --> 02:05:46,173
So I think this is something really important because it's really hard to address

1095
02:05:46,773 --> 02:05:51,153
individual like things that are happening and you really have to figure out

1096
02:05:51,333 --> 02:05:55,953
what is the overall problem that we're trying to address because you can't

1097
02:05:55,953 --> 02:05:59,853
just make a plan for every individual scenario that's that's going to happen.

1098
02:06:01,523 --> 02:06:06,922
And then the next step would be to kind of summarize our findings so we can present them to the

1099
02:06:06,923 --> 02:06:16,043
board and then also lay out sort of in a document how this misconduct goes against our mission,

1100
02:06:16,043 --> 02:06:17,273
vision and values.

1101
02:06:17,843 --> 02:06:27,383
Just so the board understands why it's important that we do something about it and how this is not sort of how we want to present our organization.

1102
02:06:28,713 --> 02:06:33,453
And then finally we're going to come up with a list of recommendations for our board.

1103
02:06:34,083 --> 02:06:41,193
So this might involve implicit bias training or focus groups.

1104
02:06:43,013 --> 02:06:50,723
Kind of as a beginning to figure out what we can do about the problem and just lay out for them what the steps are to do that.

1105
02:06:50,963 --> 02:06:57,203
And I know I was talking to the group a little bit about this, which is there's some research out there that implicit bias training doesn't work.

1106
02:06:57,773 --> 02:07:03,793
And so I think part of. The research process, if we had had more time,

1107
02:07:03,793 --> 02:07:10,362
would be to figure out what our research based or what are steps that are evidence

1108
02:07:10,363 --> 02:07:14,473
based that we can take and suggest to the board to be able to address this problem.

1109
02:07:16,453 --> 02:07:19,813
Yeah. Yeah. We can answer questions.

1110
02:07:24,213 --> 02:07:28,262
How feasible do you think it is to as a man, as someone who was in senior leadership,

1111
02:07:28,263 --> 02:07:32,343
to go and interview every single person who's had a discriminatory claim against them?

1112
02:07:34,033 --> 02:07:42,862
How many have we think it's important and we hope that you've got a lot of not that many complaints are filed but we have a week or so we

1113
02:07:42,863 --> 02:07:50,273
can we can realistically do that depends if it's hundreds of people that might be a different approach and we might need to tackle it in a.

1114
02:07:51,373 --> 02:07:58,543
Group meeting or something. I think it'll depend on the situation, but we would hope that we could address all of them.

1115
02:08:01,663 --> 02:08:10,873
Read. How are you going to address the possibility that interviewing the people who filed the reports may worsen their experience overall?

1116
02:08:10,883 --> 02:08:15,833
It might be kind of traumatic to be interviewed about something that you experienced by a hospital governing board.

1117
02:08:19,603 --> 02:08:25,263
Like how we start these meetings, how we said some of what we're just trying to gather is that we're sort of like

1118
02:08:25,303 --> 02:08:28,693
using these reports and reference in reference to like figuring out where we've

1119
02:08:28,693 --> 02:08:31,842
gone askew from our mission and values and just sort of just rephrasing those

1120
02:08:31,843 --> 02:08:34,723
to ensure that we can get everyone back on track is what we're looking for.

1121
02:08:35,053 --> 02:08:38,413
So we're going to actually interview everybody and go through all these reports or we

1122
02:08:38,413 --> 02:08:42,943
probably do some more research just to like the best way of like going after the,

1123
02:08:43,183 --> 02:08:44,113
you know, the issue.

1124
02:08:44,443 --> 02:08:50,683
But I think that the point is to just gather all the information required to like go forward and get everyone back on that organization's mission.

1125
02:08:51,073 --> 02:08:54,402
And I also think I'm going to add, I think you made a really good point.

1126
02:08:54,403 --> 02:08:59,323
And maybe one way to mitigate this issue is to like reach out via email,

1127
02:08:59,323 --> 02:09:04,123
maybe even to the whole organization and say if you've just seen people who filed the reports and say,

1128
02:09:04,363 --> 02:09:06,703
if you filed a report and are comfortable talking,

1129
02:09:06,703 --> 02:09:11,323
we would like to interview you or something like that so people can have an out if they're not comfortable.

1130
02:09:12,403 --> 02:09:16,273
We would hope to file a report that they would like to talk.

1131
02:09:16,273 --> 02:09:24,873
It's I think what would various people people are not filing reports and are experiencing this discrimination that would be harder that.

1132
02:09:26,773 --> 02:09:32,052
What is going to be read as this course of disciplinary action to ensure that this is something that won't be tolerated.

1133
02:09:32,053 --> 02:09:47,383
That your organization. So the question, I think we are going over the assignment and asks for an audit for the plan of what the board,

1134
02:09:47,893 --> 02:09:51,013
what to present to the board, meaning of what we're going to do.

1135
02:09:51,643 --> 02:09:56,683
And this is more of a plan and all the details haven't quite figured out.

1136
02:09:57,223 --> 02:10:01,813
So I think when we present it to the board, we kind of want to give them an overview of what our approach is.

1137
02:10:02,203 --> 02:10:10,003
But the details, again, haven't quite decided on fielding questions.

1138
02:10:13,893 --> 02:10:19,373
So I was just I was going to suggest maybe hire a consulting company.

1139
02:10:19,373 --> 02:10:25,123
You've got a quarter until the next board meetings, then they can approach it independently without any bias.

1140
02:10:25,123 --> 02:10:26,502
Where you might have bias.

1141
02:10:26,503 --> 02:10:39,033
When you're interviewing people and releasing software, you're going to say, Sorry, Laura, I'm trying to become a consultant.

1142
02:10:48,343 --> 02:10:52,273
So growth going off of those last couple of questions.

1143
02:10:53,473 --> 02:10:56,803
Our main recommendation is actually to bring in like a consulting company,

1144
02:10:56,823 --> 02:11:02,773
third party type or an iOS psychologist just because they are trained to deal with sensitive topics.

1145
02:11:02,773 --> 02:11:12,283
And they are like it's a bit more comprehensive in that they can understand employee behaviors in the workplace and can hold unbiased interviews.

1146
02:11:12,613 --> 02:11:15,823
And so that's like our main for our first big stuff.

1147
02:11:16,393 --> 02:11:24,163
Yeah. So in partnership with our third party, we are going to lead a work group with our HRO,

1148
02:11:24,373 --> 02:11:31,752
Chief Human Resources Officer, to review these historical cases of discrimination similar to the last group.

1149
02:11:31,753 --> 02:11:38,053
We also came up with some criteria that we want to look at, looking at patterns of who is affected the most.

1150
02:11:39,073 --> 02:11:42,733
How were these situations resolved, if at all?

1151
02:11:43,783 --> 02:11:49,003
How was satisfaction affected before and after the incidents and.

1152
02:11:51,183 --> 02:12:01,593
Things like that. And I think our ultimate goal was to identify best practices for us moving forward and implementation.

1153
02:12:03,453 --> 02:12:07,263
Um. Yeah, so kind of it's a little scattered, but, uh,

1154
02:12:07,683 --> 02:12:15,153
similar to the last group we wanted to go in and have interviews with, uh, employees that face discrimination.

1155
02:12:15,603 --> 02:12:20,223
It might not be entirely feasible to interview every single person.

1156
02:12:20,253 --> 02:12:27,633
Um, but it's very important that these employees have a voice and that they can give feedback about,

1157
02:12:28,143 --> 02:12:34,213
um, discrimination or discriminatory events that may go unreported and, um,

1158
02:12:34,383 --> 02:12:41,343
under the radar, things like microaggressions are things in the workplace that aren't like it's hard to kind of,

1159
02:12:41,793 --> 02:12:46,233
they're not as tangible as more obvious discrimination events.

1160
02:12:46,833 --> 02:12:53,643
So this is also kind of a place we could bring in a third party consulting or, um,

1161
02:12:54,063 --> 02:12:58,983
third party who's experienced and trained in dealing with these types of situations.

1162
02:12:59,493 --> 02:13:06,572
Um, and yeah, I think, yeah.

1163
02:13:06,573 --> 02:13:09,843
And then we also talk about what channels is discrimination happening on.

1164
02:13:09,843 --> 02:13:12,433
Obviously it's not only going to be happening face to face.

1165
02:13:12,433 --> 02:13:20,252
So is it organization sponsored communication like emails, any like third party messaging apps like Slack or is it like other communications,

1166
02:13:20,253 --> 02:13:24,152
like text messaging or even things outside of the workplace?

1167
02:13:24,153 --> 02:13:30,873
So really going the extra step and seeing in what ways is this discriminatory, discriminatory behavior happening.

1168
02:13:31,263 --> 02:13:37,023
Yeah. And just going after that when they're emails or they're on Slack, these are incidences that are very much documented.

1169
02:13:37,023 --> 02:13:41,613
They're written out on a computer or whatever on an email or text message.

1170
02:13:41,613 --> 02:13:49,203
So it's very easy to see those and kind of prove your point, I guess you could say, and just really see the situation as it came up.

1171
02:13:49,203 --> 02:13:52,833
So it's not he said he said she said it's blatantly obvious.

1172
02:13:53,583 --> 02:13:59,763
And I think another thing is just looking through this data on where these were happening, were they after work?

1173
02:14:00,393 --> 02:14:03,813
Were they one on one? Were they in a group more so?

1174
02:14:03,813 --> 02:14:09,063
Was it more microaggressions or was it more face to face, like confronting one another?

1175
02:14:09,063 --> 02:14:11,593
So just looking at different things like that, right?

1176
02:14:11,643 --> 02:14:19,023
And then cross-referencing that information with our rates of turnover for those individuals and other costs

1177
02:14:19,023 --> 02:14:23,643
to the organization would definitely be part of our audit results that we would present to the board.

1178
02:14:24,633 --> 02:14:29,403
And I think Brandon brought up a good point about making for kind of the trauma

1179
02:14:29,403 --> 02:14:32,883
surrounding that and making people interview when they might not want to.

1180
02:14:33,693 --> 02:14:40,473
That's why, again, the third party might be a source or a way to make people feel more comfortable to share.

1181
02:14:40,833 --> 02:14:47,613
Um, so they're not talking to their senior advisory board or their employer, but someone they feel safe.

1182
02:14:47,973 --> 02:14:53,283
And just going off of. Another point that was brought up in the last group is with interviewing.

1183
02:14:53,283 --> 02:14:59,432
We thought about that there could be a ton of these little things going on or reports or things like that.

1184
02:14:59,433 --> 02:15:03,363
So I, we thought that the easiest way was just to do an anonymous survey.

1185
02:15:03,693 --> 02:15:08,463
That way, everybody feels safe enough that even if it's a small issue, they feel like they can report that.

1186
02:15:08,463 --> 02:15:12,782
And I think just creating a culture that's open and honest about these kinds of

1187
02:15:12,783 --> 02:15:16,173
things is very important to limit turnover and burnout and things like that.

1188
02:15:17,633 --> 02:15:26,103
Z. A very sensitive topic, but was he presented good plans?

1189
02:15:26,523 --> 02:15:30,303
And I think ultimately he came up with that.

1190
02:15:30,603 --> 02:15:34,783
He believes that having an objective to where you have that going on is pretty sensitive.

1191
02:15:34,803 --> 02:15:41,583
Yes, I think something wasn't implicitly said by either group was the fact that most of

1192
02:15:41,583 --> 02:15:46,143
these instances actually occurred between students and staff members and providers.

1193
02:15:46,503 --> 02:15:55,683
So how do we deal with the optics of like if the student gets out into the community, does it look like we're attacking our patient population?

1194
02:15:55,683 --> 02:16:00,752
Right. Yeah. Not that it's not important for us to bring these things up, because it absolutely is.

1195
02:16:00,753 --> 02:16:06,033
But if we're only focusing on employee versus employee, we're actually missing the point.

1196
02:16:06,393 --> 02:16:10,833
That's a really good point. Yeah, very good point. That that can come from your piece as well.

1197
02:16:13,233 --> 02:16:18,153
All right. Team 525. I have to be up here now.

1198
02:16:18,153 --> 02:16:21,003
Usually very different situations.

1199
02:16:21,713 --> 02:16:35,492
Certain things happen if we run out of time for groups nine or ten or something, it's possible we might then start nine and ten for the next period.

1200
02:16:35,493 --> 02:16:43,783
So just, you know, panic. Funny, I didn't hear that also for our five.

1201
02:16:43,983 --> 02:16:50,883
Okay, so we were tasked with three different stations patients, your grandmother or your father and you or your partner.

1202
02:16:51,183 --> 02:16:57,063
So all have different things going on with your health and they want to receive a checkup.

1203
02:16:57,873 --> 02:17:05,882
And so we were tasked with looking at what is a good result for that for each individual patient and what does continued good health look

1204
02:17:05,883 --> 02:17:13,353
like at our organization and what things need to be in place for these good results that happen for each of these individual patients.

1205
02:17:13,743 --> 02:17:18,213
And so it's kind of different for each patient and that's on the patient base level.

1206
02:17:19,023 --> 02:17:23,013
So we're just trying to figure out how to have an excellent result for each of these events.

1207
02:17:25,473 --> 02:17:32,913
Hello. I am the grandmother. I'm 80 years old. I'm having a problem hearing eyesight, mobility.

1208
02:17:33,273 --> 02:17:38,733
And so we think that for good care, for this patient, access to referrals.

1209
02:17:39,423 --> 02:17:44,043
Referrals. So these all these different specialists can her with the care that she needs.

1210
02:17:45,273 --> 02:17:53,463
Next we think is accommodations she's all you may need help seeing what games large and stuff like that and

1211
02:17:53,463 --> 02:18:00,662
then the next one was an access to a primary care provider that actually cares about what's going on with her.

1212
02:18:00,663 --> 02:18:03,813
And that's like pass her up and.

1213
02:18:06,293 --> 02:18:11,903
And then I think a big thing is the ability for this patient to get where they need to go.

1214
02:18:12,533 --> 02:18:15,293
You see that the family is also having issues.

1215
02:18:15,323 --> 02:18:21,713
So they may not be able to transport her to all of these appointments that she may need to be able to get to.

1216
02:18:21,743 --> 02:18:26,213
So I think access to transportation is also something that's very important.

1217
02:18:27,803 --> 02:18:33,773
So on behalf of the father, was the chest pain that's coming from unknown causes there?

1218
02:18:34,703 --> 02:18:41,632
All he cares means that he is getting the correct flags and tests and that there's there is

1219
02:18:41,633 --> 02:18:46,433
also a certain urgency applied to this case that might not appear in the grandmother's case.

1220
02:18:47,363 --> 02:18:49,342
This applies to all three down the line,

1221
02:18:49,343 --> 02:18:57,943
but making sure that the patients are heard and understood and different levels so that their pain levels are properly assessed and responded to.

1222
02:18:57,953 --> 02:19:02,063
And so from here on.

1223
02:19:03,293 --> 02:19:09,743
We could potentially see the father get on certain medication and make sure that they are seeing a specialist as well,

1224
02:19:10,763 --> 02:19:12,333
potentially like the grandmother.

1225
02:19:12,353 --> 02:19:20,213
And also, lifestyle changes might be recommended to the father, such as a diet and exercise plan, depending on what the problem with his chest is.

1226
02:19:22,273 --> 02:19:28,653
Okay. So my partner, my partner and I think I might be pregnant.

1227
02:19:28,673 --> 02:19:35,742
And we went to the hospital. The hospital makes sure if we want it, the child or not.

1228
02:19:35,743 --> 02:19:45,883
So they would all up a long term plan for me to regularly do lab testing and make sure I have a.

1229
02:19:47,033 --> 02:19:51,433
Counselor that kept my baby and myself safe.

1230
02:19:51,743 --> 02:20:01,433
And until the delivery and afterwards and as well as the way and testing after that the hospital

1231
02:20:02,363 --> 02:20:08,873
will make sure I have to attend a follow up appointment and my knowledge of my new lifestyles.

1232
02:20:11,303 --> 02:20:14,783
I think the biggest thing we've learned in all these is that we just need a plan for

1233
02:20:14,783 --> 02:20:18,023
each one of these different patients because they're all different and experiencing,

1234
02:20:18,353 --> 02:20:20,543
you know, unique things to them.

1235
02:20:21,083 --> 02:20:27,323
So as a health care organization, we need to make sure that we have the resources and the care teams in place that can manage these patients.

1236
02:20:28,223 --> 02:20:34,073
And then to have these in place. We need things like, you know, invested staff.

1237
02:20:34,103 --> 02:20:40,113
We need things like a good our system, you know, from a financial perspective.

1238
02:20:40,133 --> 02:20:44,873
We need to make sure that we have timely filing and coding and billing to make sure that, you know,

1239
02:20:44,873 --> 02:20:50,033
the grandma who's 80 years old doesn't get a surprise, Bill, because she's out of network or something.

1240
02:20:50,073 --> 02:20:53,183
So we need to make sure that we have these things in place so the patients have a good

1241
02:20:53,183 --> 02:20:57,142
experience and they want to come back and that our physicians are also having a good experience,

1242
02:20:57,143 --> 02:21:02,033
you know, as part of that triple or quadruple aim to make sure that we're satisfying burnout

1243
02:21:02,033 --> 02:21:26,693
as well as the Board of Health and just go ahead and experience all this budget.

1244
02:21:26,723 --> 02:21:31,973
My handwriting is not nearly as pretty as Christine's, so I'm going to talk through it.

1245
02:21:32,753 --> 02:21:36,863
You know, the thing we talked about on second and secondary summarize the whole case, too.

1246
02:21:36,863 --> 02:21:42,043
So we've got these three case studies and 85 year olds are getting older age all the conditions associated with that.

1247
02:21:43,013 --> 02:21:47,783
A father who is 55 and suffering chest pain. We don't know what the nature cause of the chest pain is.

1248
02:21:48,113 --> 02:21:51,623
And then I'm recently discovered that I'm gaining some weight and may be pregnant.

1249
02:21:52,163 --> 02:21:57,553
So the three questions that we want to address and each one of these is obviously, you know,

1250
02:21:57,593 --> 02:22:02,543
what constitutes a good result immediately for the health condition that we're presented with.

1251
02:22:03,023 --> 02:22:09,913
You know, given those excellent results, what other factors would be important to ensure continued ongoing health?

1252
02:22:09,923 --> 02:22:15,593
And then finally, what do we need to have in place to achieve these two goals?

1253
02:22:15,713 --> 02:22:22,222
So with that simple, yeah. So we get started with the grandmother that's basically old age.

1254
02:22:22,223 --> 02:22:26,033
It's kind of attributed. All of these are kind of attributes to that.

1255
02:22:26,033 --> 02:22:32,763
And so it's or I guess, Mohammed, what constitutes an actual result for this patient for Josephine.

1256
02:22:33,003 --> 02:22:36,533
Yeah. So the goal for those, right to get your lovely grandmother to get a checkup.

1257
02:22:36,773 --> 02:22:41,123
So one of the things, you know, you need transportation is to get her to the checkup.

1258
02:22:41,123 --> 02:22:43,402
Second thing you need to have as a patient advocate could be a family member.

1259
02:22:43,403 --> 02:22:46,373
It could be a staff member making sure you have someone to guide because of her

1260
02:22:46,373 --> 02:22:50,183
age through the appointment and then just making sure you have palliative care.

1261
02:22:50,453 --> 02:22:53,723
So make sure that she gets her diabetes treatment and has all the other resources.

1262
02:22:53,993 --> 02:22:57,913
So make sure she's as healthy as possible. So what's the good outcome.

1263
02:22:58,093 --> 02:23:02,773
So the good afternoon is making sure she gets through the checkout and then also making

1264
02:23:02,773 --> 02:23:07,303
sure her diabetes is treated and also for help doesn't continue to decline as they do.

1265
02:23:09,513 --> 02:23:14,823
Yeah. And so a lot of it so about 55 is a huge chest pain.

1266
02:23:15,063 --> 02:23:19,053
And I started a half an hour ago. And so in this case, what would constitute an excellent result?

1267
02:23:19,623 --> 02:23:26,373
So first thing that bothering me would be emergency care with little to as little wait time as possible.

1268
02:23:27,123 --> 02:23:31,353
That'd be like an ambulance 12 lead or whatever it is that they may need.

1269
02:23:31,623 --> 02:23:35,343
And on top of that, it would also mean efficient follow up care.

1270
02:23:36,033 --> 02:23:42,062
And in order to have a good go for a good health outcome, it would be obviously a key lose.

1271
02:23:42,063 --> 02:23:51,483
And he has a rapid response and having a solid foundation is necessary to have a

1272
02:23:51,603 --> 02:23:57,693
comprehensive up to date record of the father's previous like health behaviors and such,

1273
02:23:58,113 --> 02:24:05,813
and that would lead to more efficient health, education and integrated communication with the primary care providers.

1274
02:24:07,233 --> 02:24:10,723
And lastly, so what constitute your point?

1275
02:24:10,743 --> 02:24:13,953
You or your partner may be pregnant and what constitutes an excellent result for this?

1276
02:24:13,953 --> 02:24:18,663
And what are some of the necessities we need? Thank you so much for the question.

1277
02:24:21,033 --> 02:24:28,383
To ensure that we have culturally competent and experienced care given to our patients who may or may not be pregnant.

1278
02:24:28,653 --> 02:24:34,353
And we have to ensure lab services. We have to make sure that if there is a positive pregnancy,

1279
02:24:34,923 --> 02:24:41,743
that we're providing maternal navigators and making sure that each one of our areas that this

1280
02:24:42,453 --> 02:24:50,463
potential person who's pregnant will touch are integrated in a team based if they so choose,

1281
02:24:50,463 --> 02:24:57,663
to go into labor. When they do, they have met their team and their care providers before you experience.

1282
02:24:58,443 --> 02:25:09,422
We also want to make sure we have solid systems for ensuring communication between OB-GYN and PCP to make sure the mother is well taken care of.

1283
02:25:09,423 --> 02:25:12,693
Leading to a healthy mother and a healthy baby.

1284
02:25:14,033 --> 02:25:19,013
So in summary, there are some commonalities between all these that we can look at as an organization.

1285
02:25:19,023 --> 02:25:21,293
The first thing we need to arrange for is transportation,

1286
02:25:21,293 --> 02:25:27,502
whether that's within the system itself or partnerships with ambulatory companies to make sure that

1287
02:25:27,503 --> 02:25:31,402
in an emerging situation like a potential heart attack or a pneumothorax or something like that,

1288
02:25:31,403 --> 02:25:39,133
we can get the patient to the hospital if they have to have the appropriate care that each one of us talked about when they get there,

1289
02:25:39,143 --> 02:25:46,583
and then that there's an integration. Because while these might all present an immediate need, you have to have coordination of care with,

1290
02:25:47,033 --> 02:25:52,583
you know, a cardiac specialist and a primary care physician for any kind of follow up care.

1291
02:25:53,933 --> 02:26:00,533
Any questions? That's got one, I can tell you.

1292
02:26:01,543 --> 02:26:12,913
Well done. I think this is a good overall thing.

1293
02:26:12,923 --> 02:26:27,513
He was right that women need to make choices about family advice and oh yeah, seven, seven and eight.

1294
02:26:28,583 --> 02:26:38,093
It's probably easier. This.

1295
02:26:45,623 --> 02:26:51,703
Yes, we have the Patient Family Advisory Councils, and so we propose that we should institute this council in our organization.

1296
02:26:52,643 --> 02:26:57,593
And the first question we're asking is what this council could be used for in our organization.

1297
02:26:57,593 --> 02:27:04,223
So you said the main goal of this council will be to overall better a patient family experience within the hospital setting.

1298
02:27:04,373 --> 02:27:10,222
And this specific council would work to develop communication and education materials for patient and

1299
02:27:10,223 --> 02:27:16,883
families to kind of serve as an idea generator for new programs or new benefits for patients and families.

1300
02:27:17,753 --> 02:27:24,383
Also to encourage cooperation and collaboration with clinicians, staff administrators, with patient family groups.

1301
02:27:25,823 --> 02:27:29,903
Additionally, we provide feedback on new innovations or changes from, again,

1302
02:27:30,113 --> 02:27:34,522
not an outside perspective, but families and patients in terms of not operating within the hospital.

1303
02:27:34,523 --> 02:27:38,603
So what their perspective on what these changes would mean for them and what they would be.

1304
02:27:38,963 --> 02:27:47,422
And then overall, just kind of to promote resources for patient families so that they feel heard anything is being changed or just in general.

1305
02:27:47,423 --> 02:27:52,823
And then also so they can actually themselves better navigate the hospital system through

1306
02:27:53,033 --> 02:27:57,173
meetings or through online portals or whoever over that access would be best distributed.

1307
02:27:57,533 --> 02:28:00,443
So that's what we set for kind of what that could be used for, for us.

1308
02:28:00,953 --> 02:28:06,403
So how will we incorporate this council into our organization structure is first of all,

1309
02:28:06,413 --> 02:28:11,583
the makeup will be about 60% patients and families with about 40% administration.

1310
02:28:12,113 --> 02:28:16,553
So that would consist of board members, relevant stakeholders and clinicians.

1311
02:28:16,853 --> 02:28:26,992
And we were thinking that we could start with a general patient family council to kind of get an idea of what focuses we should be targeting.

1312
02:28:26,993 --> 02:28:35,813
And then if there are specific units that could use more help than others, divide them into subcommittees so we can better target in on those issues.

1313
02:28:37,053 --> 02:28:43,863
So for next steps, you'd obviously need to get the word out that we're doing this and see who's interested and get on the board and stuff like that.

1314
02:28:44,523 --> 02:28:50,132
And then also just looking at other organizations that have already started these and see what works best

1315
02:28:50,133 --> 02:28:56,703
and like what we can improve on before it becomes old and kind of just like piggybacking off of that.

1316
02:28:57,813 --> 02:29:02,733
Some pitfalls of the PFC may be that like it just simply might not work.

1317
02:29:03,123 --> 02:29:07,892
So I think one way that we could mitigate that is just by looking at other organizations

1318
02:29:07,893 --> 02:29:12,353
who may have similar counsels and kind of take notes about what worked for them,

1319
02:29:12,393 --> 02:29:16,893
what didn't work. And obviously we would have to refine that to make it fit our specific organization.

1320
02:29:17,673 --> 02:29:24,093
But that way we can kind of avoid it falling apart because we missed like one detail.

1321
02:29:26,853 --> 02:29:37,013
Yeah, I think that was it. And to ensure excuse me to ensure that it's actually reflective of the organization's was a patient population.

1322
02:29:37,053 --> 02:29:42,303
We plan on using the kind of data that we have about the demographics of the patients and

1323
02:29:42,303 --> 02:29:46,023
make sure that property is reflected throughout the organization through this council.

1324
02:29:47,253 --> 02:29:53,233
That's all people.

1325
02:30:07,293 --> 02:30:17,493
It's a high same case. So a board member came up to us and was like quickly passing by, like, think about creating this program.

1326
02:30:18,033 --> 02:30:23,543
He thought all calm throughout this discussion, didn't get the details, so we had to just kind of shoot from that.

1327
02:30:25,503 --> 02:30:32,072
So he back in the in the organization can help us support our patients by providing resources.

1328
02:30:32,073 --> 02:30:38,553
Right. And right when I when I read this prompt, I thought social workers, you know, that type of that type of action like hey,

1329
02:30:39,903 --> 02:30:45,423
in the hypothetical situation we used is like a labor a labor and delivery delivery department.

1330
02:30:45,423 --> 02:30:50,973
So new mothers obviously need a lot of resources support postpartum care.

1331
02:30:51,153 --> 02:30:55,113
So that kind of that kind of helping aspect.

1332
02:30:55,233 --> 02:31:02,283
So it'll fit in our organizational structure by decentralizing by department.

1333
02:31:02,283 --> 02:31:11,733
So we have multiple teams throughout the hospital facility, decentralized to two departments to serve that certain patient demographic.

1334
02:31:11,753 --> 02:31:15,693
So say we have geriatrics.

1335
02:31:15,783 --> 02:31:25,382
So we will create these fat committees or councils by providing older, older councils, right?

1336
02:31:25,383 --> 02:31:30,733
Because they understand the basic patient population. They understand certain challenges that each department has.

1337
02:31:30,753 --> 02:31:34,683
So I think that's a that's a great way to kind of focus in and tackle that problem.

1338
02:31:36,113 --> 02:31:37,402
In regards to next steps.

1339
02:31:37,403 --> 02:31:46,943
There is a variety of things that we discussed which included looking to see how other organizations kind of developed their own bases,

1340
02:31:47,573 --> 02:31:56,513
but also creating a mission plan for the council and then implementing and seeing how that kind of reinforces our own mission as an organization.

1341
02:31:57,323 --> 02:32:00,593
And it would also include creating a work plan,

1342
02:32:01,163 --> 02:32:09,593
which includes creating responsibilities and roles for the council members, and also training that they would go through,

1343
02:32:09,593 --> 02:32:21,133
such as of training and then thinking about how we can evaluate this council once we do a pilot on the council and the members.

1344
02:32:21,143 --> 02:32:25,793
So kind of thinking about long term and the sustainability of the council,

1345
02:32:27,243 --> 02:32:33,652
looking into the people will be looking into the resources time because whenever you implement something,

1346
02:32:33,653 --> 02:32:38,153
you know, it seems from the other side, sometimes it seems as supportive.

1347
02:32:38,603 --> 02:32:40,823
So you know, time, resources, finance,

1348
02:32:41,393 --> 02:32:49,433
all those are the people and even the outcome because it is unknown what's going to be the problem and how do we get a hold of this?

1349
02:32:49,433 --> 02:32:55,972
One is like maybe coordination and collaboration within the organization and different stakeholders and also doing

1350
02:32:55,973 --> 02:33:03,503
some research on the evidence based practice and other organization was implemented and what what are the outcomes.

1351
02:33:03,893 --> 02:33:08,513
So that's how we are going to mitigate those issues.

1352
02:33:09,233 --> 02:33:13,253
Yeah. And in terms of being reflective of the organization's patient population, of course,

1353
02:33:13,253 --> 02:33:18,803
taking the current patient population and ensuring that the council members are.

1354
02:33:21,813 --> 02:33:30,753
Have a variety of those, including age, race and income level, and making sure that all representatives or council members.

1355
02:33:38,263 --> 02:33:43,662
Nice job, both routes. I think the spirit here is to get the patients perspective.

1356
02:33:43,663 --> 02:33:49,423
So going back to the stakeholder chart, making sure you translate what you're doing into things that matter for patience,

1357
02:33:49,843 --> 02:33:57,433
it's a different feel that they know who you are. And one of the exercises I like a lot is the cancer patient walk.

1358
02:33:57,673 --> 02:34:01,573
How many steps your cancer patients have to take to get through your facility?

1359
02:34:02,123 --> 02:34:09,522
Incoming. Incoming. Check in, then go to labs, then go to imaging, then go to diagnostics and see if you can make that better for them.

1360
02:34:09,523 --> 02:34:14,502
Because there are people that are really having trouble getting, you know, really sick.

1361
02:34:14,503 --> 02:34:19,873
And so that's just an example. But nice job. Both teams, 9 to 10, we will start with you next time.

1362
02:34:20,623 --> 02:34:24,433
I don't know what the case is. Yes, but we'll start with you next time. So thanks for doing this.

1363
02:34:24,943 --> 02:34:32,982
Monday is MLK Day. There is a lot of programing available to spend time honoring Martin Luther King on campus or in the community.

1364
02:34:32,983 --> 02:34:36,283
So please take some time to do that on Monday.

1365
02:34:36,283 --> 02:34:47,983
But thanks for doing my job in case this is not a location dream.

1366
02:34:50,753 --> 02:34:56,953
But we just wanted to do that.

1367
02:34:57,103 --> 02:35:07,123
But then I was like, Maybe this is all going to be working.

1368
02:35:07,243 --> 02:35:13,033
We got to work out a lot of stuff like that.

1369
02:35:13,363 --> 02:35:20,363
I mean, I was never going to go out.
