1
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:14,127
Benjamin Franklin once said that in this
world nothing can be said to be certain

2
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:16,080
except death and taxes.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,810
I like to think that if he'd lived
a few hundred years later he might have

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,610
amended that to also add people's
urge to move to urban areas.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,390
Okay, maybe that's not the case,
but it is in fact the truth.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,930
So in this module we're going to
explore the concept of urbanization,

7
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,765
that is humans moving from traditional
settings, rural and agricultural,

8
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:37,680
to more urbanized settings.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,110
Now in 2008 we hit a very important
milestone, for the very first time in

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,490
human history 50% of humans in that
year now lived in urban areas.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,650
And that number has only continued to
increase, so just 10 years later that

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:57,040
number had shifted to 55% of the whole
human population living in urban areas.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,320
That's an epic shift in the places
that we've chosen to live but

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,970
that shift has not occurred
equally across the entire planet.

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,320
So if we look at the map here,
you can see for example,

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,235
North America has 82 percent of its
human population living in urban areas,

17
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:18,095
followed very closely by South America
at 81 percent and Europe at 74%.

18
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:21,396
But you can see that Asia and
the Australasia region and

19
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:25,344
Africa all have lower fractions
of people living in urban areas,

20
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:31,733
that actually presents opportunity for
for additional growth as we'll see.

21
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:35,156
One of the ways that we can look at
urbanization is by the type of country

22
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:39,125
that it's occurring in, specifically
by the income level of countries.

23
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:43,705
So we know from global data that
about 90% of urban population growth

24
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:47,175
is currently happening in low and
middle income countries and

25
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,480
that's very much expected to continue.

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,330
So if we look at the graph here, this is
data going back to 1950 and projected all

27
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,230
the way out to 2050, broken down by high
and middle and low-income countries.

28
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,460
So let's focus on the high
income countries first.

29
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,150
Here we see that the total population
living in urban areas in high-income

30
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,830
countries has been
relatively stable over time.

31
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,600
So the size or the thickness of
that bar is stable over time.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,950
On the other hand,
if we look at middle-income countries,

33
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,670
you can see that these represented
a relatively small fraction of the total

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,260
urban population back in
1950 to maybe the 1980s and

35
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,630
then we started to see this
very rapid acceleration

36
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,230
in the number of people living in urban
areas in middle-income countries.

37
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,050
To the point where projecting out to 2050,
the vast majority of urban residents

38
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,471
are expected to live in
middle-income countries.

39
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:45,182
Among low-income countries you can see
there were very few people living in urban

40
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:49,552
areas in the 1950s to 1970s and
then we've had a relatively slow and

41
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:53,273
monotonic increase since then.

42
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,561
So one thing we can think about in terms
of urbanization is the growth of so-called

43
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:02,380
megacities, these are urban areas that
have greater than 10 million residents.

44
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,430
And in fact that growth has been and is
expected to continue to occur primarily in

45
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,990
developing low or middle income countries.

46
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,430
So as we'll see in the sequence of maps
that we're going to go through in a moment

47
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,980
of the world's 20 most populous
megacities from 2010 projected

48
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,850
all the way out to 2100,
we're going to have a total of 13

49
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:27,070
African cities that will actually surpass
New York in size over the next 80 years.

50
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,850
So this first map we're looking at shows
the distribution of these top 20 mega

51
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,210
cities in 2010 and
you'll see that we have three in North and

52
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,420
Latin America,
there are three in South America.

53
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:45,040
Basically one in Northern Asia and
quite a few in South Asia and East Asia.

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,960
Now if we project out to 2025 we see that
North and South America are basically

55
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,960
unchanged but now the growth is
occurring primarily in South Asia and

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,660
we start to see some
cities emerge in Africa.

57
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,610
Going forward to 2050 we've now had
a shift of a couple of the 20 largest

58
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,000
cities from South America
to South Asia and Africa.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,960
By 2075 we're down to two
cities in North America and

60
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,840
none in South America among the top 20 and

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,570
we have the vast majority of megacities
now in Africa and South Asia.

62
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,330
And by the time we project out to 2100,
none of the top 20 mega cities

63
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,600
are in North or South America or
Europe or Northern Asia, basically all of

64
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,720
the urbanization and the largest 20 cities
now are focused in South Asia and Africa.

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,490
So I want to wrap up this short module
by noting that the areas these people

66
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,460
are moving to, these urban areas come in a
range of different characters and flavors.

67
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,480
So for example,
some of them might be elegant and

68
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,110
sophisticated like we see here
Manhattan in New York City.

69
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,840
Some of them are very distinctive and
unique like Cairo with its pyramids.

70
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,570
Unfortunately some of them particularly
I would say here in the Midwest of

71
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,770
the United States are relatively
monotonous and interchangeable.

72
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,048
However, as we learned in another module
about a third of the world's population

73
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:11,450
lives in slums and these are often dense
and crumbling and dangerous environments.

74
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,795
Moving forward we have to
think about how we design or

75
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:19,206
redesign our cities to make them
ideally more compact, more dense,

76
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:24,225
more pedestrian-friendly rather than
the way we've been designing them for

77
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:29,430
some decades which tends towards vast and
sprawling and automobile dependent.

78
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,720
So the design of urban areas will become
increasingly more critical as more and

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,520
more people continue to move to cities and
without good design we

80
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,296
can't hope to promote public health for
the folks living in these urban areas.
