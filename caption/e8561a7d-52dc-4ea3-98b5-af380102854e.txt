1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,800
So thank you. It's a great, great summary, really thoughtful mouthful.

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,980
And it's very clear that you've read or really got what I was hoping for you to get out of the reading.

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:21,130
So I really appreciate that. I know, I know this topic is really difficult to talk about.

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:30,950
So, you know, I, I guess I want to say that up at the top, you know, suicide is something that is very highly stigmatized.

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:40,130
It's. We'll talk about tens of thousands of people die from suicide this year.

6
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,940
Hundreds of thousands of people are affected by it, their loved ones in their communities.

7
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:53,209
So I just want to sort of say that the topic that we're going to talk about it in a very broad terms from a public health perspective.

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,720
So I'm not going to sort of I know the veterinary podcast, if you listen to it was very difficult to listen to at times.

9
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:07,420
We're not going to talk about anything like that, just questioning. So some reminders.

10
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:14,149
I want to remind you that checkpoint number four is due on the second. I'm still not even reading your checkpoint three, but it's not dependent on it.

11
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,490
So even though you should,

12
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:21,140
you're not going to change what you're doing for checkpoint number four in response to any feedback you're getting from me on checkpoint number three.

13
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,580
Reminder that there is no class next Wednesday, so I have to be out of town for a conference and you can just do this by Zoom.

14
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,330
But like I mentioned, given this conference is exactly at the time of this class.

15
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,460
So I continue to listen to my talk. It's not actually about what we're talking about here.

16
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,069
The last point is that I've added a new topic for us to talk about on November 22nd.

17
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:56,420
So our 21st party, which is on Monday. So we're going to have I've been so of a student that actually was in your seats years ago.

18
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,360
So she two years ago she took this class.

19
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,310
Then she did an independent study with me, then she graduated. Now she works on a study that I to tell you about today.

20
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,490
But she's going to talk to you about her project that she did on during her independent study,

21
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:20,000
which was a really interesting topic about direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications and how that relates to placebo response.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,370
I think you're going to love it, but we're also, in addition to her presenting on her project,

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,389
which kind of get inspired here, but then she did this larger independent study.

24
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,460
We'll talk a little bit about careers in public mental health.

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,029
I know a lot of you are kind of getting ready for grad school or thinking about what do you want to do with the rest of your life?

26
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,660
And I don't have the answer to either of those, but I think that we can at least chat about it.

27
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,629
Today we're going to talk about this mostly conceptual framework, some suicidal behavior,

28
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:54,380
and I'll show you some data that the sort of research that I'm doing now on using data science tools to understand the factors for suicide.

29
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,640
Next, because we don't have class a week from Wednesday, we're going to start our conversation about autism on Wednesday.

30
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,399
So it's another day. We're going to talk about suicide in class.

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,580
But of course, we're always welcome to chat, catch me in the hallway or we can have time to talk.

32
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:24,710
So I'm going to start off by you sort of just emphasizing that suicide is not a is not well understood.

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:34,220
And so if you read the it is both, but it is also both this like a topic that has been that people from everywhere,

34
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,320
from geneticists to philosophers are trying to understand.

35
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,690
Right. So like Albert Camus, who, you know, writes about, you know,

36
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,620
he wrote suicide is the only something like to the effect of suicide as the

37
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,679
only question or the only question of suicide or the only problem is suicide,

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,640
which is like what I interpret that to mean is the fundamental question is why get up?

39
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,130
Right. So he's a philosopher writing about this. And then you have people who are doing like genetic studies of suicide.

40
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,840
Right? So this is a this is a the I just sort of put this out there to say,

41
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,129
I'm not going to you're not going to leave here with a lot of answers about this phenomenon.

42
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,880
But I think that it's something that we need different tools to try to address and that that was part of the review article.

43
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,790
That was very, very long. And I know you read all of it even I haven't read probably every paragraph of it.

44
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,540
But the reason I gave you that is, and I'll summarize it today,

45
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,970
is that it helps emphasize sort of why we're in the situation where we don't really have answers.

46
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,720
So before I do that, I want us to this is not created. Of course, we take out a sheet of paper for me or just you can do in your head.

47
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,140
These are five questions that are all true or false.

48
00:04:42,620 --> 00:05:04,100
So I'd like you to tell me whether you think these statements are true or false. That's just.

49
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,830
Right. All right. So first one each year, there are more homicides than suicides in the United States.

50
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,180
Who thinks this is true? We certainly hear a lot about a lot more about homicide and suicide.

51
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,760
Right. So so the answer, this is false.

52
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,120
So there are about two and a half times more suicides in the United States annually than homicides in 2019,

53
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,680
which is the most recent year of data that I feel comfortable showing you based on the pandemic and all the data issues that have come with it.

54
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,070
There were, you know. 47,000 suicide deaths and only 60,000 homicide deaths.

55
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:19,660
The other part that's really important to understand here is that the vast majority of suicides in the United States occur by gun.

56
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,730
So what that means is that given that there's far more suicides and homicide deaths

57
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,100
and most of these in both cases are occurring predominantly through firearm,

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:40,630
that it means that when we are talking about gun violence in the United States in terms of number of people who die from firearms,

59
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,480
we are talking about suicide. The majority of people who die from firearms in this country die from suicide.

60
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,719
So but what's also important and this is going to we're going to talk about this in a second,

61
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,860
is that the population that is affected by these firearm suicides and the population that is affected by this homicide,

62
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,090
firearm homicides are two very, very different populations.

63
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,020
All right. As I'm going to tell you this, this is predominantly middle aged white men.

64
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,800
This is predominantly younger people of color. That is that is these are two totally different populations.

65
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:23,850
But because of it, you know, and you overlay this the difficulty our country has, what's kind of like talking about gun control, etc.,

66
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,760
but what I want you to kind of take away from it here is like if you actually look at like people who die from a firearm,

67
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,540
who are they in the United States? The majority of them were suicide deaths.

68
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,870
All right. The other thing.

69
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:47,790
So I told you, there's 47,000 suicides. The other thing to understand is, while that's a very large number, that's really just the tip of the iceberg.

70
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,940
So in addition to these suicide deaths each year,

71
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,990
there are an additional one and a half million suicide attempts and then another almost

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,900
3 million people who say that they've thought seriously about committing suicide.

73
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:08,370
What I want what I want you to know, this is data from SAMHSA, what I want you to notice about this graph.

74
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,820
So the smallest one is people who attempted suicide.

75
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,920
Yellow is people who made a plan, and the blue is people who thought about it.

76
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,640
What I want you to notice is that the red is not fully engulfed in the yellow.

77
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:28,649
So what that represents are people who have attempted suicide without seriously without making a plan that is an impulsive act,

78
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,870
a relatively impulsive act. This is important. It will come up later when we kind of talk about like, how could suicide be contagious?

79
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,140
Like, what would what would even be like? How could this the ultimate thing that somebody could do?

80
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,940
That's the fundamental question that Albert Camus gives us. How could this be impulsive?

81
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:52,140
Right. And so but the point is, is that you see this this is also explains why we see, for example,

82
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,820
when we put barriers up on the Golden Gate Bridge and things like this, which are these things are effective.

83
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,820
They do not just reduce suicide over time, suicide from that specific cause,

84
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,309
but they appear to specifically prevent these kind of impulsive acts of suicide.

85
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,070
And therefore, if I can get somebody across the Golden Gate Bridge safely,

86
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,450
they're not going to go try to buy a gun when they get to the upside look like they're just it's that's so it's an important thing to understand here.

87
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,109
But of course, this is not the largest group, but this is a group that exists or the next question,

88
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,550
women have a higher risk of suicidal behavior than men who thinks this is true.

89
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:45,000
Why do you think it's true? I. Okay. So I think if I'm remembering the data correctly, I think like men have higher suicide success rates.

90
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,850
Like where they actually die from suicide. But I don't know.

91
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,340
For some reason, I thought it might be the opposite for women. Like suicidal behavior.

92
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,480
Yeah. So. So, yeah. So the answer is it depends on what you mean.

93
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,900
So do we even have Iris with suicidal behavior? Well, depends on what you mean. We're talking about death from suicide.

94
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,860
That the answer is no.

95
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:12,030
But if we're talking about attempted suicide or think about suicide or have suicide risk factors like depression, the answer is yes.

96
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:19,260
So this is again showing you this is the report of a thinking plan, I mean, seriously thinking about.

97
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:28,080
And so you can see that women, particularly if this 18 to 24, but, you know, have more likely to report that.

98
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,680
And again, it's they're also twice as likely to attempt.

99
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:41,339
Now what contributes to the the difference in terms of this is that the the means of self harm.

100
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:50,010
So women are far more likely to attempt with something like ingestion or poisoning self-poisoning, which gives you time to save somebody.

101
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,800
Right. So there's, there's, there's time to intervene in the attempt versus something like a firearm.

102
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:03,270
Right. Which men are more likely to to use? So it's but if we were this, this already starts to complicate the problem.

103
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:13,440
Okay. Well, if I'm what I'm talking about and what it also introduces is the fact that not only is making an attempt different from thinking about it,

104
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,750
even thinking about it is different from dying. Right.

105
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,350
So all of these this is it is not the case that an attempt is just you should think about it.

106
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,610
Don't think about it. It's just like a severe form of depression or a severe form of ideation.

107
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:35,220
Or rather, these are actually different phenomenon. And this is this this is the type of data that starts to make us think this isn't just one thing.

108
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:42,810
It's not just that we're kind of talking about different parts of the elephant. And it's possible that things are different for the next one.

109
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,260
Teenagers, uh, teenagers have a higher suicide risk.

110
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,930
Who thinks this is true? Yeah, it seems like.

111
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,320
Okay. Well, again, it kind of depends on what I mean by risk.

112
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,890
So what I'm showing you here X is time. The Y axis is the mortality rate from suicide.

113
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,540
And what do you see? Who is the highest? Who is most likely to die from suicide in the United States?

114
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:17,860
The relation my five and older I got. So and here's teenagers actually here's your youngest teens are your 10 to 14 year teenagers.

115
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:24,950
So the risk of there's the rate of mortality is highest.

116
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,580
It increases with age. This is true in the United States, as is true in most other countries.

117
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:35,390
But the reason that you think suicides are more the teenagers have the highest risk is because thankfully,

118
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,970
there's not a whole lot of things that kill you when you were a teenager.

119
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,030
And so suicide is the second leading cause of death of teenagers in the United States.

120
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,040
But the number of people who die from suicide that are these ages is many,

121
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,850
many, many times smaller than the number of older adults who die from suicide.

122
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:01,370
So it's because there aren't other competing injury as competing causes of death that allows suicide versus you think about a 75 year old.

123
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,330
Suicide is not a leading cause of death for a 75 year old, even though the vast majority, even though suicide risk is high.

124
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,840
Why is it not a leading cause of death? Because all everything else is a leading cause of death up here.

125
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,950
This is cancer, heart disease, diabetes. This is stroke. Right.

126
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:23,840
So it's but but because there are so many more deaths happening, the mortality rate is higher for older adults.

127
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,780
Next question. Most people who die from suicide were depressed.

128
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,450
This is true. It seems like. So this is data from the CDC.

129
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,040
So this is false. Now, with the caveat, there should be an asterisk here.

130
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,280
So this is data. I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you some data that we're using from the CDC,

131
00:13:50,280 --> 00:14:01,930
data that 54 they estimate that 54% of people who died from suicide did not have a known mental health condition tell you that this is on.

132
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:10,110
So it doesn't mean that a person wasn't struggling with something and it doesn't mean the person wasn't struggling with something.

133
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,630
But if you look at did family or friends know that a doctor know where they're being treated,

134
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:21,000
etc., the answer is only about half of people would be with this case.

135
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:28,770
And again, remember back to what I just showed you about how men are more likely to die from suicide, but women are more likely to attempt.

136
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,370
Who is most likely to have depression? Okay.

137
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,030
So, again, indicating that the the problem of suicide mortality,

138
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,450
the public health problem of suicide mortality is not the same as the public health problem of depression.

139
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,660
Okay. I see that these are the these are not I'm not saying they're completely independent.

140
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:59,580
They're overlapping, but they are not concentric circles. Last one.

141
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,190
The rate of suicide varies geographically. Know from the geography of Los.

142
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:12,480
So this is true. So in the United States, U.S. counties that are more rural have a higher rate of suicide than those are more urban.

143
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,230
The states in the West have higher rates than states in the East.

144
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,540
You may have heard about like the stroke belt, which people kind of talk about is running across these deep, deep South states.

145
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,570
We also have a suicide bombing on the mountains. Okay.

146
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,269
So you can see that it's that there's one this here is West Virginia.

147
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:37,110
Predominantly, you're in a very rural area. But you can see here in Michigan that the rate of suicide is higher in the U.P., where we're more rural.

148
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,170
But even then, it's it's consistently higher here in the West.

149
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,280
And I should also say, like, if you were to overlay a map of wouldn't it wouldn't look exactly like this.

150
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,000
And if you were overlay a map of substance use, it wouldn't look exactly like this.

151
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,790
So there is it's again, to the point of it's not that they're completely independent,

152
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,980
but they're not they're not simply like another way to measure the same construct.

153
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,190
In addition, we talked about this a little bit already when we talked about in our studio that the rate of suicide varies drastically.

154
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:24,420
So this is from the geography of Los. So there are several nations that have a suicide mortality rates that are higher than the United States.

155
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,400
So Russia, Japan, South Korea and Finland all have rates higher than the U.S.

156
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,460
There are lots of also there are many, many nations that have rates that are lower than us and we trust their data.

157
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:42,480
So there's lots of places, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, where it is literally illegal to die from suicide.

158
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,260
So there are like no suicide deaths in Saudi Arabia.

159
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:53,250
It's like, of course that's not true. Of course that's not true. But that's what their official statistics have.

160
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,800
You have, you know, so these but these are states where I do believe their data.

161
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,720
So these are places that are not safe nations, but we do believe their data that actually have lower rates than me and the United States.

162
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:11,130
And it's you know, it's hard to sort of say like, well, what's you know, but you can sort of think hypothesis generating.

163
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,510
Well, what's similar about Japan and Finland? You know, I don't know.

164
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:23,280
Or maybe they're not maybe there isn't something similar actually there. But the point is, is that it's helpful to kind of understand this.

165
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,290
This is a global phenomenon and it does vary across different places.

166
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,860
I know Greenland has the highest rate of suicide. It also has a extraordinarily small population.

167
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,799
So I'm not I would I would it's true that this place has a very high rate.

168
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,850
But if you exclude Greenland, these are the top one places in the world.

169
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,870
So just to summarize and I'll pause for questions about these kind of big picture statistics.

170
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,950
So the in the United States, the annual rate of suicide is about 13 or 14 per 100,000 per year.

171
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,409
It is currently the 12th leading cause of death. It was the 10th leading cause of suicide.

172
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:09,000
Risk varies by age, gender, race and geography. It's highest among Native Americans, Alaska natives and non-Hispanic whites.

173
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,430
It's very difficult to do comparisons, particularly for a Native American population,

174
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,680
because it's so much smaller than the rest of the populations that matter is just so much less stable.

175
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,110
So you can get really big differences. They don't necessarily it doesn't necessarily mean that they're meaningful.

176
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,700
And in the United States, middle aged white men, which was think like 35 to 55,

177
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,130
is the bracket that they consider account for almost 70% of suicide deaths in the United States.

178
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,620
And then the last thing I'll say before I take questions is that suicide risk is distinct from depression and other mental disorders.

179
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,490
And even among those with serious mental illness, most will not die from suicide.

180
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:55,170
Leading causes of death for somebody with schizophrenia or depression or anxiety are the same as the leading causes of death for everybody.

181
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,170
Heart disease and cancer. Okay, so questions about that.

182
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:12,850
So for like statistics about like suicide in different countries, like,

183
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:23,550
I know like in Finland pass or passive euthanasia, like voluntary assisted suicide is legal, you know.

184
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,710
Are there like any statistics on like how that affects suicide mortality rates in the countries or areas where it is legal?

185
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:40,630
That's a great question. So it's it's one. So, yeah, many European nations, not all, but many European nations do have a death with dignity type laws.

186
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:50,729
And, you know, they these are accessible under certain very specific conditions by and even in the United States,

187
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:58,080
we have several states that have documented laws. My I, I can off the top of my head, I don't know the answer.

188
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,680
My hypothesis would be that those laws are passed in this country.

189
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,930
Actually, I don't even want to speculate. I'm going to just say I don't know the answer, but I'll find out for you.

190
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:29,070
Questions. Yeah. For those like moral and religious societies, higher other factors that speak to the standards.

191
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:37,890
Yeah. So that's a great question. So this is sort of what we're going to talk a little bit about how the kind of

192
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,240
conceptual models as to why people think this map might look the way it looks.

193
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,110
So. Remember one of the. Or maybe not. But on the very first day of class, I showed you a data from Emile Durkheim,

194
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,330
who had also shown geographic variation in suicide of his on his map was not urban.

195
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,610
His map was predominantly Catholic areas and predominantly Protestant areas.

196
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,610
Like not, the rate of suicide was lower in prominently Catholic areas.

197
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,650
This hypothesis was that this effect of the really the social control that the church exudes over the population.

198
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,740
So you couldn't have a funeral mass, you couldn't be buried in a Catholic cemetery.

199
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,210
But also, there are social control in terms of how you get absolution from sin.

200
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:23,550
Right. And so that the net result was this idea that sort of this is keeping people.

201
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:34,000
Here we are. Okay. So the this is a preamble to say, like, are there elements here that are.

202
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,200
Promoting social disengagement in some ways or barriers to social cohesion.

203
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:48,600
There's certainly also the concern about concern about factors of like firearm ownership is going to be greater in a lot of these rural areas.

204
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:54,510
A lot of this is for like, you know, hunting and other types of things that people would be using a firearm for.

205
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:03,300
There's a colleague here at the School of Social Work who does work with suicide prevention among Alaska Native communities,

206
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,850
where, you know, it's unheard of to not own a gun. And especially in rural areas of Alaska, just like there's literally like, you know.

207
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:17,010
So but that what their intervention is on safe firearm storage.

208
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,890
So that's one of the arms that is to prevent that kind of impulsive act.

209
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,200
So you keep your wallet separate from your gun. You keep those things locked up there.

210
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,629
And look, these are different, you know what I mean?

211
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:35,940
So the idea that like every one of these things, these intentions create time, that in a moment of crisis.

212
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,990
So, you know the universe, it's so sorry.

213
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:51,780
The last thing I'll say is that there's also, you know, if it's a longer distance to a health care facility that can save you.

214
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,600
Like suicide mortality would be higher even if the amount of attempts is the same.

215
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:07,260
So it's heartbreaking. But I can tell you that this fact, this relationship, that the rate of suicide is higher in rural areas, it's true everywhere.

216
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:15,149
So I'm not going to show your data on this today. But one of the big findings with the Organization of China over the last 30

217
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,150
years is there's been a dramatic decline in the rate of suicide in that country.

218
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:28,470
And what what that was driven by was that the increased, we think, increased economic opportunity for women in rural areas.

219
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,510
So now we'll be able to go into the city.

220
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:37,920
And it's because what was happening is that women were in these are agricultural areas and we're self-poisoning with pesticides and stuff.

221
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,299
And now the economic development has opened up all these new opportunities.

222
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:51,340
And so this is not while some of this might be a unique U.S. component, this finding that is higher in rural areas is not a U.S. question.

223
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:59,610
There was not statistic that after COVID, it's now the 12th, because even worse.

224
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,450
Is that because of it? It's the leading cause.

225
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,930
Yes. COVID COVID bumped suicide down.

226
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:15,389
And and there was also an increase in like kidney, kidney disease or something like this, again, probably as a result of COVID.

227
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:20,370
So that I guess I guess the other thing I would say, though, is that what scares us?

228
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,490
Yeah. This is this is older data. But the other thing that's that I would say is we talked about substance abuse last week,

229
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:37,410
and we're not going to have not have time to talk about misclassification today, but it is unless there is clear intent.

230
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,069
That is a medical examiner. There's a there's a note.

231
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,220
There's clear intent. An overdose is going to be ruled accidental.

232
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,330
And so that the increase in overdose mortality.

233
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,750
We think that at least some of that is suicide, but it's being misclassified.

234
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,590
So if you were to count that as those as suicide to at least some portion of that would still be in the top ten.

235
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:09,400
But yet. Correct. It's just we got to figure out what causes these lines.

236
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm just wondering when they know why the mortality rate among 75 year olds is.

237
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:25,680
So I just never heard them. So this is so this is like I'm going to tell you about this quite a bit today.

238
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:36,570
So the but I think the short answer is we don't know why, but it's very understudied and I guess we kind of prophesies.

239
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:42,250
These are things where actually let me let me pause on that now.

240
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:48,810
Let's return to that question, if you can, because I've got to tell you some theories as to why people think suicide occurs, period.

241
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,309
And so let's let's then we can come back. That's a great point that we can connect that back to.

242
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,420
This is okay.

243
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,340
All right. So to that point, let's talk about conceptual frameworks, suicidal behavior.

244
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,480
So the first time I'm going to tell you about and I guess is before we even get here, has a preamble.

245
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,930
So you might you might think maybe you don't think, but I could say, like, you know,

246
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:24,170
there's there's you think science is like data or experiments and inference, right?

247
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,910
But the point before you get to data, you have to have a conceptual model.

248
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,690
The conceptual model is putting bounds on what is a reasonable question to ask.

249
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,500
Without the model like you know astrology is okay to have is like a warrior is honest like right you're like I'm sorry,

250
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,370
you know, I'm glad that you're Libra, but it has absolutely nothing to do with her.

251
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,890
They actually did a twin study of this one to show how that may make no difference.

252
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:57,209
Not a lot. Back back to the topic. So the conceptual model puts bounds on what is a reasonable scientific question.

253
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:03,690
It puts it helps us interpret findings. So the first model I'm going to tell you about is Durkheim's model.

254
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:11,160
That is the model that we revisited just a second ago about where he was comparing suicide rates in Catholic areas,

255
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:21,360
predominantly Catholic areas, predominantly Protestant areas. And the his argument is that suicide risk varies along three axes.

256
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,020
One is social integration of nations is a sense of belonging.

257
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:31,440
Do you feel like you're part of a group? The other is social regulation.

258
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,569
So it's like do you sort of do other people? Do you pay attention to other people's expectations?

259
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:43,680
Do you modulate your behavior based on their expectations and then social role that is,

260
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:51,809
do you have a role that is you're kind of not going anywhere or do you have one that's being disruptive?

261
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,600
So think maybe like a major commercial.

262
00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:05,730
So what's the situation where and his argument is that suicide risk increases at each of these extremities so that the sweet spot is right here.

263
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,600
This is this is the lowest suicide rate that you can imagine. This is like a three dimensional smile.

264
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:16,109
So what are situations of where you can imagine of high social integration,

265
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,690
very high sense of belonging and why this would be associated with suicide?

266
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,600
You imagine a scenario with this. Yes. Yes.

267
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,680
So this is this. Yes. So more social integration, right?

268
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,969
This is for somebody who's alone, doesn't have lot. Right. This makes more sense to us.

269
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,890
But this is this would be a situation up here.

270
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:46,229
What's a situation where we might have I guess we could be the same sort of thing or one example would be the same thing of high social regulation,

271
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,290
right? Where your the group is telling you what to do.

272
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,540
Right. That would be an example of very high social regulation. That is very low self autonomy.

273
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,690
But also if you have very low if you're if this is the group down here, this is like I'm an island.

274
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,340
Nobody's I own. I don't owe nobody nothing.

275
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,890
Nobody owes me nothing. Right. That's this that's this attitude out here.

276
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,380
The idea of social role, the stagnation would be like I'm a burden to others.

277
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,700
This is going to come back up in a second. We're talking about psychological theories or disruptive that everything's changing too once.

278
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,420
Okay. So so the sociological model of suicidal behavior predicts that you sort of

279
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:34,860
these these are the dimensions that are along which suicide risk can be root.

280
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,399
That's one. So I'm going to ask you to keep these in mind,

281
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,960
and we'll return to the question of why my older adults be more likely to have a higher rate of suicide.

282
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,550
Second model of suicide. What you remember to tell you about a psychological model.

283
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,180
So this model I told you about, this idea of burdensome ness.

284
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,340
So is this idea would look similar, but there are some differences.

285
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,150
Is the idea that I'm a verdict on others, that is people.

286
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:09,329
Other people would be better off without me. The way this often gets expressed belongingness, both worded belongingness.

287
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:17,740
So this is loneliness, this is bonding. To have more social connection that you have this you saw this on a sociological point as well.

288
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,900
I suppose both of these models argue that these ideas are important.

289
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,769
What's interesting about this model is it adds the third piece, which is capability for suicide.

290
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:37,020
And the reason that this is on here is because we know the strongest predictor of suicide mortality is having a prior attempt.

291
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,399
So they have this piece, what they call capability for suicide.

292
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:50,070
So this would be this this is this additional variable that is not represented in these sociological models.

293
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:58,740
Okay. And so the other thing I should say is that this model is nice and that it distinguishes suicidal ideation,

294
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,879
which they have, unfortunately, that you this is I just cut and paste this from their paper.

295
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,380
So they have unfortunately called this desire for suicide. But the way to think about this is thinking about suicide.

296
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:13,980
Okay. So they see that as the intersection of burdensome this and thwarted belongingness.

297
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,830
But the attempt is they distinguish.

298
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:24,509
So this model is helpful in that it helps to sort of illustrate this isn't this isn't a situation of concentric circles,

299
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:30,240
but rather it's the specific combination of risk and risk factors that come in.

300
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,350
Think about the the podcast about vets right here.

301
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:45,360
Right? So this is exposure to death, you know, an access to lethal effects that that the podcast about that's right here.

302
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:56,920
Okay another model from our cultural model suicidal behavior is this thing called television series,

303
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:04,320
which the terror that it's referring to is like the existential terror of knowing that some of you are going to die someday.

304
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,970
So we say that every year, I promise I would never die.

305
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:17,460
So the but the the literally this is this is sort of the existential terror.

306
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:29,370
So what what it argues is that we all know that we're all going to die and that that

307
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:35,580
fear of that unavoidable mortality leads us to want to make have a meaningful life.

308
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:48,450
And we just basically construct meaning for the sole purpose of distracting us from this

309
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:55,960
existential anxiety of our own mortality and suicide risk increases when those meanings,

310
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:02,730
when those sort of constructions don't work anymore, what they they don't they don't they're able to function as much.

311
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,600
And so a lot of what they argue is as to why these these kind of meaningful this this idea of like,

312
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:18,900
I want to live a meaningful life, that those start to fall apart is the idea about sort of like increased exposure to death.

313
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,150
Right. So that's what this is.

314
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:29,040
They talk about that associated some stimulus that is like sort of like just to be reminded of mortality.

315
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:37,650
And again, the argument is that this these we generate culture to.

316
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:48,020
These are existential anxiety about mortality. The last one I'm going to tell you about it.

317
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,300
And then we'll we'll kind of return to this question of why do suicide risk increase with age?

318
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:00,040
Is the social contagion model of suicide behavior? This is that 13 reasons why reading or the 13 reasons why you inspired by this.

319
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,810
So this is called the Verner effect. This is a from a.

320
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,089
It's named after a character in a novel who dies from suicide.

321
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:15,340
And the thought was that just reading this book was associated with a rash of suicides

322
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,350
of people who were the same age as this protagonist in the novel who died from suicide.

323
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:24,820
So it's kind of a stretch, you know, when you think about it, like that's where it comes from.

324
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:32,020
But I will say there's a there's actually quite a bit of empirical data to support this, but not necessarily the United States.

325
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,709
But this is a chart showing there was a broadcast.

326
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,180
I think this is you know what?

327
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:51,460
I'm sorry, this I think this is Germany. There were two broadcasts of a series where this character in this TV series died by suicide five times.

328
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:58,719
And the number of suicides through that from that exact same dangerous increased after

329
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,470
this post the first time the series is shown and the second time the series is shown.

330
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:07,900
So again, showing that not just overall but through this exact same method.

331
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,350
This is from the 13 reasons why a chart are that reading that you read.

332
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,630
Again, for those of you not familiar, this is a fictional series about a high school girl who dies from suicide.

333
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:24,640
I've not watched this because I'm not going to the degree to which I think that contagion happens.

334
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,880
I don't want to support Netflix in my watching something that I think would be harmful to people.

335
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:38,080
I feel like this paper is probably the first time I've ever seen in JAMA the word influencer show up, which is probably a low point in humanity.

336
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,520
But so. So.

337
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:50,170
But what they found is that indeed, there was an increase in suicide deaths among this age group, target age group.

338
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,520
And that increase was larger for women relative to men.

339
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,140
And they compare that to women age that are older.

340
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:08,649
So this 35, that's that's the comparison. Now, the Verner Effect says that it should be the same method, like that's the suicide contagion.

341
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,430
It's not just suicide as a phenomenon, but the suicide using a specific method.

342
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:19,050
And they did not look at that in the study because these outcomes are extraordinarily rare.

343
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,680
So this y axis here is number of people and it goes up to 150 at the most.

344
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,330
This is for. Sorry.

345
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,170
This. Yeah, sorry. This top one. This is messed up here. It goes up to 250.

346
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:43,160
Where's my. It was up to 100. Okay. So these are actually not common events, so just kind of keep everything with a grain of salt.

347
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,740
They do have these confidence bands around their estimate, so that's helpful to see.

348
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:55,320
But you can see this is the line here is the broadcast and then this is the the increase they see immediately immediately afterwards.

349
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:01,860
Or that they think they see. This is from Vienna.

350
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:11,450
This is data showing not that not the broadcast, but a change in media reports of how media talked about suicide in 1988.

351
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,750
They changed the reporting guidelines in terms of what you could actually say about suicide deaths.

352
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:24,960
And they report today is that the you saw this increase that was happening after reporting we got a decline in suicide deaths.

353
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:34,259
So, again, this is a public health interest because it suggests that the way that we talk about suicide can actually change risk of suicide,

354
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,590
which I can't think of another outcome where that would be the case. Okay.

355
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,500
Is this the possibility of this effect?

356
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,040
Again, I'm not the data on this is not perfect.

357
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,689
And it doesn't it's I'm not saying that it's a very strong relationship,

358
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,809
but if there some there's evidence that is consistent with it, but it has informed these reporting guidelines.

359
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:03,690
So I actually wonder, because I don't see these often covered or followed in the media,

360
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:11,040
but the media does have reporting guidelines that specifically guard against you should not report the method of injury.

361
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:24,420
You should not talk about not to minimize the sensationalize, to include the hotline number.

362
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:38,630
Again. So just do not do not provide details about the essentially the death, because that's the argument as the that's the contagion.

363
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:47,120
That's the conclusion that. So let's go back to this this chart.

364
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,470
So why don't you think this chart looks the way it does?

365
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:58,610
Based on what I just told you. What might be some reasons why it looks like now with the caveat that nobody really knows?

366
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:06,680
Yeah. Well, thinking about the psychological model, I feel like 75 and over are more likely to fall into the boat.

367
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,650
I am alone due to like other people that they love dying.

368
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,640
And then I am a burden because they might have, like, increased needs for physical health reasons.

369
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:23,870
Very good. Yeah. So there could be some influence from the social contagion model, because in that age group,

370
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,090
I feel like the highest frequency where you see like death happening all around you,

371
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:34,310
like a lot of the people your age or around your age have died or are dying and you might be dying yourself.

372
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,940
So that could lead to some kind of not like general, but like just like being surrounded by that exposure could have some kind of influence.

373
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:46,790
I agree. I would probably put that under like the term management model rather than the social contagion model.

374
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:54,770
But your point is well taken. That exposure to that is increases as you get older.

375
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:05,820
Right. And yes, the church and state cultural level, it's like retired and like not giving as much as they used to.

376
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,719
So they're probably thinking more about like, Oh, I'm getting closer to death just because you're aging out so well.

377
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:20,940
And yeah, it's like, where are the new meaningful roles, right? So here life is like your age, the world of possibilities right here.

378
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,419
It's, you know, there's less new, are there?

379
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,710
There's less models of kind of like positive aging.

380
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,930
Right. And so or I shouldn't even say positive aging, but there's less models of here are these new, generative, meaningful ones.

381
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,540
When we talk about prevention intervention in a few weeks,

382
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:41,729
we're going to talk about this intervention called experience for this directly trying to address this population,

383
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:49,490
which is its whole experience with the idea of like you have lots of experience, let's find new opportunities for you to engage with the world, right?

384
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:56,910
And so specifically around this, the other things that are happening, you know, in midlife here, so these are not groups.

385
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,960
So 25 to 44, these are not groups that have a lot of health conditions going on.

386
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,580
But what what is happening what's happening with them that's maybe different than these younger age groups?

387
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,340
Midlife crisis, divorce, kids, stress of life in general.

388
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:23,379
Yeah. So there's there's potentially more, you know, if we if we start again,

389
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:29,660
I'm not saying any of these models is correct, but if we were to think about ideas of social roles changing, right.

390
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:42,310
So whether that's something like a divorce or a job change or even positive things like, you know, a new job, job if you want, or having children.

391
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:46,750
Right. That these are things that cause massive disruptions in social roles.

392
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:52,820
And so that's different than when we're looking at the younger, you know, these younger age groups.

393
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,460
Okay. So it helps, I think, too. And I think you can you can think about those models and think about any of these data,

394
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,610
you know, but I'm not I'm not I'm not saying any one of them is correct,

395
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:16,230
but it's it's helpful to have those conceptual models as a way to think about why do these charts look the way they do were like, oh, okay.

396
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:23,040
So the question is about to me, ask if there are questions about these different models before anyone.

397
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:35,120
Okay. So I told you at the beginning of class, not today, but literally started months ago.

398
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,450
Now it seems like God. Now it's not you, it's me.

399
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,900
But. But the the idea of this class is also about epistemology in the sense of, like, how do we know what we know?

400
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:54,170
How do we know anything? I just told you and we know that. So most research is on suicide comes from one of three places.

401
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,100
So it might come from a survey or a self-report data.

402
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:05,659
And you did. So you interviewed each other with scales that are used by the government and by like the best,

403
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,290
the best we have to like measure depression and substance and alcohol use.

404
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:15,649
All right. So you we you did something you saw you saw with these measures on the other place that

405
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:19,280
we might get information is from emergency department records or healthcare records.

406
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,100
Right. And like if you attempted suicide or if you your doctor ask you about suicide and you told them they were thinking about it.

407
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,480
But the vast majority of everything I just showed you is coming from mortality records,

408
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:37,760
which by definition means that all of the information that's in those records is being recorded by somebody else.

409
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,940
There's the person I want to talk to is no longer here. Okay.

410
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:49,190
So the and in addition to the fact that now I'm one step removed from the person I actually want to talk to,

411
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,229
there's we know there is massive misclassification of cause of death,

412
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,750
particularly when differentiating intentional versus unintentional overdose and most mortality records.

413
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:06,230
I'm going to show you the exception, but most mortality records have very little information beyond demographic characteristics,

414
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,300
like what's on or what's on a death certificate.

415
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:17,210
Again, the health care records only a portion of people who attempt suicide make it to an emergency department to get care for it.

416
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:23,449
There's still misclassification. This would be coded as an E code or an injury code if a doctor coded, it is that.

417
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:28,850
But they don't necessarily have to code. It is that. And screening for suicidal ideation is almost never done.

418
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:39,110
And even if it was done to just the effectiveness of it is suspect and the survey measures that you did in class.

419
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:47,180
As I've told you before, these are these are not just another way to measure suicidal behavior.

420
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,400
Severe depression is not the same as suicide ality. These are different phenomenon.

421
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:59,120
So there's more they're correlated. But they are they do not they're not that strongly predictive.

422
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,790
And this is from the Franklin paper that I asked you to read, which summarized that.

423
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,929
And there's the small, homogeneous set of risk factors that have been examined over time.

424
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:12,590
They reviewed 50 years of research, and basically over that 50 years,

425
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:20,450
they said 80% of everything that we've marked of the research that's been done on suicide has focused on these five factors.

426
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:30,679
And each of these is kind of broad. But if you think about 50 years of of the last 50 years of cancer research, it's not even close.

427
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:36,229
Right? Like 50 years ago, nobody was talking about immunotherapy. And now that's that's the breakthrough, right?

428
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,970
We've got these new drugs that, again, they don't work for everybody. But if they work, they work.

429
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,960
But if you think about the amount of increased knowledge we've got about preventing heart disease,

430
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:53,420
treating cancer, treating diabetes, it's it's very different.

431
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:02,629
And this they have this quote that I love in the sense of it's always nice when people are like usually scientific papers.

432
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:09,230
I'm sure you've noticed this are very dry. They don't, you know, they're like, well, we could possibly, maybe do that.

433
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,450
But instead, like, I love it when they're very direct.

434
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:20,450
And so to say this and by and large, this field has conducted essentially the same studies over and over again for 50 years.

435
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:27,950
That's pretty damning criticism of the field.

436
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:33,530
And, you know, and they they go on to say that the predictive ability that it's like,

437
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,080
can we predict who's going to die from suicide, that we basically we're no better off today than we were 50 years ago.

438
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:51,680
So that that is an important and it's important to kind of again, take this has like what it is, which is a call to action and their followed action.

439
00:46:51,680 --> 00:47:00,080
What did they argue that we should do are using better methods, including data science tools, to examine multiple risk factors simultaneously.

440
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,780
So so not because of not only because of this paper, but in part because of this paper.

441
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,260
This is we launched a study last year called the Atlas study.

442
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,870
So this is Lilly who's going to come and talk to you in a few weeks who took this class a couple of years ago,

443
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,270
is the project coordinator for this study.

444
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:25,940
But let me tell you about what we're trying to do in response to this now, not only in response to the financial paper, but it's part in response.

445
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,459
So the first so so the goal of, I should say broadly,

446
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:39,560
the goal of this the ATLAS study is to understand how major life transitions over the whole life span.

447
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:45,770
So we've got we have data from of all ages. We're predominantly focused on age 25 and up.

448
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:57,950
But with we've got data on everybody, how major life transitions in work, in housing, in health and in social relationships relate to suicide risk.

449
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:03,110
And this work started with some work that we were doing on older adults,

450
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:09,440
specifically related to older adults who might be transitioning into long term care like assisted living, nursing homes, etc.

451
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,890
So let me tell you about that work.

452
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:20,480
This this idea that I'm going to represent are the fundamental methods and the kind of main idea we can apply to any life transition.

453
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:28,760
So the goal of this first project that we did within Atlas was to understand suicide risk during transitions into residential long term care.

454
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:33,600
So we wanted to identify suicide deaths that are occurring in or during these transitions.

455
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:39,959
Why is this important? Well, residential care is a lot of people live in there.

456
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,270
So almost 9 million older adults interact with residential care in some manner.

457
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:54,180
Each year, about 3 million older adults currently live in long term care and a 25% of Medicare beneficiaries currently live in residential care.

458
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:03,350
These are the number of nursing homes the United States has been on a precipitous decline over the last 20 years,

459
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,150
the number of assisted living facilities at 88 degrees.

460
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:15,150
Anybody want to guess why? Who pays for long term care?

461
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,370
So this is Medicaid. So Medicare does not pay for long term care.

462
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,550
Medicaid pays for long term care, but you don't get Medicaid unless you have a lower income.

463
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:36,300
So what ends up happening is that people will transfer assets like they'll give their kids the house and their money,

464
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,520
etc., like transfer in order to qualify for Medicaid, which pays which does not have great reimbursement rates.

465
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:48,290
Who pays for assisted living facilities? Your insurance pay.

466
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:58,070
No insurance covers. I says you're the average cost of a monthly rent in an assisted living facility in Michigan.

467
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,590
Yes. It's $10,000, not ten, but it's like four.

468
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:13,010
So but I don't know if, you know, I have a lot of grandma and grandpa got an extra four grand lying around for however long they got left.

469
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,430
Right. So the point is, is that these are and free do other things.

470
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,480
The last thing I'll say is that assisted living facilities are entirely regulated by the state.

471
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,140
Entirely regulated by the state. There is no federal regulation of assisted living facilities.

472
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:32,050
Nursing homes because they take Medicaid are regulated by the federal government.

473
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:39,910
What that means is that what counts as an assisted living facility and the licensing requirements and like how much staffing you need to have,

474
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,580
etc., is entirely dictated by the state.

475
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:50,080
So in Virginia, where I was living when we started this work, you could open an assisted living facility in your home with two beds,

476
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,290
which meant people would be like taking care of their mom or dad.

477
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:59,290
And I just like to get the guestroom issue because this is these are not providing care.

478
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,189
These are providing help with like getting dressed and taking your medications.

479
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:06,400
But they don't provide there's no nurse involved. Okay.

480
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:13,390
So anyway, so in 2011, SAMHSA, the substance abuse,

481
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,530
mental health or Mental Health Services Administration came out with this toolkit on

482
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:22,309
how to promote mental health in these what they called senior living communities.

483
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:29,730
So that's their term. I don't. But what I'm going to use that to mean residential long term care, but also potentially age restricted communities.

484
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:35,110
Right. So if you have to be 50 and above or 55 and above, you'll see there's lots of apartments in Ann Arbor that, for example, that require that.

485
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,030
So they released this toolkit. And this is this is a BI toolkit.

486
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:46,190
I mean, these are recommendations for people who work in these facilities on how to promote mental health of their residents.

487
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,280
Right. That's the that's the purpose of this toolkit.

488
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:54,400
But on page two of this toolkit, they have this quote, which is there are few reliable statistics.

489
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:58,300
And I was like, well, I could probably help with that. I can probably figure that out.

490
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,670
And I'm going to show you how I figured it out.

491
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:08,890
But the reason that we also might think about I why this is an interesting setting or maybe an important setting for thinking about suicide

492
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:16,330
prevention is that people who are living in residential like long term care or in like an what they call senior living communities,

493
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:22,660
they may have more risk factors for suicide like depression and isolation and pain and functional impairment,

494
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:29,500
but they also might have protective factors like hopefully it's less difficult to get a gun.

495
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:37,390
And, you know, it's just like although in Virginia, this was not the case, there is hopefully access to psychiatric care more readily available.

496
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:41,350
And, you know, there hopefully are more opportunities for social interaction.

497
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,110
Right. So this there could be reverses living in the community.

498
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:51,850
Right. So how do we figure this out? So we use a dataset called the National Violent Death Reporting System.

499
00:52:51,850 --> 00:53:00,040
So this exists largely and as a result of the advocacy efforts of NAMI and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention,

500
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,450
which have been arguing for funding for this registry for many, many years.

501
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:08,409
And so this is a state based surveillance system of violent deaths.

502
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:12,370
So that includes suicides, homicides, undetermined deaths and terror related deaths.

503
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,690
And what it has is, in addition to all the data that you would have in a certificate,

504
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:27,309
it has all of these additional variables that are created by the state reporters from these sort these original source documents.

505
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:31,200
And I've actually gotten to talk with people at many of these different states, state senate.

506
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,840
Right. So they actually have the physical documents and they're doing this data entry.

507
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:43,750
We we now in our dataset, we have data on over 300,000 deaths from all 50 states, including Puerto Rico.

508
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:52,690
And this is what the CDC says is the purpose of this data set to identify the who, the when, the where and the how to provide incentives to the why.

509
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,550
One of the things that we're using. So 300,000 is a big number.

510
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,200
Right. So this is a large dataset.

511
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:08,079
But what's really exciting about this dataset is for every one of those 300,000 deaths, I have what's called a text narrative.

512
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:14,830
So this is a paragraph that the abstracts has written that was describing what was happening in the person's life at the time of their death.

513
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:23,170
So I literally have a it's not a lot, right, but I have a paragraph that is describing what was happening.

514
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:30,220
And so now I don't know about you, but like I don't have time to read 300,000 paragraphs, right?

515
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,000
But I can teach a machine to read 300,000 kids.

516
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:44,020
So now you we all use have exposure to these sorts of natural language processing machine learning algorithms all the time.

517
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,040
This is what is your spam filter? This is your predictive text.

518
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:52,030
Okay? Like you have exposure to these like literally on a daily basis,

519
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:59,620
but we can use them to in addition to like trying to figure out, do you want to like what, what emoji you want?

520
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,210
Send this person based on your past history or whatever, talking to them.

521
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:12,390
We can use it to identify like processes out these algorithms to identify cases of suicide that are related to

522
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:18,480
residential and long term care related to we use that general term and should we tell you what I mean by that?

523
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,780
But so the point is we're going to train an algorithm to to identify cases that I'm looking for.

524
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:32,909
So this is an example. This is not an exact narrative. I've changed many of the details to term, but this gives you a sense of what this looks like.

525
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:39,570
So this is this person was in their apartment, an assisted living facility when they died.

526
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,640
You can see that a lot of the rest of it is describing the scene. But then there's also elements.

527
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,210
This person talks about being in pain.

528
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:58,770
This person is also it's clear they had done things to this was not a this was not a this was this was intentional.

529
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:04,890
This was not an impulsive act because they can tell from the narrative this person had been doing things in anticipation of this.

530
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:14,380
So so we use this. So basically what I tell the algorithm is I want you to find more like this, but I don't tell it what it is I'm looking for.

531
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,710
I don't say I want the full text. I just say, this is what I'm looking for.

532
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:23,270
And I give it hundreds of examples of this type of thing. And I say, Find more of this.

533
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,830
And then I give out hundreds of examples of things that are like this but a little different.

534
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:32,600
And I'm like, I don't want more. I don't want that. So this is how your spam filter figures out that when it's like, Dear Sir or madam.

535
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:36,310
Right? Like, that's actually not real email. Right.

536
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,649
That's our robot. And so. And how does it know that?

537
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:45,920
Because it's been trained on literally millions of emails from all of us to figure out that that's what spam looks like.

538
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,690
So it doesn't even have to know. It's not looking for specific words. It's not looking for the words server matter.

539
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:56,059
It's looking for the whole dash, all of the email. So this is from a smaller data.

540
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:00,140
Sets are not the 300,000, but the the format is the same.

541
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,770
We create this training set, we turn the algorithm we're going to this is what I'm looking for.

542
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:15,860
This is what I'm not. I turn the algorithm loose on it and identifies some additional cases and I take a look at those additional cases and and say,

543
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:21,530
Is that what I'm looking for or not? So this algorithm told me there was a 43% chance that it thought, this is what I was looking for.

544
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:26,180
And so I choose. I look at these and I'm like, I sure as [INAUDIBLE] I'm looking for that.

545
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,180
That's exactly what I'm looking for. So then I tell them that algorithm.

546
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:34,229
Yes, that's what I'm looking for. Good job. And all the things that it thought I was looking for, that I'm not what I'm looking for.

547
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:39,890
I said, no, I'm not looking for that. Right. So it learns. So this is one form of what's called supervised machine learning.

548
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,590
That is, I'm watching it learn. I'm giving it more information.

549
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:51,409
We then train the algorithm until we've got a good set and by the end of it what we end up doing out of these,

550
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:59,180
about 48,000 cases, we identified 1000, 37 cases that are related to long term care in some manner.

551
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:09,680
How are they related? So there's we're able to then we read all the narratives qualitatively and identify which how, what, what's in them.

552
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,400
So the first group of people are people we find that are living in long term care at the time of their death.

553
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,160
That's the first example I just told you about.

554
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,750
The second group we find are people who are transitioning into or out of long term care at the time of their death.

555
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,410
That's the second narrative I just showed you.

556
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:31,100
The third narrative are people that we wanted to call caregivers of somebody in long term care, but the reviewers wouldn't let us call them that.

557
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,110
So instead, we have to say they're otherwise associated with long term care, but they were almost always the spouse.

558
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,490
If your partner needs a nursing home care, you cannot go with them.

559
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,140
So what we get is people whose spouse has dementia,

560
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:48,920
spouse goes into a nursing home and it's the servant is the spouse that's still at home, that's who's there.

561
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,920
And you can tell that this group is far more likely to be married.

562
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,309
So 70, almost 73% of them are married at the time of their deaths, which is much higher than these other groups.

563
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:01,670
And we can tell from the narrative, well, you know, what they thought was happening.

564
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,710
Skip that. So we published this in JAMA a couple of years ago.

565
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,330
And what we summarize again, to provide the statistic,

566
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:19,840
we find that 2% of all suicides over age 55 in the United States were related to long term care in some manner.

567
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,670
The largest group were those people who are in transition.

568
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:26,709
So that is the person that they're you know, most of them are transitioning into long term care.

569
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:32,260
That is, the family had had a conversation with them or they were concerned they were not going to be able to live on their own anymore.

570
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:40,000
At the time we did the study, there was no way to identify these cases and then there was no variable for that.

571
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:44,050
Since then, the CDC has actually added a variable that's called transitioning into long term care.

572
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,390
Yes. No, which is incredible. I have never had that kind of like positive feedback from the government.

573
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:55,610
We can't look at lynch transitions, but as I mentioned, it's because that is one of the things.

574
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:03,370
It's not that this is the only thing that was happening to people. But as I mentioned with the caregivers of people, we can see that said often.

575
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:11,200
In fact, oftentimes what has happened is that we see that there's a couple together.

576
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,580
One of the spouses dies, you know, for whatever reason.

577
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:20,950
But that person, for example, if it's if it's a heterosexual couple, the man dies.

578
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:26,590
Men are far more likely to be a current driver still driving an automobile at the time of their death than women.

579
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:34,120
And so what that means, if that were the case, that the that she may not she may no longer be able to drive the car.

580
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,790
Right. So it's the idea of like linked trends.

581
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:44,140
And so that may then necessitate the family saying like, well, we should, we should we should talk about going into a nursing home.

582
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:50,200
The good news is that you can't get into a nursing home or even an assisted living facility without talking to somebody.

583
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,250
And so the opportunity here for prevention, I think, is reasonable.

584
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:58,510
And in fact, when we did this, the pilot work for this, we did in Virginia.

585
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,049
And when I was living in Virginia or when I was working at Virginia,

586
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:05,050
Commonwealth University is located in Richmond, Virginia, which is the capital of the state.

587
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:13,630
And I did this we did this pilot, not this study, but the pilot study for this with the Department of Health and Department of Social Services.

588
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:17,470
And there were two Beverly's two ladies name, Beverly. They spelled it differently to Beverly.

589
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,730
She worked for Social Services.

590
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:24,850
And before we started the project, I said, Have do you think there's ever been a suicide in long term here in Virginia?

591
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:30,040
And they said no. Like one of the Beverly said no. And I said, Why? Why do you say no?

592
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,800
And she said, Well, I when I heard about it, I said, Why would you have heard about it?

593
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:38,880
And she was like, Well, they would have told me, I'm like, Do they have to tell you? And they don't have to tell you.

594
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:43,920
These places don't have to tell the state because that's that's the regulation is not written in America.

595
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:48,690
There are some states where the facility would have to tell Massachusetts, if you call them Massachusetts,

596
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:53,640
they could tell you exactly how many people died in assisted living facilities from suicide because it's required by their licensing.

597
01:01:53,970 --> 01:02:01,770
Virginia was not the case. The other, Beverley, is the person who did these pre admission screenings and I asked her,

598
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,640
Do you think there's ever been a suicide in long term care in Virginia? She said, absolutely.

599
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:13,290
People tell me they would rather be dead every day rather than go. So she hears it and I said, Has anybody ever trained you on how to address that?

600
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:18,440
And she said, No, there's no real need, real opportunity here for, again, that tool kit.

601
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:26,850
But also being able at the even before they get into it, even before your law firm gets into a facility to talk about you talk about this.

602
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,090
I'm going to skip this slide.

603
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:40,179
But the other thing that I want to say, I guess, about Atlas more generally is that in addition to using this child mortality registry,

604
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:47,170
we're using other big longitudinal surveys that are collected here at the University of Michigan because the national biologists reporting system,

605
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,500
by definition only has people who died from suicide.

606
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,020
And so I don't have the counterfactual, which is people who went through the same life transition but did not die from suicide.

607
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:04,120
Right. And so we're using these other longitudinal surveys to understand protective factors in the general population,

608
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:10,810
and we're using different types of methods. So both statistics that you may be more familiar with, but then also data science methods.

609
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:16,930
Neither one of these is perfect, but what's good about them is that they have relatively uncorrelated sources of bias.

610
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:23,890
That is, the things that make your statistical analysis go wonky are not the same things that make your data science analysis go on.

611
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:29,090
Okay. The last thing I want to tell you is about crisis intervention.

612
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:36,860
I originally call this prevention, but it's not prevention. In 2020, we get the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020,

613
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:44,150
which creates we've already had a suicide hotline number, but now the hotline number is 988911.

614
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:51,860
Okay. So that's the that's the and this is this is the slide hyperlinks out in the notes of this slide you can go to and actually read this.

615
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:59,629
Yes. This act, you can see they're basically they're like they're they're providing the explanation and the

616
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:03,020
thought that we should have a three digit national hotline across all geographic areas,

617
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:07,400
like a911. And that's the purpose of this act.

618
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,510
This was implemented in July. It rolls out in mid-July.

619
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,700
This is data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

620
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:20,330
What you see is that as this right after this is rolled out, they do get an increase in calls to the hotline.

621
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:24,080
There's a decline in chats and a slight increase in text.

622
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:31,820
But again, this is advertised as a hotline number, not advertised, even though there is a online chat and a text option for this.

623
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:40,550
So it's implemented. We get this increase in calls, which is consistent with the argument that by having a just easy to remember number,

624
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:52,010
this would increase people's awareness that this is something they can call the there was an increase in the cancer rate.

625
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:56,600
So about overall, about 90% of calls to this hotline are answered.

626
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:02,540
The call wait time did not substantially shortened. You can read this report, this call.

627
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:06,530
Wait times are about 30 seconds, which is pretty, pretty good.

628
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:12,079
But what was interesting is that the call length decreased by about a minute.

629
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:17,340
But that doesn't mean that the calls became poor quality, but the call length decreased.

630
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:23,180
And what's this? I think this is my last slide.

631
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:31,010
You know, the reason I'm telling you about this is that this the this crisis line or crisis lines in general.

632
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:36,660
Our essentially our our country's strategy towards suicide prevention,

633
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:40,680
which is kind of like saying you're going to prevent heart disease through bypass surgery.

634
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,550
So I don't call this prevention. This is crisis intervention.

635
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:53,910
And we will know in the future sort of whether this line item change had its intended effect,

636
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:58,650
which is getting people into into care when they're in crisis.

637
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:11,639
But the when we talk about suicide prevention, this this is this is not even on the spectrum, like intense in the sense of like where we need to be.

638
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,180
But instead we need to be more of like what the SAMHSA toolkit is,

639
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:20,820
which is an effort of mental health promotion, because if we promote mental health, we will decrease suicide.

640
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,829
But we mean it's but the things that are going to promote mental health are things like

641
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:30,540
helping people stay in school and helping people start meaningful lives and helping jobs,

642
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:31,529
being supportive. Right.

643
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:40,320
Not things that are, like easily fundable and that the effects are sort of cumulative rather than this kind of acute crisis intervention.

644
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:53,490
Okay, so that's what I got. So questions about and all that, you can all stand around for a few minutes if you have questions.
