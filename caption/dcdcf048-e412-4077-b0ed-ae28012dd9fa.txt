1
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:09,907
I'm Dr. Barbara Robinson-Dunn, and I will be an instructor for epidemiology 525,

2
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:16,987
so I am now recording the first lecture, its lecture number one, and it's going to be on general lab issues.

3
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:24,397
So the first thing I want to talk about is how to wear a mask in these days and times of COVID.

4
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:34,177
Wearing a mask appropriately is absolutely necessary, so you need to wear a mask correctly and consistently.

5
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:40,417
Don't pull it down under your nose. Don't just have it hanging from an ear.

6
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,297
You need to wear it over your nose.

7
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:52,917
Another thing that is very, very important is to make sure that you wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting on a mask.

8
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:58,777
If we all know that our hands are dirty, dirty by whatever we touch, however,

9
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:07,927
we don't want to put the dirt or the microorganisms on our hands on the front of the mask, which could by accident get around the back of the mask.

10
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:13,237
And and in fact, you so make sure that you wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.

11
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:19,747
If you're washing your hands, what I was taught hand-washing. It was seeing the Happy Birthday song twice.

12
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:27,487
You don't have to sing it out loud, but sing it twice in your head or use hand sanitizer and rub your hands together until they are totally dry.

13
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:31,387
You should never touch your mask when wearing it.

14
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:38,587
If you have to touch or adjust the mask, if you have to adjust it often, it doesn't fit you properly.

15
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:45,477
You may need to find a different mask or make adjustments, reduce the size of the ear loops and so on.

16
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:54,447
Next slide. So these are all correct ways to wear masks, and it's easy to see these masks because they're quite colorful.

17
00:01:54,447 --> 00:02:03,747
But I will guarantee you they are not the safest masks to wear because they are made out of cotton or poly poly material.

18
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:13,877
And that does not have a small enough pore size in the mask to keep airborne particles out.

19
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:19,397
So this next slide is how not to wear a mask, so I've already mentioned a couple of these.

20
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:23,807
Don't wear it around your neck or on your forehead or under your nose.

21
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:27,587
I see so many people wearing it under your nose. It does absolutely no good.

22
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:33,167
Don't wear it only on your mouth, only on your nose, because sometimes you do breathe through your mouth.

23
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:43,377
Don't wear it on your chin, dangling from one ear or even on your arm, because as you know, that will do absolutely no good for you.

24
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:48,867
Next slide. So in effort, 5:25, we have some course objectives.

25
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:55,877
So I want the students to gain an understanding of the functions of a clinical microbiology laboratory.

26
00:02:55,877 --> 00:03:03,347
I would hazard a guess that most students in this class, unless they're medical technologists, have never been in a clinical microbiology lab,

27
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:10,187
nor have they worked in a clinical microbiology lab, and it's not always straightforward what we do in the laboratories.

28
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:14,057
You need to learn the basic biology and pathology of common infections,

29
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:24,257
and we'll be talking about those common infections throughout the course and then the diagnostic techniques and interpretation of the results.

30
00:03:24,257 --> 00:03:27,197
When we sign out results in microbiology, we put on.

31
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:33,467
We may put a lot of comments on because the technologist may note something unusual and they want the health care team,

32
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:43,967
the physicians and the infection practitioners and so on. Infectious diseases and everyone else to know what we're seeing on the cultures.

33
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:53,447
So in this class, discussions may use include the use of data from the clinical microbiology lab to help resolve epidemiologic issues.

34
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:59,417
So if it's a common issue, I'll probably bring it up and we'll talk about it.

35
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:05,207
Next slide. So remember, this is very important, and I say it in every class I teach.

36
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:12,707
Humans are animals and as such, all humans are covered by microorganisms inside and out.

37
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:17,447
It's bacteria and it's fungi and it's viruses, and they're everywhere.

38
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:27,587
The testing in the clinical microbiology lab must distinguish normal flora that we all have from that which is abnormal and not supposed to be there.

39
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:36,027
And I'll be talking about ways to distinguish it by looking at the gram, say seeing what's growing in different types of specimens and so on.

40
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:45,867
One possible analysis of specimens for the presence of polymorph, a nuclear leukocytes can aid in the determination of normal versus abnormal flora.

41
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:53,067
So if you have a few pigments present and just normal flora, there's no need to do anything else.

42
00:04:53,067 --> 00:05:02,367
But if there's a lot of pml-n's and a lot of abnormal flora that really keys is a key for the microbiologist to say,

43
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:08,577
Hey, we need to do a little bit more work on this culture. Next slide.

44
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:11,187
So what is the role of the clinical microbiology lab?

45
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:17,427
We have diagnostic functions and we need to make sure that we communicate our findings in a way that they

46
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:23,187
are understandable by everyone who is not a clinical microbiologist or an infectious diseases physician,

47
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:30,417
or even clarify it for people who are infection prevention tests.

48
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:38,307
So we. Diagnostic functions include directing the examination, direct examination of the specimen,

49
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:43,257
generally by use of of a gram stain smear, but there are other ways to do this.

50
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:50,997
We can grow or cultivate, cultivate or detect to to detect the organisms that are present.

51
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:58,707
And I'll go through this as we talk about different organisms and the types of diseases in the lectures and what we grow them on,

52
00:05:58,707 --> 00:06:01,107
what they don't grow on and so on.

53
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:10,797
And then once we have or growth of organisms from a specimen, we need to analyze the cultivated organisms and identify what's there.

54
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:15,807
And yes, we may have non pathogens or are organisms that are rarely pathogenic.

55
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,957
But what we really want to find are the ones that we know are true pathogens.

56
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:27,657
Next, we want to communicate our findings so that they are understood, and this can be a big problem,

57
00:06:27,657 --> 00:06:36,027
particularly with computers, because you have prerecorded reports, you can always add more to them.

58
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:40,047
But if oftentimes they are confusing to to the people looking at the reports.

59
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:45,537
So we want to present the information so that we avoid or we minimize any confusion.

60
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:52,047
Yes, the people taking care of the patient can always call the laboratory and talk to the person doing the testing.

61
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:59,547
But if we are careful about how we present the information, we can avoid the necessity for these calls.

62
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:06,747
We when we communicate our findings, if there's anything extra that we think the the physician or the practitioner needs to know,

63
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:11,487
we'll we will add interpretive comments, but only where they're appropriate.

64
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:19,927
And we can also provide educational updates, such as when the methods for interpretation of susceptibility,

65
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:29,547
recent antimicrobial susceptibility results change. We can provide educational updates on what the new break points are.

66
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:36,867
Next slide. So we also want to expedite result reporting, and this is done through computerized systems,

67
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:42,807
computerized laboratory information systems, also for critical specimens such as spinal fluid,

68
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:50,877
positive gram stain positive culture will result not only in rapid release of laboratory of a laboratory report,

69
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:57,297
but a telephone call to the to the physician or the person taking care of the patient.

70
00:07:57,297 --> 00:08:01,707
Those of us working in the microbiology lab have various sources of technical guidelines,

71
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:06,117
the Manual of Clinical Microbiology and the Clinical Microbiology Procedures Handbook,

72
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:13,047
where all the chapters were written that through the Through the American Society of Microbiology directed it.

73
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:20,007
But we had clean micro lab directors. We had technologists, we had physicians, we had infection practitioners.

74
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:24,087
They were all in on this to make these procedures the best that they could be.

75
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:31,707
Then the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute writes guidelines for how to perform certain tests in the laboratory.

76
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:38,427
And if you don't follow those guidelines and you're having and having your lab inspected by the

77
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:43,617
College of American pathologists who license lab licenses clinical micro labs in the United States,

78
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:49,717
you better make sure you have a pretty good reason on why you didn't follow a certain standard.

79
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:56,767
Next slide. So this is an example of a gram stain smear, and this is this an old smears from 2010, I just pulled it.

80
00:08:56,767 --> 00:09:03,067
So numerous polymorph, a nuclear leukocytes, moderate gram, negative rods.

81
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:11,347
And with this report, if the patient's not already on antibiotics, the patient will be placed on antibiotics.

82
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:18,007
Unfortunately, this report does not tell you what kind of specimen it is. So that was on December 26.

83
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:28,027
By January 1st, we had a final report numerous interim Dr. Koiki, moderate Bacillus, serious skin flora present.

84
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:33,277
And then there would be there was a supplementary report for susceptibility, other susceptibility results.

85
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:36,697
But this is the susceptibility for the interim Dr. Koiki.

86
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:43,777
And you could see that it is susceptible to 19:00 intermediate level resistance to pit facilities or bacteria

87
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:50,647
totally resistant to CFS one which we would expect intermediate level resistance to swift reaction and meropenem,

88
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:55,177
which is a great drug for resistant antibiotic resistant gram.

89
00:09:55,177 --> 00:10:04,477
Negative bacteria is totally susceptible, susceptible gentamicin, but it is resistant to tobramycin, which is an interesting finding and so on.

90
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:07,747
And trimethoprim sulfur, which a lot of physicians like to use,

91
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:16,497
particularly if this is from a urinary tract infection, will be of no use because it is resistant.

92
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:25,767
Next slide. So let's talk about specimen collection and handling when we talk about collection techniques, the laboratory,

93
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:36,957
the microbiology laboratory provides the instructions for all people sending specimens to that laboratory for culture or for microbial analysis.

94
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:47,607
And so what someone may have learned in a class before they started in at the at the hospital or were the laboratories is located,

95
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:52,677
needs to know what collection techniques are used at that facility.

96
00:10:52,677 --> 00:11:00,387
Always collect a specimen during the acute phase of the end of the illness and prior to administration of antibiotics.

97
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:05,517
Because the administration of antibiotics may not show,

98
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:12,987
the Graham strain may not show other organisms and they may be not able to to be grown on agar.

99
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:18,927
So you always have to collect during the acute phase prior to any antibiotics and, if possible,

100
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:24,807
if at all possible, prepare the site so that you minimize contamination from normal flora.

101
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:28,587
So we all know that when blood is collected for a blood culture,

102
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:37,407
the arm has to be prepared in a standardized method so you don't get the skin flora in the blood culture.

103
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,377
And so any time that you have to prepare a site,

104
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:50,247
you do it as as as you stand the standard in the institution and you have to let the antiseptic agent dry.

105
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:57,867
Also, very, very important, if you think your patient or you're dealing with patients may have a respiratory infection,

106
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:03,477
please never send saliva for culture or for analysis to the microbiology lab.

107
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:07,047
It has to be sputum and sputum is brought up from deep in the lungs.

108
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:12,207
It's not just saliva that a patient can spit into a tube.

109
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:19,137
Each hospital will have additional information for specimen collection on their laboratory website.

110
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:25,317
And so here's one from Beaumont laboratory, where I worked for 20 years and here's one from the University of Michigan.

111
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:32,057
You can click on those and you can see what they are. Stay for specimen collection.

112
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:40,667
So if you go on to the University of Michigan website, you can see the Department of Pathology, a clinical test catalog.

113
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:44,447
And it says here how to send laboratory specimens.

114
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:51,047
And it talks about courier service because a lot of the specimens come from a doctor's office or multiple doctor's offices and so on.

115
00:12:51,047 --> 00:12:53,957
So there's very specific information online,

116
00:12:53,957 --> 00:13:01,767
which means that you don't always have to call the laboratory and you may save some time by looking at what's online.

117
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:09,297
Next slide. So as you go down, that list on the handbook shows what the abbreviations are.

118
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:16,047
So if you're going to do a urinalysis, obviously a EUA, if it's a urinalysis macroscopic only which you Mac,

119
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:20,367
if it is somewhere here that you're in for AFB culture.

120
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:30,837
So if you have an abbreviation for AFB culture, catheterization, Arabic culture and urine, a clean catch, urine and so on.

121
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:38,337
So if you have those abbreviations, it's very easy to add them to the test requisition.

122
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:45,417
Next slide. So here's an example of.

123
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:48,117
What what might be in the laboratory guide?

124
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:57,507
So this show shows you the order code is you RCC, and the synonyms are for your in clean catch routine culture, Arabic culture, clean cat urine,

125
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:07,077
urine, clean catch, Arabic routine culture, clean cat urine or urine begged routine culture tells you the container, a sterile tube or a container.

126
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:12,417
The normal volume that we want sent to the lab is 10 milliliters. The minimum value is two milliliters.

127
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:17,217
If we don't get that, the provider will get a telephone call saying, Hey,

128
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:21,507
we can't do everything that you've ordered on two mils two milliliters of urine.

129
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:27,357
What is most important to you? And then if the specimen is going to be collected offsite,

130
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:33,147
the patient needs to be instructed how to appropriate collect a clean catch midstream urine.

131
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:42,207
And there are instructions online for this if it's on site collection and each hospital has their own guidelines for on site collection.

132
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:52,007
Here it shows the guidelines for University of Michigan hospitals only how to prep the patient and so on.

133
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:57,127
Next slide here is additional information about urine cultures.

134
00:14:57,127 --> 00:15:03,047
It's set up daily. Preliminary results are reported in 18 to 24 hours.

135
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:10,967
Negative results reported after two days or 48 hours. Reference range is no significant organisms isolated and so on.

136
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:18,337
And if you ever have any questions about this information, you can always call the laboratory and ask.

137
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:21,547
And if you don't like this rejection criteria,

138
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:29,237
you have some other medical reason that you don't want the specimen rejected, call the microbiology lab and talk to them.

139
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:39,587
Next slide. So here we have a chart of collection, transport, storage and processing of specimens commonly submitted to the microbiology laboratory.

140
00:15:39,587 --> 00:15:47,387
So this is a table that the hospital that you work in may not have exactly the same information,

141
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:55,057
but they will have this information available to people, to doctor's offices and so on who are in the process of collecting specimens.

142
00:15:55,057 --> 00:16:00,167
So if it's aqueous or vitreous fluids, collect in a sterile screw cap tube.

143
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,977
If it's an abscess also known as a lesion, a wound,

144
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:11,897
a puncture and also we need to differentiate whether it's superficial or deep and then follow the guidelines that are shown here.

145
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:21,137
Body fluids list the body fluids submitted to the lab in a sterile screw cap tube or an anaerobic transport.

146
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:25,677
If you think it's an anaerobic organism causing the infection or both.

147
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:28,877
If it's anaerobic, if it's deep, it can't be a surface wound.

148
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:33,887
But if it's a deep wound, you'd want an Arabic and an anaerobic culture.

149
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:39,377
And then, of course, disinfecting the skin and how to get the specimen with a needle aspirate and so on.

150
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:41,417
And these instructions are available, as I said,

151
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:51,637
for every institution that has microbiology laboratory or for institutions that send their specimens to another laboratory.

152
00:16:51,637 --> 00:17:02,957
And here is more showing aqueous or vitreous fluid, which is a very difficult specimen abscess, a deep wound blood or bone marrow, and so on.

153
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:14,417
And I'm not going to go through each of them, you all know how to read. So next topic, specimen preservation, storage, labeling and the requisition,

154
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:21,977
so the specimen should be transported to the lab as soon as possible because of very critical issues.

155
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:30,407
The first one is oxygen is toxic to anaerobic, so if it's a specimen that would normally get an Arabic culture and an anaerobic culture,

156
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:36,257
you want to keep the specimen away from from oxygen.

157
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:44,057
If it's a gentle specimen or even CSF or blood temperature is critical because Neisseria die,

158
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:50,177
whether they're gonorrhea or meningitidis, die very, very rapidly worth when they're at the wrong temperature.

159
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:56,357
And if it's a stool specimen, a patient has bad diarrhea, thinking salmonella shigella,

160
00:17:56,357 --> 00:18:03,867
you need to keep it in a container, a transport container where the patient is maintained at a certain level.

161
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:12,057
You can use preservatives or anticoagulants, anticoagulants if there's going to be a delay of receipt of the specimen in the laboratory.

162
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:19,267
But you should always check with the microbiology laboratory for if you have any questions about how to submit a specimen.

163
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:30,657
The microbiology laboratories do not like to reject specimens, however they will, if testing that would provide not the right results.

164
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:37,567
Incorrect results because the specimen was handled incorrectly. Next slide.

165
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:44,857
So here's an example of a University of Michigan hospitals and health centers a test request form.

166
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:49,477
You can see at the top you've got to have the patient's name, birth date.

167
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:57,037
Registration of a specimen source is critical. Who was collected by when it was collected, the collected collection time.

168
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:02,617
And then it goes through the different types of specimen. So cultures accept blood are up here.

169
00:19:02,617 --> 00:19:03,457
On the left hand side,

170
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:11,977
blood cultures have their own box in the Senate because they are absolutely one of the most critical types of specimens we can test.

171
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:17,647
Here's a box for what if you want molecular testing on various types of specimens and so on.

172
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:21,907
So generally, all of the information for what you want to order is on the test request.

173
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:26,527
If there's anything else, of course you call the laboratory. Next slide.

174
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:32,107
So I did mention this in the past. Specimens can be rejected by the laboratory.

175
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:39,517
It is absolutely correct to reject a specimen if it's not been handled correctly for the test that's been requested,

176
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:43,597
or if it's the wrong specimen for the test that's been requested.

177
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:50,887
So there's the rejection reasons here, or it's not a large list.

178
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:59,797
I've only listed a few if the specimen is mislabeled or unlabeled. Now we won't test it if it's been improperly transported at the wrong temperature.

179
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:05,887
As I said, many organisms will die out of the wrong temperature or if it's in the wrong container for transport.

180
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:13,417
If we don't have enough quantity, not sufficient. We can't do everything that might be requested if the specimens leaking out of the container.

181
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:18,787
That means that other organisms can get in and your specimen is compromised.

182
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:27,467
And so specimens that take more than two hours to get to the laboratory and get processed, so they're there,

183
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:33,277
the this can be very bad for some types of specimens and that would be the delay

184
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:38,317
and transfer it would be if it's greater than two hours of preserved specimen.

185
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:44,257
There would be a telephone call. It might be set up in certain situations and other situations.

186
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:55,957
It might be rejected. So if it's also received in a fixative or received dried up, that's an automatic rejection because we can't do any work with it.

187
00:20:55,957 --> 00:21:06,087
Bottom line is when these things happen, the laboratory will communicate with the care team or the physician's office, whichever whichever it was.

188
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:16,647
Next slide. So more on specimen processing, once we get the specimen in the lab for certain specimens, we do a direct microscopic examination.

189
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:21,957
So we would do that on spinal fluid.

190
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:27,207
We would do that on sputum. We don't do a direct microscopic for the most part on urine.

191
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:31,737
We wouldn't do it on blood because we need to get that blood set up and cultured.

192
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:35,757
We might do a direct molecular test also, but we're not talking about that right here.

193
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:42,807
We're talking about just direct microscopic exam. So the technologists can assess the quality of the specimen.

194
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:46,167
They can assess the amount of inflammation.

195
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:53,297
And that's a small, medium large number of white blood cells present when their culture the following day one.

196
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:58,107
We've got growth on the culture. They can compare what's on the direct smear with what's going on in the culture

197
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:02,697
and see if they need to do additional work to get organisms that did not grow.

198
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:09,237
But we're seen on the direct smear. A number of different stains are used to look for bacteria.

199
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:12,837
We white blood cells, red blood cells and epithelial cells.

200
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:14,877
We can see all those with the gram stand.

201
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:23,457
And of course, the grandstand will tell us if bacteria or gram positive or gram negative notice you don't see anything with viruses here.

202
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:29,607
If there if there's a request for a fungal culture, we're going to do a KOAT or a calico floor white stain.

203
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:34,437
Calico floor is a fluorescent stain, and we can pick up fungi very easily on that.

204
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,997
And if it's for a specimen such as a sputum for acid fast bacilli,

205
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:49,197
we will have to process the specimen and then we will do a fluorescent stain that would be an orange romaine and the routine kinion acid test stain,

206
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:57,127
which will either be a Ziel Nielsen or a Kenyan. Next slide.

207
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:02,797
So then we have two going on in specimen processing, we have to select the appropriate culture,

208
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:09,527
media and culture media comes in three different types. There's Nutritive, which supports the growth of a wide range,

209
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:16,717
or most organisms such as chocolate or almost everything will grow on chocolate, auger or blood sugar.

210
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:22,847
There's differential media that allows for distinguishing between organisms because of different growth characteristics.

211
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:29,407
So when you think about differential lager, think about a mcconkey plate where lactose form enters.

212
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:35,617
The colonies are yellow and non lactose from enters. The colonies are red, reddish orange.

213
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:41,827
And then there's selective media and that supports the group of one group of organisms, but not another.

214
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:46,597
Because of there are inhibitors, various types of inhibitors in the media.

215
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:57,517
And so if we're looking for a specific type of organism, there is Mersa Select Augur that only Mercil will grow on it and the colonies will be blue.

216
00:23:57,517 --> 00:24:04,437
So that tells you right away if Mersa is present. Next slide.

217
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:10,917
So here's an exam type question colistin now dislike acid, also known as Siena Auger,

218
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:20,127
contains antibiotics and inhibit the growth of gram negative organisms. This type of media is a is differential.

219
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:28,707
Be as supportive, C is selective. And D is nutritive now, if you were in class, I would ask someone to answer this.

220
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:32,997
But since you are online, the answer, it's selective.

221
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:40,057
It selects for gram negatives and others are inhibited.

222
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:48,067
Next slide. So going on with specimen processing. So we have to prepare the specimen if it is tissue.

223
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:53,137
It needs to be ground up and homogenized or at least minced into very, very tiny bits.

224
00:24:53,137 --> 00:25:02,377
If it's spinal fluid, it needs to be centrifuged so you can take the sediment and do your stain on it and set up your culture from the sediment.

225
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:06,277
And if it's a respiratory specimen, particularly for acid fast bacteria,

226
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:13,807
because the the incubation period for acid fast bacterias is much longer, it's in weeks rather than days.

227
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:16,207
And so you need to decontaminate the specimen,

228
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:25,897
get rid of all the normal flora so that slowly growing organisms have a greater chance to grow and be seen.

229
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:33,817
So after specimen preparation, we have to inoculate the media. And as I said before, we use both solid and liquid media.

230
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:42,457
We don't use solid and liquid for everything, but for for the most serious types of infections, we would use both solid and liquid media.

231
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:50,617
We can do quantitative cultures. We do those, particularly for urine, so we can do a colony count right off the plate.

232
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:56,527
And then when we streak the plate for just routine, such as a respiratoria one specimen,

233
00:25:56,527 --> 00:26:01,897
we'll use a sterile inoculating loop to spread the specimen on the plate basically in three or four quadrants,

234
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:10,237
so that we can get isolated colonies to work with. If we don't have isolated colonies, we need to subculture, and that takes another day.

235
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:15,007
And then in this day and age, we're doing a lot of nucleic acid detection.

236
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:20,167
There are many, many tests out there on the market being used by clinical labs.

237
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,217
They're great test.

238
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:30,547
They tell you what organism is present in a specimen if they're positive and it can even tell you some assays can tell you if there are,

239
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,477
there are any antibiotic resistance genes noted.

240
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:40,257
That doesn't mean that those genes would be active, but they might be there.

241
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:44,997
Next slide. So what about safety in the lab?

242
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:50,157
The lab can be a very, very safe place or there can be problems with laboratory safety.

243
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:56,727
So we have the means in laboratories to sterilize and disinfect sterilization.

244
00:26:56,727 --> 00:27:00,297
There's a big difference between these. Sterilization kills all forms of microbial life,

245
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:07,707
including spores and the physical methods for sterilization or incineration with a flame such as flaming a loop.

246
00:27:07,707 --> 00:27:14,457
You can autoclave at 121 degrees centigrade at 15 pounds per square inch of pressure, and that is moist heat.

247
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:20,607
With steam, you can heat with dry heat 160 to 180 degrees centigrade.

248
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:28,557
You can use filters to filter liquid specimens, and they're the poor size and the filter has to be 0.2 microns.

249
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:36,987
And then for some specimens, we can use gamma radiation or microwaves or X-rays to get rid of unwanted forms of life.

250
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:47,667
If we're using chemical methods, it's ethylene oxide, and that is a gas that we can use for heat sensitive materials.

251
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:52,167
Next slide going on with sterilization and disinfection.

252
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:59,397
When we talk about disinfection, only the pathogenic microorganisms are destroyed, it leaves the other organisms there.

253
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:04,527
So disinfection can be done by either physical methods or chemical methods.

254
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:11,997
So in the physical methods, you could boil a specimen at 100 degrees centigrade, a liquid specimen, obviously for 15 minutes.

255
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:21,747
You could pasteurize it as milk as pasteurized at sixty three degrees centigrade for 30 minutes or 72 degrees, centigrade for 15 seconds.

256
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:27,657
Or you can use UV light to to disinfect it.

257
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:35,247
If you're using chemical methods or a variety of different types of chemicals that can be alcohols bleaches, phenols can disinfect.

258
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:44,907
And we do use phenol constantly in the laboratory to disinfect laboratory benches and and so on, as well as using alcohol wipes and some bleach.

259
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:49,767
So, but the chemical methods can be impacted by the organism load.

260
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:57,897
If there's too many organisms and not enough chemical, the organisms will i'll the chemicals, such as bleach.

261
00:28:57,897 --> 00:29:05,397
If if organisms are too concentrated or the environmental conditions of the specimen, it's very thick and gelatinous,

262
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:11,767
then it's going to be more difficult for that chemical, the chemicals to get in there and kill everything.

263
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:17,227
Or to disinfect everything. Next slide.

264
00:29:17,227 --> 00:29:24,897
So when we work in the lab, we worry a lot. We don't worry. We follow biosafety and exposure control plans.

265
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:25,897
So these are very,

266
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:33,847
very important because we don't want our technologists or anybody else in the laboratory to get sick from what they're working with.

267
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:42,637
So mandatory federal guidelines, employee education and orientation for biosafety and exposure control,

268
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:47,347
there has to be standardized ways of disposal of hazard and hazardous waste.

269
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:53,857
Yes, it can be autoclave, but mostly large laboratories do not have enough autoclaves to take care of all the hazardous waste.

270
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:57,997
There are companies that will pick up hazardous waste and they will take care of it.

271
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:03,277
They will dispose of it appropriately for a cost.

272
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:10,417
Standard precautions Everyone in the lab has to follow standard precautions no eating, drinking, smoking or applying cosmetics.

273
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:20,467
In the laboratory, you treat every specimen as if it is positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, and that may mean wearing gloves all the time.

274
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:26,467
It may mean wearing a mask. Whatever it is, you treat every specimen as if it's HIV positive.

275
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:30,637
Handwashing is mandatory, and it's mandatory multiple times a day.

276
00:30:30,637 --> 00:30:33,877
And, of course, avoid needle sticks or sharps exposures.

277
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:41,917
If you would happen to get a needle stick, that would be that you would be sent to employ health to,

278
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:47,797
and they would determine whether or not you needed to be treated or followed, et cetera.

279
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:55,777
Then in the laboratory, we have engineering controls, a number of them shown here, we have biological safety cabinets.

280
00:30:55,777 --> 00:31:01,177
And if you use them correctly, they're very, very safe to work in.

281
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:08,407
How if you don't use them correctly, you are creating a hazard for yourself and anyone who's in the room also.

282
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:16,987
And then, of course, personal protective equipment. We've already talked about wearing masks and how important it is to wear masks appropriately.

283
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:20,977
But other personal protective equipment would be wearing gloves, not wearing gloves.

284
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:23,087
After you use them, you don't walk out in the lab with the glove.

285
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:31,777
You toss them into a container that would be autoclave and the gloves would be handled appropriately.

286
00:31:31,777 --> 00:31:36,457
And then, of course, if you have a cut scrape, you're exposed to something.

287
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:44,947
It's a call to employee health. You go over there and they manage things so that you don't get infected.

288
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:52,747
Next slide. So this is an example of personal protective woman. Well, first of all, personal protective equipment, this woman is wearing a shield.

289
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:56,237
She does not have a mask on, but she's not actually working with any specimen.

290
00:31:56,237 --> 00:32:04,417
She's logging them in and making sure that the name on the list matches the names on the tubes, and she does have gloves in.

291
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:13,947
The person assisting her has gloves also. So this is a biological safety cabinet when you work in a biological safety cabinet.

292
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:20,217
Well, in this day and age, this person is an older picture. This person would have a mask on also, but does wear gloves.

293
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:26,817
So any time you're working in a biological safety cabinet or with specimens and this is clearly a specimen.

294
00:32:26,817 --> 00:32:34,437
Gloves are critical. You must wear them. And I have to tell you that this picture also shows one thing you should never do.

295
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:37,647
You should never block the airflow through this vent.

296
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:48,107
So if you're going to keep your hands someplace, keep it on this part or all the way in here doing some work, but not blocking the airflow.

297
00:32:48,107 --> 00:32:54,137
So here's how a biological safety cabinet works, person is sitting here working.

298
00:32:54,137 --> 00:33:00,557
His knees are here. He's sitting here working. We've got room air coming in and we have HEPA filter.

299
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:06,887
The air coming down through mayor comes in. The work is done here on the desktop,

300
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:12,407
in the hood and potentially the air might be contaminated from something the person is doing

301
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:19,067
well that that contaminated air mixes with the HEPA filter there and the air coming in.

302
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:27,437
It's sucked down, it's sucked out. It goes up through this chute and it's filtered before it comes back into the hood.

303
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:35,627
So it's a very safe way to work if you follow all the precautions and one of them is not having your hands where they shouldn't be on that,

304
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:41,457
the filter where the air was coming down through here.

305
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:49,497
Next slide. So I assume that you may have heard about the classification of biologic agents, but let's go through this.

306
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:59,157
So a biosafety level one agent has no potential to cause disease in healthy people, and we can just use standard precautions, standard precautions.

307
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:03,927
We wear gloves when we're working with a mask and working with a specimen.

308
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:08,457
We have a lab coat on. We don't splatter things. And so on.

309
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:15,057
Biosafety level two agents are what we mostly work with in infectious diseases.

310
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:19,467
We use standard precautions and those include. We limit access to the lab.

311
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:24,357
So somebody from across the street can't just walk in and see what's going on.

312
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:29,997
They have to have a guide someone to show them they can't touch anything they need.

313
00:34:29,997 --> 00:34:33,897
People working in the lab have to have special training and supervision.

314
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:41,187
They must work in biological safety cabinets, as I showed you on a previous slide to contain potential aerosols.

315
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:53,037
And it should be noted that most organisms in the clinical lab are biosafety level two agents, except for a few.

316
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:59,637
So on the next slide, we have biosafety level three agencies are unusual, pathogens are not routinely encountered.

317
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:07,767
Well, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is definitely a BSL three biosafety level three agent, very, very infectious.

318
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:10,827
You do not want to be infected with it.

319
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:23,487
The there are dimorphic fungi, histo plasma and so on that are mold when grown in humans or animals or grown on enriched media.

320
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:28,617
Excuse me. I said that wrong there, mold when grown on normal psychologic media.

321
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:32,097
But when they're on enriched media, they form a yeast face.

322
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:41,287
And so those, when they're in the mold form are highly infectious, they only can be used in a, you know, biosafety level three.

323
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:46,377
Hood and then Francisella and Brucella are extremely infectious.

324
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:55,697
Also, they must be handled in a biosafety level three type arrangement, and all of these are transmitted by aerosol.

325
00:35:55,697 --> 00:36:03,887
So you can work with some biosafety level three agents in a BSL two laboratory,

326
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:10,517
if you have the appropriate engineering controls and everybody is wearing additional PPE and they're wearing it correctly.

327
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:18,407
But it's much safer to do this type of organism in a biosafety level three containment facility.

328
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:23,897
And then we get to biosafety level four. And fortunately, these are rarely encountered organisms.

329
00:36:23,897 --> 00:36:27,927
The hemorrhagic fever viruses are arboviruses and so on.

330
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:32,237
So to manipulate these specimens and so on,

331
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:39,377
we need a biosafety level three as we have up here for TV and for cell Brucella plus special special containment,

332
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:44,177
additional airflow and very strict wearing of personal protective equipment.

333
00:36:44,177 --> 00:36:46,367
And that would be if you were growing these organisms,

334
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:58,037
and the same high level containment must be used if you're testing for these in clinical specimens.

335
00:36:58,037 --> 00:37:02,927
Next slide. So I've already mentioned requirements for the laboratory,

336
00:37:02,927 --> 00:37:12,527
so clear Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 is mandatory that we follow it if we want to be a licensed laboratory clear resulted from

337
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:20,567
public and congressional concerns about the quality of clinical laboratory testing in the United States back in the 1980s and so clear set,

338
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:27,197
they set a basic set of guidelines to apply to all labs, regardless of size, complexity or location.

339
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:35,687
These are basic ideas. You can go beyond it if you're working with more dangerous organisms, but you have to follow the basic set of guidelines.

340
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:39,437
And so the implementation and development of working guidelines were assigned to Hicksville,

341
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:48,387
which is the health care financing agency now known as CMS, or the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

342
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:57,867
Next slide. So the intent of clear is to promote the development, implementation, delivery,

343
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:05,917
monitoring and improvement of high quality laboratory services without clear without the government oversight,

344
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:14,477
we would still be back, most likely where some labs were not turning out quality results.

345
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:18,827
Next slide so clear. Originally consisted of four sets of rules.

346
00:38:18,827 --> 00:38:25,907
They described laboratory standards and the laboratory standards included standards for personnel.

347
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:32,807
So what type of education, what type of licensing, who can work on certain types of specimens?

348
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:36,887
So does a person setting up cultures have to be a medical technologist?

349
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:43,877
Or can you have a laboratory assistant? Do that as long as there are trained and working in the right situation?

350
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:53,567
There are quality control requirements. There is a test complexity model and then quality assessment of the complete testing process,

351
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:59,027
and that comes along with the licensure process every two years.

352
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:02,237
There's an application process for clear and it is expensive.

353
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:07,577
There are user fees for the laboratory, but you can't do testing if you're not Clia's certified.

354
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:09,797
There are also enforcement procedures.

355
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:19,667
If a lab is seems to be making a lot of mistakes, they may be claiming that they could do things that nobody else could do, which.

356
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,917
Doesn't happen very often.

357
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:31,247
They may get a visit by people from clear and then they have the approval of the accreditation programs also saw labs testing specimens,

358
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:38,657
reporting the results and getting paid for doing the testing need to have the accredited.

359
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:48,827
So here is the total testing process. It's divided into three parts we have pre, analytic, analytic and post analytic.

360
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:57,737
So in the pre analytic phase, the physician or other medical provider orders whatever test is necessary, the patient is prepared.

361
00:39:57,737 --> 00:40:03,107
It may be in that preparation that they may have to sterilize the site and obtain a specimen for that site.

362
00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:08,927
Patient may need to be taught how to bring up sputum and not just saliva for a respiratory culture.

363
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:19,737
The specimen is acquired, it's handled, and it's placed in the appropriate tube for transport, and then it's transported to the laboratory.

364
00:40:19,737 --> 00:40:28,417
That's all pretty analytic. In the analytic phase, the sample is prepped for any test that needs to be deemed to be done on it.

365
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:33,497
An analyzer may need to be set up. The test may need to be calibrated.

366
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:40,637
Then you have ongoing quality control and analysis of the sample.

367
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:47,597
And then finally, in the post, the analytic phase, the test is reported to the physician.

368
00:40:47,597 --> 00:40:54,737
It's so it's reported it's transmitted the physician or other health care provider receives the report,

369
00:40:54,737 --> 00:41:04,977
reviews the test results and then it's finally at this stage that they can take action if necessary on the test results and that maybe,

370
00:41:04,977 --> 00:41:10,247
no, you don't need any therapy. This is not an infection or yes, you need some antibiotics.

371
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:19,837
Let's get some on order for you. Next slide, so in all the testing that's done in microbiology, hospital microbiology labs,

372
00:41:19,837 --> 00:41:25,777
as well as other clinical lives clinical chemistry, clinical hematology, anatomic pathology and so on.

373
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:29,017
We have to have quality assurance programs,

374
00:41:29,017 --> 00:41:37,387
and these are programs designed to monitor and evaluate the ongoing and overall quality of the total testing process.

375
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:43,117
And this includes the pre analytic phase, the analytic phase and the post analytic phase.

376
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:52,777
And of course, the post analytic is getting the report. And before the report goes out, it's check to make sure that everything is correct on it.

377
00:41:52,777 --> 00:42:04,057
Next slide. So I've mentioned quality control before all laboratories perform a wide variety of a large number of quality control activities,

378
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:10,987
and these activities are designed to monitor and evaluate the performance of instruments and reagents used in the testing process.

379
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:17,017
Clearly, if an instrument has not been quality controlled and it's providing the wrong information and that

380
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:22,507
information goes back to the practitioner who's going to treat the patient with the incorrect drug,

381
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:26,797
there are problems completely along the way and there will probably be a lawsuit.

382
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:37,087
So quality control is very, very important, and quality control is a component of the total quality assurance program.

383
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:46,747
Next slide. So here are some quality assurance activities, so they fall under different headings, so patient test management assessment.

384
00:42:46,747 --> 00:42:52,747
So our specimens being collected in the appropriate containers and the appropriate volume of specimen

385
00:42:52,747 --> 00:42:58,657
that is also is looked at to see if it's being collected are specimens containers labeled appropriately?

386
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:04,417
Are they transported in the appropriate timeframe? And then what about the test requisition?

387
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:11,407
Is there an option for specimen rejection? There always has to be an option for specimen rejection.

388
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:15,697
In case the wrong specimen is submitted, it's submitted in the wrong form.

389
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:23,797
It takes too long to get to the laboratory and so on. And then, of course, the test report format has to be easily understood.

390
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:32,937
Can't be quite complex, so you can't even find the answer on the test test report, and the reporting systems have to be fairly straightforward.

391
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:40,167
Along with all of this, there is assessment of quality control, so records are kept of the calibrations and the controls,

392
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:43,617
how often they're used, how often the test is calibrated and so on.

393
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:50,817
And the patient's data ranges are most of most data in range or there are a lot on the high side of the range.

394
00:43:50,817 --> 00:43:54,807
So it would indicate something's wrong with calibration or the controls.

395
00:43:54,807 --> 00:44:00,957
And then if there's a reporting error, you report a positive blood culture on a patient on the wrong patient.

396
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:13,537
Then there's a wide variety of procedures that the laboratory has to go through, and that will be reported to to Medicare.

397
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:22,717
Next slide. So along with other call, this quality assurance activities also proficiency testing, all lavatories have to do proficiency testing.

398
00:44:22,717 --> 00:44:28,927
Sometimes it's twice a year, sometimes three times a year, sometimes four times a year depends on the type of specimen,

399
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:35,737
and the laboratory will receive unknowns with tests requested two, three or four times a year.

400
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:39,907
And it just depends on the type of specimen, how many times you get it.

401
00:44:39,907 --> 00:44:44,527
There are different programs for various areas of the microbiology laboratory.

402
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:52,147
They generally come from the College of American pathologists, but if they don't offer one, there are other companies that will offer them.

403
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:56,527
But generally, the proficiency test programs come from the College of American Pathologists.

404
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:01,687
And as you recall, I said that that's who licensed laboratories also.

405
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:09,217
So along with proficiency test assessment and quality assurance, this comparison of test results.

406
00:45:09,217 --> 00:45:15,697
So the laboratory must make sure that they have if they have different assays for the same test or different instruments.

407
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:19,657
Multiple instruments used for the same tests that the results correlate.

408
00:45:19,657 --> 00:45:24,757
You get the same results from the same all the assays, you get the same results from all the instruments.

409
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:29,857
And those assays and instruments must also be accurate and reproducible.

410
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:39,347
So you test a specimen five times get the same result. It is reproducible that type of comparison.

411
00:45:39,347 --> 00:45:49,127
Next slide. Going on with quality assurance activities. So what is the relationship of the patient information to the test results?

412
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:56,927
So the results must be consistent with patient info and patient info might be age, sex diagnosis or other results.

413
00:45:56,927 --> 00:46:03,677
Obviously, we cannot report a positive pregnancy test on a male or on a woman 75 years old,

414
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:10,967
so they have to be compatible with age, sex diagnosis and other results in the patient.

415
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:15,677
And then, of course, the personnel who work in the lab are so very important,

416
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:22,787
and there is a nationwide shortage of medical technologists that's been going on for many years, not just since COVID started,

417
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:27,977
and they need to be assessed for their education and they're competent,

418
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:43,067
competent competency to work in specific areas of the laboratories and then under education, they must complete continuing education periodically.

419
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:51,557
Going on with quality assurance activities at each laboratory must maintain and not just the general lab, but each section of the lab, cell chemistry,

420
00:46:51,557 --> 00:47:00,437
hematology, microbiology and so on must maintain a communications log and this must be reviewed during a quality assurance review with the staff.

421
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:12,047
And these quality assurance reviews happen, if not monthly, every other month or every third month during regular staff meetings.

422
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:17,987
Next, slide more on quality assurance activities. The laboratories must keep records of quality assurance,

423
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:24,227
and the mandated retention time is at least two years if the laboratory has an inspection from

424
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:31,547
the College of American Pathologists and they detect an issue with quality assurance records.

425
00:47:31,547 --> 00:47:37,627
They may mandate that these records be maintained for longer periods of time.

426
00:47:37,627 --> 00:47:48,497
And so it's necessary for supervisory staff and directors of laboratories and managers of laboratories to look at review quality assurance records,

427
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:58,537
make sure everything is a date that everything is where it should be prior as it goes on regularly in the laboratory.

428
00:47:58,537 --> 00:48:05,647
So it's not just enough to have a licensed technologist and do testing,

429
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:15,037
but we have to verify our methods in the laboratory and our verification methods include accuracy and precision.

430
00:48:15,037 --> 00:48:24,157
Do you get the right organism identified? Do you get the right amount of, say, of antimicrobial agents from known test specimens?

431
00:48:24,157 --> 00:48:27,817
We have to look at analytical sensitivity and specificity.

432
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:36,877
We have to look at reportable ranges of the ranges that we are reporting within range, and the reference ranges are the normal values.

433
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:45,337
If those don't correlate with other reference ranges, that needs to be examined.

434
00:48:45,337 --> 00:48:51,187
Next slide going on with quality assurance. Finally, we have to do quality monitors.

435
00:48:51,187 --> 00:48:56,407
We have to look at turnaround time, so we take 20 specimens, say respiratory specimens.

436
00:48:56,407 --> 00:49:01,867
And how long did it take them to get time to receive it in the lab?

437
00:49:01,867 --> 00:49:05,837
Two result is released. Same thing for a urine specimen.

438
00:49:05,837 --> 00:49:14,707
Same thing for blood cultures. Time to detect positive organisms or organisms in a positive blood culture.

439
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:22,507
We have to look at correlation of smears and cultures, and that is not only say on the respiratory or wound bench, but in the AFB lab.

440
00:49:22,507 --> 00:49:26,347
Also, do our smears and cultures correlate?

441
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:36,217
And then another huge quality monitor is contamination rates on blood cultures, so we can have the best blood culture system in the world.

442
00:49:36,217 --> 00:49:42,787
But if the specimen site where the the blood is drawn is not prepared appropriately

443
00:49:42,787 --> 00:49:46,087
with disinfection and waiting for it to dry and you don't blow on the site,

444
00:49:46,087 --> 00:49:51,217
you don't wave your hand over it to get it dry, you just let it dry on its own.

445
00:49:51,217 --> 00:49:54,757
That can all those can all lead to contaminated blood cultures.

446
00:49:54,757 --> 00:50:02,347
So these are all just these are just a few of the quality monitors that microbiology labs look at.

447
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:08,797
Next slide. So who assesses compliance once again, it's the College of American Pathologists cap.

448
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:15,907
And this is a professional pathology organization organization. It has been granted deemed status by CMS,

449
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:29,737
which means it has the ability to pull a license from a laboratory if they're not doing what is necessary to provide an accurate and good test result.

450
00:50:29,737 --> 00:50:34,117
And all laboratories licensed by the College of American pathologists in there.

451
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:43,147
This is across the United States are inspected every other year by a group of peers, and this would be clinical pathologists,

452
00:50:43,147 --> 00:50:52,567
anatomic pathologists, clinical scientists who may direct Ph.D. scientists who may direct chemistry or hematology or microbiology labs.

453
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:56,767
And they have a standardized form that they have to follow when they do the biannual site inspection.

454
00:50:56,767 --> 00:51:05,317
Please check the the form correlates with the published checklists for the laboratories and about a year before on the alternate year.

455
00:51:05,317 --> 00:51:12,937
In between inspections, the laboratories will go through the current checklist to make sure that they are still in compliance and if not,

456
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:20,257
they have to work to make sure that they return to a state of being in compliance.

457
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:23,927
Next slide. So here's an example of an inspection form.

458
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:31,507
This it's just number 12 11 zero, and it's a phase two deficiency, which is worse than a phase one.

459
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:39,727
And it can answer not applicable yes or no. Is there documentation of at least annual review of all policies and procedures in

460
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:44,437
the entire microbiology laboratory by the current laboratory director or designee?

461
00:51:44,437 --> 00:51:52,747
And what the laboratory or designate needs to do must do is ensure that the laboratory policy,

462
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:59,077
manual or technical protocols are complete their current and they've been thoroughly reviewed by a knowledgeable person.

463
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:07,687
That person is probably the laboratory director of the microbiology laboratory director or associate director,

464
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:16,417
but they have to sign off on everything every other year. Technical approaches must be scientifically valid and clinically relevant.

465
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:26,677
And so they're suggesting that one twelfth of all procedures be reviewed monthly, say, reviewing a portion of the procedures every month.

466
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:30,487
And you can have a paper, can be on paper, can be electronic.

467
00:52:30,487 --> 00:52:41,107
But either way, it's need to be signed off at the end of each procedure and this needs to be done every other year.

468
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:47,317
And so if you follow all these for all areas of your laboratory, which would be bacteriology, mycology, acid,

469
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:56,467
fast mycobacteria, algae and other areas of the laboratory, you could say yes on the inspection document.

470
00:52:56,467 --> 00:53:03,997
And then when the inspectors come in, if they agree with you, they'll have. Yes, they're also. Next slide.

471
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:13,267
So let's talk about stool cultures. This if this could be a phase one deficiency, this is part of the inspection document.

472
00:53:13,267 --> 00:53:19,127
Does the final report for routine bacterial stool cultures lists the organisms for which the specimen was cultured,

473
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:32,827
so it should say salmonella species identified additional information to follow Shigella species Vibrio species not isolated.

474
00:53:32,827 --> 00:53:41,397
You cannot report no enteric pathogens. You have to specify them individually.

475
00:53:41,397 --> 00:53:46,647
Next slide. So how do we assess the performance of our tests? How do we do this?

476
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:50,847
So we do verification. We look at the background of the test.

477
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:59,847
So the clinical laboratory improvement clear requirements require the lab to check or verify the manufacturer's

478
00:53:59,847 --> 00:54:08,217
performance specifications that are in the package insert and that will assure that the test is performing as intended.

479
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:14,727
So this needs to be done by various testing personnel in your laboratory.

480
00:54:14,727 --> 00:54:21,897
Take a variety of specimens and look at them across your patient population and look at your laboratory settings.

481
00:54:21,897 --> 00:54:27,087
This is a one time process performed prior to implementation of a test.

482
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:33,507
Just ensure that the test is performing as intended based on the types of specimens that you get,

483
00:54:33,507 --> 00:54:38,117
the testing personnel that you have and your laboratory setting.

484
00:54:38,117 --> 00:54:46,127
That's verification under verification also, we have to look at accuracy, are your test results correct?

485
00:54:46,127 --> 00:54:50,807
So this assure us that the test is performing as intended by the manufacturer.

486
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:59,507
And here we look at the use of quality control materials proficiency test results or previously tested patient specimens.

487
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:06,087
We can look at all of those and say, yes, our tests are performing appropriately.

488
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:12,477
Next slide. Also, under verification, we have to look at precision. Can you obtain the same test result?

489
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:18,297
Time after time after time. And here we take the same samples on different days.

490
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:27,567
Not all the samples from one person, but say we're testing serum for something or a respiratory specimen or a urine specimen we could take it on.

491
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:36,207
Five samples on Monday, five samples on Wednesday, five samples on Friday and set up the cultures and make sure the results are reproducible.

492
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:47,507
And these have to be tested by different lab personnel so that we would find if there was any variances between the operators.

493
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:52,777
Next slide. And so there we go in verification also includes a reportable range.

494
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:56,847
And that is how high or how low can test values be and still be accurate.

495
00:55:56,847 --> 00:56:04,997
This is a qualitative measure so we can choose samples with known values at higher low end of the range claimed by the manufacturer.

496
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:11,567
So sometimes these are purchased samples, sometimes they're patient samples that we know we can can use for this purpose.

497
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:20,897
And we also have to know what is the range where the test is linear or quantitative, and so you have to test samples across the range.

498
00:56:20,897 --> 00:56:29,087
So you know that when you're bringing up a new test, there's a lot of testing that goes into verifying a new test.

499
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:33,557
Next slide also in verification, what are the reference ranges or the interval?

500
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,987
What are the normal values?

501
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:44,627
So you have to make sure that the test you're bringing up for the using in the lab has reference ranges that fit your patient population.

502
00:56:44,627 --> 00:56:53,207
So you start with the manufacturer's suggested ranges and you use published ranges, and they could vary based on the type of of patients.

503
00:56:53,207 --> 00:56:56,507
So if you're testing specimens from an adult patient,

504
00:56:56,507 --> 00:57:03,137
you may not have the same ranges as if the child is very young and you may need to adjust these ranges over time.

505
00:57:03,137 --> 00:57:08,357
As things change, normal patients should be within range.

506
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:21,297
Abnormal patients should be outside of the range. So easy way to think about this is if you're thinking about blood cultures,

507
00:57:21,297 --> 00:57:29,847
person who does not have sepsis will have a negative blood culture and it will stay negative for several days until you stop testing.

508
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:40,027
A patient who has a positive blood culture with no antibiotics will continue to be positive, and it's outside the range of normality.

509
00:57:40,027 --> 00:57:45,157
Next slide. So in verification, how many samples do you test?

510
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:51,907
Obviously, it is a big strain on a laboratory to do all the verification and validation testing, but it has to be done.

511
00:57:51,907 --> 00:57:56,737
So the number of samples to test depends on the test system in the laboratory test volume.

512
00:57:56,737 --> 00:58:01,087
If it's an FDA approved test, it's 20 positives and negatives.

513
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,437
And if you test them and they come out 20 positives and negatives, you're good.

514
00:58:05,437 --> 00:58:09,607
If it's not FDA approved, the requirements are much more stringent.

515
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:16,987
You have to test 50 positive specimens and 50 negatives, and the number used for each part of the verification will vary.

516
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:25,267
So sometimes you need to call and get additional information on what you need to do to do a verification.

517
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:31,867
If it's a not FDA approved test, but the minimum here is 50 and 50 50 positive and 50 negatives.

518
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:37,357
The laboratory director must review and approve the results before reporting any patient results and if they're not approved,

519
00:58:37,357 --> 00:58:45,387
additional testing verification testing is necessary.

520
00:58:45,387 --> 00:58:50,727
Next slide, so we've talked about sensitivity and specificity, this is sensitivity,

521
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:56,157
and it's the probability of a positive test result given the presence of disease.

522
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,427
So if a person has a strep throat and they get has a sore throat,

523
00:58:59,427 --> 00:59:06,627
they do a culture and it's group strep that's a positive result in the presence of disease.

524
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:11,007
How good is the test at detecting infection in those who have the disease?

525
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:17,457
So if there's a low detection rate, is it due to the test not being sensitive enough?

526
00:59:17,457 --> 00:59:21,957
Perhaps the test is being used inappropriately or it's the wrong test.

527
00:59:21,957 --> 00:59:29,817
So you have to look at how good is the test is the test at detecting infection in patients who are positive for that disease,

528
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:36,357
and that is the sensitivity of the test. A sensitive test will rarely miss people who have the disease.

529
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:45,787
You may have a few false negatives, but generally you'll have mostly appropriate positive results.

530
00:59:45,787 --> 00:59:54,217
Specificity is the other factor here, sensitivity and specificity always go along, so specificity is the probability of a negative test result.

531
00:59:54,217 --> 00:59:59,347
If there's no disease, you should not have a positive test result if there's no disease.

532
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:03,847
And also, how good is the test at calling uninfected people negative?

533
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:12,217
Those go together. So a specific test will rarely misclassified people without the disease as infected.

534
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:22,507
So there will be a specific test will have very few false positives, and a false positive could be a patient who was sick a couple of weeks ago.

535
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:32,417
Well, now, but they may have some of the organisms still around. But you have to have very few false positives.

536
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:38,297
Next slide, so here's calculations, and I'm sure you've seen this before of sensitivity and specificity.

537
01:00:38,297 --> 01:00:42,527
So you've got on the top disease present or absent.

538
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:47,297
And on the left hand side, positive test result or a negative test result.

539
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:52,037
So if the test is positive and the disease is present, that's a true positive.

540
01:00:52,037 --> 01:00:56,897
If the disease is absent, but you have a positive test, that's a false positive.

541
01:00:56,897 --> 01:01:01,967
If the test is negative but the disease is present, that's a false negative.

542
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:05,427
And then if the disease is absent and the test is negative, that's a true negative.

543
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:15,137
So clearly you want to be either in the lower right hand corner or up in the upper left hand corner if you've got sick patients.

544
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:20,927
So sensitivity and these are two calculations that you need to remember.

545
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:28,397
Sensitivity is true positive, divided by true positive plus false negative and the opposite.

546
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:39,017
Now, the specificity is a true negative divided by true negative plus false positive.

547
01:01:39,017 --> 01:01:41,327
Next slide.

548
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:51,167
Then we go on to predictive value, so the predictive value is the probability of the presence or absence of a disease given the results of a test.

549
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:59,477
So does a test have a high positive predictive value, a low present positive predictive value if it's a low positive predictive value?

550
01:01:59,477 --> 01:02:08,687
It's probably not the test you want to use. So a positive predictive value is the probability of a disease in a patient with positive test result.

551
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:22,967
They go together and a. Positive predictive value negative is the probability of not having disease when the test result is negative.

552
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:29,297
And those are two that you need to remember also. Next slide.

553
01:02:29,297 --> 01:02:33,017
So here's calculations of predictive values.

554
01:02:33,017 --> 01:02:34,757
We've got true positive.

555
01:02:34,757 --> 01:02:43,817
One of the diseases present in the test is positive when the false positive on the upper right hand side when the disease is absent,

556
01:02:43,817 --> 01:02:48,557
but the test is positive. And this can't help. And if somebody has gotten over the disease,

557
01:02:48,557 --> 01:03:00,137
but there's still a few of whatever the test is detecting hanging around and then your false negative is when the disease is not present.

558
01:03:00,137 --> 01:03:08,447
But the test is positive. Excuse me, false negative is when the disease is present,

559
01:03:08,447 --> 01:03:15,347
but the test is negative and then a true negative is when the disease is absent and the patient is negative.

560
01:03:15,347 --> 01:03:24,107
And so you can see that helps, excuse me, see the calculations on the bottom for a predictive value positive to positive divided by true positive plus

561
01:03:24,107 --> 01:03:33,927
false positive and a predictive value negative is true negative divided by true negative plus false negative.

562
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:42,927
OK, so going on to the next slide, so a little bit more on predictive values, how predictive is this test result for a particular patient?

563
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:52,137
And that really depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the test and the prevalence rate of the disease in the population being tested.

564
01:03:52,137 --> 01:03:56,097
So you've got some more calculations coming up.

565
01:03:56,097 --> 01:04:05,597
So the prevalence rate is the number of cases of illness existing at a given time divided by the population at risk.

566
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:16,787
Next slide. So here's the anatomy of an epidemic. We have the first case on the lower left hand side, and then we go from red to purple and then red.

567
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:25,517
We're in the transition period and then we are going up here and the the disease peaks at zero time.

568
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:34,817
So we count to the left weeks from the peak and from to the right weeks from the peak as it's decreasing.

569
01:04:34,817 --> 01:04:44,197
And we finally see the last case over here in the lower right hand side 14 weeks after the disease started.

570
01:04:44,197 --> 01:04:54,067
OK. And not just from when the disease started, from one when it peaked, then we could see how it's decreased and finally just about disappears.

571
01:04:54,067 --> 01:04:57,847
So this is an anatomy of an epidemic. Next slide.

572
01:04:57,847 --> 01:05:05,257
So hypothetical influenza test performance, the prevalence of the disease 20 percent, that's a lot of influenza.

573
01:05:05,257 --> 01:05:12,067
So if the test is positive and people with disease, that number is 380 test positive.

574
01:05:12,067 --> 01:05:25,107
People without disease is 64. Test negative 20 people and people without the disease whatsoever, 1536.

575
01:05:25,107 --> 01:05:30,177
To test sensitivity. It's 380 over.

576
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:42,507
Test positive plus test negative, which is 400 is 95 percent to the specificity is the true negatives 15 36 divided by six hundred,

577
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:48,447
which is the false negatives and.

578
01:05:48,447 --> 01:05:52,077
And so excuse me.

579
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:57,567
It's divided by false, yeah, false, false positives, not not what I said.

580
01:05:57,567 --> 01:06:03,567
So it's 15 36 divided by six hundred in the specificity, then would be 96 percent predictive.

581
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:12,327
Value positive would be that 380 people who are positive and have the disease divided by 444,

582
01:06:12,327 --> 01:06:18,537
which is the people who have positive tests, but some of them don't have the disease and most of them do.

583
01:06:18,537 --> 01:06:24,807
That's a positive predictive value, with eighty five point six percent in this example and the predictive negative value.

584
01:06:24,807 --> 01:06:32,007
The Pavilion is 15 36 lower right hand corner divided by 15 56, which is ninety eight point seven.

585
01:06:32,007 --> 01:06:39,027
So the predictive negative value is very, very good. This is actually looks like a very good test.

586
01:06:39,027 --> 01:06:45,867
Next slide. And you can do this with influenza, where the prevalence would be one percent.

587
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:51,117
So the influenza surge is just starting, you don't have a whole lot of cases.

588
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:56,367
Sensitivity of the test would be 95 percent. Specificity is 96 percent.

589
01:06:56,367 --> 01:07:06,817
But look, predictive value of a positive test 19 over 99 is nineteen point two percent.

590
01:07:06,817 --> 01:07:13,357
So that's not very good. Not positive predictive value in this case is very low.

591
01:07:13,357 --> 01:07:20,557
But the predictive value of a negative is quite high. Ninety nine point nine percent.

592
01:07:20,557 --> 01:07:30,097
Next slide. So we have a chart here, a table chart, predictive value positive depends on sensitivity, specificity and prevalence.

593
01:07:30,097 --> 01:07:38,437
So the green triangles are 99.

594
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:43,177
True positives? OK. Sensitivity and specificity. Right here, it's green.

595
01:07:43,177 --> 01:07:49,147
The Thin Purple Line is 95 and 95 percent.

596
01:07:49,147 --> 01:07:52,867
The yellow line with the yellow squares is 90 and 90.

597
01:07:52,867 --> 01:08:03,067
Sensitivity and specificity. And then, of course, the final line is the red diamonds,

598
01:08:03,067 --> 01:08:13,807
and we have 80 percent sensitivity and 80 percent specificity in showing you the prevalence out here and the prevalence is much lower.

599
01:08:13,807 --> 01:08:23,917
So you can use this. I don't find a chart like this being nearly as useful as just detecting sensitivity and specificity.

600
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:29,437
But sometimes it's necessary to know prevalence also, particularly if you're working in public health.

601
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:38,677
OK. Next slide infection prevention. Yay. The function of infection prevention is to prevent health care associated or nosocomial infections.

602
01:08:38,677 --> 01:08:48,337
That is it in one sentence. In the past, we've used hand-washing and hand-washing was found to prevent nosocomial infections.

603
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:49,067
That worked very well.

604
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:56,227
But some people don't wash their hands correctly or don't wash them at all, and running them just through water doesn't wash hands.

605
01:08:56,227 --> 01:09:06,757
These health health care associated nurse Comal infections add days, sometimes many days to patients days and increase morbidity and mortality.

606
01:09:06,757 --> 01:09:17,767
We don't want nosocomial infections. These are tracked by the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Group at CDC.

607
01:09:17,767 --> 01:09:23,287
And if your rate is too high, you will hear about it.

608
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:30,427
So the types of nosocomial infections there could be urinary tract infections primarily due to indwelling catheters,

609
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:38,647
get that catheter out as soon as possible. There could be lung infections because the patient is intubated or on a ventilator.

610
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:41,767
There can be surgical site infections and then, of course,

611
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:49,467
bloodstream infections due to indwelling devices and the chance of a positive blood culture patient has an enthralling device.

612
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:57,667
The chance of a positive blood culture goes up. There can also be the emergence of I hate, I hate hearing about these things,

613
01:09:57,667 --> 01:10:02,347
antibiotic resistant organisms, what I've dealt with, so many of them through my my career.

614
01:10:02,347 --> 01:10:07,987
So you all know what mercy is methicillin resistant staph aureus.

615
01:10:07,987 --> 01:10:13,207
And then we have very which is vancomycin resistant Enterococcus.

616
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:19,267
So two of the newer ones for gram positive organisms are Visa,

617
01:10:19,267 --> 01:10:23,347
which we reported the first one here in Michigan back when I was with the

618
01:10:23,347 --> 01:10:26,527
Health Department Vancomycin Intermediate staph aureus and about the same time,

619
01:10:26,527 --> 01:10:34,387
we were reporting that down in Dearborn, they reported Versa, which is vancomycin resistant staph aureus.

620
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:41,737
So we have these started here in Michigan. They have can now be found across the United States, and they are never good.

621
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,847
They are a huge problem, but fortunately, we don't see them very often.

622
01:10:45,847 --> 01:10:55,537
Then when we think about the gram negatives, we have extended spectrum beta lactamase producing enteric gram negative bacteria called Isbell's,

623
01:10:55,537 --> 01:11:04,567
and this makes it much more difficult to treat gram negatives when they are SBL positive.

624
01:11:04,567 --> 01:11:09,787
We all know about the problems with Clostridium difficile toxin Clostridium difficile.

625
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:15,607
It's not a problem if it's not toxic gennych, but the toxic Jenek strains can be very bad,

626
01:11:15,607 --> 01:11:22,207
cause unrelenting diarrhea and need for additional hospitalization.

627
01:11:22,207 --> 01:11:27,457
And then finally, along with the SBL as we have our series or carbapenem resistant antibacterial.

628
01:11:27,457 --> 01:11:36,247
Okay? And these are carbapenems for the last great group of antibiotics to be able to treat resistant, organism resistant gram negatives.

629
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:40,267
And now we have carbapenem resistant antibacterial. Okay?

630
01:11:40,267 --> 01:11:48,707
Fortunately, we don't see too many of them, but they can't happen, and they certainly can happen when antibiotics are used inappropriately.

631
01:11:48,707 --> 01:11:59,267
Next slide, so hospital infection prevention programs are critical, they establish programs to prevent the spread of microorganisms.

632
01:11:59,267 --> 01:12:07,097
They have standard precautions for all patients, so these precautions don't vary depending on which hospital you're in.

633
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:10,247
And there are transmission based precautions for selected agents.

634
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:19,067
So if a patient has a staph infection staph aureus and it's a Mercedez methicillin resistant, this point well,

635
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:24,767
even with a staph aureus infection, they're going to be depending on what kind of infection it is.

636
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:26,627
Some some type of isolation.

637
01:12:26,627 --> 01:12:38,917
If it's a versa, a visa, they're going to be in higher level precautions because there cannot be any transmission of that organism.

638
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:44,067
So the role of the micro lab we're getting back to microbiology now is to provide

639
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:49,747
standardized quality data to infection prevention regarding positive cultures,

640
01:12:49,747 --> 01:12:58,777
and we work closely with our colleagues in infection prevention to report infections of public health importance.

641
01:12:58,777 --> 01:13:03,097
We can characterize strains or have another lab characterize strains involved in an outbreak.

642
01:13:03,097 --> 01:13:07,517
We can look at the antibiotic REMS, the antibiotic resistance patterns of the strain.

643
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:12,127
And so if it's at one institution, we can pull those organisms, compare the antibiotic grabs.

644
01:13:12,127 --> 01:13:17,287
And if they're all the same, that's a way of saying these are the same isolates we can do serotypes,

645
01:13:17,287 --> 01:13:24,247
which is somewhat falling out of favor because of the lack of sera available for typing.

646
01:13:24,247 --> 01:13:30,337
But molecular typing has come on strong, and most clinical labs do not do molecular typing.

647
01:13:30,337 --> 01:13:36,877
They would send them off to the state public health lab or another laboratory to do the molecular molecular typing and say that yes,

648
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:52,297
these are the same isolates. So let's talk about precautions, so we have airborne precautions, and we would use those with measles,

649
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:55,207
varicella, tuberculosis and here is the infection control measure.

650
01:13:55,207 --> 01:14:00,217
I'm not going to read these to you because I know you all know how to read, but you can read them on your own.

651
01:14:00,217 --> 01:14:05,617
And then we have droplet precautions, and these are primarily from respiratory viruses or respiratory infections.

652
01:14:05,617 --> 01:14:12,247
So each influenza causes not only restoring infections, but meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottis and sepsis.

653
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:20,647
We've got Neisseria meningitidis, always serious diphtheria, which fortunately we don't see in this country hardly at all mycoplasma pertussis.

654
01:14:20,647 --> 01:14:25,087
We don't see plague in this part of the country, other parts of the country do and so on.

655
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:28,327
And now we could add to this COVID 19.

656
01:14:28,327 --> 01:14:34,537
So the the infection prevention guidelines place the patient in a private room without special air handling or ventilation,

657
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:38,407
or you can cohort patients to patients who have the same infection.

658
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:44,617
Health care workers not should must wear a mask when working within three feet of the patient

659
01:14:44,617 --> 01:14:51,697
and can't take the patient out of their room without the patient having a surgical mask on.

660
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:53,737
Next slide, we have contact precautions,

661
01:14:53,737 --> 01:15:02,977
and this is necessary for get GI gastrointestinal or respiratory skin or wound infections or colonization with multidrug resistant bacteria.

662
01:15:02,977 --> 01:15:07,807
This could be due to Clostridium difficile causes a bad type of diarrhea.

663
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:12,577
E. coli O157:H7, or Shigella, and you can go through and read this.

01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:19,297
It could be respiratory type infections could be skin infections. And so on the right hand side, we've got the the what needs to be done.

665
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:24,907
The patient needs to go in a private room with special air handling or cohort patients with the same organism.

666
01:15:24,907 --> 01:15:28,447
Health care workers should or must wear gloves entering patients room.

667
01:15:28,447 --> 01:15:32,887
They wash their hands with special antimicrobial agent or a waterless and antiseptic.

668
01:15:32,887 --> 01:15:41,807
And so as you read out here, there are ways that the health care worker can stay safe and also not transmit the infection.

01:15:41,807 --> 01:15:48,587
Next slide. Oh, we're at the end now. I would like to ask if there's any questions, but if there any,

670
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:54,377
please see me in lecture or ask a question in lecture when we meet again and try to answer it.

671
01:15:54,377 --> 01:15:57,242
Thank you. I said.
