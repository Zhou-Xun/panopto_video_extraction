1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:15,480
Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was like you don't get credit the drive thru you wouldn't have to be in Massachusetts to make it.

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,310
I don't. So it works the same all the way through.

3
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,610
I think you should be fine. And it should be fine. Yeah.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:48,190
Somebody who did the drive and all this kind of lost art out of that is how good you are right now.

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:57,120
Yeah. Yeah, I got my cousin last night.

6
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:08,640
Is that still down here? So I don't know what is going on.

7
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,979
Well, that's scary.

8
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,040
So parents have to come and help them get.

9
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:29,070
As a child, I had an irrational fear for, like, a year and trying to remember.

10
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,700
I saw it.

11
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,839
I was like, Oh, my God, I had to watch it.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,790
But I know that happens and I'm here today.

13
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,550
I'm going to drop out. Yeah, I know.

14
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:06,540
They see their own way that sometimes you get your big face met with some rugs that they can sleep on.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:14,040
They want to see if they don't have to go to. It's not like I don't want one.

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah, but she went to see, like, all of the same thing.

17
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,950
You know, this is just controlling by, you know, a reasonable amount.

18
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:36,630
Yeah, like I was like, I was just telling you, they are so like, I like to go.

19
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,080
I stay with them. I don't if I know spicy already.

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,310
So that today.

21
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,920
Yeah. Yeah, I think I do. He actually does. But she's somebody still the U.S. is on flying Syrian air force.

22
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,990
And instead of you listening to me talk, I'm going to be putting you to work around this.

23
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:09,179
One of my goals in this process is to expose you to a wide range of application of theories to interventions that

24
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:18,600
my goal for you is that it becomes a little more second nature as you roll into the winter of your program,

25
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:31,950
planning for it and sort of start to integrate a little more into your unique, maybe at least into more interactions about focused work.

26
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:39,329
So I'm really motivated to expose you to a wide range of examples that set an opening.

27
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,770
Can he give you a snapshot of like one or two?

28
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:52,349
I want to mobilize all of you into an activity where you're going to be able to talk to each other a little more during our time together

29
00:03:52,350 --> 00:04:02,260
today and identify theoretical concepts applied to designing some real world interventions for a range of public health issues.

30
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,090
So what I'm going to do is I want you guys to get into eight groups with your peers.

31
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,650
Um, and I'm going to assign you guys an article that describes an intervention.

32
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,780
You don't have to read the entire article, but just focus on the aspects of the article that describe the intervention.

33
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:29,490
And I want you to work in your group's chair. You have about five questions together.

34
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:37,850
What is the public health issue that they're trying to address? What is the population of okay, what is the intervention component?

35
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:46,200
And most importantly, when you're sort of reflecting all the various theories and concepts and models that we've covered so far,

36
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,559
how are you seeing them manifest in the development of the intervention and its various components?

37
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,880
And if anything, what do you think? Maybe this thing's going to be here if this intervention system is designed?

38
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,640
When you think about applying very scary things.

39
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:13,409
So you're going to get into groups of aides and I'm going to assign you an intervention and I've posted links on the cannabis site today,

40
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,920
so you have access to that here for a link.

41
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,490
And I want you to talk to your group members that your group is a little bit feel free to split up.

42
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:32,189
So it's a little more manageable to have a conversation and each of you should really take notes so you're not going to be a passive participant,

43
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,879
and then everyone's going to take notes around those various five areas I want you to focus on.

44
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,980
And then in round two, I'm going to have each group cut off 1 to 8,

45
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:50,219
and you're going to be a representative of your intervention and get into a new group and share with each other.

46
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,870
So by the end you will get exposed to about eight different interventions of you're using constructs.

47
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:05,700
And I really want you guys to get comfortable talking about this applying theory and discussing with each other the strengths and limitations.

48
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,510
Every week with these theory assessments, you kind of do this by yourself.

49
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:18,419
Maybe some of you work with each other, but I want to use this time for us to be a little more interactive and talk to your peers.

50
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,230
So if you have any questions about what we're going to do today, things.

51
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,710
And maybe you might be brave and join a group on the other side of where you're sitting.

52
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:38,100
That would be nice, but I'm not going to force you to do that at one point either.

53
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,979
Round one, around two you will get mixed up with each other.

54
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,219
So go ahead and just form groups of eight and we have eight groups like Raise Your Hand and

55
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,410
I'll go ahead and pass out slips of paper that identify which intervention I assigned you.

56
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:59,640
And then just go to that article in which these are the links posted on the campus site that gives you information about that.

57
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:23,730
Okay, so ready, set, go. So your that we need to make sense of you would tell you what you can go through.

58
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,560
Join our, you know. Yeah.

59
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:50,660
I'm going to tell you what we were looking to do this week.

60
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,830
How did you know? Oh, yeah, I know.

61
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:13,250
That's where you can find the best article right now.

62
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:31,770
Here. Okay, so it's almost like you're okay with that?

63
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:41,969
Yeah, it's one of those. I don't know. I don't know. Even with this one, we're not quite ready to say personally.

64
00:08:41,970 --> 00:09:04,420
But I think you really need 836 and you're like, maybe before I tell you what, I would just like to listen to, you know.

65
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:16,830
So that's what I was like. Because you mean like with I thought a lot about you guys,

66
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:29,970
maybe you just sort of go back and you can read through like when it comes to talking about I know

67
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:45,540
how to tell you how I felt like it wasn't like but it's not like I think about your neighbor.

68
00:09:46,840 --> 00:10:00,070
Thank you. Okay, I'm going to join a different kind of game.

69
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:08,580
I think it's going to take a minute.

70
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,370
Okay. Now you go to one of these.

71
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:26,520
I really like each other and want to work together up just to make sure that you have lots of options.

72
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:34,280
We got a lot of representation from the topic is focused on this.

73
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:48,920
You know, today's, you know, what is the public health issue because they're just kind of family.

74
00:10:50,030 --> 00:11:02,190
Among Latino men, would you be addressing timely HIV like immigrants?

75
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:16,280
And so are you. Yeah.

76
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:26,360
What is the intervention? One of the components. She says it's strictly like, you know, immigrants.

77
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,940
Or is it just like immigrants are Quebec?

78
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:40,010
He said, they say Latinos are things your particular immigrant men are more likely to present late to take care of receiving HIV infection.

79
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,730
So you're probably less likely to go to the hospital.

80
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:52,040
The whole in person skills necessary to deliver going out with your kids and

81
00:11:52,490 --> 00:12:06,440
you're not asking for them to compete with you do different kinds of things.

82
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:22,590
They say just. Down.

83
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,020
Yeah. Kind of.

84
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:50,110
Yeah, that's what it looks like. And then they also have like mass social media, social media engagement and recruitment.

85
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:59,280
A lot of it just in social media for the people to address the existing groups.

86
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,100
And I think she was responsible for it.

87
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,660
I went behind her back.

88
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:27,420
Yeah. Why did you. Oh, yeah. There were a lot of smaller ones saying, oh, you know, I don't know.

89
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,810
You're involved in the media that time you bring it to the community.

90
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,840
What was that conflict I should have learned about. Yeah.

91
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,480
It's community basically is the jargon.

92
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:52,110
Mhm. Where are you going to do community based research with.

93
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:09,830
Social, social motivation, motivation towards those social issues.

94
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:29,179
I know it's safe to say these numbers and relationships usage is based on.

95
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:45,460
Oh, it includes like. Policy focus social change has focused on of the complaints.

96
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,320
Oh, that's new. Ten milligrams.

97
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,830
Would you see? You?

98
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:14,430
Well, I was thinking more like the meeting was like, you know, like deeper and deeper issues.

99
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:24,459
I said, yeah, we'll see this as a research has a focus feature in it was to follow the previous meetings which

100
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,070
is what led them to using PR delivered messages as opposed to research and deliver messages.

101
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:39,490
Because of this, I think we prefer to have people who are like us to tell us now people for like, oh, in the things.

102
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:48,230
And I think there's always not like me. I want a one on one about whether, you know, and I think that's important for me.

103
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,040
Like, um, I, what do you guys think that we should include?

104
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:06,459
And I love, you know, they were like, it's a very, we have to be like, okay, slow down something, guys.

105
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,660
Give it as a program. There was movie.

106
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,860
We're on E for questioning.

107
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,940
There's the words, you know, we just say community based research and social kind of theory,

108
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:31,570
which goes in in the the research is more focus has a focus group do we want to self-determination theory basically because they use like a different

109
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:45,060
motivation around just like oh I'm asking like for days we want to include about self-determination theory because it addresses all your arguments,

110
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,790
talk about all the other things like that.

111
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,120
That was like one of the first ones that. Yeah, like that.

112
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:06,980
Oh just, just, you know, so I don't lose it.

114
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,350
So this is hopefully like, it's like your actions like that that's relevant.

115
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you think it's serious? Seriously? Yeah.

116
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:30,680
I have my family thinking. Oh, well, that was like they did a good job of like having people from the community, but they also just give women.

117
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:41,799
I was just looking at like the models and stuff. I was just trying to get the thing that the only way to deal with HIV is to not lose anyone.

118
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:50,650
They had a very it is not something they could have excluded as living people bringing with you the science of like how anybody can have sex.

119
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,910
Yeah. That's why I was limited to something more specific.

120
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,560
They said.

121
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:05,080
I mean, they said stable housing, expanding people like the transport insufficiency that exists, but it's not like others are working on it.

122
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,350
If you want it more and you think it's definitely a valid one.

123
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,770
Woman And coming out, I don't know if they're included in this one right now too.

124
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:30,210
I think I might be that we would be trying to do expand like if we were to expand something like sticking with like, well,

125
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:37,479
not just experimental like reaching out to but trying to get the researchers out to Latino

126
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,150
men in general and not just gut yeah that is where the they don't like work with other

127
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,000
countries like that'd be a quote public health thing is like oh we develop in America

128
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,460
what are you guys doing and you could change some of the materials for like nonwhite,

129
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,180
especially because it is social Texas. Is that socially conscious, right?

130
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,300
Yeah. So you could like everybody. Yeah, everybody.

131
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,750
But a lot of people in Dallas, it sounds like a third of the population were immigrants from from a different country.

132
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,300
Well, I, I think it's like a good opportunity to work globally with a bunch of people,

133
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:19,030
like with Central America and like change parts of it, how it's more like an increased on what people there say that knowledge is not.

134
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:31,330
I mean I think I think yeah that's a good point.

135
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:41,160
The problems are bad and all of this just came really, really close.

136
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,320
But I didn't like what was going on.

137
00:19:47,620 --> 00:20:02,470
I decided it might be just a little strange because it's just in general, it's all about like there's so.

138
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:10,890
I'm not going to ask you because I'm sorry. You're going to be the same man.

139
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:22,110
Yeah. Yeah. It just makes it harder for me.

140
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:29,190
You know, I'm kind of hoping, actually, and just a feeling, I would say that ages 18 to 30.

141
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:48,680
That's right. But I feel like I'm sitting there and it kind of gives you the kind of gives a pretty heavy weight.

142
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,100
People don't like that.

143
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:05,430
Yeah, I'm like, Oh, good at the moment. But it's definitely a lot of times in this community based on something like that.

144
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:22,560
And so in my community, so it's like one, like one of the things we watch on Monday was like, I don't have any organization regular.

145
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,330
I need to, to all the language teachers.

146
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:34,160
I wanted to draw like variables as community capacity, which is how kids really identify.

147
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:44,250
And then you're in those lines and it's what's really changed things in my, you know,

148
00:21:44,550 --> 00:22:01,950
I think not so much out of the city that so many of its aspects turning that lead to anything that you guys can see.

149
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,870
I think I like that. One other cool thing about it wasn't just the software,

150
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:21,670
so they also made modules available for everything except for the those options and see if that was the majority of some did it like education,

151
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:31,080
social and social capital. I feel like it's also from the students gets kind of.

152
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,790
Yeah that makes sense.

153
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:45,210
Like it's like I went to a seminar yesterday talk about the lessons and so like only some people were involved in like attending that things.

154
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,870
So like people talk about it, people talk to each other and that could be a way for them to disseminate information.

155
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:59,340
Just yeah. If people feel more comfortable having those discussions, just like also a lot of what they told you, which is, you know,

156
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,360
that's really good at making that the norm instead of just talking about like which like the very first paragraph starts about,

157
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:17,300
I just feel like you're trying to do what's your social one?

158
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:27,990
Yeah, yeah. I'm enjoying the things I like to grow.

159
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:35,280
So, yeah, the parts of the intervention, like the one they obviously built this coalition basically of news organizations.

160
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:49,530
They also embedded this model to help businesses deciding how to run a clinic alongside other medical professionals and not medical care.

161
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:02,820
And then, yeah, because in the presented it like a community and the community driven initiatives program which was like community led,

162
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,610
I think that was the thing is that like directing the whole paper.

163
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:14,890
Yeah, I mean it's funny, I was like thinking like that was something that I was concerned in a little bit.

164
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,200
So I don't, I don't think it's like. Right, it's more the health initiative.

165
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,360
Yeah. Part of the outcome will be the loss of someone like you.

166
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:38,340
I think it's my hope whether people are like, you know, if you want to do better, we for the things that really focus on individual.

167
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,490
Okay, what about anything?

168
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:51,990
Without thinking hard about it, I would just stay focused on doing what I like to do.

169
00:24:52,030 --> 00:25:02,650
So just like a lot of different things. But it's just like having like towards care and having like literally everything like.

170
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,420
I think there are a lot of like the interventions like this,

171
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:21,940
they're aiming to intervene like they did all that for like a horrible thing that was like, I haven't done anything.

172
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,440
I started and he. Yeah. It was all led by that part.

173
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:36,200
Yeah. Yeah. Well that might be like to even try to go and establish that.

174
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,010
Yeah, I like something else. Right. Right.

175
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:55,139
Yeah. You know, she's like, synergize.

176
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:04,770
The agencies like to talk about it. Like, I'm just like you.

177
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:18,220
What I was going through because I think it was like, you know, some families that were watching it.

178
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:28,040
And I didn't know if that was super easy.

179
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,340
I think just like maybe it was narrow, it was like, this is a good start.

180
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,020
But actually I don't think they had anything.

181
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:44,149
I think the idea is like we're trying to get some people them and said that like you don't have a lot of success in one area.

182
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:49,380
You you're trying to make change by themselves.

183
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:59,129
They don't want it to be like one question, I think, provided you had some reason why they can't,

184
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,560
you know, like, I mean, it's a huge, huge in this country.

185
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:26,190
And, you know, you did say one of our limitations and isolation section was it feel like what it is you have to do.

186
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:34,620
So like we're only going to talk about things like that.

187
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:43,020
Oh, it's nice.

188
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,110
Yeah. I don't know.

189
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,850
I guess it's just nice.

190
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:01,530
Didn't know how to do that.

191
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:17,100
We're. It's going to have to be somebody, isn't she?

192
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:25,630
I don't know. I don't think I really have the source and the idea of being proud of you.

193
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:34,569
But you know that we're doing my job.

194
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:45,060
That's how it would work. You know that it matters was like an obstacle to funding from foundations and research institutes.

195
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,139
So maybe secure additional funding beforehand or something, I think.

196
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,280
Program, maybe? Yeah.

197
00:28:50,280 --> 00:29:08,830
Especially with an idea as like I've been in the job so far and I was like by way of working with like cupcakes on the table are nowhere to go.

198
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:23,930
So I think especially because it was like, oh, well, you know, I used to be well,

199
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:45,770
you know, I don't have anything else ready to work, you know what I mean?

200
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,339
This is what you guys have been having some work. Got to go this way.

201
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:59,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

202
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:06,780
So that's how we're going to section off the rooms. Just number off within your group at 1 to 8.

203
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,990
And if there's more in eight, maybe they'll be able to review in a group.

204
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:18,250
And you can tag team the presumptive. Yeah.

205
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,380
I was like, I know my license one.

206
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

207
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:42,540
I thought it was like, you know, I mean, this is what I thought.

208
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:53,310
This is what she said. My daughter's like, what did you they're going to be checking.

209
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:40,450
Everyone wants to know they're there for you.

210
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:57,750
Oh, yeah. I think I was like I said, you know, you call people like the time.

211
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:12,550
I was just like, Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

212
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:25,420
Okay, it's okay. I'm going to be a lot more calm down.

213
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:39,790
Are you sure? Yes. Number two, we're all on the same team so that you can lose another head for tomorrow.

214
00:32:40,300 --> 00:33:07,150
I will be back. I mean, I tried so hard for the technology.

215
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:16,150
Everything from the moment you turned up the use of the process,

216
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:53,190
which is a part of me that I'm about to tell you the truth and the truth because I feel so present systems are basically higher classes,

217
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:13,300
but institutions like the ones in the room at the same time and the policy issues and that guardian papers access to the classroom online,

218
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:27,380
which was great but a lot of love to see me healthy diet and the living of

219
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:33,880
intervention as it is and correctly identified all the strengths and overall,

220
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:47,760
especially in itself, was established in the main stressors together.

221
00:34:47,980 --> 00:35:06,740
It was possible, I used to it and so they have the ability, sustainability meetings, medical information.

222
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,820
I get a report during the meeting regarding guidance of gardening activities.

223
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:27,340
There's a very good side. And so there were some listeners excited about what I'm going to morbidities.

224
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:35,980
I think it suits whatever you want them to look at.

225
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,930
What was the patient's regards? What is the type of what I like to do about my group?

226
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,110
And asked her about the neighborhood alliances.

227
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:52,089
And also as far as what I was aiming to address here, it was very broad.

228
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,300
So basically their goal is to help us narrow.

229
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,460
They are targeting targeting Inc.

230
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:10,050
So I didn't have like a very specific cause really because of the population that they were trying to find was located in Austin, Texas.

231
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:17,070
So they focused on neighborhoods that were primarily comprised of minority ethnic and racial groups.

232
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:26,220
About one third of the population. But they were or more.

233
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,320
And then as far as what's entrenched on their part.

234
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:41,100
So basically the first kind of stuck in the intervention was that they were different organizations

235
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:51,330
in the area first and essentially created like a coalition to this neighborhood and that was it.

236
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:59,550
So organizations that partnered up but then got a lot of medical school at the University of Texas at Austin,

237
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:12,960
and they were augmentation officers, which was community based or like tenants rights or that sort of thing.

238
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:24,389
And something else on this initiative and the different parts of the intervention were one,

239
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,330
they started with that like coalition building, but then once they combined where they got funding.

240
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:38,999
One of the first initiatives that they did was they embedded this model into this clinic

241
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,479
that they partnered up with and created this community primary care model for not doctors,

242
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,650
but they also had like a non-medical 30 year old family.

243
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:57,149
They also had an assessment unit, and they also did a community driven initiative program,

244
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:06,300
which is community led efforts to have community members bring their ideas of what intervention from one member

245
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:18,330
and then partnering with or ground to reality partners on some of the issues that my community was asked to do,

246
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:26,970
things like we're going to talk about like twice as many members and they kind of worked on

247
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:40,080
instrumental social and PR and the kind of like needs assessment and story and models to crack down.

248
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:51,510
And that's pretty much it was it was kind of difficult. And I got to decide what the limitation of the intervention was bad for the first 5 hours.

249
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:07,650
But and they also securing funding before transformation is so much about the large scale.

250
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:14,790
I also I got like there's a lot of coaches at the hospital,

251
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:38,820
so there's innovation in online modeling and I think you realize that there is an awful lot of people that might be like they chose to that research.

252
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:49,650
And as a result, their intervention for intervention was like six days after graduation and developing leadership skills.

253
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,770
The resources exclusive.

254
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:14,590
I do still education and I guess I stand in the middle of all her and she's actually when she stared at a table using the teleprompter,

255
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:30,750
it was like, I am supposed to be trying to make this neighborhood health initiative.

256
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,320
So the intervention not too dissimilar from Kaiser.

257
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:52,450
I started getting partnered with the student and struggling with her need to turn to design.

258
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,290
I do not like and I know that a lot of these.

259
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:06,569
Either go to sleep area or whatever engage her name are learning more about it in high school in the hospital,

260
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:16,170
environmental, social, cognitive science oriented behaviors are influenced by her own personal factors.

261
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:23,760
That that was evident when I did a medical exam.

262
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:44,940
They are only intelligent person they want. This was actually gathering information for her first so they tried to go back and start starting to

263
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:59,860
focus on what may have been created as part of the workshops and put some very specific information,

264
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:05,400
got really good ideas and those are possible.

265
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:22,480
And it's like, yeah, it's like it's like a very positive, really quick to say I'm not so sure I'm going to pay for it.

266
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,230
So it's kind of be like very hands off.

267
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:37,770
People would say, it's like you're going to be working with your mind.

268
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,760
I do read all of us reach out to typically target these.

269
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,230
It's all just like that.

270
00:42:48,410 --> 00:43:04,940
Don't want to communicate with them their own, which I think is putting on that advice, is telling how much you like.

271
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:20,010
You're not going to lose a lot of stuff from like they had you participated that we're trying to figure out what

272
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:37,620
sort of services like this we can make this for you and I know one of the neighborhoods even was based in Austin,

273
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,790
Texas, and it was a pretty broad intervention.

274
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,540
It was mainly focused on social life in general.

275
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:56,190
I was learning on campus communities, like all of the people, just like any consequences from an unsafe neighborhood.

276
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:06,929
I think it's like therapy because I'm not I'm not possible.

277
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:17,210
But based on the group, like I didn't even know where she was to establish this initiative, like that other one that they just called town.

278
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:49,020
I'm like because so many like the blood glucose levels in the logical model with the yeah this was one hour and a half ago.

279
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:58,230
So literally like the things that are so, you know, so it's just like I didn't really think,

280
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:05,669
oh, she meant I don't have this on your list of like if you have all the time.

281
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:19,020
That's why I'm surprised. Nobody else on stage for sure. You know, this is like focused on a lot of issues.

282
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:27,659
So I thought to myself, like, I just assumed that they were a little easier for to just make time,

283
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:37,980
jump the gun and get started applying simulation, work on establishing their partnerships and community engagement prior to starting.

284
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,290
And also you know we could issues so just making sure that it's actually usually great

285
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:55,500
focus critical is results you don't want to be like we prefer to spend a lot of very like.

286
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:20,280
I was always excited about the Spanish and English just because I was like, Oh, how amazing when you go to think of that.

287
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:34,360
And so it was like the final because it was the first time that you knew what it was like.

288
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:41,760
People that by not having status.

289
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:54,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:59,999
It's. It's pretty good.

291
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,420
How much are you gonna want to have anything?

292
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:24,960
And then they only focus on ages 18 to 30000 people to go a long time to Salt Lake City itself is the transcript of this all higher prevalence.

293
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,800
So what are the people involved?

294
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:39,330
So there's people from my shop, right?

295
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:46,920
My friends. And so yeah, that's true.

296
00:47:51,820 --> 00:48:04,600
You know, it was just like I didn't like it because it's something that's like, totally, I don't know.

297
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,650
You can see like the garden one.

298
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:21,840
Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, my God. In Navajo it means something, which means not only recognition and you might well,

299
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:35,210
not being there, but like I did, this situation was getting access to education on the record.

300
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:42,410
Yeah, you're so you can be guarded so much just like.

301
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:57,689
Yes. So he had to maintain those gardens as well that would educate the community on the importance of doing so in that community outreach.

302
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:07,530
And my job, I'm focusing on this House believe model because they obviously wanted to increase

303
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:15,680
perceived benefits of eating healthy by hosting to getting constant community.

304
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:24,690
Sounds like it has to be also interpreted, I'm sure social cognitive clearly by increasing themselves.

305
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:37,860
Her advocacy around the neighborhood, she said she raised the garden so it's kind of managed to pass the time so that I know

306
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:41,840
that that really turning it really would has caused me to get a lot of feedback.

307
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,890
I know people want to know what it looks like those were the expert for.

308
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:59,010
So it's not like it's not like in a cage but with the garden.

309
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:07,730
And so it's a little too far out.

310
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:15,870
But after they keep something sort of like stage, right?

311
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:24,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

312
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:35,250
But I don't feel free to spend any time connecting with your house or not.

313
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:51,540
So how are you going to make sure that, you know, go?

314
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,700
Oh. Yeah.

315
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:02,490
I sat down for the first time here.

316
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:19,860
Oh. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Yeah, that's just great.

317
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:43,200
Do you want to know how you feel?

318
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:54,740
Like you know.

319
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:09,570
Yeah. Yeah, I know they would do.

320
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:25,080
You know, this is quite dramatic.

321
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:37,510
For the last minute, I was like, I'm sorry.

322
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:55,200
You got to pay attention to that for, like, not interrupting.

323
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:24,149
You guys are not required by law, you know, so that you're not saying, okay, yeah, that's what I hear.

324
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:31,180
I'm going to try to find the what kind of schools?

325
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:41,280
I mean, let's go to our services. Yeah, I guess so.

326
00:53:41,300 --> 00:54:34,380
Because I think that has been so hard to separate is not to be sure intervention.

327
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,710
It is what you're saying.

328
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:51,560
Well, I think you've done a good job.

329
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,190
I think you have to fail together.

330
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:12,780
So why don't you do that?

331
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:18,450
You guys have a lot of your say, a lot of Arabic.

332
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,080
He's going to destroy us.

333
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:53,040
And in America, trying to maintain that kind of you know, I think he's got a lot of other people on the bottom that everyone is saying like.

334
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:04,150
Of our descriptions. But I think it's like, you know, the environment.

335
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:11,230
I don't know. But it's impacting our economy.

336
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:33,030
Yeah, I know. Yeah, I guess I was just like, oh, my gosh, I know.

337
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,970
I wanted to go somewhere else.

338
00:56:41,160 --> 00:57:17,720
So. And for an American, just like, you know, I don't see how it's actually overnight yet, but I feel like, you know,

339
00:57:19,320 --> 00:58:03,460
maybe like this can be like what I do is I guess what you're doing is kind of like you're like making comments while your taxes go up about.

340
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:15,820
It's all you.

341
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,560
Yeah. Good night.

342
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:37,510
Yeah. It's true that my house.

343
00:58:37,510 --> 00:59:06,910
How much? You know. I would say that I tend to focus on a number of things that everybody.

344
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:23,590
That's what's important.

345
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:37,030
And I really got to get back to.

346
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:56,130
You know, I think the tragedy is that you can tell, you know, these things out because I like to act like this.

347
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,180
All right.

348
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:11,830
I think what I love about all of this think I think I'm just not used to it.

349
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:41,420
And then when you start to say that you are, like, really serious about what's the.

350
01:00:45,860 --> 01:01:00,750
I really I guess you can call me with multiple times.

351
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:05,060
You know, it's always been.

352
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:12,020
Oh, well, yeah, I took some training.

353
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:17,660
That is interesting.

354
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:25,510
Like, what do you want me to get?

355
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:54,460
Because these are the same. Yeah, like you're totally, I think, like my sister and my sister is going to be for freedom.

356
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:59,100
Oh, I think so. Yeah.

357
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:22,430
Yeah, I think it's going to be so, you know, happen, but it's not baby shower flooding.

358
01:02:23,500 --> 01:03:04,250
It was like I have to be able to do more than what we really need to use it.

359
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,460
I think that's true.

360
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:32,610
Yeah, I like to think, you know, tribute bands are really different, but I guess that's the biggest thing right here.

361
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:39,090
That's all right.

362
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,940
Because I don't want I don't need sequins fighting for my life to make that mistake.

363
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because here's the thing.

364
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:55,390
Is that what you're gonna look back on it?

365
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,710
I think that's my own.

366
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,839
That's what I'm trying to say.

367
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:09,750
Oh, I'm to name a few.

368
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:26,820
Why? This is important. But yeah, at the same time, I think I can think of a whole lot to get in there and start on it.

369
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:54,740
I know that there is hopefully since I was, I was probably the point 7% figure out how to do that and I did not make that choice that I can make it.

370
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:21,130
Yeah, I started I did not make the decision making process or anything like that.

371
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:32,280
Yeah. I'm curious to see how we can play all kinds of different.

372
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:40,440
In fact, I'd like to help you as well.

373
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:55,870
Maybe it's like we're not even like all the way through those interventions.

374
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:14,149
A better addressing. Yeah. I mean it's usually used for me to say I like action hero with an accent and self-management because I feel like,

375
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:26,050
I mean, I think everyone guess, all right, so let's say you're a little inside language.

376
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:34,020
We have we have this procedure from time to time.

377
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:45,780
And I was like, don't tell me you're not you're willing to kill me.

378
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:51,720
So what about you? I'm sorry I said you like I don't know.

379
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:57,389
I'm like, oh, yeah, let's go back to let's watch.

380
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,010
Can I get a decent education?

381
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:18,510
I want to know why do I like I very similar behavioral attacks are based on the same or directly to believe me, it's not like I can't tell you.

382
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:39,360
What do you research? Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Our connection there would be really basic based on the history of medicine at Mount Sinai.

383
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:48,150
Macroeconomics, such as? Well, I don't know how to get your to suffer.

384
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:54,150
So I said, you're like, how much is that?

385
01:07:55,260 --> 01:08:03,350
Some of the stories. Well, for context, we are the kind of doctors I mean, that's like.

386
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:10,120
I don't know that we had to learn to make the rules because it's like a two column

387
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:21,010
to be standing between them and the supporters are really starting to work out,

388
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:29,460
which makes them more totally different.

389
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:35,390
I to I don't know.

390
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:55,630
Yeah. It is just not bottle as, as early as this population has started to describe the population that you know a discussion group these interactions

391
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:11,910
that you're describing where would you actually want me to be after it was all sufficiently before I leave to go to war.

392
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:22,510
So sorry for the politicians opening up that they were going to be here.

393
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:27,580
It's not like you're like you just don't want to go.

394
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:42,340
Yeah, we do that. On the idea that sourcing early detection you like.

395
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:53,920
Okay, there we go. I mean, I think it's I think you just have to be trained on how to live.

396
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,760
Like, we're just like, what are you hearing?

397
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:11,200
I think, you know, getting credit, she's like maybe trying to address like the topic of the cause.

398
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:23,270
But when she does that, she just like tells the story about women to begin with and it, like, does not even see,

399
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:34,420
you know, when you don't have that sort of the problem is that it's not that it's not it's not like it hasn't changed.

400
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:49,810
But, you know, so many theories have identified that, oh, our stories are starting to show them, which is fine,

401
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:58,560
but at least I'll share like something that happened in her and subsequent years are obviously like,

402
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:07,880
I don't play like a medical do I have to sign up in that group for them only didn't comply with the

403
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:12,940
law to just start talking whenever she doesn't it doesn't raise their hand and she'll just be like,

404
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:22,330
there's so much for you. Like, I shared my example yesterday responding to my comment and she just like, you know,

405
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:29,460
we had asked a question about what do you do when you feel like it was like, Yeah, yeah.

406
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:33,570
What do you think about that class?

407
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:40,350
What you would do if you're not? Besides, for some of them more immediate, they can really see it.

408
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:47,230
And it's like, I'm sure it's like an obvious sort of like very common sense.

409
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:55,280
You want me to have this type of exploitation, especially in the background, so that might help them.

410
01:11:55,300 --> 01:12:04,380
And I think that kind of feels a little you're supposed to criticize, like, we just need to get stressed.

411
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:12,650
You remember, we just have better access to learn to do that.

412
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:19,540
I mean, like, it wasn't like, what would you do when you're arguing with you guys?

413
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:27,060
Like, they're trying to like, get her out of the way now and then we were taken by dead parts of your party.

414
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:36,190
And like, if you in your mind for that, how do you want to make the right kind of choices for you to hold the door open for that?

415
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,820
I'm worried about you getting like, just like a restriction.

416
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:46,960
So that's going to come back. Whether or not you actually I mean, I know some of us, but that's different from other things.

417
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:54,840
But they're going this is not going to help. Like you could be like, I know that I can lose weight, but not like, what do we have that losing?

418
01:12:55,990 --> 01:13:03,550
You know, it's like either way, these are not necessary. Like if you have to, like, I give me that and like, why would I?

419
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,060
Oh, no. Comparable documents of gold yogurts.

420
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:13,000
Lots of them went in for an exit interview with the Congress,

421
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:17,890
and then they wrapped up and the three of them turned back around and went into Monica's office.

422
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:29,260
Actually, we have more to come because you recognize that connections are different, because that's something that I feel like,

423
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:38,150
you know, like there's these benefits that I'm in close club, which is something if you don't have them.

424
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:42,990
Well, it's not about, you know, like I'm not going to be like Monica was.

425
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,729
I believe that. Yeah, I do this actually read the room. Oh yeah.

426
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:56,600
That's going to be about all of it, which was the first place to go.

427
01:13:57,190 --> 01:14:06,159
Yeah. And you know, it's like, yeah, but this is the excellent way to make it look like what kind of expectations?

428
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:10,569
And this is the next one.

429
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:20,110
You want me to remind you that having those details to the right hand.

430
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,739
Okay. Yeah. So I guess, I mean, that's a good question.

431
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:28,210
Like what? What would you like?

432
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:37,330
What would be like? So it's you're currently to Pakistan, it's your own confidence in you people for something like that.

433
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:40,700
I know that's what I'm saying. So that's what. All right.

434
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:52,870
So just, you know, I know I'm saying self-efficacy is your confidence and like the expectation is actually like so.

435
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:59,710
Right. So, you know, they feel like they're not me.

436
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,730
You don't do very well. But even though she says like early.

437
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:09,090
But that's very true. What are you suggesting? So like, what does that mean?

438
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:19,149
You're thinking about it in a way with the early school St Ange or like kind of what it is very much is one thing we

439
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:28,030
should obviously sort of eastern obviously everything like instead of saying the choice to create each 30th speech or so,

440
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:29,709
you can have an arrow pointing at both screen.

441
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:37,690
And we like 80% of what with arrows starting from the perceived behavior need to happen for early detection to be possible.

442
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:43,520
And so I don't exactly have ideas on how I really am.

443
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:50,650
I feel like if we're thinking about it systematically based on those areas, I mean what it's going to allow you to believe,

444
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:58,630
whether or not you can actually choose so in the background that you want that this right.

445
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:07,960
So that was true. This really happened all of them expectations so you can actually achieve the outcome.

446
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:20,870
That's one diagnosis is really amazing and I don't think it's to help people get kind of efficacy control

447
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:27,040
didn't seem to try and change a lot with reason to change the number of people that are getting screened,

448
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:33,159
you know, or at least maybe like excellence.

449
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:39,600
What do you think? So we're going to try to individually want to see where you want to see this.

450
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:47,360
Read it 16. It's not that they're like starting it, you know, I think this comes to here.

451
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,270
It's but I think because of screening, one doesn't teach others.

452
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:56,770
Yeah. So you haven't seen anything between the two?

453
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:04,800
Yeah. So it's like they do a blood test to get into it.

454
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:14,340
So it's kind of different from the test to make the diagnosis because we don't have the most mature guys.

455
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:18,490
You can see what sort of draft that was.

456
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:27,070
So the procedure. Yeah right that's a really expensive to Afghani so they can design one which is mostly based on their

457
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:37,660
it leads to the behavior which has very much with is a blood testing done right like in their sixties.

458
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:45,220
Yes, please. I thought you'd probably be so this would be like a triangle.

459
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:53,680
Somebody may not be very. So you have the arrow pointing right here.

460
01:17:54,520 --> 01:18:00,040
Right here, right? Yes. So you have to make like a direct link.

461
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:03,490
What do you see your first one come to?

462
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:11,800
So I think what we do is we do like primary care because it's it's hard to say,

463
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:21,610
but I see it's what I was trying to determine between I think we should make the arrow between these

464
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:30,550
two and these two should be different because think it's like and just keep it fresh would be good.

465
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:36,740
I wouldn't do it. Like I'm struggling to see how.

466
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:46,880
Which by the way, we would also like to make it like this is like access to like let's start like example like how many my son I,

467
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,960
I inherited this gene, which is a perceived barrier since I have them to see more of.

468
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:59,650
I don't think that losing weight would be able to survive a struggling just like this one, even for example.

469
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,760
So I feel like those environments, those two things could be. So would you just like born in the middle of that?

470
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:11,270
Because then the question that you're going to have certain resources available to you like you're going to have to

471
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:19,990
create or if you're not so that your business oh actually I might have something that's like an intervention plan.

472
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:26,710
Brain structure is like these two.

473
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:31,690
Where is this arrow right now?

474
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:38,589
And you could I don't know. And that could be a barrier.

475
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:43,620
Yeah. So I think it's idea that why is, is,

476
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:53,220
is it true you can remember it you don't need to connect to science which is like why are these are very very

477
01:19:54,490 --> 01:20:07,190
tough and how would say it after very okay okay okay so you have to go through those because so you go from 120,

478
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:16,650
right? Yeah. I compare. I was like that fault if if you know what I'm saying.

479
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:24,910
So it has to be like a source where I write about crime factors, inherited risk,

480
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:34,090
which is the lack of knowledge and skills in education and then perceive that as something that you with assessment in a part of dying.

481
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,390
Okay. So basically we've got to right.

482
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:55,150
You know what I need to tell you so I can just go right to the industry and then do all these things.

483
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:58,380
Like all three of these, you could just walk.

484
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:06,510
Oh, could you get it? And then we could drill into what it was like.

485
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:18,030
Because if you did also an Air America or to me you're saying like education would be an intervention for actually the entire world.

486
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,790
Just thinking like, what if I told you anything else?

487
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:30,370
I like Sheerness. I think maybe there's something here, because what if it's like an area where it's like refocusing smoke to the details,

488
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:34,470
how perhaps we feel that's but you just because you physically cannot do it.

489
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:44,790
We mentioned that we didn't expect it for most. I think it's something that came up.

490
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,210
So can I pull out? No, I kind of.

491
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:57,730
I'll leave you to write about 11. Oh, yeah. So for me or even so.

492
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:01,630
Yeah, something like that.

493
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:06,779
But I heard about this one.

494
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:10,470
I mean, it's never the word just right.

495
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:19,680
Yeah. It's a pretty color to other people, right?

496
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:26,370
Yeah. Okay. Well, honestly, I don't honestly, I don't read your script.

497
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:35,510
These don't have to be like, why don't you you could do this anything the, the, the help you need.

498
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,750
First names. I can I used to work class.

499
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:54,540
I was like do when we first met and her husband used to put me in a race on the bottom ones like elements and you on this.

500
01:22:55,140 --> 01:23:10,890
Yeah I think we need to meet time so like this it's like I love know it's so hard to organize them like do it this way.

501
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:15,470
I should love arms and you can see how chaotic that's like.

502
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,840
So we're not I don't think.

503
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:30,930
Oh, I don't know. It feels like like every case I just check in tomorrow.

504
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:40,350
I don't want to go with it thinking what it was due Friday.

505
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:48,330
It's just the draft I was in to really see her like get ready to submit and submitted.

506
01:23:49,590 --> 01:24:01,580
I must submit on Friday morning and you just send this are is not correct and have you were going to get exactly what you're talking about.

507
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:09,930
I'm I'm going to meet you there. I was doing some stuff before me so everyone that I know how much is just like

508
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:16,499
I think I was like oh how the research for they one were just like it's good.

509
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:27,180
I mean so I'm going to cut it because after all, she means that like that, you know,

510
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:37,910
no criticism of I don't relationship actually it's just like there's so many different results and they're

511
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:51,920
one of the on and you just sort of like yeah that's hard because what are you suggesting are like yeah,

512
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:58,110
that's like an improvement is a lot like after I graduated semester.
