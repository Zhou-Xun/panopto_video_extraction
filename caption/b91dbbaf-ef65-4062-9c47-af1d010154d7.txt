1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:06,520
Then to the contrary. According to the.

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,950
And I didn't. Okay. I came up a little bit late.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,420
I was making some last minute edits to this presentation.

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:29,570
So today we're going to be talking about vitamin C and I'm going to give you some background in vitamin C and scurvy.

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,590
And this has a huge impact on society in general.

6
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:49,220
So it's worth discussing and covering this. There's been a lot of interest in the potential for vitamin C to regulate immune function.

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:58,490
And I'll go over that when I when I want to qualify this by saying that vitamin C deficiency,

8
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:03,860
there's a clear cause and effect relationship between deficiency and impaired function.

9
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,330
In terms of supplementation,

10
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:16,400
there's been a lot of discussion and people wanting to show an effect of vitamin C supplementation on preventing the common cold,

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,090
preventing or reducing the severity of illness from the common cold.

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,620
And this is a highly controversial thought.

13
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:33,320
There's been a number of studies. Well, I'll go over some of the data to discuss this and you'll see why it's controversial.

14
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,670
And at the very end, there's just one slide on this.

15
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,399
It looks at it's kind of a review in the Cochrane Review,

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:52,190
which is a systematic review of all of the data on vitamin C supplementation trials and whether or not it's worth

17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,370
or has an effective and effective treatment on preventing the common cold or reducing the severity of illness.

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,790
And we'll go over that at the very end. So these are the things that I'd like you to learn today.

19
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:14,270
So I'm sorry to even turn on on you're seeing it in front of you, but you're not seeing it on the screen.

20
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,170
Okay. We hear.

21
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:57,570
At this point. So this is a big source of interest for the companies that make these vitamin C supplements.

22
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,030
So emergency is a popular supplement that people take.

23
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,700
It has a lot of vitamin C in it, about a gram, and it's got a lot of other micronutrients in it.

24
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,650
Whether or not this is an effective treatment, it most will discuss this today.

25
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,379
But this is an expensive kind of thing to buy.

26
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,770
And you'll see at the end whether or not it's worth it.

27
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,610
How many of you have tried this, this couple of people?

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,680
Did you do you think it did anything for you? I think it was definitely mostly a blend because it's EPO effect.

29
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,090
Yeah. Yeah. How about you, Abby?

30
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:48,120
I mean, I tried it once, once a long time ago when I was an undergrad, but I don't know if I didn't think I was living in the dorms at the time.

31
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,350
So yeah, I probably said yeah.

32
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,840
About anybody else. Jenna? No. Elizabeth.

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:06,630
No. So the new thing, the hot thing that people are excited about, vitamin C is whether or not it prevents COVID 19.

34
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,300
And boy, that's a that's a whole nother ball of wax.

35
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,640
There are studies coming out looking at this therapy, even in clinical trials,

36
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:26,190
to give people systemic vitamin C supplements to look at whether or not that prevents the severity of COVID 19.

37
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,629
And that data is all over the place.

38
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:42,030
And what I often see is people trying to make claims for supplementation based on a small subset of patients who have other things going on.

39
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,690
Oh, they have. So you can find papers showing vitamin C deficiency by measuring formic acid in the

40
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,840
blood and showing greater symptoms from from the severity of illness from COVID 19.

41
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,830
But they won't say, oh, by the way, these these patients were smokers as well, you know, which is confounds everything in my mind.

42
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,530
So that's that's kind of the background to this. That's today's lecture.

43
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:17,530
So just a little bit of out of history. Scurvy has been around for generations, going back thousands of years.

44
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:28,090
So modern archeology has given us a view of what life may have been like for people.

45
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:36,190
This is a skeleton of a young child demonstrating symptoms of scurvy.

46
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,669
So the first image here is the maxilla maxilla bone on the left,

47
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:51,790
maxilla bone showing porosity in newborn formation on the outside of the surface of the bone, which is a classic sign of of scurvy.

48
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,620
Vitamin C deficiency.

49
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:07,749
And then when look when you look at the long bones of this child who was buried, you know, almost 4000 years ago, you see other signs of scurvy,

50
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,580
new bone formation along the post posterior lateral surface of the bone,

51
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:20,290
indicating a lack of vitamin C and you need vitamin C for a trabecular bone formation.

52
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:27,190
And this is a classic symptom associated with vitamin C deficiency in children.

53
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:36,190
And this this child may have had other symptoms associated with scurvy, the disease that occurs with vitamin C deficiency.

54
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,330
So this was a very, very big deal.

55
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:53,680
Think about it. We have access to fruits and vegetables year round because of our modern supply chains.

56
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:02,019
But long time ago, this source of of of nutrition was not available,

57
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:10,090
especially to the sailors whose occupation was to be out to sea for months or years even.

58
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:22,180
So during the age of sail, which is between about the 16th, the 16th and 19th century, um, there was a scurvy was a major cause of death.

59
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,460
And this is an etching of sailors aboard a ship at the time of the Ancient Mariner.

60
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,680
And it shows you the state of the sailors there.

61
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:44,740
They're exhausted. They're slumped over from exhaustion of the labor involved and probably due to scurvy.

62
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:58,660
So scurvy affected many different physiologic functions, which will see and led to an incredible number of deaths with this population of of laborers.

63
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:09,960
So this is a drawing of what someone might look like if they had scurvy.

64
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:18,750
And a classic symptoms associated with scurvy was this is the appearance of place like blood blisters.

65
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:31,440
So the blood blisters were forming underneath the skin and you need vitamin C for the production of collagen.

66
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,130
So college is constantly turning over in your tissues.

67
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,260
And if that collagen isn't rebuilt, you have problems with the integrity of tissues,

68
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,090
the vasculature, the things in the vascular space versus the interstitial space.

69
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:57,150
And what you see here is blood escaping from the capillaries and building up underneath the skin and within the muscle and other tissues.

70
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:11,550
So there are a number of signs and symptoms of scurvy, and this can occur within a period of 1 to 3 months.

71
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,440
With vitamin C deficiency, the most classic and common symptom is bleeding of the gums.

72
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:29,190
And this is a young child who's showing bloody gums here, but their teeth are in the lower part of their job.

73
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,360
And you'll also see signs within the skin.

74
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,690
You have these pin like blood blisters on the surface of the skin.

75
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:55,129
And then you'll see other types or other formations that these kind of little blisters and then the structure

76
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:03,590
of the hair can change in response to a vitamin C deficiency such that the hairs in a harmful shape.

77
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:10,940
So these are these are signs that would occur early before this large blood blisters appeal.

78
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:20,450
And it appeared it has to do with the college in not being restored with having vitamin C present.

79
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,800
Another classic sign and symptoms is this splinter hemorrhage.

80
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,820
This occurs right underneath the surface of the fingernails.

81
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
So that's an image that represents that condition.

82
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,340
And then you have joint effusions.

83
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,490
So vitamin C is really important for the formation of bone.

84
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:55,550
And you might observe swelling of the knee joints and people who have vitamin C deficiencies as a consequence of this.

85
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,520
So there's pain associated with this as well.

86
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:09,380
So bone information at the knee joint is as significantly affected by vitamin C deficiency.

87
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:16,190
And then you need a vitamin C for red blood cell formation.

88
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:24,800
So there's an increase in hemolysis in people who have vitamin C deficiency or scurvy.

89
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,930
So associated with this is a feeling of fatigue and tiredness.

90
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:39,860
So there's more hemolysis of the red blood cells and there's poor iron absorption from the gut in the absence or deficiency of vitamin C.

91
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,790
So although all of these things contribute to all of these conditions.

92
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,350
And then there are neurological symptoms associated with vitamin C deficiency.

93
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:02,590
So ascorbic acid is needed for the catecholamine formation.

94
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,590
So with a lack of vitamin C, perhaps you're not, but you're not forming enough of the catecholamines, epinephrine and Nora Ephron.

95
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,470
Ephron. And this can manifest itself in terms of neurological symptoms, depression, fatigue.

96
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,510
It can affect your appetite producing anorexia.

97
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:37,120
It can cause nerve pain. And in the neurological symptoms and in combination with the anemia, you can experience hypertension as well.

98
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:47,560
So all of these are signs and symptoms of scurvy. And these would occur within a relatively short period of time of having a vitamin C deficiency.

99
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:57,790
So if you were on board a sailing ship and you didn't have access to fruits and vegetables or any source of vitamin C,

100
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,480
these symptoms would manifest themselves within about this period of time.

101
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,879
So. That's what I wanted to say here.

102
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,210
Going back here, I didn't finish this description.

103
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:29,520
So during the age of sale, it was common for the recruitment of about 50% more crewmen that you need to man the different duties of the ship.

104
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:44,250
So when the ship set sail, they anticipated losing about half of their crew from scurvy so that they would recruit more men to work on the ship.

105
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:50,910
And as people died off, they were okay still because they had enough people to man the different duties on the ship.

106
00:13:52,530 --> 00:14:00,929
It was actually there was a time in which during the age of sail where the owners of the ships or

107
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:08,370
the captains were familiar with the use of lemon juice or lime juice or cabbage to prevent scurvy,

108
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,900
but that those kinds of supplies were really expensive.

109
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,830
Whereas then getting getting an additional number of momentum in a ship was cheaper.

110
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,870
So they would just recruit more men to, to work on the ship.

111
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,330
So who gets scurvy nowadays?

112
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:39,090
Well, if you're a patient in a facility in which you have limited access to food, perhaps your bedridden, you have an increased risk.

113
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:49,020
If you have a chronic illness in which you have a greater level of oxidation going on,

114
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:56,130
this can increase your risk of a vitamin C deficiency because vitamin C can be

115
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,580
used up and not regenerated as a consequence of not having a ready supply of it.

116
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,860
It's a water soluble vitamin and you can't make it yourself.

117
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:22,620
You have to ingest it through your diet. You'll see symptoms of scurvy associated with alcoholism and alcoholism is fairly common in our

118
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,810
society among people who are in the lower socioeconomic class and the upper socioeconomic class.

119
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,720
So it's not uncommon to find vitamin C deficiency there as well.

120
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,060
It's fairly common in poverty in impoverished regions of the world.

121
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:46,919
So one of the classic examples that have been described is regions of northern India,

122
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:54,570
where especially in young children, you might see a very high prevalence of vitamin C deficiency of up to 17 70%.

123
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,560
So in terms of the United States and other developing nations, it's fairly rare.

124
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:14,899
And when I went to find the most recent data from the enhanced study where they were

125
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:22,130
looking specifically at the U.S. population in regard to vitamin C deficiency,

126
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:30,259
I could still only find this information published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2009,

127
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,730
where the survey was actually done in 2003 2004.

128
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:45,920
We're about 7% of the US population could be considered vitamin C deficient based on the blood levels of ascorbic acid.

129
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,450
So a fairly low prevalence in the United States common in impoverished regions of the world.

130
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,120
And then there are certain populations within the U.S. that are at high risk.

131
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:07,820
And you might encounter a vitamin C deficiency due to a dietary deficiency.

132
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:17,210
So there are certain types of fad diets where vitamin C deficiency may be problematic or common.

133
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:28,690
So what fad diet can you think of? That's a hot thing today that might contribute to low vitamin C levels if they're not taking exogenous supplements.

134
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,340
So in this bad diet, there's low fruit and vegetable intake.

135
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:55,940
And you hear about it every day. You know, it could be Quito.

136
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,890
Quito? But I was thinking of something else. But you're thinking along the right line.

137
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:08,210
Ketogenic diet have less carbohydrate.

138
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,659
Right. So go ahead. Okay.

139
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,870
Means can also mean, like, less gravy. Yeah.

140
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:23,540
So the ketogenic diets are consuming less carbohydrate and then very low carbohydrate

141
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,250
diets where people are consuming less than 50 grams of carbohydrates per day.

142
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,140
So in those individuals, they're going to be at risk for vitamin C deficiency.

143
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:43,849
And we've had students that were on very low carbohydrate diets for whatever reason, and they knew about this.

144
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:51,290
And there they were consuming like a certain amount of broccoli every day.

145
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:57,529
And broccoli is a rich source of vitamin C, and this is how they avoided vitamin C deficiency, plus they took supplements.

146
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:05,210
So that's an example of a fad diet where you might encounter vitamin C deficiency smoking.

147
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,650
So vitamin C is an antioxidant and it's a scavenger for free radicals.

148
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,860
If you smoke cigarets, if you're exposed to biomass, that's not smoke.

149
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:27,890
If you smoke marijuana. All of these things are sources of accidents that can lower vitamin C concentrations in your blood.

150
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:42,690
And then if you lack the ability to obtain fresh fruits and vegetables or fruit that supplemented with vitamin C,

151
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,320
you're at a greater risk of developing a vitamin C deficiency.

152
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,460
So fairly rare, but you do see it.

153
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:58,350
And in particular in developed nations like the United States, you'll see that in these particular groups of individuals.

154
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,610
So those of you who took 631, what do you remember?

155
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:14,340
What else do you remember about vitamin C deficiency or is that long,

156
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,660
ancient history in your minds now because you've had to remember so many other things.

157
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,730
Okay. So I don't have to worry about redundancy here.

158
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:34,559
That right. Okay. So another reason why I like talking about the history of vitamin C is because it was actually the second part

159
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:42,030
of the discovery of vitamin C and our foods rich in vitamin C was part of the history of the clinical trials.

160
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:50,220
So the very first clinical trial was performed to determine what we should do to prevent scurvy.

161
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:59,370
And way back in 1617, the Surgeon General, John Woodhall of the British East India Company,

162
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:12,270
the company that was responsible for shipping materials, goods from India to the United Kingdom.

163
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,370
This is a very lucrative trade, and it was a very, very long journey.

164
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:31,890
So to get from the United Kingdom to India, you had to go around Europe, around the Horn of Africa and up into the Indian Sea.

165
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:41,340
And then to get to India is a very, very long voyage. And many of the crewmen within these ships died of scurvy.

166
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:57,510
And so James Flynn was aboard the HMS Salisbury in 1747, and so I should go back here.

167
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,989
So the first clinical trial was in 1747.

168
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:10,690
The the the recommendation for preventing scurvy was actually instituted in the 1600s.

169
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,090
So lemon juice was known in some circles to prevent scurvy.

170
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:23,940
But in terms of it, it being tested as an effective treatment didn't happen until the first clinical trial by James Lind in 1747.

171
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:35,220
So he recruited 12 men who had scurvy and he separated them into six different pairs.

172
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,290
So the first group had the same diet that they had.

173
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,320
They had six pairs, so there was the same diet plus the treatment.

174
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,610
So the first group had the regular sailor died, plus cider.

175
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,870
The next group had a sulfuric acid cocktail.

176
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:07,460
The other group had vinegar. And the point of these treatments was to provide acidity to the the diet of these individuals.

177
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:18,500
And we'll talk about why they thought that was important in a minute. Seawater was another treatment, garlic paste and barley water was another group.

178
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:26,060
And then finally, you had one group that was consuming two oranges and one lemon per day during this trial.

179
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,320
And at the end of the trial,

180
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:42,500
they observed that the guys or the men who were in this oranges and lemon group found that they recovered from scurvy and the others did not.

181
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:53,130
So this the results of this first clinical trial were reported.

182
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,420
And however, this was not widely practice.

183
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,610
The results of this study were ignored.

184
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:18,600
They weren't believable based on the current zeitgeist, the current view of what actually affected health and disease.

185
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,260
So the results of this clinical trial were or were not at all followed.

186
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:38,430
And here's an example of how James Lind interpreted his clinical trial and how the current view

187
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:45,570
of what affected health and disease at the time clouded his interpretation of his own study.

188
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,910
So his interpretation of the study was this.

189
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,719
So the sailors were always exposed to dance conditions.

190
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:07,620
There's always getting wet. And he believed that this blocked perspiration and they weren't sweating because they were always getting wet.

191
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,740
And this led to a balance of alkalinity imbalance and alkalinity.

192
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,230
And he believed that it was the acidity in the fruit's balanced approach in these individuals.

193
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:34,799
And he he didn't pay much attention to his controls with hydrochloric acid or other types of,

194
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,950
ah, sulfuric acid or other kinds of things that were used to acidify.

195
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:47,040
The drink of these individuals and other elixirs at the time were recommended like hydrochloric acid added to water or water,

196
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:55,230
word of mouth, which is a precursor of beer. These other things were tried and they were thought to provide the same level of acidity,

197
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:01,200
which would balance the page in these individuals, preventing them from getting scurvy.

198
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,870
However, none of this is true, and he had the answer.

199
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:13,560
The citrus fruits restored the health of the individuals with scurvy.

200
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:23,050
But because of this current view of what was important in terms of health and disease acidity, his study was largely ignored.

201
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:31,620
He didn't even believe the oversaw his own results from his study. So I mentioned here that those are ineffective treatments.

202
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:41,370
So what was the prevailing view at the time? Well, the prevailing view was that health and disease were controlled by the four humors.

203
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,180
You had phlegm, you had blood, black bile and yellow bile.

204
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,280
And it was the balance of these different fluids that affected health and disease.

205
00:26:50,580 --> 00:27:01,350
And if you had too much or too little of one or the other, you would get disease and you could do things to balance these different humors.

206
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,570
And that would provide some restoration and healing.

207
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:15,280
So there was some physicians that would recommend bleeding if somebody had scurvy.

208
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,250
And in fact, if you watched the video, a lot of the the blood blisters that are formed on some of these sailors,

209
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:29,380
they would cut them out of their guns or their legs or wherever they had these blisters and let them bleed out.

210
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,980
And they felt that that was a way to restore that particular humor that had too much blood, in other words.

211
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,970
So this was the zeitgeist at the time.

212
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,700
This was the current view of health and disease that was controlled by the four humors.

213
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:58,200
And that belief was so powerful that it caused individuals who were educated, who did run a clinical trial with controls to ignore their own results.

214
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:10,379
So James Cook came on the scene about the same time in the 1700s,

215
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:21,060
and he's famous for having all of his men throughout these long voyages who didn't get scurvy.

216
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:32,760
So he. Here's a here's a famous painting of James Cook giving one of his sailors, um, citrus fruits to cure their scurvy.

217
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:39,240
This is a kind of an exaggeration, and you can see some of these guys are actually exhausted.

218
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,190
You can see the boils on their skin, indicating that they have scurvy.

219
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,090
He was really clever in providing fresh fruits and vegetables for his crew.

220
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,250
But he also did another thing that was really interesting.

221
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,709
So you would have to stop at a port during these long voyages.

222
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:08,280
And he was going to the Pacific Ocean from the United Kingdom, which took an awful lot of time.

223
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:15,650
But he would when he would stop and restock his rations, he would always pick up fresh fruits and vegetables.

224
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,680
And one of the vegetables that he would keep and preserve was cabbage.

225
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:31,440
And cabbage was made into sauerkraut. And it's it's a very acidic food, but it also has a significant amount of vitamin C in it.

226
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:38,970
And to two Englishmen, this was had a foul odor and a foul taste.

227
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,600
And the sailors wanted to have nothing to do with the sauerkraut.

228
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:51,480
So what James Cook did is that he served he had the Cooks board, served sauerkraut to the officers.

229
00:29:52,800 --> 00:30:01,980
So the sailors viewed this as some kind of a delicacy and some kind of a, you know, really important special food.

230
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:09,570
And as a consequence, there was a request by the sailors to also consume sauerkraut.

231
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:20,160
And by providing that that preserved vegetable, the cabbage, and then stopping at ports to restock with fresh fruits and vegetables,

232
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,730
he was able to maintain that the crewmen on the ship and no one would get scurvy.

233
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,910
He he met his demise in the South Pacific for other reasons.

234
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,970
But this is the one thing that made him famous.

235
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,950
All of his crewmen were able to return to England and none died from scurvy.

236
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:49,430
So you want to think that, okay, based on those experiences, scurvy was a thing of the past.

237
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,800
It was something that affected people who just couldn't, for whatever reason, get fruits and vegetables.

238
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,820
Well, that that's actually not what happened.

239
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:11,880
So it was observed within the British Navy and the East India Company that having access for crewmen to have,

240
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:23,040
um, lemons and limes in the form of lemon Robb or lime Rabb was effective in preventing scurvy.

241
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:27,800
So to preserve the lemons, they would. Make lemon juice.

242
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,020
And the lemon juice was very acidic, so it wouldn't spoil.

243
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:38,899
So you could keep it at whatever the temperature was and holds the ship and it would last.

244
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,670
And you might have some mold growing on top of that and you could scrape that off and mix

245
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:50,180
that lemon juice with the daily ration of rum or lime juice with the daily ration of rum.

246
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,850
And you can mix a little sugar in there.

247
00:31:52,850 --> 00:32:02,000
And it was palatable and all of the sailors enjoyed their ration of lemon rub or lime or whatever the case may have been.

248
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,960
And this was an effective way to prevent scurvy.

249
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:17,330
So that worked. There were the number of cases during the 1800s, too, of scurvy, which was declining.

250
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:29,240
But at the same time you had changes, technological changes that moved from the cell to steamships and on the steamship.

251
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:39,440
The journeys were shorter so that the potential for the sailors to get scurvy was diminished because they didn't spend as much time out to sea.

252
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:47,900
So because lemons and lines were expensive, they actually eliminated them as being part of the sailors diet.

253
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:59,280
And so I still didn't know why lemon and lime juice were required to prevent scurvy.

254
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:10,560
And this notion that you needed to have its fruits and vegetables present in the diet of the sailors was kind of forgotten.

255
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:21,510
And during the early 1900s, there were these expeditions to the polar regions that are out there, Antarctica and the North Pole.

256
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:32,780
And there was this one journey, and it involved a long journey to the polar region.

257
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:40,070
And in this particular journey, they didn't have any means of providing the crew with vitamin C through fruits,

258
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:47,940
fruits and vegetables or land use or whatever. And a number of these sailors in the expedition died from scurvy.

259
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,970
And this adventure, it was described in the book, The Worst Journey in the World.

260
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:04,950
And this is a description of the demise of the crew as a consequence of all of the hardships, including getting scurvy.

261
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,959
Because they didn't they didn't remember.

262
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,610
Oh, yeah, providing this lemon robb or lime juice or cabbage or whatever the case may have been prevent scurvy.

263
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,659
Well, they didn't think to include this in these particular journeys,

264
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:24,510
which are long and arduous and often without the fresh fruit, fresh fruits and vegetables.

265
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:37,650
Okay. So in the early 1900s, 1920s, actually, there was this revolution in baby formula.

266
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:50,260
So women, particularly those who had many children or who had other types of responsibilities, felt that or that.

267
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:59,970
The idea was if you provide women with a formula, they have to spend less time nursing their babies and they can do more other things.

268
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:07,620
So baby formula was developed and it was essentially condensed milk, cows,

269
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:17,250
milk or some other type of powdered or liquid source of nutrition for the baby.

270
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:24,730
So here's an example. This is from 1920. This was baby formula produced by a company in Cleveland, Ohio.

271
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:32,009
And the container looked like this. It could be either dried or could be a condensed sweetened milk type of a product.

272
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:38,040
And that was fed to babies. These products were heat treated.

273
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:45,750
And if there was any vitamin C in these products, it was eliminated during the heat treatment process.

274
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:56,609
So during this time, a lot of babies were getting scurvy and this was, again, a problem.

275
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:08,400
They forgot that the people in charge of creating these types of products were not remembering the past.

276
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:18,780
So to address this deficiency, to address the reoccurrence of scurvy in the population.

277
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,720
Orange juice was mixed in with the baby formula and that prevented scurvy babies.

278
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:39,830
So up to this point, we still didn't know why citrus fruits, orange juice, what was in it that prevented scurvy.

279
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,960
And it wasn't till Albert Saint Guruji came along.

280
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:51,440
He is a Hungarian physician, also a scientist who actually made the discovery of vitamin C.

281
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,650
So Albertsen Guruji was a soldier during World War One.

282
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:06,370
He was drafted into the Hapsburg Army or the Soviet Empire Army.

283
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:13,280
This is a Hungarian Austrian empire or Austrian empire.

284
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:23,749
So he served as an officer within the First World War, and he hated this service.

285
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,050
And to get out of this service, he actually shot himself in the arm.

286
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,430
So he claimed that he was wounded in battle and they sent him back to Hungary.

287
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:41,180
And in Hungary, he was able to complete his medical studies.

288
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:55,400
And actually, after he became a physician, after the war and later on in 1929, he actually completed a Ph.D. at Cambridge University,

289
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:08,810
and he was able to do research on vitamin C and he was actually able to isolate vitamin C or big acid.

290
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:16,640
And he was able to demonstrate that it was the agent that was responsible for curing scurvy.

291
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:28,220
And he did this by observing or feeding one species of animal that was like humans and that they could make their own vitamin C,

292
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:36,320
and this was the guinea pig. So guinea pigs have to have in their diet some kind of a fresh source of vegetative

293
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,970
material that contains ascorbic acid to prevent them from getting scurvy.

294
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,640
So he had different treatment groups. We had, uh,

295
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:54,620
guinea pigs that were fed just grains and guinea pigs that were fed grains in some other sorts of vegetative matter that had vitamin C in it.

296
00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:03,889
And he was able to show that it was the ascorbic acid within the dietary treatment

297
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:12,170
that he was using that prevented the guinea pigs from developing a scurvy.

298
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:22,070
And he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this. And after a time in the thirties, he actually wrote this book, The Crazy Ape.

299
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:31,190
And the Crazy Ape just described this issue of the design guys and how the prevailing

300
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:40,490
view of medicine prevented the use of fresh fruits and vegetables to prevent scurvy.

301
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,369
And it was the zeitgeist before that which which at the time before him was

302
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:53,480
that the four different humors that were responsible for health and disease,

303
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,670
the dominant theory. And this pretty much prevented any other new ideas from coming along or supplanting that.

304
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:08,120
And so he wrote this book that crazy to describe that concept.

305
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:16,610
So that's the history. And it's, it's, it's, it's,

306
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:28,640
it's really interesting in terms of how we figured out why vitamin C was deficient and why it caused deficiency and scurvy in individuals.

307
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:38,510
Now at the time, the focus. So before 1920s, we're only thinking about scurvy in terms of the importance of vitamin C.

308
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,080
So um, having an appropriate model system.

309
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,670
This to understand the importance of micronutrients is really important.

310
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:56,390
And if you're going to work with an experimental model, you're going to want an experimental model that is like humans.

311
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:04,190
And you're fairly limited when it comes to vitamin C, so humans can't synthesized around vitamin C,

312
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:19,880
but most other mammals can mice, dogs, rats, other types of type of animals that have been used in dietary studies.

313
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,919
They can all make their own vitamin C,

314
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,650
they don't need to take in vegetables to have a significant or sufficient amount of ascorbic acid in their blood.

315
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:40,010
So guinea pigs, higher primates, fruit bats and bulbul birds all need to get vitamin C in their diet to prevent scurvy and vitamin C deficiency.

316
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:49,729
And here is how ascorbic acid is metabolized to form glucose.

317
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm sorry, this is how glucose is metabolized.

318
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:04,640
Performance in garbage acid. So you have glucose going to dig like you're on a diet and look like you're on a diet.

319
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:11,420
The quantity gluconate I'm sorry, gluconate. And then you have a key enzyme that's missing in these different species.

320
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:24,800
So if you lack this particular enzyme that can't make this next step that you can take to to Quito, we can do blue cloud lactam.

321
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:31,640
You can't make your own vitamin C and you can develop vitamin C deficiency and eventually scurvy.

322
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:40,249
So the guinea pig was the model of choice and still is.

323
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:47,750
And in terms of understanding the importance of vitamin C deficiency and its impact on human health and disease,

324
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:59,600
you can use mouse models to to look at this, but in the mouse model, you're going to have to do something to this.

325
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:11,390
Key enzymes that make this conversion so way to study this in a mouse model in mice are a lot less expensive to house,

326
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,080
to feed, to study than guinea pigs.

327
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:21,889
And the way you would use a mouse model is to create a knockout mouse and you would knock out this

328
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:29,870
enzyme here and you'd have a mouse that can develop vitamin C deficiency if you didn't feed it.

329
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:43,830
Vitamin C. So there are a number of things that you need vitamin C for its collagen synthesis.

330
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:52,259
And that's why you saw problems with the blisters, blood blisters forming in individuals.

331
00:43:52,260 --> 00:44:01,710
And catecholamine synthesis is why you saw issues with neurological impairment in people with vitamin C deficiency and scurvy.

332
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:09,180
And in terms of the metabolism of low energy, you need vitamin C for carnitine synthesis.

333
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,160
So this is important for metabolism.

334
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,910
So if you had a deficiency, you would have issues with all of these problems or issues.

335
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:31,410
But what vitamin C is thought of doing in terms of immune function is its ability to accept electrons.

336
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,920
So it's an antioxidant and it doesn't work alone.

337
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,010
It works in concert with vitamin E for Apple to come out with a call for ALS and Lou to fail.

338
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:56,170
So ascorbic acid is represented in this diagram as a square acid and the inactive form of vitamin C here is the hydro ascorbate here, DHEA.

339
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:04,800
And so you have vitamin C working in concert with Tocopherol.

340
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:12,570
So you have in the case of Tocopherol to confer actually radical on it.

341
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:21,600
It can take this radical and forming this inactive former by the day and then restoring the active form vitamin D or the

342
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:36,210
comparable and vitamin C can be restored with beautiful and potassium can be restored to reduce that down with any approach.

343
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,100
So vitamin C doesn't work by itself.

344
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:51,900
It works through this exchange of redox reactions that can preserve the function of vitamin C as an electron acceptor.

345
00:45:53,690 --> 00:46:10,970
So you would need to have adequate levels of ascorbic acid, vitamin E and blue to sound and mph to have healthy redox status.

346
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:19,250
Okay. So there I mentioned some of the physiologic functions of vitamin C.

347
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:28,130
Here are some more. So you need collagen for barrier integrity, you need carnitine for metabolic energy.

348
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:35,270
And carnitine is important in metabolic processes that occur in the within the mitochondria.

349
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,830
You need vitamin C as a precursor for catecholamine synthesis.

350
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:46,820
You need vitamin C to help the formation of annotated peptides.

351
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:58,249
And then in terms of immune function, vitamin C is important as a regulator of hypoxia.

352
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:06,020
Inducible factor. This is a transcription factor that's upregulated in cases of hypoxia.

353
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:14,600
So this particular transcription factor can regulate things like cell death, AP ptosis.

354
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:23,120
So you need vitamin C to be present to prevent hepatocytes and immune cells from occurring.

355
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:31,220
Vitamin C also plays a role in the regulation of of DNA methylation.

356
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,720
So in this case, it's shown that it reduces DNA methylation.

357
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,060
This is a process in which you have control of gene.

358
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:48,590
Transcription. And the Vitamin C plays an important regulatory role in these responses.

359
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:57,230
And then in terms of other types of epigenetic regulation, vitamin C reduces histone methylation,

360
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:04,340
and this affects whether or not the chromatin is tightly wrapped around histones or loosely wrapped around.

361
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:10,430
And this affects gene transcription as well. So lots of different physiologic functions.

362
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:16,070
Those relevant to immune function are things like the barrier integrity,

363
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:27,680
then the hypoxia inducible factor and then the epigenetic regulation and carnitine regulation as well.

364
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:36,150
So the chapter or the review paper that I gave you is is really outdated.

365
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:43,170
But a lot of the interest in studying vitamin C is kind of comes and goes.

366
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,850
Right now, we're in a lull.

367
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:58,890
That interest in research on vitamin C may pick up with it, using it as a treatment for people who have Vitamin C deficiency and COVID 19.

368
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:08,640
There are some new studies out looking at Vitamin C to prevent reactive oxygen species formation,

369
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:14,040
oxidation of all kinds of different substrates in people who have sepsis.

370
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:24,630
So that area of research is starting to pick up and hopefully we'll see more up to date reviews on the subject.

371
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:31,790
But here's a table that shows you a bunch of studies, many of them published many years ago,

372
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:41,280
looking at the function of vitamin C in regard to immune function so important in college and synthesis.

373
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:46,020
So you have that barrier function. It is it's an antioxidant.

374
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,590
So it's going to protect against the reactive oxygen species damage.

375
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:56,580
And so the innate immune response is going to give you lots of reactive oxygen species.

376
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:03,540
And having enough vitamin C can protect the host against collateral damage from those types of interactions.

377
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:14,550
And it has a number of other functions related to keratinocytes differentiation and lipid synthesis, fibroblast proliferation,

378
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:25,320
and ultimately it will shorten and wound healing in people who have infections or disruption of the epithelial barriers.

379
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,020
In terms of innate immune function, there are a number of things listed here.

380
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:40,800
It's an antioxidant. It's an electron donor. It's it enhances the motility and chemotaxis of neutrophils.

381
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,629
I've seen some of these studies and you know, if you have a deficiency.

382
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:50,070
Yes. If you supplement, I don't you know, you see a little bit of an effect.

383
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:56,100
And here are some key effects of vitamin C.

384
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,080
It's it enhances the ability of these phagocytes to kill bacteria.

385
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:13,920
It facilitates the clearance of apoptotic cells, and it decreases neutrophils from undergoing a process known as net ptosis.

386
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,750
So neutrophils can be activated to release their nucleic acids.

387
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:29,610
And within the nucleic acids, you'll have proteolytic enzymes that can cause collateral damage and vitamin C can prevent that.

388
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:38,520
What's known about vitamin C and lymphocytes is that vitamin C is important for the differentiation of lymphocytes,

389
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:43,470
but not very much else is known about what it does in this population of cells.

390
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:52,260
And then in terms of vitamin C's role in cytokine production, well, it can increase it.

391
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:58,950
So if you take cells and culture and you culture them with no vitamin C or high levels of vitamin C,

392
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,450
the higher levels of vitamin C will increase cytokine production a little bit.

393
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:09,690
But importantly, and what I want you to remember here is this.

394
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:19,640
So Mass sells the granulated more readily in the absence of vitamin C.

395
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:28,550
So this kind of work was developed in the guinea pig model.

396
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:34,520
And so histamine plays an important role in inflammation.

397
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:47,810
It causes edema within tissues in which the mast cells to granulation in terms of relevant tissues, the common cold, it's the nasal pharynx.

398
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:54,890
So if you have a lot of mast cells there and they're granulated, they're releasing histamine and that causes inflammation.

399
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:05,090
And that's a sign and symptom of common cold, right? So if you have a deficiency versus deficiency or maybe a little bit higher doses,

400
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:16,070
the vitamin C can actually inhibit that histamine release, reducing an inflammatory symptom associated with that condition.

401
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:26,630
So when we start when I start to show you data on the common cold here and vitamin C, I think of that.

402
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:40,880
So this is an old timey figure presented or published a long time ago looking at histamine levels in blood and that ascorbic acid levels in liver.

403
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:47,960
So these studies were done in guinea pigs and you can see that as the level of

404
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:53,090
ascorbic acid increases in the blood or in the liver of these guinea pigs.

405
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,490
There's less histamine in the blood,

406
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:08,030
suggesting that higher levels of vitamin C can suppress histamine release and perhaps symptoms associated with mass cell mediated inflammation.

407
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:20,790
Okay. So where did these ideas come from regarding the use of vitamin C to prevent and treat the severity of symptoms with vitamin C?

408
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,740
Well, they came from this guy here, Linus Pauling. Now, Linus Pauling was a chemist.

409
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,150
He won a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1954.

410
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:36,780
And his Nobel Prize was in the nature of the chemical bond, in the structure of molecules and crystals.

411
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:47,160
And he was very prolific and very well known, and he had done another a number of elegant studies to demonstrate these effects.

412
00:54:48,840 --> 00:55:00,090
Um, in 1962, he was also recognized for his work in UN in regard to nuclear proliferation or

413
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:05,010
the proliferation of the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.

414
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:14,459
And he and a number of other scientists performed or presented a number of lectures

415
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,500
on how this could be detrimental to the human race and society as a whole.

416
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,970
And because of his work on this, he was awarded another Nobel Prize.

417
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,420
In this case, it was for peace 1962.

418
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:35,760
So this guy becomes very influential, influential in these two worlds, and it kind of branches off from these areas.

419
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,260
And he writes this book on vitamin C in the Common Cold in 1970.

420
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:44,400
And because he's a Nobel Prize runner, he's got a lot of influence.

421
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:51,270
He's got no data, he's got a lot of influence. So from his own studies, from anecdotes,

422
00:55:51,690 --> 00:56:00,210
he believes that taking high doses of vitamin C can prevent the common cold and reduced symptoms associated with.

423
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:09,460
So what's the common cold? It's an infection of the upper respiratory tract.

424
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:16,780
And everybody's experienced this runny nose. You might have a sore throat, or maybe you have fever or muscle pain.

425
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,320
And it's self-limiting. It lasts 7 to 10 days.

426
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,850
And the symptoms that you get with this kind of infection are usually due to the immune response itself.

427
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:34,220
What causes the common cold? Well, there are a number of viruses.

428
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,300
The most common is the rhinovirus. So I'm going to talk about a little bit more.

429
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,270
But it can be caused by other kinds of viruses.

430
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:53,000
Note here, coronavirus, and we've familiar with this kind of virus from the COVID 19 to a different kind of coronavirus,

431
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,840
there are at least two different serotypes of these age agents that can cause the common cold.

432
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,470
So if you were to be vaccinated against one of them,

433
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:12,640
it might not do anything in terms of reducing the prevalence or incidence of common colds in the society.

434
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:21,049
This is why you're not going to see very much in the way of scientists or drug companies working on vaccines against the common cold.

435
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:26,700
They're just way too many viruses that can cause it. There are no cures.

436
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,000
You just kind of ride it out and you treat the symptoms. So here's a rhinovirus.

437
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:39,270
It's the most common cause of the common cold. There are about a 1 billion cases per year, and that's an estimate.

438
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:49,200
It infects the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, and it's a single stranded RNA virus.

439
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,910
It has a protein capsid and these nucleic acids.

440
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:00,900
Here's how enters the host. This is an epithelial cell and you're on your upper respiratory tract.

441
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,920
It binds to this LDL receptor.

442
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:10,170
Isn't that interesting? And another kind of a receptor that isn't very well understood.

443
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:18,670
So those are the cell types in which the virus exhibits tropism for.

444
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:28,320
In other words, it can bind to the particular receptors on the cell and get inside it where it replicates and performs more proteins or more viruses.

445
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:33,260
And this occurs in the end, some within the cells.

446
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:42,440
And you have a number of inflammatory cascades that are activated when that single stranded RNA gets into the end zone.

447
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:50,960
So it didn't mention very much in the way of toll like receptors before, but I'm going to introduce that concept now.

448
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,500
So a toll like receptor is a receptor on host cells.

449
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,290
It can be an immune cell, can even be an epithelial cell that recognizes pathogens.

450
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:08,870
In this case, it's a virus. And with viruses, they recognize by toll receptor three and seven and eight,

451
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:18,260
and they can activate downstream signals impinging on the transcription factor and nuclear factor.

452
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:22,610
Um, the Kappa being Kappa beat, I should say.

453
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:31,220
K But you know, and this can increase pro-inflammatory cytokines production and then you have other intracellular molecules,

454
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:41,930
transcription factors that are upregulated during that infection and they can increase the synthesis of other cytokines.

455
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:52,640
And what they do is they produce signals to peripheral cells to become activated and to be recruited to the site of infection.

456
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:58,970
So this is a short summary of what's going on in your nasal pharynx.

457
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:08,510
During the common cold, you get an activation of these pathways, you get all of these cytokines being produced, and you get cellular recruitment.

458
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,440
You get inflammation and symptoms associated with the common cold.

459
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:19,220
Now. So does the vitamin C.

460
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:25,820
Does there appear to be a consensus on the effects of vitamin C supplementation and the incidence of severity of the common cold?

461
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:32,000
Well, there have been a lot of studies on this, and there have been at least six large randomized trials.

462
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:43,400
And in normal interest, individuals in Western countries, supplementation for a period of 2 to 9 months usually has no effect.

463
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:54,770
So the idea that taking vitamin C supplements to prevent the common cold there doesn't appear to be much in the way of evidence to support this idea.

464
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,440
Okay. So this is taking the supplement to prevent the common cold.

465
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,760
The incidence of the common cold.

466
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:12,810
Does there appear to be a consensus on the effects of vitamin C supplementation on the incidence or severity of the common cold?

467
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:19,080
Well, there have been a number of studies that have looked at this, looking at both incidence and severity.

468
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,560
And one of the classic studies that's mentioned is this one.

469
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:36,000
So in this particular study, there was a group of British males that were found in a camp in Norway, I believe it was.

470
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:43,799
And they had vitamin C, poor diets, and they were engaging in lots of physical activity.

471
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,360
So there was a lot of physical stress.

472
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:53,500
And they there was a subgroup of individuals who were attending this camp who were taking vitamin C supplements.

473
01:01:54,360 --> 01:02:01,170
And it was found that in these individuals, it reduced the duration and severity of symptoms.

474
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,900
So this study is quoted often about its its effectiveness.

475
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,390
But it wasn't a randomized controlled trial, was a small group of individuals.

476
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:24,060
And it wasn't very well documented in terms of how well the the different dietary groups, the amount of physical stress were controlled.

477
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:31,020
So there are randomized controlled studies. They usually don't last more than a year.

478
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:35,010
But this was a study that was published in 2006.

479
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:42,180
Again, this is an old study. This is dated. There's been a less interested in studying common cold and vitamin C.

480
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:48,810
That's why you don't see very many studies that the consensus is it doesn't do very much.

481
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,860
But here's a study that was done that had some evidence.

482
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,350
And because there's some evidence,

483
01:02:55,620 --> 01:03:01,830
you're going to continue to see vitamin C supplements sold in the market and they're going to quote studies like this.

484
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,360
So this is a five year vitamin C supplementation trial.

485
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:14,610
They looked at the incidence and duration of severity of symptoms associated with vitamin C supplementation.

486
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:21,840
And this particular study was a double blind, a population based, double blind, randomized controlled trial.

487
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:30,600
The population, the target group, this is is actually a study that was piggybacked onto another study.

488
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:40,560
So they're looking at men and women aged 40 to 69 years of age, living in the Akita in a particular district in Japan.

489
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:50,790
And it it is an interesting population to study, because within this particular region of Japan,

490
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,810
the mortality rates from gastric cancer are particularly high.

491
01:03:56,850 --> 01:04:02,850
And so they recruited these subjects for a number of different studies.

492
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:10,980
And one of the studies that they were conducting involved supplementation with micronutrients.

493
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So they had these double subjects in the study.

494
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:21,390
They were chosen based on a diagnosis of atrophic gastritis.

495
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:36,490
So there was receiving animal annual checkups and they enroll these studies and they were given supplements from a vitamin A, vitamin C,

496
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:46,480
and in the first part of the trial, they were initially interested in preventing the development of cancer in these individuals.

497
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:52,360
So there was an initial run and phase where they were given vitamin B, beta carotene,

498
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:58,510
vitamin D, 15 milligrams per day, and two different doses of vitamin C.

499
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,549
And these were given to all the patients for the first four weeks,

500
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:11,950
and they wanted to identify subjects who were non-compliant or showed side effects to eliminate them from the study.

501
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:18,220
And after the run in period, they did their randomization.

502
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:27,400
So they had people randomized to one of four groups and a two by two factorial design where you have

503
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:36,849
people on zero or 50 milligrams a day of beta carotene or 50 or 500 milligrams per day of vitamin C.

504
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:41,140
And this the duration of the study was a long period of time, five years.

505
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:52,520
So during the time when they were conducting this study, they found out that using 15 milligrams of beta carotene was a problem.

506
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:04,700
There was a paper published on vitamin D supplementation that had indicated that giving people that dose of beta carotene had adverse effects.

507
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,900
So they stopped doing that.

508
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:14,180
They took the vitamin A completely out of the study and continued with just the vitamin C.

509
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:30,830
So they gave individuals these capsules and they checked for compliance by counting the number capsules, and they provided more.

510
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:40,550
If they didn't consume them, they provided the subject, provided information about a food frequency questionnaire,

511
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:47,000
and they also took blood samples to measure ascorbic acid during this time.

512
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:57,020
So they had ways to assess compliance and they had a biomarker to assess adherence to the treatment.

513
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:04,459
So at baseline in five year, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding their smoking habits,

514
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:14,210
alcohol consumption and medical history. And then they were also surveyed about symptoms associated with the common cold.

515
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:22,010
And here's how they scored the common cold, where they had cough, nasal symptoms, throat symptoms or systemic symptoms.

516
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:27,920
And here's how they categorized the symptoms one, two or three.

517
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:35,000
So this was self-reported information on the severity of symptoms associated with the common cold.

518
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:40,190
And they did this from a period of 2 to 5 years and one year after the intervention.

519
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:47,990
So there's the tree that they use to narrow down their initial 1200 subjects to two different groups.

520
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:52,160
120 completed the trial. They were on 50 milligrams.

521
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:58,790
Another group, 124 that completed a trial, they were on 500 milligrams a day.

522
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:04,370
And this is the baseline characteristics.

523
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:12,290
So for the most part, there were no differences in terms of their age.

524
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:26,090
Those in the high dose vitamin C were a little bit younger in terms of other things smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, dietary intakes.

525
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:30,170
There was no significant difference between these different groups.

526
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,490
So they're comparing 50 milligrams per day, 500 milligrams per day.

527
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,080
So this is some of the data that they produced from the study.

528
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:52,830
And this is a diagram or a graph that shows you the incidence of the common cold by supplementation group.

529
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:59,970
So the incidence is on the Y axis and the time of the survey is on the X axis.

530
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:08,130
And the straight line or the solid line is the high dose and the low dose is the dash line.

531
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:18,450
So this is the kind of data that they produced. And based on this information, you can kind of see that as time went on,

532
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:27,480
perhaps there was lower incidence of the common cold and those who are in the high dose group.

533
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:35,430
But let's take a look at how they reported their data.

534
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:43,950
So in table three, they show you the relative risk of the common cold incidence by intervention group.

535
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:54,030
And here you have people who completed the study and then those who dropped out were included in the intention to treat analysis.

536
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,110
So those who dropped out were included in the study to see if there was any

537
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,480
effect of people leaving the study that may have affected the overall results.

538
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,200
And they're comparing the effects now using the low dose group as their control.

539
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:24,000
So when you look at the total number of common colds, there appears to be more with the low dose total number of colds per thousand person months.

540
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:29,310
Another way of expressing the data and there appears to be a significant difference.

541
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:35,430
And when they adjusted their data, this is when they started to see differences.

542
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:44,880
So in this column here, they're looking at the relative risk for common cold occurring one time during a whole survey period versus fewer occurrences.

543
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:52,920
And so you're getting between the two groups, not very much of a difference here, one versus 0.93 and one versus 0.98.

544
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:59,189
If they're looking at the common cold occurring two times during the whole survey

545
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:03,570
period versus the fewer times the differences become a little bit bigger.

546
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:09,900
If they look at the common cold occurring three times during the whole survey period,

547
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:19,980
they start to see bigger differences where those who are in the high treatment group seem to have a lower incidence of the common cold.

548
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,350
So here and here. This.

549
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:34,120
Is that so three times or more year, there seems to be an effect for those who had three common colds per year during the study period.

550
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:41,680
Okay. What was the big difference? The big difference in symptoms was runny nose.

551
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:51,070
Okay. What did I just tell you about the effect of vitamin C on mast cells to granulation and histamine production?

552
01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:59,560
It decreases the history levels. Yeah. So what might that do to your symptoms?

553
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:03,760
Like a runny nose, but also decrease them.

554
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,030
Yeah. So this might have nothing to do with what is going on in terms of host events against the virus.

555
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:19,750
It might be affecting the the mast cells now that are responsible for this reduction in the symptoms associated with the cold or ninos.

556
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:25,660
And there were no differences in the other symptoms.

557
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:34,840
Cough or other other nasal symptoms besides a runny nose, sore throats, systemic symptoms.

558
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:42,700
And then if you add up the different scores where you consider all of the different symptoms, there is no significant difference here.

559
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:52,660
So those are the kinds of studies that you will see that look at look at vitamin C supplementation and the common cold.

560
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,720
And this is one of the better ones. It's not saying a whole lot,

561
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:04,389
but it was a randomized controlled trial and it was a study with a relevant population

562
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:08,710
and followed up for a number of years and they were actually checking for confounders.

563
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:13,809
So there were only a small group of individuals.

564
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:18,200
244 There's no clear definition of the common cold.

565
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:23,770
They were just looking at symptoms. They had some dropout that occurred initially.

566
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:27,549
They had 1200 people enrolled.

567
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:36,130
And this was the people who were interested in completing the study and they were interested in the effect of the micronutrients on cancer.

568
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:41,170
There was no placebo arm, there was no zero vitamin C supplementation.

569
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:47,290
So that's a limitation. And then the differences in serum ascorbic acid.

570
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:55,360
Well, you know, there didn't seem to be very last slide here.

571
01:13:55,690 --> 01:14:00,280
This is the Cochrane Review and we'll end here looking at all the studies that have

572
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:04,300
been done for the prevention and treatment of the common cold with vitamin C.

573
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:14,650
And here are here's the summary here. So for the most part, there's a failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of common colds.

574
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:24,670
There have been a number of studies seven mentioned here, comparing the examining the effects of therapeutic vitamin C,

575
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:30,550
and there was no consistent effect of vitamin C seen on the duration of the severity of colds.

576
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:41,680
Okay. So having this information in this huge Cochrane review, one might conclude that don't waste your time or your money in vitamin C.

577
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:50,080
However, the author of the study said he recommends people trying the vitamin C supplementation because

578
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:56,050
the side effects are very mild and it's an inexpensive thing to do and it might benefit people.

579
01:14:57,370 --> 01:15:00,760
I don't understand why you would come up with this recommendation, but that's what he did.

580
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:08,800
And as you said, Ilana, it could be the placebo effect that works, not necessarily what vitamin C is doing.

581
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:12,850
All right. So that's all for today.

582
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:20,770
I went over a little bit, but that is a very hot area of interest.

583
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,360
Previously Vitamin C now covered.
