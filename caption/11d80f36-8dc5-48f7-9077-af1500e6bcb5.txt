1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,900
Okay. I guess we'll go ahead and get started. Welcome back, everyone.

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:16,850
That was really cool last time getting to hear Dr. Sloboda talk about the first half of Carcinogenesis.

3
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,990
I'm going to take on the second half of that material today.

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,389
But before I do that, I just wanted to remind everyone that the problem sets do.

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,590
924. So that's like five days from now on Saturday.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:41,479
Um, and I also wanted to, I had a couple of questions at office hours that I thought made me want to briefly just

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,840
clarify a couple of points or just give you a hint for when you're doing problem one,

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,139
basically. Um, so I'll just talk to this and maybe you already noticed this in the wording of the problem,

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,950
but just in case you didn't, I wanted to walk through this, so.

10
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:03,810
Sorry. Uh. I want to use this as an illustration.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,300
So in that problem, what you're given, like so you're assuming an IV bolus injection, right?

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,900
And you're given concentrations in the blood at several timepoints after injection.

13
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:25,080
And so you're being essentially given these data points. And then in one of the other problems, you're asked to calculate the area under the curve.

14
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:35,870
And so you can and it says out to 99% of the area under the curve after 99% of the chemical has been excreted.

15
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:45,930
Right. And so that's going to require that you essentially calculate two additional data points to really get the full area of the curve.

16
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,190
The first one is going to be the initial concentration right after injection.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,920
And so you'll get that. You should get that. When you do the problem, you'll see an equation of the form that you'll recognize from the slides before,

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,970
where initial concentration zero is one of the terms you're given from the equation.

19
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,460
So when you plot that curve, you should be able to pick up initial concentration pretty easily at that point.

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,540
The other one is a little bit trickier.

21
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:22,680
So if you want to take it out to 99% of the time, that would which 99% of the chemical has been excreted from the body.

22
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,850
One thing you have to do is understand. Where do I have that?

23
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,910
Well, it is essentially. Yeah, here we go.

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,659
So if you take out just logically how many half lives it would take to get 99% of that chemical out of the body,

25
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:47,100
it's going to be about seven half lives. Right. So, you know, the half life is also from that initial equation that you got.

26
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:55,200
So if it's seven half lives times, the amount of time per half life, that'll give you the last time point.

27
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,830
And so where was that?

28
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,729
Here. So you'll basically add another plot, another data point to your overall curve and using the numbers for each of those.

29
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,209
So you're going to have a time and the concentration for each of those you'll be able to solve

30
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,910
for all of the information you need to get that full curve to get the area under the curve.

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:29,180
Does that make sense? So in the in the wording of the problem, you should be able to extract that information out of what I'm talking about,

32
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,990
of what should people expect that information from the wording in the problem.

33
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,640
So it's just a matter of logically going through like calculating, okay, if it's take seven half lives to get 99% of this stuff out of the body,

34
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,120
then that is going to equate to the time of, say, 8 hours or whatever it is,

35
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,890
because you'll know the half life and you know how many half lives you're talking about this.

36
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,020
Multiply this together and you'll know the time point, right?

37
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:59,330
And then that'll come up and you'll have, you should have the other information you need to get the concentration at that time point.

38
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,470
So I think that should be all the information you need.

39
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,620
I'll have three or four office hour sessions up until this is due.

40
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,399
So if you have and then again, if anyone can't make those office hours,

41
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,890
just email me and I'll try to set up a time that works for you too, to talk about that again.

42
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:27,760
But I think that should be all the information you have based on some of the questions I was getting at office hours that some select people,

43
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,959
some people might be getting tripped up on the wording of that problem or not understanding that, not noticing.

44
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,140
I might not notice that you do have all that information until like graph out that curve all the way to like 99%.

45
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,870
Does that make sense? So again,

46
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:52,340
just noting that that's the due date is Saturday and I'm available between now and that to talk about anything that might be still tripping anyone up.

47
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,210
So cool. Thanks for that.

48
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:05,900
And also, recessions have been fun, you know, at least for me, talking things through and going over, reinforcing some ideas.

49
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,140
Anything anyone else encountering any other difficulties with the course so far?

50
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:22,240
Any issues? Questions again.

51
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,480
Email is great for office hours.

52
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Always available. Okay. So now I can actually dove into the material for today.

53
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,600
Any questions from last time? Any like big burning questions?

54
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,540
We'll just dove into it. Okay. So I'm going to go over some of the material again that Dr. Supported talked about just to

55
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,619
kind of make sure we're all on the same page and maybe just kind of flesh out some ideas,

56
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,199
maybe a little more that we didn't spend as much time on. In the last lecture, you could see everything.

57
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:03,120
Okay. So we talked about this multi-stage model of Carcinogenesis, where we have different events that lead up to the development of cancer.

58
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,670
And so that included initiation. So, so typically this is due to DNA damage.

59
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,300
So a chemical like radiation or a physical agent like radiation or something can damage DNA causing something like a double stranded break in the DNA,

60
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,129
something to that effect. That is what we would call an initiated cell.

61
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,870
That cell now, that individual cell now has a potential to turn into cancer.

62
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:36,360
Essentially, there are pathways of DNA repair that our cells have developed that can repair DNA,

63
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,520
like really high fidelity to kind of counteract that DNA damage.

64
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:50,280
But it does DNA damage overtakes or, you know, gets around the repair mechanisms you have what you would call an initiated cell.

65
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,370
So once that cell is initiated, we then have what we call tumor promotion or cancer promotion.

66
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:03,209
And that's where this damaged cell proliferates and it form what's called a focal lesion.

67
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:10,470
So like a region on the body here in the tissue, that is a sort of an injury or a cell growth.

68
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,490
That is a lot of damaged cells that are proliferated.

69
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,330
And we still have ways of combating that, like apoptosis or programed cell death.

70
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,569
So essentially the cell understands that there's some kind of like critical thing wrong with it.

71
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,100
And so it starts to activate pathways that lead to the death of the cell.

72
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:42,720
And so there are so at this point there are still like multiple factors sort of counteracting this progression towards cancer.

73
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:51,059
However, if this doesn't work and the cells continue to proliferate and we get to a point where

74
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,129
proliferation far outstrips the these cross signals that are causing these cells to divide,

75
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,400
because we have all kinds of growth factors and things in our bodies that cause cells to divide and grow.

76
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,370
If that proliferation if those proliferation and growth signals outpace the apoptosis signals,

77
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,399
then because we still have this practice of signaling that could counteract this effect.

78
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,180
But if they're outpacing the proliferation signals, then you have cancer.

79
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:27,900
And we have other hallmarks that start to sort of come into play that we talked about last time that are part of like tumor biology and make

80
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,670
this tissue or the B cell sort of even more insidious in terms of escaping some of the safety mechanisms that our bodies have in place.

81
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,860
So we went over I think we went over this last time, but just to double check some general definitions.

82
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,460
Neoplasia is the new or autonomous growth of tissue.

83
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:55,200
A benign neoplasm is one of those lesions that can grow with this expansive growth.

84
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:03,100
Um, and so, you know, in some cases we might see slow rates of cell proliferation and we're not seeing invasion into other tissues,

85
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,640
which is like one of the main hallmarks of cancer. Right. Is that it metastasizes and invades other tissues in the body.

86
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:17,770
We can have a malignant neoplasm, which is an invasive lesion that kind of has the size to other tissues.

87
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:27,069
And then metastasis is probably not a super unfamiliar term, but it's secondary growth derived from this primary malignant neoplasm.

88
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:37,300
So when the cancer is starting to spread, essentially, then a tumor is like this lesion is growing, swelling and increasing in size.

89
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:47,380
Cancer is just another term for malignant neoplasm, and then a carcinogen is a physical or chemical agent that causes or induces neoplasia.

90
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,770
So these are some of the main terms that we're going to talk about. So I think we also talked about this last time.

91
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:04,340
So I don't want spend too much time on it, but just to like review. Initiation is this stable heritable change in the DNA of the of the cell.

92
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,990
It's involved. You know, DNA modification can be DNA double strand breakage or some other modification to the DNA.

93
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,010
Typically, this is caused by what we call a genotoxic agent.

94
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,270
So a genotoxic, it is something that alters the DNA in some way.

95
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,790
You typically need to undergo a cell division to lock in the mutation.

96
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:32,269
So, you know, you get this one cell as damaged DNA. If it just dies, then not much of interest is happening.

97
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,930
But if it continues to replicate, then you have potentially a problem.

98
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,220
Yeah. So this is usually not enough on its own to induce a neoplasm.

99
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,630
Promotion is when we get is when that cell does divide and proliferate.

100
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:57,740
This is the expansion or clonal expansion of this initiated cell population and we can get endogenous or exogenous stimulations of growth.

101
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:07,250
One of my favorite examples of this, because I work in reproductive toxicology, is hormones can stimulate growth of tissue.

102
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,309
And so hormones or chemicals that act like hormones,

103
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:18,020
endocrine disruptors can actually be tumor promoters by activating growth pathways in the body, essentially.

104
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,320
So if you have so if you're activating growth pathways and one of the target cells in there has damaged DNA,

105
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,610
then you have promotion of this potential in cancer itself.

106
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,780
Yeah. And so tumor promoters are usually non genotoxic, so they're not acting on the DNA they're acting through.

107
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:41,030
In the case of a hormone, they're activating the receptor that's causing the cell to undergo certain changes.

108
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,730
Uh. Yeah. And oftentimes this is going to not going to happen like with a high dose of radiation,

109
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:55,790
like a single time point, you might get a lot of DNA damage and cause cancer that way.

110
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,780
However, with these promoters, we're usually thinking of like you're eating to continue to promote the growth of these cells.

111
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:11,630
And so you're often, in this case, thinking about repeated or chronic exposures to certain chemicals, and these can be organ specific.

112
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:20,780
Right. So another again, going back to my background in repro, I think about things like cervical tissue or uterine tissue,

113
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,420
chemicals that are highly responsive to estrogens like estradiol.

114
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,979
That's a very kind of a specific response that is at play in those tissues as opposed to other tissues in the

115
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:41,750
body that are not quite as regulated to the extent to that extent by things like hormones such as estrogen.

116
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,540
Make it sound so far. I'm going to close the store.

117
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,310
This is, like, distracting me. Okay.

118
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:04,010
Okay. So then we have progression. So it's the conversion of like what could be up to there, but a benign lesion to this invasive cancer.

119
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,470
And so you have this growth, it's not necessarily metastasizing.

120
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:15,750
But then at some point enough changes have happened in these cells that they're starting to start metastasize and invade other tissues in the body.

121
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,100
And then at this point, we're starting to see things like additional DNA mutations.

122
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:26,549
So there's like certain mechanisms that play in cancer that cause like more genomic instability.

123
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,880
So these cells are just kind of out of control in some way and some ways they start to outgrow the surrounding cells.

124
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:41,250
And then a big one is they start to actually develop like their own vasculature and attract their own nutrients to keep this growth going.

125
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,870
And so they're invading the surrounding tissue and can metastasize to other tissues.

126
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,049
And so some of the terms that you might see,

127
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:57,270
like if you're looking in the cancer literature are things like and we're going to go with like increasing severity here,

128
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,530
something like hyperplasia, which is an increase in cell number.

129
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:08,310
I think we talked about this last time, the cells are basically looking normal except that they might be a little bit bigger.

130
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:16,680
And so this is just indicating that these cells have divided and grown and we see like abnormal growth or cell division.

131
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:24,240
Cell division going on medically is abnormal cell differentiation.

132
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,750
And this is replacement of one cell type with a different cell type that is not normally present in that tissue.

133
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,960
And this can be an adaptive response to certain like environmental agents or other like microorganisms or what have you.

134
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,460
So there might be like if you're exposed to a chemical over and over again,

135
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,030
you may see certain cells like, say, in the liver, it's just the chemicals causing damage to the liver.

136
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,219
You might see the the typical cells that are in that part of the liver are

137
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,480
sort of replaced with a more hardy type of cell or a fibroblast or something,

138
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:09,630
as there's like scarring and damage to the liver over a period of time in and of itself, doesn't necessarily mean like cancer is imminent,

139
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:17,250
but it's, you know, it could be this can be a precursor to the next thing I'm going to talk about.

140
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,000
Which is dysplasia. So this is admirable differentiation and maturation.

141
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,940
This is where things are really kind of starting to go haywire. You see like cell structure abnormalities.

142
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,420
The tissue organization is just out, kind of out of whack.

143
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,890
And again, things are just basically overall going haywire.

144
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,950
So you see, like it would normally look like this with one particular type of organized cell.

145
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,850
We'll see like different types of cells, different types of differentiation going on.

146
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:55,750
In the case of dysplasia. So we talked about the hallmarks of cancer last time.

147
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:03,730
I just wanted to reinforce those one more time. So some of the hallmarks of cancer include the sustained, proliferative signaling.

148
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,240
So there's some type of signaling happening that's telling these cells to continue to grow.

149
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,990
Divide your evading growth suppressor. So there's chemicals.

150
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:18,480
There's. There's pathways in the body that help to keep cells from kind of growing out of control.

151
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,639
So we have something called contact inhibition where if a cell knows that it's around a bunch of its neighbors,

152
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:32,290
it'll stop dividing because it's, you know, through certain signaling pathways, understanding that we don't need more of me around, you know.

153
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,150
So there's these signals that are in play to keep tissue from just growing out of control.

154
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,720
And things like cell cycle control pathways. So there's all molecular pathways that drive these processes.

155
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,500
And so if they get knocked out of whack, then you could have cells entering back into the cell cycle and dividing again.

156
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,280
So these are the types of things that happen in cancer cells. This invasion of metastasis is another hallmark.

157
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,800
So cells typically have methods of limiting the number of times they can replicate.

158
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,370
But again, these mechanisms are knocked out in cancer cells.

159
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:14,810
So cell could just keep dividing over and over again and then inducing angiogenesis again,

160
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,490
developing a vasculature to bring nutrients and things into the tumor site.

161
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:28,850
And then you also have a knocking out of apoptosis regulators like the p53 pathway, which again are meant to sort of survey for damage in the cell or,

162
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,640
you know, that cell's basically sensing when something is going awry and will trigger its own demise, essentially.

163
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:42,170
And so you need you need to really knock those pathways out in order to get this like cancer,

164
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,220
to knock these cells to not end up killing themselves, essentially.

165
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:55,550
So this was back in 2008, and Weber identified these and then doctors of Ebola talked about this,

166
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:04,069
these next generation of hallmarks of cancer back in 2011 that are kind of more updated.

167
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:11,660
You know, we're understanding more and more about cancer biology. And so we have things like cancer cells can avoid immune destruction.

168
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,570
So we normally have cells that look like understands that something's wrong with these cancer cells or trigger some kind of immune response.

169
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:27,110
But the cells are able to evade that. You get this inflammation is starting to become more and more of an issue we're understanding with cancer.

170
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:35,930
So with cancer, you get the recruitment of cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and can rebuttal the tissue and increase tumor progression.

171
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:42,730
So inflammation pathways play a role as well. And then genome instability is a big one.

172
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,700
I'll talk a little bit about genome instability later. What specifically is going on there?

173
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,810
And then cellular energetics have become more, more and more of interest.

174
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,940
So we see that cancer cells utilize like different metabolic pathways than normal cells do,

175
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,300
so glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation, for instance.

176
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:15,149
So these are just very different kind of cells that have like developed all of these ways to get around some of the innate sort of safety mechanisms,

177
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,690
if you will, of the body to keep cells in check.

178
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,450
So a toxicant is considered a carcinogen if it does any of the following.

179
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:36,210
So if it increases the incidence of tumors or the how often tumors are observed decreases the age of tumor development.

180
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:46,250
So just as a part of normal aging in animals and humans, we're more likely to see in older organisms, like a higher rate of tumors forming.

181
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,950
And I'll talk a little bit later about how with animal experiments,

182
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,260
there's a background amount of tumors that you're just going to see in an otherwise healthy animal.

183
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,340
And you have to sort of account for that when you're doing when you're planning your experiments.

184
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,540
So but if we start to see those at an earlier age after exposure to a chemical, that we would consider that a carcinogen.

185
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:14,790
If it induces rare, unusual tumors, that's a good indication that it's a carcinogen or the multiplicity or the number of tumors.

186
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:22,930
So if rats, for instance, develop typically like two tumors of the liver and we see what exposure to this chemical at older ages,

187
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:28,990
they're developing like eight or ten tumors in the liver then, or like in the liver and in the lungs or, you know, what have you.

188
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,590
So the general classes of carcinogenic agents include like their biological agents, which may be as a toxicologist,

189
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,390
I kind of haven't thought about quite as much until I started learning more and more about cancer.

190
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,530
Things like HPV can cause cervical head and neck cancer.

191
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,030
And then we have like, say, hepatitis can is associated with liver cancer.

192
00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:00,680
So biological agents can have these effects. Physical agents always going back to like radiation, UV radiation.

193
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:07,070
Doctors were about to talked about tanning beds and UV radiation and the risks for skin cancer there.

194
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,000
And then ionizing radiation can cause like many types of cancers.

195
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:21,079
And then chemicals kind of more in my wheelhouse. Synthetic and naturally occurring chemicals are also associated with many cancers,

196
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,400
which we'll talk about some of the potential mechanisms later on in the talk.

197
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,350
So we have what we call genotoxic versus non genotoxic carcinogens.

198
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,720
You can reverse Dr. Vote and talk about this or not, but we'll just go over it.

199
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,650
I don't think it's will take too long to just go over it again. If so.

200
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:51,950
So genotoxic again. Compounds are compounds that interact with DNA to modify or change its structure or like the order of the base pairs, for example.

201
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,650
These are considered mutations.

202
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:04,880
A genotoxic agent can be what we call a complete carcinogen, so it can trigger all three stages initiation promotion progression on its own.

203
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:12,220
This tumorigenesis or this ability to cause tumors is usually like dose dependent.

204
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,140
If you're exposed to higher levels of the chemical, you're going to see a greater number of tumors or just more severe tumors.

205
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,840
And in the case of a general toxicant, like theoretically there's no threshold effect.

206
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:31,280
So even if you have like one little cell that's exposed to one little small, small dose of a chemical.

207
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,970
Theoretically, if it can interact with the DNA of the change in DNA, it could cause cancer.

208
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,450
So there is like a and that sort of that sort of changes the way we think about it.

209
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:51,970
We're essentially like there's no dose to a particular toxicant that acts to these mechanisms that would be considered without risk, for example.

210
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,550
Non Genotoxic are chemicals again that do not directly interact with with the nuclear DNA,

211
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,130
but they can influence this carcinogenesis usually through promotion of the growth of the tissue.

212
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:13,910
These are not considered to be to chance. There could be a threshold effect where at a low enough dose you're just not seeing the effect.

213
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,889
The body, just like metabolizes and excreted, excrete this chemical, for example.

214
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,950
And it doesn't really do this tumor promotion activity that we think that it does in other instances.

215
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:32,200
Yeah. And again, usually those responsive those responses are pretty like almost universal saying in most cases.

216
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,600
These again, we're thinking about promote. Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,799
Just so I like kind of get this straight. So when you have a tumor that is set on by like a genotoxic agent,

218
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,690
the actual DNA of the tumor is different than, like, the rest of the body because it's been mutated.

219
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:54,700
Is that correct? And then if you have a tumor that's onset by like a marginal toxic one, it's like identical DNA, the same tissue.

220
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:04,190
There's just too much of it. So in a tumor, there can be cells involved in the tumor that have the same DNA as the rest of the body,

221
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,959
but they might have altered epigenetic signals, so different genes are being turned on and off.

222
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,210
The DNA could potentially be the same cause it's going to start like recruiting other cell types into the tumor.

223
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,770
The it was the second half or so.

224
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:28,040
I yeah it was like if it's been set on by a genotoxic agent, does that mean that that tumor DNA is unique from the rest of the body?

225
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,700
Well, typically, most tumors are going to start with some kind of mutation,

226
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,900
some kind of impact on the DNA and then the promoters like at the next step.

227
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:44,600
Right. So there's not typically any cancers that have like normal DNA in their own cells associated with that tumor.

228
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,560
So there's something off in terms of the genome typically.

229
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,480
Yeah. So yeah, there's not really.

230
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,860
They're usually going to need some kind of mutation to start the process.

231
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,280
Even in like a non genotoxic situation. Yeah.

232
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:06,360
So like a genotoxic agent is typically not going to be doing the initiation step.

233
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:12,600
So you going to have initiation maybe, you know, this could be sort of an endogenous thing where the cell just has like as it goes through,

234
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,209
there's so many cell divisions that happen that sometimes we get that's why we develop these repair mechanisms.

235
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:28,620
So sometimes we get these mismatch or mismatch repairs or mismatches of base pairs or some other defect in the fidelity of the DNA.

236
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,620
And so the and so when that happens, if you're you know,

237
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,540
if we just if you get that endogenous and then exposed to a chemical that promotes the growth of that cell,

238
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:47,610
that, you know, that that's a case where you getting promotion. But the initial event was not induced by a DNA toxicant.

239
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,100
It was the initial event actually just maybe could have happened as part of the normal kind of cell turnover.

240
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,240
Does that make sense? One question.

241
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:06,030
Would you please give us an example of non genotoxic that promotes war or cancer?

242
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:17,669
Yeah. So I think again, the one that I always go back to is like like say an estrogenic compound that like bisphenol A for example,

243
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,499
so chemicals dividing in the cervix for example,

244
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,840
and you know, through some maybe some other exposure to radiation or what have you, there is a genotoxic events that is that initiated.

245
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:41,580
And then that cell has damaged DNA that has not undergone ptosis and the individuals exposed to some type of hormonal, like I said, BPA.

246
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,330
And that cell then is because it's part of like the cervix is responding to estrogenic signaling it starts to grow and proliferate.

247
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,419
So that would be the case of a non genotoxic.

248
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:57,840
So it's a chemical that's acting through a hormonal pathway as opposed to actually directly impacting the DNA.

249
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,590
We might get to some other examples, too, that would help to clarify that.

250
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:12,000
And yeah, because of these new nano, you know, toxic chemicals can be.

251
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:24,040
Due to the mechanisms by which they are acting, they could be like tissue species or sex specific as opposed to a genotoxic chemical.

252
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,980
Basically, it can impact DNA. So basically, all all the cells have DNA.

253
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:36,900
All the species have DNA. So theoretically, you could be carcinogenic, you know, in any case.

254
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,669
Regardless of tissue or sex, what have you. Okay.

255
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:53,260
So genotoxicity DNA repair. So we have chemicals that we know of to be direct acting genotoxic compounds.

256
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,679
These do not require metabolic activation just as they exist.

257
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,810
Normally they are genotoxic.

258
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:10,360
And again, these are typically typically carcinogenic in all species and at all tissue sites because that DNA is going to be a factor in all of those.

259
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,610
They're usually electro electrofishing, so they like this negative charge on the backbone of DNA.

260
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,450
So you can see here, like a positive charge on a carbon emission,

261
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:30,310
it's going to tend to want to attack DNA, disrupt and react with DNA and cause changes to its structure.

262
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,610
A really kind of notorious structural functional group already park sides with this

263
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:45,349
oxygen here bound with to to bonds to carbon atoms kind of sticking out here.

264
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:52,940
That's going to be a reactive compound that's going to be kind of attracted to the negative charge of DNA as well.

265
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,819
And then like chemicals, like as iridium ions, which are part of like mustard gas,

266
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,969
which is like a really nasty, obviously, chemical warfare agent, again, you know, has this positive charge.

267
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,060
So has this tendency to, like interact with the negative charge of DNA.

268
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,890
And so these guys exist already as a general toxicant.

269
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:23,380
But then we also have in the majority of chemicals are what we would call indirect acting gene or toxicants, and these require metabolic activation.

270
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:31,210
So the parent compound or the compound that you're directly exposed to is not the chemical that's going to be doing the DNA damage.

271
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,380
It's a metabolite. So the body metabolizes that chemical into a reactive compound.

272
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:46,220
And for that reason, these chemicals tend to cause cancer at the site of metabolism, not at the site of exposure.

273
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:54,340
So, for example, if you're eating something that contains a direct acting gene, a toxic compound, and it's mostly metabolized in the liver,

274
00:29:54,430 --> 00:30:01,240
you're going to see that more in terms of liver carcinogenicity as opposed to like forming tumors in the GI tract.

275
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:13,760
A good example of that actually is aflatoxin. So aflatoxin B so aflatoxins are toxins produced by certain types of fungi that are found.

276
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,140
They can be found on agricultural crops like corn or peanuts.

277
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,210
If they're not stored properly,

278
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:29,450
you'll get the growth of these fungi that produce these aflatoxins in the body metabolizes this to this epoxy structure here.

279
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,480
And because it's metabolized in the liver, it is a big risk factor for liver cancer.

280
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,690
It's like one of the more potent liver carcinogens that we know of.

281
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:46,880
Another example is benzoate appearing, which is a product of combustion that's found in coal tar, tobacco smoke.

282
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:53,110
Grilled food. Grilled meats can produce benzoate powering the body, benzoate powering itself.

283
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,290
So this would be the structure here is not the type of carcinogen.

284
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:03,160
It's these oxides that are formed as the body is metabolizing depends on appearing.

285
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,339
So talking about we can think about individual susceptibility to cancer.

286
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,030
So there's a genetic component that plays a role here.

287
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:26,930
So for example, BRCA1 is can be individuals with the BRCA1 mutation have a higher risk for breast cancer.

288
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:35,390
And BRCA1 plays a role in repairing both endogenous and exogenous produced DNA damage.

289
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,730
Right. So it's one of these mechanisms that we have for repairing DNA.

290
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:49,610
In this case, it's a DNA double stranded break. So we just have like the DNA molecules like broken here that can help repair that again with fidelity,

291
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:55,430
because you don't want to mess with the fidelity of DNA. You want to keep the order of the base pairs the same.

292
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:05,900
Right. And so it plays this important role. And some individuals have a mutation in BRCA1 where essentially it's not functioning.

293
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:14,040
And you get this. Basically disrupted ability to repair DNA.

294
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:23,280
And there are mechanisms, even if that doesn't work. Again, these p53 apoptosis pathways that trigger the cell to die.

295
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,270
So in one case, if P53 is doing its job, it's essentially like surveilling the cell and understanding that there might be

296
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,830
damage in that cell and causing that cell to undergo apoptosis or cell cycle arrest.

297
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,640
However, if that individual, for instance, has another mutation in P53 that where P53 isn't functioning as well,

298
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,360
then you could get cell proliferation and kind of all bets are off and you could develop a cancer in that manner.

299
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,250
And so we see that this really manifests in ovarian and breast cancer.

300
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,620
These like really stark differences in individuals with this BRCA1 mutation.

301
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:10,230
So here individuals with the BRCA1 mutation up to 50% risk for breast cancer by age 50 compared to 2% for the rest of the population.

302
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,390
And that kind of changes by age.

303
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:21,990
But the trend is basically the same with this like really highly elevated risk for breast cancer individuals with this mutation.

304
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,000
She was anything else I want to mention on that slide?

305
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,890
I think that was it. How are we doing so far?

306
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:41,250
It's making sense. So we can think about cash.

307
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:47,900
We thought there was something else. I wanted to mention that. And that's the main points.

308
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,350
Okay. I'm sure I'll think of it like five or six slides later. So we can think about the tumor microenvironment.

309
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,319
And we talked about this a little bit earlier. The tumor sort of acts at a certain stage.

310
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,850
It starts to act almost like was its own ecosystem. You see like changes in the surrounding tissue.

311
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,580
You get the infiltration of immune cells,

312
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:14,110
you get like these cancer associated fibroblasts to start to give the tumor like structure of this angiogenesis,

313
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:20,800
it forms its own blood vessels to provide nutrients. Um, it's a mix of cancers and normal cells, right?

314
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,250
So you're starting to, like, recruit like normal cells into this tumor.

315
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:33,129
Yeah. So and again, this is kind of speaking to your earlier comment, like with these cancer associated fibroblast,

316
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,640
for example, there's no mutations, but they have these big time epigenetic changes.

317
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,890
So they're different, but they're not like it's they have undergone that mutation.

318
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:50,059
And kind of an interesting thing if you like pull a cancer associated fiberglass out and culture it in

319
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:55,340
a dish with like not next to normal cells you'll see those normal cells start to develop like cancer,

320
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:01,579
like phenotypes. So there's this, like really complex and you could say like insidious,

321
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,380
like communication that's going on between these different cells that are forming tumor.

322
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:17,930
And it's sort of acting like, you know, other parts of the tissue, but it's own sort of dysregulated in different way.

323
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:26,179
More and more cancer stem cells are stem cells that have turned cancerous have been

324
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,999
found to be play a pretty big role in the biology of like cancers and tumors.

325
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,430
So I'm not sure how familiar everyone is with stem cells, but in general,

326
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:42,620
like a stem cell is a cell that has the property of being able to renew itself so it

327
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,760
can divide into two additional stem cells from one to the two additional stem cells,

328
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:55,670
or differentiate into multiple types of cells like neurons or hepatocytes or what have you can differentiate.

329
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,950
So it's multipotent. That's another word that we use.

330
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,920
And they're really important in both like early developmental biology and even in like adult biology.

331
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,490
And so cancer cells act in a similar way.

332
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:14,330
So you have a cancer or cancer stem cells act in a similar way where they create a cell for a new to,

333
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:20,270
you know, and so proliferate and divide or differentiate into different types of cancer cells.

334
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:27,500
And so this is like we're learning more and more. This is like an important part of cancer development.

335
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,650
And then thoughts of play an important role in metastasis.

336
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,660
Right. So almost like seeds in a way to like form new cancers elsewhere in the body.

337
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,660
So some characteristics. Characteristics of cancer, stem cells.

338
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,919
One thing that I should mention, cancer stem cells and multiple organs were first identified here at University of Michigan.

339
00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:03,260
So that's a cool thing we can be proud of. They make up a small fraction of the tumor, so it's only like 1 to 4% of the total cells within the tumor.

340
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,730
So they're usually not dividing but retain the ability to reenter the cell proliferation phase if given the right signal.

341
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:20,200
The right signals. Right. They could survive for a long time, go through many subdivisions.

342
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:28,059
And this is something we talked about earlier. These guys have this upregulation of what we call drug efflux pumps like.

343
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,090
AVC Transporters are multi-drug resistance proteins.

344
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:38,620
Remember we talked about these transporters that basically, like pump chemicals out of the back, out of the cell.

345
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:46,120
And so with chemotherapy, you're trying to develop a chemical that's cytotoxic to these cancer cells,

346
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,690
but they have these pumps that are just pumping it right back out before it can do its job.

347
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,040
So that presents a problem. Yeah.

348
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:01,980
And so they're now thought to be responsible or at least play a huge role in the invasion and metastasis of cancers.

349
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,850
Yeah. So I'll just take a pause there, see how everyone's doing.

350
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,060
Let me know if I'm going too fast or if you guys. Seems like everyone followed along pretty well.

351
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:24,850
So some examples of environmental and I would say I guess I should say nutritional factors that can potentially lead to cancer

352
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:31,690
or like potential mechanisms for how these chemicals that make up our environments or our diets could play a role here.

353
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,930
So there's epidemiology data that links high fat diets to colon cancer.

354
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,150
Right. So what's the mechanism that could explain this?

355
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:47,720
And there was a paper that came out back in 2016 that used I believe this is a mouse model.

356
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:57,689
And so one ask one thing to know about the colon is in between these like VL I think I mentioned I was talking about the GI tract.

357
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:04,830
There's these finger like projections that make up the surface of the intestinal tract right in between these VHL,

358
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:12,260
either these structures called colon crypts that are kind of like just these like dips in between the blood.

359
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,800
And at the bottom of these guys, there are stem cells.

360
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:24,590
And so this play, this is important for like the overall analogy of like the colon, where there's actually like a high turnover of cells,

361
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,650
like and you need to like renew the cells of the colon, like fairly often of like the surface of the colon.

362
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:35,540
You see this in some tissues where there's this kind of like high turnover of the differentiated

363
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,820
cells with like they're like replenished kind of more often than in other parts of the body.

364
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:49,310
And so what these researchers did was essentially fed a high fat diet to these mice.

365
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,000
And one thing they saw was there was increased colon tumor incidence.

366
00:39:53,930 --> 00:40:01,920
And what they proposed was the lipids that make up the high fat diet actually activate.

367
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,980
Well, one thing that the other thing we observed, sorry,

368
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:10,790
is that there were a lot more stem cells in these colon crypts than there were in the control animals.

369
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:18,130
Right. So if these like colored guys like the green blue down here versus this gray stuff, these are like the stem cells of.

370
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,940
Let's see. Uh, there are more of them in the animals that are fed the high fat diet.

371
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:37,360
And so, yeah, so we had increased stem cell proliferation and it was thought that this is probably stimulated through the lipids in the diet,

372
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:46,540
activating what are called PPR pathways. So these are called PPR stands for PEROXISOME Proliferator Activated receptor.

373
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,120
It's basically a pathway that mediates a lot of different processes in the body,

374
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,530
one of them being lipid metabolism as well as growth cell differentiation.

375
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,010
People play a role in a lot of different things in the body.

376
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:08,349
And so the researchers were proposing that the activation of these PPR pathways

377
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:13,420
was what caused a high proliferation of stem cells in these colon groups.

378
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:21,040
So the lipids are basically activating these pathways in these cells and causing these cells, the stem cells, to proliferate.

379
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,500
So the idea being here that we have this plausible mechanism that a high fat diet.

380
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:36,050
Oh, yeah. Is it always true that the stem cell proliferation is a bad thing, or is it just when it's activated?

381
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,590
Also, it's like a pathway that could lead to cancer.

382
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:46,780
I would. Like stem cell proliferation. Not only I would say like aberrant stem cell proliferation.

383
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,229
You know, again, like everything tends to be very pretty coordinated in the body.

384
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,200
So there are certain times where you're going to want a lot of stem cell proliferation.

385
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:06,139
But if, you know, a certain chemical is like, you know, causing a cell type of stem cell type to proliferate kind of above the background level,

386
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:15,530
then then you might start to be concerned, but certainly not like we need we need all cells to do proliferation to an extent.

387
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:23,930
So what we have here is like a plausible mechanism that this high fat diet contains lipids that could activate these pahs,

388
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:32,610
these receptors that lead, that also activate increased stem cell proliferation, and then these stem cells proliferating.

389
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,880
If you get a lot of proliferation of these stem cells, you could this could lead to acquisition of mutations,

390
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,520
because these cells are like dividing, like crazy dividing.

391
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:47,000
They're copying their DNA and trying to do it with a high degree of fidelity and it increases the chance that something might go wrong.

392
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:57,050
And so the proposed mechanism here is that this is why you might see increased levels of colon cancer with a high fat diet.

393
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:10,580
QUESTION So is is that because four four is more hard to digest, high fat diet.

394
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:20,570
So that's why they are that proliferation of stem cells is for our four data system is harder to digest, for example.

395
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:27,320
Well, in this case there, you know, and I'm not like super deep in the literature with with this mechanism.

396
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:34,309
But the third proposed mechanism here is kind of just more a like a direct chemical interaction where

397
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:40,490
these lipids are stimulating or activating these parts and the activation of the molecular pathway.

398
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,719
And when that pathways turned on, it's, it's telling the stem cells to divide or proliferate, right.

399
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:53,780
So it's not so much related to digestion as a direct like sort of molecular interaction within a cell.

400
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,729
But these you have a lot of more of these lipids around that are and these receptors are

401
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,780
made to respond to lipids because they're like helping to regulate lipid metabolism.

402
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,850
And so you're kind of activating these guys, you know?

403
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,270
Yeah. You know, maybe like early on, I'm just this is completely hypothetical, but maybe early on,

404
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:19,040
you know, while the animals are weaning, you know, they might be drinking a lot of milk,

405
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,940
for example,

406
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:27,680
and there's a lot of lipids and those help to stimulate these certain developmental pathways for certain tissues that are growing early on.

407
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,840
But later on, maybe these high lipid this high lipid content isn't so good, you know?

408
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:40,370
So it's like it's a developmental it could be like a developmentally specific stage there, but that's completely hypothetical.

409
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:47,779
I'm just kind of really kind of using the best of my knowledge to make your proposal part of the context there.

410
00:44:47,780 --> 00:45:00,819
But does that make sense? Thank you. So I think we've talked about this day here in the class of bisphenol A is kind of this notorious

411
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,490
chemical that's found that's reminding me to drink out of my plastic water bottle found in plastic.

412
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:13,720
It's also found in, uh, those types of receipts where you there's like a carbon copy.

413
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,460
You can get exposed to BPA through a lot of those thermally.

414
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:28,500
And it's been kind of falling out of favor because of some of the the toxic and like endocrine disrupting properties that we've seen for bisphenol.

415
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:36,819
And there's a lot of proposed replacements for bisphenol A to be used in products like plastic bottles or what have you.

416
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:45,850
And those have also shown some degree of endocrine disruption and toxicity effects, but they're not as well.

417
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,719
They're not as the taureans. So they're like, Oh, how about we use this?

418
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,620
But. Anyway.

419
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:01,810
Let's see. Oh, so this is a case where mice were treated with Bisphenol-A or BPA in utero.

420
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:07,320
So the mothers were fed. And then they were looking. They were fed BPA in one way or another.

421
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:14,680
And the the mice after birth were analyzed for effects.

422
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:23,159
In this case, we're looking at the mammary gland. And so the researchers observed hypoplasia or like this high growth of cells.

423
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:30,209
Right. Consistent with an expansion of stem cells. And so you can see the control here versus the treated here.

424
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:37,200
You get this like a lot of what we call terminal end buds here, which is a part of the structure of the mammary gland.

425
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:41,819
And these guys are loaded with stem cells. And so, again, same principle applies here.

426
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:46,010
If you're getting a lot of proliferation of stem cells, maybe that's a risk factor.

427
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,110
That could be a risk factor for breast cancer, for example.

428
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:01,460
So for this reason, we've been looking more towards maybe targeting the cancer stem cells in cancer therapies.

429
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:09,590
So instead of a conventional cancer therapy where we're just trying to kill the rest, because remember I said it's only like 1 to 4% of the tumor.

430
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,059
You're killing the rest of the cells while the stem cells might stick around and start to divide,

431
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:20,410
proliferate into their kind of like it kind of has super powers compared to like your average cell, the stem cells do.

432
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:26,810
So they're sticking around and they're able to do some of their unique functions and lead to a tumor relapse.

433
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:35,590
The. And, you know, I mean, kind of intuitively, if we want to target stem cells, we're targeting the stem cell here,

434
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:42,790
which we think is going to lead to like a tumor regression because we're killing this, like, key superpowered cell that is in.

435
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,260
So we can talk about non genotoxic carcinogenesis.

436
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:00,110
So. Kind of a very sort of like crude mechanism for carcinogenesis with like with chemical

437
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:05,929
exposures is like a high dose of a chemical causing like a lot of cell death in a

438
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:12,530
particular organ can lead to cancer due to like the organ trying to compensate because the

439
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:16,909
Oregon is trying to like regenerate this tissue and like having to constantly repair.

440
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:21,070
That involves a lot of things like cell replication and proliferation.

441
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:28,550
You know, with this like persistent regenerative growth, we could start to see a high rate of DNA mutations.

442
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:36,890
And so just like agitating and injuring like the liver, for example, if someone is exposed over and over again, like, say, on the job,

443
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:42,800
they could be you could be that could present a risk factor for development of liver cancer if they're,

444
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:46,790
you know, getting this constant sort of injury to the liver.

445
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:51,519
Really. So these mutated cells can accumulate, you know, if are you know,

446
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,469
if we start to see mutations over time and then then form lesions and eventually

447
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:02,500
tumors and kind of the way that we talked about in the earlier slides. So we see this with certain things like, say, chloroform and liver tumors.

448
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,160
So that's one way kind of like this.

449
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,200
I don't have any fancy molecular slides to kind of show that.

450
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:16,570
It's just kind of like you're kind of just enjoying the organ and causing these carcinogenic effects.

451
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:25,129
Oxidative stress is another one. So if you haven't heard of oxidative stress, it's a big one.

452
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:31,460
And toxicology of oxidative stress is an overabundance of reactive oxygen species in the cell.

453
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:40,670
Reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules that contain oxygen, and they can easily react with other molecules in a cell.

454
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:44,480
So they often have, like, unpaired electrons and things that like to like.

455
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:56,580
Break off or like attack the molecular structures of other chemicals we have through our own cellular biology, just normal cellular biology.

456
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,840
We have endogenous cellular oxidants that can cause oxidative stress.

457
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:09,810
In some cases, the mitochondria produces chemicals like hydrogen peroxide here and these other types.

458
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,479
And yeah, so the mitochondria through its own function,

459
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,660
mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell and so through its own just kind of normal processes,

460
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:28,890
you'll get the production of oxidants cytochrome p450 is I don't think we've talked about those too much yet, but we should pretty soon.

461
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:38,070
Cytochrome p450 are the main one of the main classes of metabolism enzymes and through their functions we get the production of oxidants.

462
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:48,090
Immune cells are a big one. Immune cells use, uh, reactive oxygen species sometimes to attack pathogens.

463
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:53,280
And so those are often associated with these guys here.

464
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:04,140
And we can also get the formation of oxidants from exhaustion as exposures like exposures to heavy metals can produce these oxidant compounds.

465
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:13,530
And so because it's part of the normal metabolism in the cell, we have these antioxidant mechanisms,

466
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:23,340
these like enzymatic systems such as enzymes like catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione and peroxidase, etc., that help to balance things out.

467
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:30,210
So this oxidative stress does not start to we don't get this overabundance of reactive oxygen species in the cell.

468
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:38,490
And we also have dietary factors or like vitamins and nutrients that provide that are essentially antioxidants, things like vitamin E and vitamin C.

469
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:49,090
So if this gets out of whack, if we have an overabundance of accidents compared to like what our antioxidant systems can take care of,

470
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:55,090
that can lead to oxidative damage and the types of structures that can be impacted by this oxidative stress.

471
00:51:55,090 --> 00:52:03,760
Our DNA, RNA lipids, like cell membranes, like organelles, for example, can be disrupted or even like critical proteins.

472
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:13,990
So we know that certain toxicants can induce oxidative stress like phthalates or PBDEs or poly brominated di phenol ethers.

473
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:19,900
There's actually a lot of toxicants to one degree or another can cause oxidative stress,

474
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,660
and toxicants can also target the antioxidant defense systems.

475
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:29,829
So for instance, cadmium can suppress catalase functions.

476
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:40,690
So that causing oxidative stress persisting, although cadmium probably does, it's also inhibiting the activity of these antioxidant defense systems.

477
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:53,580
So. One way that oxidative stress can lead to carcinogenesis is it could potentially damage DNA directly.

478
00:52:54,270 --> 00:53:04,830
So that would be a genotoxic case. But we also have a non genotoxic mechanism by which reactive oxygen species could be a tumor promoter, for example.

479
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,650
So we actually, like I said, they they have a bad rap for a lot of reasons.

480
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,160
Reactive oxygen species too.

481
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:22,320
But they are part of the normal functioning in the body and actually play a role in like our endogenous cell signaling pathways.

482
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:30,459
And so if we activate some of these pathways, such as activating things like that, kinase cascades,

483
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:35,050
like erk, p38 or junk, these are just some of the different flavors of these types of cascades.

484
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:44,020
I don't expect you to know the particular names there, but if you activate this pathway,

485
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:52,720
you can get the essentially the activation of transcription factors that sit down on the DNA and start to transcribe genes involved in,

486
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,380
say, cell proliferation or differentiation or apoptosis.

487
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:06,400
So all of these could play a role in the promotion of the of the tumor or progression from a cell that has DNA damage to,

488
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:12,490
you know, replicating itself and this overall trajectory of growth into this cancerous tumor.

489
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:21,840
Reactive oxygen species also mediates some inflammatory response.

490
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,510
So if we have a lot of arrows around,

491
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:33,300
we can also activate a pathway called NF Kappa B and a scaffold B is involved in transcribing genes involved in cell proliferation again,

492
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:36,360
as well as inflammation and immune processes.

493
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:43,320
So remember, all of these processes that I'm talking about in one way or another are like hallmarks of this cancer biology.

494
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:50,490
And so for that, in that way, chemicals that generate a lot of reactive oxygen species could be tumor promoters,

495
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,850
in addition to just causing direct damage to DNA in some cases.

496
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:07,180
Yeah. And there's this kind of interesting thing. So. So oxidative stress.

497
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:17,290
So rapidly proliferating cancer cells use this high is these certain metabolic pathways and also have like increased levels of oxidative stress.

498
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,729
So the idea would be kind of going from there is that if we're treating people with cancer, with antioxidants,

499
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:33,310
that could be good because you're kind of tamping down on these oxidative stress processes that are contributing to the development of cancer.

500
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,930
However, cancer stem cells might be, it turns out, might be a little bit different.

501
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,380
They have a high expression of antioxidant enzymes.

502
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:50,379
And the idea here is that antioxidant supplement supplementation might help prevent cancer initiation.

503
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,940
So that initial, let's say the reactive oxygen species was damaging the DNA.

504
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:06,130
You give an antioxidant and you have less of that going on. But once that's already happened, if we give an antioxidant and the tumor stem cells,

505
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:11,530
essentially they prefer this sort of like antioxidant environment that might

506
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,680
be actually helping the cancer stem cells or helping them to self-renewal.

507
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:24,410
So it's not as simple as just like antioxidants. And there are actually been some clinical trials where like high levels of vitamin E have been found

508
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:31,629
that were found to actually seem to like almost promote higher rates of cancer in clinical trials.

509
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:37,440
So some of the stuff that we thought would work like these like really high doses of like antioxidants killing,

510
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:44,590
you know, getting rid of cancer didn't really pan out. So it turns out it's quite a bit more complicated than we initially thought.

511
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:56,020
Kind of going along with what I was talking about with like the cytotoxicity or continued injury

512
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:03,430
of an of an organ is if chronic essentially chronic inflammation can be a risk factor for cancer.

513
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:11,890
And this is a similar idea where you have this continued stimulus like, again, chronic toxicant exposure that's causing inflammation.

514
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,290
These like some of the immune cells that are going to be part of that response, like monocytes or macrophages,

515
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:24,430
will release reactive oxygen, oxygen species as like kind of a weapon against what they think is like an invading pathogen.

516
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,860
And this can cause tissue damage.

517
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:35,320
And this is not something that's just kind of relevant for cancer, but there's like lots of diseases that chronic inflammation helps to make worse.

518
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,670
So inflammation again, we're kind of going around the wheel of the hallmark hallmarks that I showed in the earlier slide.

519
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:54,440
Yeah. And so we can think about tumors in one way as an injury that is not healing properly.

520
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,840
So like if we look at like a normal injury to the skin, like an operation in the skin,

521
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,100
we'll get the sort of like kind of typical immune response we get.

522
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:11,750
Like fibroblasts and a little like structural proteins. And things will start to like build up here to like, you know, form a scab or what have you.

523
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,919
You'll get the vasculature will like re form in that area.

524
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,260
You'll get some infiltration of immune cells.

525
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:26,690
However, in a tumor, you have a like almost a similar process, but it's very dysregulated and like disordered.

526
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:34,399
So you get this like high, like invasion of like malignant cells and then like you're still,

527
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,840
you know, again, forming this new vasculature, but it's, again, disordered.

528
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:51,170
Uh, let's see. Yeah. So for this reason, we sometimes you can refer to tumors as a cancer, as a wound that does not heal overall.

529
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:56,420
The point here is the body's response to injuries has like some important similarities to cancer.

530
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:04,700
It's just that in cancer, it doesn't get turned off. So that's an important concept that I think kind of gets missed sometimes when we talk about

531
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:11,180
inflammation or immune processes is that we need to resolve inflammation and immune processes.

532
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:17,480
We don't want to just turn on inflammation and have it just be on in perpetuity.

533
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:23,630
We have to like have this process of like ramping it down as the injury heals or as the job is done.

534
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:29,210
So. But in the case of the tumor, that's not happening.

535
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:41,720
So things that could cause chronic inflammation like obesity, smoking, diet, heavy metal exposure, phthalates, pesticides.

536
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:48,260
We've seen indications that in one way or another, all of these factors could contribute to like chronic inflammation.

537
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:59,470
And then we've talked about this already a little bit. We have this receptor mediated non gene or toxic mechanism.

538
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:04,440
So we talked about it a little bit with the PR reset.

539
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:10,980
So those are receptors, right? So toxicants can interact with receptors to induce changes in gene expression.

540
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:19,710
And we're thinking about things like genes related to proliferation of cells metabolism, different differentiation of cells.

541
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:28,170
So we have several examples here like phenobarbital acts on a receptor called the constitutive interesting receptor,

542
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:32,460
which so when this happens, it promotes tumors, at least in mouse models.

543
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:39,899
We have several chemicals that activate these parts. Right. So it talked about how fatty diet can activate these powers.

544
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:49,139
There's actually chemicals that stimulate those as well. And then a big one is dioxins and h are activation of that.

545
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:58,420
I'll talk about that sort of thing a little bit here. So here is our ligand.

546
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,680
So a chemical called Benzoate Styrene, which we talked about earlier,

547
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:10,210
turns out is a potent ligand for this receptor called the H r receptor or aryl hydrocarbon receptor.

548
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,830
So we have our just benzoate Zoe molecule here.

549
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:23,400
What happens is that could be uptake into the cell and that can interact with this HRR receptor.

550
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:29,820
When that happens, the H receptor loses these proteins very easily bound to it and it turns into the active form.

551
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:37,950
And so you have the benzo molecule bound to this receptor that translates into the nucleus and recruits.

552
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:45,690
This co transcription factor and this whole complex sits down on a region of the genome called the xeno biotic response element.

553
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:54,840
And when this is activated, it causes an increase in cytochrome p450 s, which are these metabolic enzymes.

554
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:01,770
And so you get increased transcription of these enzymes and these enzymes metabolize

555
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:06,660
benzo a tirade into that impact side form I talked about on the earlier slide.

556
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:15,480
And if you recall benzo, a pirate needs to be metabolized by cytochrome p450 to become carcinogenic.

557
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:22,920
So this is sort of the loop that happens in terms of activating Benzoate appearing to its carcinogenic form.

558
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,260
I guess it's not a loop for the whole process.

559
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:35,310
And so what we find, as you can imagine, is that when we knock out the early hydrocarbon receptor in this mouse model,

560
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:39,870
we see that the carcinogenicity of benzo appearing is lost.

561
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,560
Now, it might seem really obvious,

562
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:51,000
but I'm wondering if I can get someone to just explain why the carcinogenicity is lost when we knock out the HRR receptor.

563
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:56,230
Does anyone want to take a stab at? Describing that.

564
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:00,399
Oh, because it can't transcribe this up.

565
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:05,410
You want to make the sides from the pencil part, right?

566
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,489
So if I'm followed with, maybe I'll just restate what you said.

567
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:19,360
So it's not the cells not going to be transcribing the enzymes that metabolize benzoate appearing to its carcinogenic form.

568
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,570
If you knock out this receptor.

569
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:30,550
So basically this whole process doesn't happen and you need the CYP guy here to metabolize benzene prior to the carcinogenic form.

570
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:37,910
Does that make sense? Okay.

571
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:50,960
So that's a little bit more in my wheelhouse as these hormonal mechanisms of non genotoxic carcinogenesis so toxicants can mimic hormones and cause.

572
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,360
A lot of times we see this with proliferation.

573
01:03:53,810 --> 01:04:02,540
So estrogenic compounds can induce tumors in these estrogen responsive tissues thinking things like cervix, ovary, uterus.

574
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,130
So we have several chemicals that are either agonists.

575
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:10,910
So agonist is something that binds to a receptor and activates it.

576
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:19,160
We also have chemicals that are antagonist like Tamoxifen, which is an antagonist, so that binds to a receptor, basically shuts it down.

577
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:26,870
So we can manipulate these receptors in various ways if we want to, in terms of like maybe coming up with new therapies.

578
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:33,979
You know, if we just a certain type of cancer is known to be really promoted by a particular receptor,

579
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:38,870
we could maybe use a treat someone with an antagonist to like tamp that down.

580
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:44,150
And then bisphenol A is also an agonist. So it activates the estrogen receptor.

581
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,429
And we'll talk a little bit more about antagonist versus agonist in a later lecture.

582
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:53,460
But that's the general. That's the gist of it.

583
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:03,849
I think we talked about this last time that epigenetic modifications are environmentally label, so a label.

584
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:09,520
So you don't have to necessarily change the sequencing of the DNA or mess with the DNA in any way.

585
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:15,490
We can have these epigenetic modifications that change the way the genes are, basically whether they're turned on or turned off.

586
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:25,930
See, and the way this looks in some cases, for example, would be if you have a normal cell here.

587
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:34,440
So if we have a normal cell here, imagine that this particular gene.

588
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,210
Just call it exon. One is a tumor suppressor gene.

589
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:43,540
So that's activated. It's basically inhibits the formation of cancer.

590
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:49,190
Maybe it maybe it's something that helps to trigger apoptosis in cells that have damaged DNA.

591
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:55,430
So if that's methylated, that's essentially a go signal that will be expressed.

592
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,370
And then we'll have another region of the DNA that is methylated, and that's basically a stop signal.

593
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:03,830
And so all these people will not be expressed.

594
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:10,819
And then what you can see in cancer cells is like a flipping of that, where the region that is a tumor suppressor is methylated.

595
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:17,149
And the reason that this other region is not and this can contribute to the it's pretty wild

596
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:24,229
like these antigenic regions are transposable elements can contribute if they're turned on to

597
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:30,469
contribute to the instability of the genome because these regions are these like ancient viral

598
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:37,490
sequences that we incorporated into our genome as we evolved and they can actually copy.

599
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,560
You basically want them to be silenced.

600
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:46,100
They what they could do is like copy and paste themselves into other parts of the DNA, like other parts of the genome.

601
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:50,600
So you can imagine if those guys get turned on, you're just like.

602
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:54,990
Genomic instability and just rife of genomic instability.

603
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:03,239
And so this is why one of the you remember on the Wheel of Hallmarks, one of the key factors was genomic instability and cancers.

604
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:11,670
And I think we're still learning how this works. But there could be epigenetic way this happens that doesn't involve changing the sequence of the DNA,

605
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:14,880
but involves saying this regional beyond versus this region.

606
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:31,560
This is just to show you that Beijing appears to like the epigenome of aging is kind of similar to the cancer epigenome.

607
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:35,459
You can just kind of look at this a little bit, a little bit closer if you want to,

608
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:40,320
but you get this like age related methylation of tumor suppressor genes,

609
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:47,750
meaning they'll get turned off as one ages, they're more likely to be turned off as one ages.

610
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:55,800
So cancer and aging kind of has some similarities in terms of the epigenetic modifications or changes that occur.

611
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:02,569
Intracellular communications are important.

612
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:11,100
And I talked about contact inhibition right now. So the cells talking to each other is important for like normal cell biology.

613
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:16,630
And we have these structures called connections that are formed like connections between cells.

614
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,470
So here you can see the membrane of one cell and then the membrane of another cell here.

615
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:29,690
And they're joined by these connections. And this allows for an exchange of molecules of a certain size, not like everything,

616
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,930
but everything below a certain size called like flow between these two cells.

617
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,510
And this is important for regulating cell growth and regulating the timing of cell death

618
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:44,090
when that needs to happen during the normal dynamics of like tissue development or,

619
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:48,300
you know, as just part of like the normal operations of the cells, right.

620
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:55,680
Can we find in cancer? We get we have altered junction control.

621
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:58,350
Like essentially the cells don't talk to each other as well.

622
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:07,830
In the cases of cancer, we see that the gap junctions are downregulated and this can disrupt these growth inhibitory signals that again,

623
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,750
the cells are talking to each other saying, hey, there's enough of us around. We don't need to keep proliferating.

624
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,940
And we see that some carcinogenic toxicants can inhibit these gapped junction formations and communications.

625
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:25,070
We see this with multiple types of chemicals like phenobarbital, phthalates and pesticides like deodorant.

626
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:33,749
And Gap junction inhibition axis. This would be like a tumor promoter because remember, like the cell growth is the part of the promotion,

627
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,560
like the replication of the cell that has a damaged DNA.

628
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,240
So the cells are not talking to each other saying we don't need to keep proliferating.

629
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:53,130
If that goes away, that communication is lost. That would promote the cell to potentially proliferate into more of this damaged DNA initiated cell.

630
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:57,600
So we got a few more minutes.

631
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:06,540
We're just going to and I think this will be the last part, just talking about some assets and how we assess chemicals far as carcinogens.

632
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:11,770
So we have like short term assays which are typically in vitro that are looking

633
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:16,840
at things like the potential of a chemical to cause light as a mutagen,

634
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:25,360
like does it cause mutations or otherwise transform a cell in cell culture to a more like carcinogenic type of phenotype?

635
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:34,899
And then we also have like medium term, like animal assays where it might be dosing a chemical for a few months up to, say, eight months.

636
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:38,980
And we assess to see if they're forming like these neoplasms after exposure.

637
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:46,180
And then with long term, we have these like long term chronic biopsies that go out for two years or chronically dosing chemicals,

638
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:59,170
dosing animals with a chemical for that whole time and see if rates of to tumor formation cancer, the rates of cancer tumors go up in that time.

639
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:07,030
So an example of like an in vitro fairly short term assay is what's called the common assay, as anyone never heard of the common assay.

640
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:15,810
Oh, cool. I get to talk about it. So in this, we're using what's called single cell gel electrophoresis.

641
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:20,000
So you basically have a gel and you can take a cell.

642
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:23,240
It could be a cell that you grew in culture. It could be a cell from someone's blood.

643
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:28,579
It could be a cell from like an animal model, probably treated and not treated.

644
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:34,010
So control versus treated or like highly exposed, the lowly exposed in the case of like human blood.

645
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:39,170
Then you essentially take a single cell and.

646
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:46,330
Essentially like die the DNA with like a fluorescent like a fluorescent dye and you

647
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:52,180
put the single cells into the gel and then you apply a charge to the gel on one end.

648
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,850
So positive charge. And remember, the DNA is positively or negatively charged.

649
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:11,980
Negatively charged. And so you can have a positive charge on one side of the gel and the DNA will migrate to that positive charge and.

650
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:20,510
What happens is, is this chemical exposure, whatever you were looking at, you know, earlier on caused a lot of DNA damage in these cells.

651
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:25,429
You're going to see these smaller like essentially smaller chunks of DNA are going

652
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:30,379
to like migrate further out of the cell or into like towards that positive charge.

653
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:37,700
And if it's relatively undamaged DNA, it's going to stay within the cell, kind of just, you know, in place.

654
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,640
Right. And so this would be like an example of a control.

655
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:47,540
And then in this, this would be if you want to expose these cells to arsenic or something in the DNA is like kind of damaged.

656
01:12:47,550 --> 01:12:54,080
And you've seen these like smaller, like broken parts of DNA are like migrating farther along in the gel.

657
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:02,240
And the reason it's called common assay is because it looks like a comet. Right? Like you have this tail here that resembles a comet.

658
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:11,470
So it's a pretty cool assay. And that was in vitro testing with these two year chronic bio assays,

659
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:19,280
typically looking at exposing rats or mice up to like say 50 males and females testing 2 to

660
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,420
3 chemical doses continuing from about eight weeks or eight weeks throughout the lifespan.

661
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:33,579
And you're going to look at like food consumption and like kind of more broad, you know, to keep track of broad things like food consumption,

662
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:38,230
body weight, maybe some clinical observations, collecting blood or urine over that time.

663
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:45,850
And then at the end of the experiment, you're going to assess tumor number, location and compare the treated animals to the control animals.

664
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:57,020
Fairly straightforward. And I said way back in the lecture that mice and rats both you know, there are some differences between males and female mice.

665
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,800
And rats have these spontaneous tumor incidents that can happen.

666
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:07,490
So, you know, these are animals that have not been exposed to a test compound or anything.

667
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:12,920
And so you see like rates of like tumor formation in different tissues, so up of species.

668
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:18,800
And so it's just something you have to account for. Like you're going to have a background tumor incidence that you have to be able to like.

669
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:24,830
If you're going to see, you have to ask yourself if you're going to be able to detect the signal above the background tumor incidence there.

670
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:35,610
And the things we like to think about with these animal models is sort of historically toxicology

671
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:42,260
studies have been done at fairly high doses because we wanted to understand the mechanism of toxicity.

672
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:46,280
So we've been treating animals in like kind of higher doses more and more.

673
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:55,470
The push is to at least include a human relevant dose like not orders of magnitude higher than what like for a family of,

674
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:59,140
you know, not like 500 milligrams per kilogram.

675
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:03,750
Like, most people are not going to be exposed to that level of phthalate in a normal day.

676
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:14,880
So we're the push now, as it should be, is to capture the relevant biology, more so for relevant dosing, more so.

677
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:21,720
And the other thing to ask yourself in like animal models, of course, is we kind of talked about this in some of the earlier lectures.

678
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:26,130
Is is the carcinogenic mechanism relevant to humans?

679
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:36,720
It's a really easy example that I can put out for that is, let's say rats have a metabolic pathway that is active and it's not active in humans.

680
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:43,080
And this chemical needs to be metabolized to a carcinogenic metabolite to be a carcinogen.

681
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:51,629
So in that case, the bottle kind of doesn't make a lot of sense because that chemical's probably going to be metabolized in the same way in humans.

682
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:59,190
And so you just need to ask yourself, is this carcinogenic mechanism relevant to what we want to do in terms of like human risk assessment?

683
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,329
And this is true for, you know, not just carcinogenesis.

684
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:08,700
It's like every type of toxicology study we do, we're asking ourselves these questions.

685
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,480
Sort of the gold standard. And we want to prevent this, of course.

686
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:23,910
But epidemiol. Epidemiology studies of cancer are considered the strongest evidence of human carcinogenicity, as you can imagine.

687
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:32,669
Oftentimes we're seeing this, unfortunately, in occupational settings where individuals are working with a high like around relatively

688
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:37,200
high levels of a chemical or getting exposed to relatively high levels of chemicals.

689
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:44,550
And pretty often, you know, you work like five days a week or whatever, so you're facing chronic exposures to certain chemicals.

690
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,159
And so we've seen several really sad cases where individuals that on the job

691
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,640
were exposed to particular chemicals have developed higher rates of cancer.

692
01:16:55,590 --> 01:17:05,549
Dietary assessments, you can also look at like dietary, you know, we see dietary links between like processed meats and colon cancer, for example.

693
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:13,410
So dietary reconstructions and going into cohort studies and things is also another way we can assess those.

694
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,650
Well, it looks like we're out of time for today. We got through most of it.

695
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:24,720
I don't think there's anything huge. I can probably just run through these, the rest of these at the next.

696
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:29,190
Well, I guess we have three more minutes. He wants to come for three more minutes.

697
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:40,700
Let's see how far we can get. I think Dr. Smith ought to talk about the difficulties in identifying carcinogens in clinical studies.

698
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:48,320
So if anyone has any questions about that, you can come by me. But I think we talked about this like we're not controlling the exposures, you know,

699
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:54,660
in terms of epidemiology studies we're relying on like reconstructed or modeled exposure levels.

700
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,260
We can't give someone a certain level of arsenic in a clinical trial or whatever.

701
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:04,200
It's like, wouldn't be ethical. The rarity of cancers, the long latency period of cancers,

702
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:09,020
whether there's like a relevant window of developmental development in which would

703
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:13,469
see these effects of these carcinogens is another thing that we can think about,

704
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:14,940
might present a challenge.

705
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:22,739
And then the temperature, the temporality of like understanding when the exposure occurred in cases that the recall bias question,

706
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,600
which I think we talked about last time.

707
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:32,020
These are some of the agencies that are looking in class, looking at carcinogens and classifying chemicals as carcinogens.

708
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,130
The big one is International Agency for the Research of Cancer.

709
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:46,600
And also I guess another one is the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

710
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:48,759
And this one kind of took me back.

711
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:56,560
I hadn't seen this before, but from groups involved sort of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial hygienists have this.

712
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:03,130
Estimation of how many cancers of various types are related to occupational exposure.

713
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:06,420
And it's like pretty high to me.

714
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:11,080
I don't know. So that that was like a really striking table to me.

715
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:17,860
Actually, like certain up to 13% of lung cancers or you know, you can just take a look here but just.

716
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:25,020
It's kind of very heartening to see that. See.

717
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:31,050
So the International Agency for Research on Cancer, I'll just go through this.

718
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:38,770
They have different classifications for carcinogens. So one would be an agent that is carcinogenic to humans.

719
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:39,659
So in that case,

720
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:50,640
we have both strong human and animal data and then we have to a probably carcinogenic with human suggestive human epi data and positive animal data.

721
01:19:52,140 --> 01:20:01,110
So suggestive as opposed to strong to be possibly carcinogenic human epi data, not really there kind of weak animal.

722
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:09,000
Animal data is positive and then a lot of chemicals end up in groups three where we just have inadequate data to say.

723
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:15,040
And then for probably not person in. So that's negative studies both in humans and animals.

724
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,440
These are some examples. Yeah, actually, that was all of it.

725
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:25,540
So there's some of the slides in there you may want to look into a little bit more, but that's pretty much all the material.

726
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:30,130
So thanks so much for sharing with me. I think we have another guest lecture on Wednesday.

727
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:38,950
So I'm going to ask you to. What?

728
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:41,370
Oh.
