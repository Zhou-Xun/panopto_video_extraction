1
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:07,491
So by definition, right,

2
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:11,570
crisis communications happen
at a moment's notice.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,130
You can't prepare for them.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,901
Well you can't prepare for the details of
them, but there are a few key principles

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:24,254
of crisis communication that have been
develop and refined particularly by

6
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:30,042
public health agencies to think about how
do we response in public health crisis.

7
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:34,218
Many of these come from work done by
the US Center for Disease Control and

8
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:38,606
Prevention, which became very interested
in crisis communication after

9
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:42,784
their experience of both
the September 11th, 2001, attacks,

10
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:45,940
and the anthrax exposure
that happened in 2002.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:52,499
Both of these were broad public
health crises, broad national crises,

12
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:57,025
that many different people
needed to respond to.

13
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:01,876
And as a result The CDC started
thinking very intentionally about how

14
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:07,020
do we train people to be ready for
the next situation like that?

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,830
Now, I could go on and on and there's
tons of information at the Centers for

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,830
Disease Control and Prevention as well
as other resources online if you really

17
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,990
wanna get interested in becoming
a better crisis communicator.

18
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,860
But for right now,
I'm gonna focus on three things.

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,780
Three critical principles for
you to remember, and if all you do is

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,730
remember these, you'll be way ahead of
the game when that crisis moment happens.

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,358
Again, could be in a health context,
could be in an organizational context,

22
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:42,787
wherever a crisis happens, these
principles will apply, I promise you.

23
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:51,041
So first principle, Bad news FIRST.

24
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:55,160
Let me say that again, Bad news FIRST.

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,640
Now, when bad things happen, most people
in organizations try to hide the bad news.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,340
They worry that it's going
to make them look bad.

27
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,300
They worry that people are gonna panic.

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,690
History has show us repeatedly
that trying to hide,

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,870
or minimize,
bad news is exactly the wrong thing to do.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,810
In fact, quite the contrary.

31
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,670
The main thing that you
wanna do is make sure that

32
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,220
the bad news comes out before
you talk about anything else.

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:33,070
Be upfront about telling people in
very concrete terms all the bad news.

34
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,470
Now, why am I recommending this?

35
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,445
Well there's two critical reasons.

36
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:43,590
First reason,
you get to control how it comes out.

37
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,890
If you're the one telling
people what the bad news is,

38
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,650
you get to shape the way it comes out.

39
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,200
You get to frame it and
put it into context.

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,300
You get to be there to answer
the questions you know people are going

41
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,828
to have.

42
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:04,922
If you don't do that, then you're at the
mercy of whoever brings it to the public's

43
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:11,520
attention, and maybe it'll be incomplete,
or maybe it will be framed the wrong way.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,760
You wait, you release control.

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,950
But if you bring the bad news first,
you get to control how it comes out, and

46
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,990
that's incredibly important
in a crisis context.

47
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,980
Second, if you put the bad news first,

48
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,340
everything else you have to say will
help to make things feel better, right?

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,640
The worst stuff is already out.

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,420
All the things that will follow
will help to make it better.

51
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,620
And the reason why this happens is
remember, in a crisis situation

52
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,910
the critical problem is uncertainty,
people don't know how bad is this?

53
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,300
As a result they tend to think the worst,
and

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,290
what they think the worst is,
is often way worse than it actually is.

55
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,060
By putting bad news first,

56
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,640
you prevent this,
you tell them exactly how bad this is.

57
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,780
That limits the uncertainty, and even if
it is worse than they thought it was,

58
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,880
you now make it concrete, so
that there's no ambiguity,

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,030
they just have to address it and
try to respond to it.

60
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,070
And that removing of
the uncertainty makes it better.

61
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,787
It makes people better able to
cope with it and respond to it.

62
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:35,455
More importantly than
either of two reasons,

63
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,002
there’s this,
if you don’t put it first and

64
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:46,650
the bad news comes out later,
people lose all trust in you.

65
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,990
You look like you're hiding it,
cuz you are hiding it.

66
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,170
In which case they don't trust that
you're not hiding something else.

67
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,080
They don't trust that you're actually
telling them all that they need to know.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,470
It's incredibly easy to
lose trust in a moment, but

69
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,280
it's extremely hard to
build it back over time.

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,430
So put the bad news first.

71
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,894
Not only does it make people better
able to cope with the information.

72
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:20,632
Not only do you get to
control how it comes out, but

73
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:25,349
you prevent that moment that
happens later on when people might

74
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:30,960
lose all trust in you,
cuz you weren't the one to tell them.

75
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,020
And that, you just don't wanna go there.

76
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,600
Okay, second big principle.

77
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,500
And it's kinda three things
rolled into one, but

78
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,750
it's a nice little phrase from the CDC's
guidance that I think is easy to remember.

79
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,800
Be first, be right, and be credible.

80
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I'll explain what I mean by each of these.

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,570
So, first, I talked about putting the bad
news first in whatever you're saying.

82
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,710
But this principle is broader, right?

83
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,890
Be first no matter what.

84
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,480
In a crisis, time is of the essence and

85
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,100
honestly right now this is especially
true given our technology, right?

86
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,313
Between cell phones, and
tweeting, and Facebook, and

87
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:17,416
mass media, the news cycle is
measured in minutes, or maybe hours.

88
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:22,739
It's not measured in days or weeks,
so there's gonna be messages

89
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:29,510
about whatever's happening whether
you want them to be there or not.

90
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,064
In that kind of environment,
you want people coming to you.

91
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:39,540
You want people wanting to go to you for
their information.

92
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,750
The only way that's gonna happen is if
you're part of the conversation from

93
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,130
the very beginning.

94
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,990
That they know that you can be a source
of accurate appropriate information.

95
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,660
Which leads me of course to
that second piece, be right.

96
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,350
Now, you might think in a crisis that one
of the most important things you want to

97
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,905
do is to wait until you
get your facts straight.

98
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:10,390
I don't want you to be wrong, but that is
the exact wrong approach to take here.

99
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,520
If you wait for the facts until you
are absolutely sure that you know exactly

100
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,651
what's true or not true, you're seeding
the new cycle to somebody else,

101
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:24,902
you're letting other people be
the people who are speaking.

102
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,328
The key idea here is you don't
have to know everything, in fact,

103
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,610
you don't have to know much at all.

104
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,860
What you do have to do is to say
what is known and what is not known.

105
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,540
So therefore, just be accurate
in what is known and not known.

106
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,010
If you say, at this moment in time our
organization does not know how many people

107
00:07:53,010 --> 00:08:00,370
have been affected by this, you are being
fully accurate, and people respect that.

108
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,320
They wanna know that you're gonna try and
find out.

109
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,200
But that's way better than waiting and

110
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,070
not saying anything until
you have the final figures.

111
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,370
What that means is that you can be
accurate at any point in a crisis.

112
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,280
At the beginning, you're gonna have to say
that there's more things that are unknown.

113
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,510
Later on,
there's a more reasonable expectation that

114
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,980
you probably out to know
some of these facts.

115
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,070
But again, being clear and

116
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:38,270
unambiguous about what is known and
what is not known is always a good idea.

117
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:46,320
Also, just don't ever say anything
that could turn out to be wrong.

118
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,130
You can say you don't know, but
being wrong undermines trust.

119
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:57,180
So being a little bit more reserved in
terms of what you say is important,

120
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,900
which gets to this point
about being credible.

121
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,810
Speak to your authority.

122
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,760
What are you an expert in?

123
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,010
Are you the leader of this organization?

124
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,710
Are you an expert in
this particular topic?

125
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,340
Or is your authority coming from the fact
that you were there and you saw it happen,

126
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,790
or you are there right now.

127
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:21,220
You're an expert in knowing
the current status of the crisis.

128
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,138
You can speak to your authority and

129
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:25,926
be honest about why should
you be listening to me.

130
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:32,430
But I also may wanna be clear here at
the same time you have to be human.

131
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,350
If the person speaking at a crisis
is an unemotional leader who is just

132
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,830
speaking as if they're a robot.

133
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,880
Nobody wants to listen to that.

134
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
Nobody wants to trust that.

135
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,610
This is a crisis moment.

136
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,450
It's gonna be a bad moment.

137
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,590
There's gonna be loss, or anger, or fear.

138
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,840
And being honest and

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,100
genuine about the emotions that you're
feeling in that crisis is never wrong.

140
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,470
You can be professional and
human at the same time and

141
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,070
you're much more relatable when you are.

142
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,540
Last point, and
I started to allude to it earlier,

143
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,500
avoid overconfidence at all costs.

144
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,390
And what do I mean by that?

145
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,420
Well, in a crisis,
leaders want to be reassuring.

146
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,840
We wanna tell people, it'll all be fine,
don't worry, it'll be great.

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,380
But overpromising leads
to broken promises.

148
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,260
And the sooner, the moment you say
something that turns out not to be

149
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,120
true people don't believe anything else,
that undermines their trust.

150
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,830
So the key is when you're talking,

151
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,830
especially in a crisis,
to avoid overpromising.

152
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,190
And there's a key tip here from
Peter Sandman, who is an expert in crisis

153
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,720
communication, never say we
are confident that x is going to happen.

154
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,350
Always say we are hopeful.

155
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,970
You can always say that we hope
something is gonna be true.

156
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,488
If it turns out not to be
true then too bad, but

157
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:12,110
you didn't promise, you're just hopeful.

158
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,236
But when you say to somebody,
I'm confident,

159
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:21,957
then when it turns not to be true
they aren't confident in you.

160
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:25,010
So again, three principles.

161
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,440
Try to hold on to these,
try to remember these.

162
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,830
Not because you need them right now, but

163
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,030
because you will need them at some
point in your professional career.

164
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,290
Bad news first, get it out.

165
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,390
Be able to control how it comes out and
prevent that moment when somebody learns

166
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,825
something and
they didn't learn it from you.

167
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:48,740
Two, be first, be right, be credible.

168
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:56,280
Say what is known and be willing to
say what is not known, it's okay.

169
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,170
And third, avoid overconfidence,
don't promise.

170
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,170
You can be hopeful all you want.

171
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,036
But don't be confident that something's
gonna happen that might not turn out

172
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:10,148
to happen at all.

173
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,745
You remember those three things,

174
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:15,760
that will really help you in whatever
crisis situations you run up against.

175
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,742
So, good luck, when those things happen,
it's never easy, but you can be ready.
