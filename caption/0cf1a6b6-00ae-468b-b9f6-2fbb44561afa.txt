1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,298
How many people would choose obliterate, very little eight.

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:10,758
Or 10 and many would choose let her be 1/3.

3
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:12,291
More than see about half.

4
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:15,808
Indeed, most of you.

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,773
Okay.

6
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:21,379
In this case, the answer is very little, so minority groups but

7
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,522
entered the data that addressed this point.

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,241
So, we actually went and

9
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:30,807
studied a group of patients with kidney failure for

10
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:37,158
regions of the United States, one of which was michigan.

11
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:42,070
And through a coworker of black and white women and black and

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:47,582
white men who were under the age of 55 in New York kidney failure.

13
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:51,962
And if you look at the white men, the unadjusted proportion is to report

14
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:54,955
the proportion of patients who were referred for

15
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:59,640
a kidney transplant evaluation using white men as the reference standard.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,950
And if you compare that to the other blue bars slide,

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,693
you see that white women in the middle.

18
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:08,540
We're a little bit less likely about 70 referred for kidney transplant.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,478
But black women and black men were much less likely,

20
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,156
only about 50 to 54% vs 76% of white men.

21
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:19,317
And what the paint for show is that when we adjusted for

22
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,785
patient preferences and expectations.

23
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:25,510
Those differences between white men and

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,228
relative to black only changed by about 2 to 3%.

25
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:35,000
And we added a number of other factors such as patients income insurance

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,803
coverage.

27
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:38,898
There are clinical appropriateness for a kidney transplant.

28
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,896
And we can only actually put everything into this model, both clinical and

29
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:44,236
patient level factors.

30
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:49,089
We can only explain about half of that 20 to 25 the difference between white

31
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:53,355
patients and white patients and their likelihood to get referred for

32
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,768
a kidney transplant.

33
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:59,596
So, this is important because the patient preferences very key piece of how make

34
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:02,870
clinical decisions and quickly rent quality of care.

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,128
And oftentimes if two patients are appropriate for

36
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:10,221
different treatment choices such as amended prostate cancer,

37
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:13,722
sometimes choose surgeries, radiation treatment.

38
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:17,036
Some choose what we call watchful waiting or

39
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:22,243
active surveillance monitoring of this local the prostate cancer.

40
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:26,837
If those patients are fully evaluated and well informed as a practising physician.

41
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:30,887
And most of my colleagues would say this as well that if they choose different

42
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,482
options, then that's perfectly acceptable as

43
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:36,540
long as patients are fully evaluated and well informed.

44
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,050
But in this case, what we found was that first of all,

45
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,094
patient preference driving the difference.

46
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:47,840
And in fact on average with black men and women less likely to be well informed

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,932
about their treatment by the minute relative to the white woman.

48
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:56,726
And so, pointing to systemic factors that in terms of how patients

49
00:02:56,726 --> 00:03:00,335
are evaluated services trans cancer treatment.

50
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:04,557
That may be a big part of the storey of racial disparity.

51
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:06,637
We have just a couple more questions that will move on.

52
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:11,736
So, this one is what effect does Medicare coverage at age 65 racial and

53
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:16,845
ethnic disparities in control of blood sugar for people with diabetes.

54
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:21,007
So, essentially we know before age 60 five that minority of patients are less likely

55
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,441
to have insurance coverage.

56
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:26,754
That depth is pretty much eliminated in the insurance coverage.

57
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:28,317
And so, the question is,

58
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:32,166
can you to eliminate the gap insurance coverage with Medicare?

59
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,432
What happens to the racial gap in blood sugar?

60
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,764
Don't get wider, does it not change at all?

61
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:40,331
Does it narrow, or it isn't particularly eliminated?

62
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,382
So, take a moment to think about your answer there and

63
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,531
we'll come back in a moment.
