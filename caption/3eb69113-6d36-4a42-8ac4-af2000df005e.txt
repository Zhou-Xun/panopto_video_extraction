1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:21,240
All of these are for the corporations to try to.

2
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:37,700
So we haven't got everybody whenever midterms be right.

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,570
Oh, after fall break. Okay, everyone, this when you have one.

4
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,319
Yeah. This weekend. Yes, that's on Friday.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,590
Then it closes on Monday or Tuesday. Okay.

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,420
But nobody else for the fall session. Yeah.

7
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,640
Okay. Q I'm just trying to gauge your current stress level.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,960
You all seem pretty chill today. So maybe if I'm crying internally.

9
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:15,690
Oh, my God. Anyone else crying inside, Sarah?

10
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:22,140
A little. Okay. Yeah, it does kind of start to build up throughout the semester.

11
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:31,260
So with that said, I'm here to remind you that your annotated bibliography is due next Friday.

12
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,560
So keep that in mind. Are there any questions about how to do that or what I'm looking for?

13
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,010
I think I linked to an example of one in the instructions, if you want to take a look at that.

14
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:54,270
I mean, essentially, I'm just trying to get you to start your search for your project and to start thinking about what's

15
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,090
in the literature because you have you're kind of you've formed your basic research question,

16
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,329
but before you can refine it for your grant proposal, you need to know what is kind of out there in the literature.

17
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,070
So I think that this will be helpful to you as you start refining and narrowing down.

18
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:27,930
Okay. So I really I thought the discussion this week was great and there are a lot of great comments and discussion around the readings for this week.

19
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:40,140
And I wanted I wanted to start with the Holloway poem, which is a new reading that I did for this year, obviously, because it's a brand new paper.

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,760
I've never assigned a poem before. I don't think I've ever seen a poem in a journal before, but apparently that's the thing now.

21
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:56,790
And so I just wanted to open it up for discussion about the poem itself or about the and

22
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:06,000
about the idea of using poetry and other forms of expression in the kind of work that we do.

23
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:30,590
Yeah. Patricia? Yeah. I thought that one was really, really powerful, and I thought it was like an important human piece of work,

24
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,920
and it's like, more than just providing context. But I just feel like an important piece that.

25
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,850
So it brought in a human element to what we do as epidemiologist.

26
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,069
Farah. I know you were fired up about this post. Yeah, I was great.

27
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,290
And I was like, Oh, my friend. Oh, yeah, I definitely talk about it.

28
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,610
Okay, we can wait and see if others want to, and then you can unleash.

29
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,810
Did anyone find it confusing and wish that there was just a table?

30
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:38,700
Because that's fine if you did. I think we're talking about.

31
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:57,710
Did anyone feel like it was? Pick up on the critique that was in the poem.

32
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,690
What what did you feel like was the critique that the author is making?

33
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,680
Yeah, potentially.

34
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:20,120
These are people that might be reduced to numbers, especially when they're on such a traumatic or yeah, that this could be like that.

35
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,680
What we do, our enterprise could be sort of sensitive to the people that we study here that we're reporting on.

36
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,550
And, you know, they go so far as to call it, I think, systemic violence.

37
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:45,950
Yeah, Jackie. Life without giving back.

38
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,220
We are profiting off of. I would.

39
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:13,130
We in the communities are being objectified and also being used in a way that promotes professional and financial rewards for researchers.

40
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,240
Cynthia, I see you nodding your head. You just agree with that or did you want to say more?

41
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,480
Just. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:36,120
I just kind of going like. One of the lines that was really hard, like, I can't remember exactly, but everybody wants to read that.

43
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,350
Mm hmm. Idea. Like we care more about, like, what's wrong?

44
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,300
And, like, trying to help. Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,970
That there's a little bit of, like, it's maybe extreme, but, like, fetishizing disease.

46
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,700
This makes me think of your comment, Frances, about trauma porn.

47
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,959
Oh, thanks. Okay. I didn't know you read that, but.

48
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you feel like that fits with the poem or what what he's trying to say?

49
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,460
Or do you just want to comment on that? I absolutely agree.

50
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,320
Um, I think that's one of the things I'm trying to do like, is.

51
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:30,810
The difference between the music you were playing. Apparently being more discriminatory.

52
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,569
Oh, yeah. And our kids are research doing more harm than good sometimes.

53
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:47,170
And how do we know? You.

54
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,720
In particular. Yeah.

55
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,480
What? What we doing?

56
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah. Are they? But then I think they're not going to.

57
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:29,700
That particular. It's difficult to be.

58
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,550
Particularly. Yeah.

59
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:53,050
And, you know, to do that. French.

60
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,130
Oh, no. Oh, no. I do have a question.

61
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:09,910
Yeah. You know, a situation where.

62
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,330
And in that position. The.

63
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,679
They tend to belong to more. One other.

64
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,690
And they happen to be in a place where.

65
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:33,330
It's become a part of the community, but they have to recognize that both in their I guess racial minority does is have different.

66
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,090
Yeah. Yeah. Like in the in the different context that they're working on.

67
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,720
Yeah. I mean, that's that's a great point, I think.

68
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:57,710
And what's your I think what you're both talking about is this idea of who can who can study race and why.

69
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:04,700
And is the way that people go about studying or is it inherently different based on your

70
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:12,560
own racial identity or the way that participants perceive you and your racial identity?

71
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:20,570
What are the sort of the ethics around that when thinking about both objectivity?

72
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:34,879
Um, but also I think this idea of is it problematic to just do research without also engaging in practice practices or something like that?

73
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,320
Those are really big questions. Does anybody have thoughts on those or responses?

74
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:05,250
And. And it really has been giving me a different perspective.

75
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,580
And reality is apparently just like crazy.

76
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,800
Turns out in so many ways her preferred.

77
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:29,120
Help me think about more ways to actually co-create with them instead of going for them, you know?

78
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,360
Yeah, that's a great point that there can be different approaches,

79
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:43,190
but just research being one that addresses some of this issue of ethical issues with research on.

80
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:56,370
Race on. I mean, I think that that research on race and health is one where everybody who does it gets criticized.

81
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:03,150
Like you're either criticized because you're not part of the group that you're studying or you're criticized because you are.

82
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
So either you can't be objective or you don't understand.

83
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,080
And so then who does that leave to do research in this area?

84
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:19,320
So I think in some ways it's a unique area of social epidemiology in that way.

85
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:27,450
And I do think that presents some barriers to to progress in this like this area of research.

86
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,440
You have to be a. I know.

87
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,230
I know, I know. I didn't think you meant that.

88
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:48,440
But I have encountered that personally because I do work on racial disparities and I have experienced that.

89
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:56,560
And I have at least one collaborator who's a black woman who has experienced it coming from the other side and saying,

90
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,970
You're doing research and you can't be objective.

91
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:09,620
And so I don't believe any of you're involved. And so, I mean, in some ways what we've found is that working together in it helps.

92
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,050
It helps address some of the criticism that we're getting.

93
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,650
So I think that's one way to view it.

94
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:36,260
Okay. Sarah, it's your turn. You can go see someone.

95
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:45,770
So I got really excited reading it, but initially just because it's so different than what I can read.

96
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,650
And when you mentioned like I was not reading conversions, I think you were right.

97
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,970
When I go there. That is the New England Journal of Medicine.

98
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:03,200
I think they have a whole section and it's like top read and it's it's usually just like somebody.

99
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,850
But not usually like a reflection. Yeah. Yeah.

100
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,660
So I thought I got super excited for it.

101
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:18,590
I don't know. I just immediately started to like the elements and then my own assumptions and then like,

102
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:25,490
in terms of, like what I saw in my I just always loved this place.

103
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,540
And immediately I started to like I was like, Oh, no wonder this group is this whole world.

104
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,630
And then I was like, I had to record. And you're like, Wait, that's not the country to look up to.

105
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:46,970
But I was really like, I was kind of surprised at how automatic. It's like you see that in not just the bodies themselves but the like accents.

106
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,280
How you started to. Tear apart those assumptions of the New York Times.

107
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,790
Oh. And then. Oh.

108
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,550
What are they looking strictly for? Military personnel. Yeah, the.

109
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:11,320
Yeah. The pleasure of the statistician is less than personal in his eyes, which is, like, so creepy and perfect.

110
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:19,740
Uh huh. And then the findings are based, founded in 1975, which was found before that, very likely, stuff like that.

111
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:27,300
And then lastly, I don't know if anyone's read James Joyce's The Short Story and the theory and it has a similar.

112
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:36,210
It talks about mortality. Oh, I was talking about snow in his hands off the record and something following on.

113
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,110
And it was just like a similar rhythm, especially given that short stories about mortality.

114
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,930
Lives matter. Not just living, but. Um. So, in other words.

115
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:58,300
Um. And then. And then I went on to write something really great about the different countries that discuss how often they do.

116
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Like everything else, you know. One of the countries this year called the reality of the ruthless capitalist recalibration had discovered.

117
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:22,810
And so recognizing that some of these things can increase reactions to even arbitrary social norms studying the effects of that person.

118
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:30,550
Yeah, I know. I'm glad that he addressed it and then those other people that reference it.

119
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,600
I think it was a nice change of pace for sure.

120
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,549
So, you know, a short you're right. Like, thank goodness.

121
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,200
Finally, a short favor. We heard different thing about this.

122
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,520
I like reading James Joyce and stuff.

123
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:56,120
Yeah. Yeah, we do. Yeah, but that raises some other points that people were talking about.

124
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,460
So, Victoria, you wrote in your post, are we studying race or racism?

125
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:06,650
Why do we focus more on race and epidemiology rather than race as though you want to say more about that?

126
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:13,470
Well, I just want to emphasize, like, why is it so important that you use race?

127
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:20,700
Two to people fell into a structure.

128
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:32,180
And this is similar to last year. People.

129
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,220
Yeah. So I mean, I do think that's true in epidemiology.

130
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:45,220
There is more research on racism today than in the past.

131
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:51,129
Um, but for the work on structural racism, which is really still kind of in its infancy,

132
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,810
I would say an epidemiologist there was work on racial discrimination.

133
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:04,089
Um, and so that work was trying to get closer to racism rather than race.

134
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:10,930
But why do you think epidemiologists focus so much on race rather than race as.

135
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,500
Yeah, but. He's here to. Yeah.

136
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:25,890
We have questions about it. And sir. Yes, I mean, that's really a lot of it is kind of a pragmatic thing that most of the surveys that we work with

137
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:32,130
don't have data on discrimination or don't have information on exposure to other forms of racism.

138
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:58,270
Yeah, I also think that. Mhm.

139
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,170
Yeah. No that's an interesting point that maybe epidemiologists don't focus on that,

140
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,579
not just because it's hard to measure, but because it feels like it's not possible to change.

141
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,400
And so if you're interested in interventions or something like that, then maybe.

142
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:19,370
It's like, okay, where I want to focus my energy. I mean, perfectly all of this.

143
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,360
So, yeah, the government is not programs they might not want to fund a study.

144
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,840
You know, that's like we're like it's like racism comes around and points to the government being.

145
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,950
You know, that's a really important point, too, that the funding climate shifts what people study as well.

146
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:50,400
So in the last couple of years there has been a big influx of money from an AI age to study racism and racial health disparities.

147
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,190
And so that has led to this like exponential increase in research in this area.

148
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:04,560
So like what the what the NIH sees as important or other funding bodies sees as important shapes.

149
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:17,890
What their research is to. Yeah.

150
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,010
Abbott, I think we is really interested in water, right?

151
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,360
Yeah. Yes. Like, how would you capture them really?

152
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,660
In a dag. You could make it one single node.

153
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,160
Racism. Racism. It's like, for example.

154
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,620
Like it's so many different things. So many different. Yes.

155
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,880
It's also both upstream and downstream. Structural and interpersonal and internalized and internal.

156
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:54,650
Yeah. And so, like, I just think it doesn't really fit neatly into.

157
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,360
The way that we think about like the social world.

158
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:05,630
Yeah, I do think that you're right that a lot of it is that it's challenging to study within our like our framework and our,

159
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,959
our methods and models that we use.

160
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,210
And there were several people actually talked about race and racism and dags.

161
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:27,250
So I have two here. Hold on. I know you did.

162
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:36,590
I remember it. I wrote it down. Oh, Ali, you were talking about where to put race in a tag.

163
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:50,890
I just remember. For and we're.

164
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:13,990
I think. I remember. I'm.

165
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:30,580
Everything. All right.

166
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:40,020
So. Yeah.

167
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,680
And I want to I want to tell you about that. But I want now that to respond.

168
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,750
Yeah, I'm still formulating my thoughts on this, but I have like I learned a doctorate this year.

169
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,980
And weirdly enough, having known everything about my class in sociology and public health,

170
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,010
so interested in public health fact, it's very much like dags are this great empirical tool.

171
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:07,740
Measure associations, state proprietors and sociologists like this is a way that we can organize our thoughts a little bit better.

172
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,260
You know, so we're kind of like coming at it from different directions.

173
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:20,400
But I have sort of a critique of that, which is that I think sometimes when we see them as so empirical, they're so subjective.

174
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,159
It's like I read about this in a different way,

175
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:31,350
just like it's organizing or sense making of the social world and the epidemiological world, putting it on paper.

176
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,500
But it's really just like, you know, more like empirical or right than if we were writing a paragraph about it.

177
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:44,480
Right. Sure. But I think like in 600, which I'm taking right now, we get tested on like the right or the wrong way to do the damage.

178
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,230
And I think that that is a little bit it can be a little bit misleading.

179
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:57,140
And it can lead to stuff like that where it's like you're not you're thinking more about the dog than you are thinking about the social.

180
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,040
And like, what do those things mean that you're putting in the dag, right?

181
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,260
Like you're putting race in there. Okay, well, race is a variable.

182
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,730
We're talking about that just a second. Right. But what is it? What is it capturing?

183
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:21,500
Like, what does it what does it mean? And I actually do think that it's it's not always inappropriate to have something that says.

184
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:28,070
So you were saying. This was the thing that felt wrong.

185
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,830
This is what felt weird to say. Yeah.

186
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:46,540
Is that cause or what is that about? If you're thinking about race as a biological construct, this makes literally no sense.

187
00:24:46,630 --> 00:25:00,880
Right. But if you're thinking about race as a social construct and where someone fits within a racial hierarchy and a racialized social system.

188
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:12,110
It doesn't really go on attack. But like this is the context in which you're studying the relationship between race and segregation.

189
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:21,139
Then this starts to actually make more sense because you're a race as categorized in the society in which you live,

190
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,709
is structuring your opportunities to live in certain places.

191
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:35,840
And therefore it really is an underlying cause of segregation because what it's doing, I guess really interacting with the social context.

192
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,370
And so that interaction is what produces this causal relationship.

193
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,830
But yeah, how do you express that in a that.

194
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:51,230
So I think for you too, I think it's fine to use the data, but you've got to be really clear about what you.

195
00:25:52,260 --> 00:26:02,150
Here. And you also have to understand that, like what you think may not be how reviewers or readers think about it.

196
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:09,240
And so it's your responsibility to communicate very clearly in your paper what you mean by this.

197
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,300
So I'm I'm writing as well. I have a paper that's under review right now.

198
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,550
And we're asking this question.

199
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:39,330
We're doing a mediation analysis. So I don't want to bore you with the details of these studies.

200
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:48,240
But see, underneath is a biomarker of stress in aging, shorter telomeres associated with increased risk of morbidity from certain diseases,

201
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,720
particularly cardiovascular disease, and also all cause mortality.

202
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,540
So you can think about this. We talked in this class a little bit before about weathering, accelerated biological aging.

203
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,540
You can think of telomere length as a marker of that. Okay.

204
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,250
So. To be more specific.

205
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,480
Okay. So we're looking at black white differences.

206
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,530
So based on what I just told you about what yours are, what would you expect this relationship to be?

207
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,810
Would you expect black people to have longer or shorter years?

208
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,860
Sure. Right. Okay. But that's not true. So black people have longer teen years.

209
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,200
And it's true across virtually every study that's been done.

210
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,400
There's a few very small studies that have shown no association or an inverse association.

211
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,480
But almost universally, especially if you look at nationally representative samples,

212
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:50,290
black respondents at all ages of adulthood, even early childhood, have longer teen years.

213
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:57,730
And so this is like perplexing to people who are coming at two years from like a social science perspective.

214
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:06,310
And so one of the things that we did is we did a paper where we looked at the interaction between race and socioeconomic status on children.

215
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:11,920
And we found that differences in telomere length vary by socioeconomic status.

216
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,320
So they were the smallest in the highest group, the largest and the low ethnic group.

217
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:27,040
And we pulled on some other research that we had previously done, actually not looking at race at all,

218
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,160
but looking at exposure to persistent organic foods like PCBs in relation to telomere length.

219
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,040
And so most things that are bad for your health are associated with shorter telomeres.

220
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,570
But exposure to persistent organic foods is associated with longer telomeres.

221
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,210
And the idea is that that is probably related to cancer risk because these are carcinogens.

222
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:57,460
And so the hypothesis was made out to be telomerase, which has come down, regulated and sold to prevent cancer growth.

223
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:05,139
And we also know that black people are exposed to much higher levels of persistent

224
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,480
organic pollutants because of both occupational segregation and residential segregation.

225
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:14,010
So environmental racism is part of this story.

226
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,200
And so we're looking we so we did this mediation model.

227
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,280
We find the differences in exposure to persistent organic foods explains a good portion of the association between this and separately.

228
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,620
And go ahead and guess what objection we got from the viewers.

229
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:43,129
Yes. Yeah.

230
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,020
You're healthier. Yeah. No, you have to be careful with that. Yeah.

231
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,420
They want to know why we're not controlling for genetics.

232
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:08,520
Huge three page response that like we're doing is totally wrong because we know that there's like that genes effects [INAUDIBLE] merely right.

233
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,400
And so they're telling me you have to control for genetic ancestry.

234
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:25,930
It's just so infuriating and wrong. And I'm like, okay, well, sure, these two things could be associated in some way.

235
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,590
Gene frequencies do vary across population groups, right?

236
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:40,090
But like, is there any reason to believe that the genes that are causally associated with teal are somehow associated with skin color or whatever?

237
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,840
Like those are racial categories? Probably not.

238
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:49,360
Also, yes, there are genetic risk scores that have been developed for telomere length,

239
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:58,060
but they were developed in European ancestry populations and so don't necessarily apply to other populations.

240
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:08,020
And so this is like it's an impossible to argue against because they're saying you don't control for this thing,

241
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,720
which we don't even have measure then then I don't believe any of that.

242
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:22,270
But the fair assumption is that if you controlled for genetic variation, there would be no difference until merely by race,

243
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:30,700
which would mean that, like any environmental differences between these populations wouldn't explain any difference in like cellular aging.

244
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,870
Does that make any sense?

245
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:41,810
Doesn't make any sense anyway, so I don't remember how I got off on this, but it's really bothering me because I'm working on it right now.

246
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:53,149
And so I think, Oh, I know how I did it with Dad. So I was very clear in this paper what we've learned by raising that,

247
00:31:53,150 --> 00:32:01,190
which we think of self-reported race as representing your position in a racial hierarchy within a racialized society,

248
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:08,000
and that it's patterning things like where you live, what kind of work you do, all that kind of stuff.

249
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,870
And still we get this argument that like, well, you're not accounting for genetics and genetics.

250
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:20,149
So even if you're very careful about explaining what you mean and people are coming

251
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:26,360
to a research question or just coming to a piece of work that's about race,

252
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:33,320
they're bringing their own assumptions about what race means and which are the most salient features of that for.

253
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:44,130
I'm know that we haven't even gotten to the slides and we have a really great documentary to watch, so I'm going to start going faster.

254
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,600
Okay. Anybody want to say anything else about the poem?

255
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,340
All right. So let's start with some definitions of worse.

256
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:05,730
And we'll start with what is a racial group. Sasha, you ask this on the first day and I said, I promise we're going to get to the.

257
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:24,770
How would you define it if you had to explain to somebody coming from another planet who didn't know anything about race?

258
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:49,210
Or would you explain to them what racial groups are? Okay.

259
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,850
I'll just. It's hard. The definition I have.

260
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,380
You could probably come up with many more,

261
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:05,080
but you can think of it as just a category of people treated as a social entity by virtue of physical characteristics.

262
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:13,640
And what are some of the physical characteristics that we in the U.S. use to distinguish between people of different racial groups?

263
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:28,120
Yeah. Skin color. Hair texture.

264
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,850
I her. I shaved.

265
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,610
Yeah. We have these things that we use to put people into racial categories.

266
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,970
Of course, they're not perfect. Right?

267
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:50,870
But these are the kinds of things that we're looking at in terms of physical features that help us distinguish people and put them in a racial group.

268
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,460
And in the U.S., the federal government recognizes these racial groups.

269
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,140
One of these. Or more than one.

270
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,060
So you can see American Indian or Alaskan Negroes.

271
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:14,280
That's a group of Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Black or African American or more than one.

272
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,510
So when you fill out the census or oftentimes if you fill out a survey, these are the categories, right?

273
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,380
Because they're the Office of Management and Budget racial categories.

274
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:32,210
And so any federally funded research has to ask these things and report this information.

275
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,710
Okay. So that's what you mean by a racial group? What do we mean by an ethnic group?

276
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:49,670
Okay. Yeah.

277
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,010
So this one's more about culture and less about physical characteristics.

278
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,989
So it's a group that has a common cultural heritage.

279
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:03,670
Not that culture is easy to define, but this can include things like shared ancestry, language, religion.

280
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,630
And we already talked about this once.

281
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:14,390
Do you remember what our ethnic groups are in the United States that are recognized as Hispanic and not Hispanic?

282
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:23,380
That's right. So you get to pick one or the other. And then we take these two questions and we put them together and we make race, ethnicity.

283
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:35,370
And then we put that in our models. Right. Now the distinction, as you can imagine, between racial and ethnic groups is not very clear.

284
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:42,840
And so that's part of why that term, race, ethnicity kind of gets used in research a lot.

285
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:59,750
All right. So we already talked about this a little bit, but this idea of what is race, is it a biological thing or is it a social construction?

286
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,600
And so let's just talk for a minute about what would it mean to say that race is socially constructed?

287
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:20,440
Yeah. But it's ever changing that we keep adopting it.

288
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,040
And I just think of. Now White is looked at as a very small box.

289
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,530
But he's. Italian-American Irish-Americans used to bring that down.

290
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,200
And then we all got together. I'm going to put it all together and move it forward.

291
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,760
And so we decide those things together and they kind of stay in that box, everything.

292
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:45,909
Yeah. So it's this idea that we like to gather not you know, it's not like we sit down around a table and negotiate about the racial categories.

293
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:54,340
It's not that that clear, but that it is this process that we go through kind of as a society where we construct our

294
00:37:54,340 --> 00:38:00,250
sort of make up this idea about what is race and what are the categories within race.

295
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:04,930
And like you said, these categories change over time.

296
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,690
The boundaries of them change like who is white? Um, changes over time.

297
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,250
So yeah, that's the idea that this is not like a universally accepted idea.

298
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,889
If you went to another part of the world and ask people to explain what is race,

299
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:29,290
they would probably tell you something different than what our senses categories are.

300
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,860
Right. So knowledge is not universal.

301
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:39,820
It's created through social activity. Racial classifications vary across place and time and are really somewhat arbitrary.

302
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:49,870
So can you just as an example, can you think of other racial or ethnic groups besides those that I had on the previous slide,

303
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,570
ones that aren't recognized by the U.S. government, but that we think of as racial or ethnic groups.

304
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,310
So patiently. Wait. They had.

305
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,850
Yeah. So there's that history of white people from Jewish, Italian,

306
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:31,770
Irish being treated as like marginalized ethnic groups, but then over time, gaining acceptance as a white.

307
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:37,570
Any other? Yeah. No, I mean, yeah.

308
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:45,440
So the Middle Eastern and North African population gets counted right now is what, white, non-Hispanic white.

309
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,010
And so there was an effort to sort of add that to the census as an ethnic category.

310
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,060
And I don't know why it failed, but it didn't happen yet.

311
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:04,760
But Hispanic wasn't included until, I don't remember when maybe the 1980s.

312
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,630
So there was like kind of a fight to have that recognized by the census.

313
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,320
And why might you want if you consider yourself lost?

314
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,370
Let's talk about from the Middle Eastern North African population.

315
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,460
Why might people in that group want to be designated differently, not be counted as white?

316
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,479
Yeah. Patricia have. Yeah.

317
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,480
You're like not having the same experiences as other people who are in the category.

318
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,530
And if we don't measure that group, we don't know anything about their health status.

319
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,659
Right? Because we're not measuring it.

320
00:40:53,660 --> 00:41:02,270
And so it's not clear if this is a group that's experiencing health disparities and needs more resources is directed toward wholeness.

321
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:13,160
So this is like a it's a political process of having a group recognize because there are four tangible things that come with that.

322
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:21,350
So then we already talked about this a little bit, but what are we capturing when we measure a race?

323
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:26,750
What does it mean when I have somebody in my survey and their white.

324
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,380
Or are there other? What does that mean?

325
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,610
Does it tell me something about their experiences? Yeah.

326
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,720
Probably calling her you raising your hand or thinking, okay.

327
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:12,430
Yeah. So we're, we're capturing something about social stratification by race, like where?

328
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,480
Like social status with respect to race and a racial hierarchy in that society that you're studying.

329
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:30,870
What else might be wrapped up in their. I already showed you that is capturing something about environmental exposures

330
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:37,920
because of the history of residential segregation and environmental racism.

331
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,420
It is also capturing something about genetic ancestry.

332
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:59,350
How important that is for a health outcome is up for debate, but it is capturing that.

333
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:14,079
So I'm just going to read you my list. It's capturing things like geographic origins, genetic ancestry, family patterns,

334
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,730
language, cultural norms and traditions, social history, current social circumstances.

335
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,300
The truth is, it's capturing a whole lot of stuff.

336
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:36,489
Yes. I'm going to go quickly through some of the stuff on demographics and health disparities,

337
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,060
and you'll have the slides later so you can look through them all if you want.

338
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:49,330
But I just want to talk a little bit about the racial composition of the United States, geographic distribution by race,

339
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:55,720
and then what we know about disparities in certain health outcomes from like from big national surveys.

340
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,829
So this is from 24, the data are from 2014.

341
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,540
So this is the non-elderly population in the United States by race and ethnicity.

342
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,290
So you can see that the population in 2014 was 59% white,

343
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:21,250
the second largest group of Hispanic than black and 13% Asian at 6% American, Indian and Alaska Native at 1%.

344
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,399
Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander are less than 1%.

345
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:37,600
And the other 2%. Does that surprise anybody or is that what you thought the composition of the U.S. was?

346
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,510
Just curious. Not too surprising to me.

347
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:55,560
Okay. So I just asked because geographically racial groups are not distributed kind of equally.

348
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,560
So depending on where you grew up, those numbers might seem really weird to you.

349
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,079
So you can see the this is the share of the non-elderly population that is a person of color.

350
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,970
So that's just all groups other than white put together for the purposes of this slide.

351
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,000
And you can see that the lightest color is less than 18%.

352
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:26,900
So that means the state is at least 82% white, and that's the case in ten states.

353
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,070
So maybe if you grew up in one of these states, you like, the U.S. is only 59% white.

354
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,230
That's not true. Right, because you just have a very different experience if you come from one of these states.

355
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:42,470
In 21 states, it ranges from 19% to 37%.

356
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:49,520
And then in 20 states, including the District of Columbia, it's more than 37%.

357
00:45:52,240 --> 00:46:02,080
And so you can see that it's very different, like the sort of areas of the country where people of color are concentrated are different.

358
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,100
It's not random across the US. And so, of course.

359
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:13,919
We also know that that feels like region to home also.

360
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,070
Right. So region is correlated with race.

361
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:26,220
All right. This is the age of the non-elderly population by race, ethnicity and 2014.

362
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:32,230
So this is just showing that the age distribution of different racial and ethnic groups varies.

363
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:39,660
And so this is important for health also, right? Because older people tend to have more health problems than younger people.

364
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:47,290
So if as a group, your your population is older, you're likely to to look worse on health outcomes.

365
00:46:47,290 --> 00:47:01,870
But that may just be because of the age distribution. So white and Asian population tend to be older.

366
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:12,260
Or shipped it that way. All right, then we also have citizenship status, another important determinant, social determinants of health.

367
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,040
Right. And that varies a lot across different racial and ethnic groups.

368
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,590
So you can see that for the white population, 96% are U.S. born citizens.

369
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,530
For the Asian population, that's 41%. For the Hispanic population, 66%.

370
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:35,430
Black population, 90%. American Indian and Alaska Native, obviously not quite, nearly 100%.

371
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,330
And Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander 72%.

372
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:47,700
So that this will definitely affect what we see in terms of when you're looking at racial

373
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,770
disparities across different populations because citizenship is also based on their.

374
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,700
And we know this because we talked about this a little bit last week.

375
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,300
But differences in socio economic indicators, of course, are also there across racial and ethnic groups.

376
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:14,470
So this is whether there's a full time worker in the family on the left and then whether the family income is below the poverty level.

377
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:24,510
On the right. So you can see very big differences in poverty across these racial and ethnic groups, which will, of course, have a big impact on how.

378
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:38,489
So I'm going to try to explain this figure and all the next figures just break this one down into specific health outcomes.

379
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,570
But this one combines them all together.

380
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:49,170
So this is showing the number of health status and outcome measures for which groups fared better, the same or worse compared to whites.

381
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:58,410
And so if for the end, they looked at 29 different health outcomes, if it's orange,

382
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:05,850
that those are the health outcomes on which that group did better compared to whites.

383
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:13,650
So if you look at Asians compared to whites, they were healthier on 25 out of 29 indicators.

384
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:25,560
So that makes sense. Okay. And then if you look at the Hispanic population, Hispanics were healthier on seven out of 29 outcomes compared to whites.

385
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,540
For the black population, that's one outcome of 29.

386
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:39,120
American Indian. Alaska Native better on six. And for native Hawaiian and other, Pacific Islander is better on two.

387
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,729
So you can see there's really big differences across a lot of health indicators.

388
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,879
And I'll tell you what all they looked at. So it's a huge range.

389
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,910
So they looked at fair or poor health status and it self-rated how they looked at physical limitations,

390
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:02,520
reporting at least 14 physically unhealthy days in the past 30 days, at least 14 mentally unhealthy days in the past month.

391
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:10,530
The smoking rate, obesity rate, alcohol dependance and abuse, drug dependance and abuse alcohol or illicit drug dependance or abuse combined.

392
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:19,530
Asthma Rate. Diabetes Rate Heart Attack Disease Rate Asthma Rate HIV Diagnosis Rate AIDS Diagnosis Rate HIV Death Rate Cancer Rate

393
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:27,059
Breast Cancer Rate Colorectal cancer rate lung cancer rate preterm birth low birth weight later no prenatal care.

394
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,150
Infant Mortality Rate Teen birth rate. Diabetes Death Rate.

395
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:35,530
Heart Disease Death Rate and Cancer Death Rate. So a huge range of outcomes.

396
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:44,559
And this is this is what the patterns look like. So I just want to point out,

397
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:52,390
because several of you noticed in the G and Heck an article and commented on the fact that

398
00:50:53,710 --> 00:51:00,880
the on the reference group and how we choose the reference group and what that means.

399
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:16,990
Anybody want to say anything about that? Why do you think that these authors chose White as their reference group?

400
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:36,340
Is it because they're the healthiest group? You just.

401
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:47,600
That's why cyber. So it could be it could be that they base it on the fact that it's the largest segment of the population.

402
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:56,560
That reasonable rationale yet. Yeah, it could be because they're the most privileged or socially advantaged group.

403
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,860
And if you're trying to understand disparities, but that's what you want to compare to.

404
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:06,600
Yeah, it would be I think it might have some. All of it.

405
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:14,070
It's. They're showing. I know that anything in better or worse category is.

406
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:24,120
So I think it makes you feel good and you're going to find more numbers and little aspects of it which we like.

407
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,500
So it might help you see more significant differences.

408
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:35,380
Yeah. With. I guess that makes them.

409
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,840
Really? You know, every person is just like that.

410
00:52:52,730 --> 00:53:02,690
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's true that like and this was one of the points that you brought up is that white is the default in the United States.

411
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,270
So the idea that white is normal and everything else is some deviation from

412
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,639
that and that that's why like that we're always using white as the reference.

413
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,620
How is this different from the white?

414
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:25,310
And Tristan, did you bring up James Jackson or do you say a little bit about his his work and his framework around that?

415
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,860
Yeah. So I guess the big topic. We're in.

416
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:42,060
Really? No. So I would say like this framework or let's just kind of challenge this as more and more kids are kind of established in the research,

417
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,590
I guess, kind of getting married and in my career as well.

418
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,210
One of the things that kind of stuck with me was more so like challenging,

419
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:57,980
like even this term, for example, just considering all black experiences to be the same.

420
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:04,320
Yeah, although they're not. So, but he was able to do it. He was able to kind of break that down a little bit farther and look at, you know.

421
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,850
I don't want to be like 78,

422
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:16,040
but looking at like we're basically breaking it down a little bit there and being able to look at those experiences in that.

423
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,969
Instead of comparing. Just wait. Yeah. Yeah.

424
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:33,250
So he was he was very interested in looking at differences in the black population and using that approach rather than a mature approach.

425
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:39,090
And that was pretty radical and still gets pushback from that.

426
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:44,990
Um, but that was, yeah, that was kind of one of the things that he led,

427
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:53,970
studies that were international studies that were able to get very large samples of the black population with heterogeneity in terms of,

428
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:07,920
uh, like country of origin and, and, and, and that was impossible to do in a lot of existing national studies because the black population,

429
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,409
like you saw, is 13% of the US population.

430
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:21,510
So if you do a national study and you have a thousand people in it, you really don't have enough black participants to analyze that as well.

431
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:29,090
And so that was kind of you have to have these studies that focus on like smaller populations to understand that.

432
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:38,570
Yeah. I do. As a researcher.

433
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,950
Reference. Yeah, you can. No, I didn't. Not in like.

434
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:55,780
Well, you know, if you're in maybe in purpose, maybe like California, you might have a large enough population.

435
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:07,300
Um, but in most research studies in the US, the Asian population is so small that they, they typically don't even get examined out of their own group.

436
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:16,010
You get lumped into another group with people who are multiracial or who are like you can see here.

437
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:22,570
Right. Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander. What those 18 means is that they didn't have data.

438
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:31,180
It's not that they were better or worse off on health is that we have no idea for 18 health indicators.

439
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:37,600
We have no idea how Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders compare to the white population.

440
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:48,150
Yeah, that may be why I think you.

441
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,659
Yeah.

442
00:56:52,660 --> 00:57:01,980
I mean, I think that maybe like you could argue that combining those, but they usually don't usually just combine everybody into one other category,

443
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:12,790
which is really meaningless because these groups have such completely different experiences that it's not a particularly meaningful category.

444
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:23,830
And sometimes people, instead of creating another category, will just drop groups that they're like enough to study for your models.

445
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:29,200
So it's really common that, like people of certain racial ethnic groups will just get dropped from the model.

446
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:36,460
Okay. I'm going to skip through. You may look at these on your own.

447
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:45,040
Okay. So now let's talk about.

448
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,730
Oh, I just remembered something else I wanted to talk about. About the DAX.

449
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,330
You want to talk? You brought this up and yours, your comments.

450
00:57:53,350 --> 00:58:04,030
So and I have I've heard this from other students that you guys are taught that you cannot do causal inference with race as an exposure

451
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:13,420
because you can't assign if it doesn't fit into the counterfactual framework because you can't assign a person a different race.

452
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,990
Is that right? You learn that. Okay.

453
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:26,379
So not everybody agrees with that. And I did put some information in the in the leg discussion.

454
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:32,680
If you want to look at it, there's some papers in there which I'd be happy to share with you on people who have written about this very topic.

455
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,840
And these may be some of the papers that you've been reading.

456
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:45,310
I don't know that challenge, kind of that notion that race can't be a cause because you can assign somebody else a different race.

457
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:55,120
But one way to think about it is if race is a social construction and what race is indicating is where

458
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,850
a person fits into their racial hierarchy based on their phenotype or their physical appearance.

459
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:06,190
You certainly could manipulate the racial hierarchy, right?

460
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:13,540
Like you could imagine a world in which black is at the top of the racial hierarchy and white is at the bottom.

461
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,790
Right. So that means or try.

462
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:24,310
Right? I know that's probably hard to imagine because it's so different from the world that we live in.

463
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,520
But like but that's it fits into a counterfactual framework.

464
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:37,030
If you are thinking about race as a social construct, if you have some other definition of race that maybe you can't do it that way.

465
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:44,950
If it's some kind of biological thing, making sure you get it wouldn't matter if you changed the social hierarchy around race.

466
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:50,469
If what race is really capturing is genetics and biology, then you can't manipulate that.

467
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:53,980
But if it's social position, you absolutely could manipulate that.

468
00:59:54,430 --> 01:00:18,110
Yes, there is fact. Yeah.

469
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:29,960
So it's that. It makes that.

470
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:43,030
Yeah, it comes off. I've heard from students that it also comes up in 644, so we've taken 644.

471
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,370
Um, did you also learn that like, Greece was not. Have you gotten there yet?

472
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,090
Yeah. So I actually had no idea this was being taught in our curriculum.

473
01:00:52,390 --> 01:01:01,540
So like maybe two years ago. Um, and I guess we were, I don't know why, how it came up, but it came up and I was like, What?

474
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:06,100
So I think that's fascinating. And there are a few departments,

475
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:15,040
Johns Hopkins in particular has this group called videos where they have gotten together and like made changes

476
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:22,759
to the basic epidemiologic epidemiology curriculum to teach students about race as a social construction.

477
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,879
And also they do things about gender and whatever to try to get it,

478
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:33,250
to push back against this prevailing narrative of white race as a biological construct.

479
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:41,050
And this whole idea of what does it mean when you put race in a model or sex or gender in a model and you control for that?

480
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:46,510
So I think that there are people who are starting to push against that dominant,

481
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,490
dominant narrative in epidemiology and it's filtering into their curriculum.

482
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:58,329
So, um, I have asked RTI committee and the department to review what's happening at like some

483
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:04,059
of the other univers other epidemiology departments to try to get a sense of what

484
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:08,139
they're doing with their curriculum so that we can learn from that and start to

485
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:12,730
implement some changes as we go through curriculum reform later this year and next.

486
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:16,660
So I think that's a really important area for us to have. I mean,

487
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:25,270
I think it's also important to understand that different professors are coming from different points of view

488
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:32,920
when when they're teaching these topics and that as long as they're defining race in a particular way,

489
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:40,650
then that's fine. You may disagree with the way it's defined, but like given their definition,

490
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:47,080
what they're teaching you is right that you can challenge that definition and then go like the kind of implications of that.

491
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:56,470
Okay. So let's talk about mechanisms. All right. So I just showed you all of those different racial disparities in health.

492
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:02,080
Right. What are what underlies that?

493
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:10,150
What's what's in the sort of pathway linking race to health outcomes?

494
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,700
I already gave you one answer. Ex socioeconomic status.

495
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:25,320
So we talked about this last time. We talked about how important different aspects of socio economic status are for health.

496
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:29,940
And we know that socio economic status is strongly racially patterned.

497
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,919
How many of you went to the seminar yesterday? At the department seminar?

498
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:42,970
And no, Sarah, was there was anybody else there? If you weren't able to go, we're going to put out a recording.

499
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:49,190
So the speaker was talking about her work and intersectionality and health disparities.

500
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:53,959
And I think that it fits in nicely with a lot of things we've talked about in this class.

501
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,990
So I encourage you to watch it if you have time. She's a great speaker.

502
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:05,630
So things like poverty, income, education do help explain some racial disparities that we see.

503
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:14,030
But even after taking different aspects of socioeconomic status into account, we still see the persistence of racial and ethnic health disparities.

504
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:22,339
And so this could be for a couple of reasons. It could be that measures of us are not equivalent across race.

505
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:25,160
And we talked about this a little bit last time.

506
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:33,080
So because of discrimination, economic returns to education are not as great as black for black people compared to white people.

507
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:39,200
That's a particular one. So if you're just controlling for education, for example,

508
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:46,520
it's not taking into account that education produces different economic gains for different groups because of racism.

509
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,579
And like we talked about last time, wealth is rarely measured in epidemiologic studies,

510
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:57,800
but the differences in wealth or even between groups is even greater than the difference in income.

511
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:06,919
And so we have these very large differences. And while that we usually care for also because of residential segregation,

512
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,900
we have differences in quality of education, which we don't capture in our measures.

513
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:19,970
So this is one kind of explanation for why you still see racial disparities after accounting for socioeconomic status.

514
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:25,309
And this is really kind of an argument about residual confounding,

515
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:32,390
like you're not we're really not fully accounting for differences in rate and see us most of the time.

516
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:42,649
But that's probably not the only explanation. There's probably also other mechanisms likely because differences in socioeconomic

517
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:48,620
status aren't the only health related differences between racial and ethnic groups.

518
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:53,680
So another mechanism that we can think about is segregation.

519
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:59,510
The Williams paper kind of goes into detail about this.

520
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:10,010
So the US is highly segregated, especially for African-Americans, but really for most groups the US is very segregated.

521
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,110
Yeah, I forgot to check this link to make sure it still works. Let's see. Oh, here we go.

522
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:22,520
And we'll talk about this more when we do neighborhood stuff. But I just want to show you some maps of segregation.

523
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:31,819
So this is Columbus, Ohio. So you can see the spatial clustering of different racial and ethnic group groups.

524
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:35,480
So the color of the dots represents a group.

525
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:41,540
No, thank you. Let's see.

526
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:45,290
There is. Okay, so Houston looks different, right?

527
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:54,530
So here we see, I think green is Asian and an Asian.

528
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,450
Leslie Green is Asian.

529
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:06,390
So you can see that like Houston is is a much more racially diverse city than what's it Columbus that we were looking at before,

530
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:13,750
but highly segregated by race. Memphis, Tennessee.

531
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,860
Black and white. Segregated Pittsburgh.

532
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,110
Largely black and white. Segregated New Orleans.

533
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:28,810
Rollins is really clear. Washington, D.C.

534
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:40,040
Baltimore. Indianapolis.

535
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:50,320
Oh, there's Los Angeles. Birmingham.

536
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:59,030
Cincinnati. Boston.

537
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:07,700
Saint Louis. Cleveland.

538
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:16,050
Miami. Philadelphia.

539
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:23,860
Chicago. Newark, New Jersey.

540
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:32,400
New York. Health educated. New York. Milwaukee.

541
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:40,140
And number one, most segregated city, Detroit.

542
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:49,380
Are these surprising when you see these? No.

543
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:56,230
Yes. No. Are they all in one region of the country?

544
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:04,370
Now there's segregation in all parts of the U.S.

545
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:09,860
So it's not just a phenomenon that's in the South or in the Midwest.

546
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:24,030
So segregation can adversely affect health in multiple ways.

547
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:31,320
And what's important to understand about this is that it's not about the racial composition of the area per se.

548
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:37,010
There's nothing about the fact that one group lives there that makes it an unhealthy place to live.

549
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,720
It's not about the group that lives there.

550
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:48,660
So it's really about the concentration of poverty and social adversity, which is the legacy of institutional discrimination.

551
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:57,900
Right. So that's what that's what's driving the sort of health context of places that are segregated.

552
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,440
So it limits socioeconomic mobility.

553
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:11,920
In large part because of disinvestment, investment for education in particular.

554
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:21,160
So you know that in the US schools are largely funded by local taxes, local property taxes and business taxes.

555
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:28,930
So if you live in an area where property is worth less and there's fewer businesses, there's less tax revenue to support schooling.

556
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:39,270
And so that can limit socioeconomic mobility, less availability of healthy food and recreation facilities,

557
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:44,100
and targeted marketing of tobacco and alcohol. We've talked about this before in this class.

558
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,510
Concentration of poverty and stress.

559
01:10:53,020 --> 01:11:01,840
Institutional neglect and decent investment in minority communities, low quality housing, high crime problems with policing.

560
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:12,660
We just saw yet another example of water quality in Jackson, Mississippi, after we, of course, have Flint in Michigan, that there's just,

561
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:22,420
just a disinvestment, not maintaining infrastructure and things that are critical for health and well-being and reduced access to health care.

562
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:31,219
Some of the things that aren't included in here but that also matter are things

563
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,920
related to political participation and representation like voter suppression,

564
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:42,290
gerrymandering, reducing political power of certain groups within criminal justice,

565
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:47,450
police surveillance and violence, which of course, have gained more attention lately.

566
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:58,970
Mass incarceration and then around the environment, environmental racism and the siting of hazardous waste facilities near certain communities.

567
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:05,840
All right. Another mechanism is interpersonal discrimination.

568
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:29,000
So what are some examples of interpersonal discrimination? Like, How would you measure this?

569
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:37,230
You were doing a study and you wanted to know how much discrimination people, interpersonal discrimination people had been exposed to.

570
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:41,700
What would you ask them? Yeah.

571
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:18,600
I'm not sure. So there could be worse scenarios that you around stigma about race.

572
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:22,670
Yeah that gives you one way to measure.

573
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:31,710
I don't know what I would call that interpersonal discrimination, but race related technology can certainly have negative impacts on the whole.

574
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:43,960
Yes. There. Yeah.

575
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:53,280
Yeah. So I.

576
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:07,370
Yeah. So maybe someone called you a racial slur or someone you got passed over for a job or a promotion or something like that?

577
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:17,060
Yeah, absolutely. So there's. So David Williams developed an everyday discrimination scale that says, I'll tell you what the items are.

578
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:26,090
So they ask people how often in your day to day experiences are you treated with less courtesy than others?

579
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,970
Are you treated with less respect than others? How often do you receive poorer service than others?

580
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:38,990
How often do people act? If you're act as if you're not smart, how often do people act as if they're afraid of you?

581
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:45,380
How often do people act as if you're dishonest? How often do people act as if they're better than you?

582
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:49,580
How often do you get called names? How often are you threatened or harassed?

583
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:57,740
And the the discrimination scale doesn't really assess timing.

584
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:05,120
It doesn't assess duration. It doesn't assess how stressful people people perceive this.

585
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:11,870
It does there is a version of it that has attribution for the discrimination, because these questions are just asked in general,

586
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:20,719
not necessarily about race, but then there are do you attribute this unfair treatment to your race or to your gender or to your weight?

587
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:27,260
There's different questions that are asked about why you experience this unfair treatment.

588
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:35,479
So that's the main way that people in epidemiology have studied exposure to interpersonal discrimination.

589
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:39,860
But like you said, yeah, it's based on like actions that people perceive.

590
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:46,620
Are there any limitations to this measure that you can become?

591
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:53,700
Yeah. You. Yeah.

592
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:08,910
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:12,530
So it's not capturing everything. It's subjective.

594
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:17,299
You may not have a person, but you may have been exposed to interpersonal discrimination.

595
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,940
But. I know it's not been reported, but it could have had an impact.

596
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:26,790
Yeah. Yeah.

597
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:33,960
Also. Yeah.

598
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:41,219
Yeah. You know, that's a really good point. But social class interacts here, too.

599
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:48,060
And sometimes people may experience one of these things but not know what to attribute it to that, you know,

600
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:53,639
maybe it was racial discrimination that they perceive that it was about their gender or something like that.

601
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,040
And so there's like there's some challenges with measurement.

602
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:01,049
I think some of the study designs that are most effective,

603
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:06,720
I've seen kind of being able to identify the extent to which racial discrimination is happening.

604
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:12,360
Are these kind of audit studies but where you.

605
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:18,540
Or resume studies. So they've done these studies where they send resumes that are exactly the same,

606
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:23,189
but they change the name and they have like a white sounding name and a black sounding name,

607
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:29,970
and they send them out to the same employers to see how many like interviews, interview requests they get.

608
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:35,579
And those types of studies have been able to show clear like discrimination in that way.

609
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:43,590
And that's one reason why some organizations have moved toward taking names off of resume for that very reason.

610
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:52,379
There's also, you know, studies where they send actors to go try to rent apartments and are able to see where there's discrimination in housing.

611
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:59,280
So like that kind of study design avoids the problems with white people having to report

612
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:04,560
discrimination because you're not always sure that you're being discriminated against.

613
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,080
And so we have to kind of use these other study designs to understand it, which are not health related studies,

614
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,100
but they help us understand the extent to which discrimination is still happening.

615
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:22,230
Um, so perceived racial discrimination, there's a big literature on perceived racial discrimination and how that impacts health.

616
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:30,750
Um, and so perceived discrimination is related to a broad range of health outcomes, including sleep quality adiposity,

617
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:37,920
coronary artery, calcium, so like cardiovascular health, lower use of health care services and increased substance use.

618
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:48,790
So then we also talked a little bit about internalized racism as another mechanism.

619
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:52,930
And so this is where I think stigma comes in common.

620
01:18:53,260 --> 01:19:00,910
So acceptance by members of a stigmatized racial group of negative messages about their own abilities and intrinsic worth.

621
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:06,670
So if you've read Camara Jones as a paper on the gardener's tale, you can tell you read that one.

622
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:13,780
So she talks a lot about internalized racism and says that that can manifest as things like embracing of whiteness,

623
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:23,800
self devaluation and resignation, hopelessness and hopelessness, and that these obviously negatively impact how.

624
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,670
All right. What about genetics?

625
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:48,900
So very often, racial and ethnic disparities that persist after adjustment for socioeconomic status are attributed to genetic differences.

626
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:58,680
You will see this in papers all the time that if they weren't able to explain the group differences, they'll say, Well, it's probably due to genetics.

627
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:10,430
But one problem with this explanation is that genetic effects on many health outcomes are extremely small,

628
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:14,450
and racial and ethnic disparities in health are extremely large.

629
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:23,360
So it seems very unlikely that this would explain a major portion of what we see in racial and ethnic disparities.

630
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:29,890
For example, in not to harp on it too much, but in the telomere literature,

631
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:34,270
what we do know about the genetic variants or the snips that are associated with telomere length,

632
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:42,400
at least in European ancestry populations, is that it explains less than 2% of the variation in telomere length.

633
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:53,350
So and most genetic risk scores explain very little when it comes to chronic disease and complex diseases.

634
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:06,350
So Williams argues that epigenetic research may be more useful because this is really about gene expression, which is sensitive to the environment.

635
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,980
I'm doing some epigenetic research right now and you run into the same thing

636
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:20,030
that like epigenetic processes are also to some extent under genetic control.

637
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:27,260
And so you get the same thing with reviewers saying if you're going to look at racism, exposure,

638
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:34,820
epigenetics is a mediator, and then some, you know, health outcome, you have to adjust for genetic ancestry.

639
01:21:36,110 --> 01:21:39,980
And usually the way people do that is through genetic principle components.

640
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:45,140
And the problem is that in the US.

641
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:51,430
Because of our history of migration patterns and all that kind of stuff.

642
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:59,020
Those those genetic principle components are super highly correlated with self-reported race.

643
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:05,320
And so they're really not actually capturing.

644
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:12,790
Meaningfully different, but nothing's for it to make any sense to control for that.

645
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:17,290
So it's just it's a really difficult problem, even in epigenetic research.

646
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:22,960
And then the last mechanism I wanted to mention was health care.

647
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:29,560
So we know that there are really large racial and ethnic disparities in quality and intensity of care,

648
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:38,920
and that's even holding constant health insurance, socioeconomic status, stage and severity of disease, co-morbidity and type of medical facility.

649
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:45,340
So we know that there's also discrimination within the health care setting that impacts health outcomes.

650
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:53,650
And this probably contributes more to disparities in the course of disease.

651
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:59,440
So how well you do once you've been diagnosed with the disease versus disparities in incidence,

652
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:05,349
and that's just a matter of how much is health care important for incidence versus course of disease.

653
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:17,400
And we've talked about that before. So those are some some kind of mediators or mechanisms.

654
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:25,080
You can also think about a moderator or effect modifier and that's neat tivity.

655
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:32,670
So in general, immigrants have better health than their U.S. born peers, and that's true in all racial and ethnic groups.

656
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:42,380
And so if you're looking at the association between race and a health outcome,

657
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:50,180
you also may need to take into account differences in determining, particularly for groups that have a lot of immigrants.

658
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:57,000
Right. Like it wouldn't make any sense to look at that in the white population since it's 96% U.S. born.

659
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:06,340
But then the Hispanic population or the Asian population, for example, like there's a significant portion of population that was not U.S. born.

660
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:13,100
And so looking at this as a moderator can be really important in this kind of gets back to James Jackson's work,

661
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,620
where he was interested in this and understanding this.

662
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:25,010
We do know from this kind of research that the health of immigrants declines with increasing length of residence,

663
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:29,389
which is always difficult to tease apart from age. Right.

664
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:37,940
Because the longer you're here, the older you are. And so it's really difficult to tease apart the effects of duration of residence from age.

665
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:46,100
But we also see it with generational status. So for a lot of groups, the second generation is less healthy than the first generation.

666
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:52,880
And by the third generation, a lot of times there's no more observable difference.

667
01:24:56,990 --> 01:25:01,069
The paper talks about the paper that you read, talks about the Hispanic paradox.

668
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:10,670
So there was a lot of research on this in the past. And the sort of the paradox is that despite having low socioeconomic status,

669
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:18,260
Mexican-Americans tend to have health outcomes that are more similar to whites than to African-Americans.

670
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:23,089
And so people have tried to understand that and the extent to which that's

671
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:29,540
explained by differences in nativity and immigration status versus other factors.

672
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:41,140
So explanations that people have done work on are things like selective migration.

673
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:48,850
So immigrants tend to be healthier than non-immigrants within the country of origin,

674
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:59,470
because if you think about it, moving to another country and some of you have done that is very difficult.

675
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:08,080
Right. Like you need to probably have a high level of resources, including like good health status in order to do that.

676
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:16,360
And so you tend to get people who are healthier than other people in the country that they're coming from.

677
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:25,550
So that's a piece of it. Then there's other things.

678
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,260
A lot of work has attributed to differences in cultural factors.

679
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:39,780
Like having more and more social support.

680
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:44,490
Differences in diet and other things that might contribute.

681
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:58,290
And then I just have a note here. I don't think I have to say this, but I will anyway, so that immigrants are also not a monolithic group.

682
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:05,040
Right. And so the effect of negativity depends on the particular group that you're examining.

683
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:12,899
So as one example, there were kind of two big waves of immigration from Cuba to the United States.

684
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:19,890
And so one was in the 1960s when Castro came into power, and then there was another in the 1980s.

685
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:27,389
And the people who came in the 1960s were people who were very well-to-do and were getting like,

686
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:30,090
you know, they were they were people who had a lot of resources.

687
01:27:30,090 --> 01:27:34,520
And then when the country became communist, like, it wasn't a great place for them to be anymore.

688
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:38,640
Right. And so they moved to the U.S. and this was a very high resource population.

689
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:44,010
And then in the 1980s, the Cuban immigrants were very, very poor who came.

690
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:49,230
And so those would be very different experiences from the same country.

691
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:55,380
And then you can also think about differences between like if you're if you're thinking about the Hispanic population,

692
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:58,860
people coming from Cuba versus from Mexico. Right.

693
01:27:58,890 --> 01:28:05,610
Like these would be very different experiences. And so if you're mixing all this up together, you're probably missing some stuff.

694
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:20,780
Okay. So the last thing I want to talk about is a little bit of the idea from the Duster article about the reification of race.

695
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:25,010
And so what was he talking about? What is reification?

696
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:57,810
Yeah, but she said it. Strike. Yeah, I think that's a good way to put it.

697
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:07,330
Right. So it's this idea that like we take the social construction and we kind of make it

698
01:29:07,330 --> 01:29:12,040
into a thing that seems to have an objective reality when when maybe it doesn't.

699
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:20,800
And so we kind of by talking about it, by measuring it, by studying it, we make it real.

700
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:31,540
And so how do you think that our research on racial and ethnic health disparities redefines race?

701
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:47,770
Yeah. It's just. Yeah.

702
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:54,410
I mean, we're like we're treating these as objective categories right in our analysis,

703
01:29:55,130 --> 01:30:02,120
just like we would with something like level of income, which is an objective thing that we can measure.

704
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:09,390
And so the more we do that, the more it reinforces the idea that these are like true objective entities.

705
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:17,479
So then. The question,

706
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:25,850
and I think this gets us all the way back to the beginning of class with the poem is Should we examine health outcomes by race and ethnicity?

707
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:50,160
Or should we stop doing it? Hey, are you thinking?

708
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:25,450
Let me. Otherwise.

709
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:44,960
Yeah. Like the dust. Your paper talks about this, right? Like, instead of having an ethnic drug, instead of saying this drug is for black people.

710
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:55,480
Right. If there is some genetic variant that affects how that drug works and it's more common in the black population than the white population,

711
01:31:55,490 --> 01:32:01,340
you shouldn't assume that like self-reported race is marking that genetic risk.

712
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:06,919
That's important. You should measure the genetic risk and you should target the drug people who

713
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:12,620
have the genetic factor that modifies the way that drug influences their.

714
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:16,050
What was vital for blood pressure? I like that.

715
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:27,240
Right. So it's saying, like, if what you're interested in is something biological that don't use self-reported race, that doesn't make sense.

716
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:34,840
But maybe it's okay if what you're interested in is understanding like.

717
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:39,760
The impacts of. A racially stratified society.

718
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:47,110
On how? Other thoughts on that.

719
01:32:50,760 --> 01:33:09,580
Yes, it. If.

720
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:23,980
The product. Yeah.

721
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:42,830
Yeah. Logical.

722
01:33:55,570 --> 01:34:07,300
Yeah. Some of it is about rehabilitation, a result which obviously gets missed and figures and charts and graphs and things, right?

723
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:17,290
Yeah, we do. Yeah.

724
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:26,350
So. Instead of.

725
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:32,890
Linked to the founding of the foundation and finding their way through this process time and time again.

726
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:48,040
Definitely. He uses this information to address rather than just constantly.

727
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:52,000
Describing. The problem is, you know.

728
01:34:54,540 --> 01:35:26,119
I. Yeah.

729
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:31,430
So some of it, you know, in terms of determining whether the work is.

730
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:39,180
I think good or bad is what's really changing the way that.

731
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:50,090
If this is something that you're going to study carefully about what it is and and how you're using.

732
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:58,760
And it's a 0.800%. And it was a point thinking about what is the next step for that?

733
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:09,980
For those of you who are epidemiology students, how do you feel about this idea of moving beyond description or explanation toward action?

734
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:13,640
Do you feel like you know how to do that?

735
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:18,410
That you want to do that? Yeah.

736
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:38,410
Not. So it's really like deconstructing those monster.

737
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:47,350
Structural. The neighborhoods that. Things like that.

738
01:36:54,310 --> 01:37:03,790
Very. That's hard to.

739
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:09,360
Yeah. So thinking about in your work, trying to identify things that like.

740
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:19,980
That are. Mechanisms are things that can be potentially to improve health outcomes rather than just stopping ads like these charts show.

741
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:23,440
Raise. Hypertension. Why? What?

742
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:37,900
What? And then partnering with people whose work focuses on intervention.

743
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:44,809
To do that. Anybody else? Epidemiologists.

744
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:52,129
You want to do intervention or I'm curious if you feel like you're prepared to do that kind of

745
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:58,680
work to take to move what you do beyond description or explanation to intervention or action.

746
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:03,060
I see some those? Not yet.

747
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,850
Do you want that or do you want to see one?

748
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:14,640
Yes, I want that. Or do you feel like the way to do that is to partner?

749
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:21,190
You know, you work with Mikayla to do it because that's what she's trained on and that's her expertize.

750
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:26,180
I think we should down. Uh huh.

751
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:33,080
I have something for you. Mm hmm.

752
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:41,990
I great organizer. I'm not great at like. And people think that what you're saying.

753
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:46,420
I'm going to use that. Well, okay. In medical school. No, I know.

754
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:53,210
I know. Like I. I much prefer being a researcher, and I think that that is like that is like a career that people are allowed to have.

755
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,530
But I think that it needs to be much less of an ivory tower.

756
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:03,080
And to this point, as has been said, someone said, like, what does that actually mean?

757
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:10,490
Yeah, I think that's the thing. Yeah. And so I think it's like research is.

758
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:17,000
Knowledge and research should be directed by.

759
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:30,489
Yeah. I mean, I think you're right that there's kind of a general understanding among many that this is important and something to move toward,

760
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:35,050
but not always a good understanding of how to do that,

761
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:46,270
particularly given the constraints within academia in terms of how people are rewarded, how they're promoted, what gets valued.

762
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:56,319
So that can be really tricky. Like we have no way or a very limited way in like the mirror review process for faculty to talk

763
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:02,410
about the work that they're doing that's practice oriented or that involves community partners.

764
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:07,270
So like when I'm going through and figuring out who gets a raise, right?

765
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:14,050
Like I'm looking at number of publications, dollars of grants, that kind of thing, right?

766
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:24,340
It's nowhere in the criteria for promotion or for phrases that you're in, that you're engaged with communities.

767
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,520
And so that could change, right?

768
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:37,150
But that would be a big shift for academia and would require a change at much higher levels than a department or a school or even an institution.

769
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:43,430
Yeah. Sarah. Yeah.

770
01:40:55,550 --> 01:41:05,590
I think that. I think. Those discussions are.

771
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:19,950
Yeah. I mean, I think the difficult thing is, though, that even if I could so I could do it in the mirror review process.

772
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:26,210
But our reasons are real small, so it wouldn't really matter that much materially for someone.

773
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:34,460
But I also do that process with the Dean's office. So if the Dean's office doesn't value it, then our scores have to align.

774
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:39,530
So we get together. I have my scores, they have their scores.

775
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:45,799
And then if we're we have to meet somewhere in the middle or whatever, we have to argue about why I gave it a higher score.

776
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:54,740
You gave it a higher score. All right. But then for promotion, which is the really big one, right, then it depends on external reviewers.

777
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:57,170
So people outside the university.

778
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:07,430
And so if people outside our university don't value this kind of work and they see someone who has lower productivity, research productivity,

779
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:11,840
because they spent a lot of time doing community engagement work, which is time intensive,

780
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:16,880
then they may say, no, this person can't be promoted, they don't have a strong enough publication record.

781
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:25,939
And so you can have people that move through the assistant rate but never move to the associate rate and therefore like leave the academy.

782
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:33,229
And so then if that's what you're doing is just burning out junior faculty, then that's not really what you want to do either.

783
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:40,940
So it's a it's a really hard problem that I don't think has a super easy solution.

784
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:43,250
I mean, I think the thing that would fix that. Oh, yeah. Such a.

785
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:53,360
Oh, I was just going to say one thing that could help is if NIH funded this kind of work.

786
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:59,840
Right. Because then it comes along with dollars and we like dollars at the university.

787
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:01,879
And so that's one way.

788
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:11,990
But it will still always lead for almost always result in reduced quantity of publications because of the time that it takes to do that kind of work.

789
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:17,830
What was your question? I and that's kind of what you are.

790
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:24,320
Right. Like being in a park with guys like.

791
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:31,510
I don't know. Yeah. Even if I could do it for, like, an hour, I think.

792
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:43,370
You got not enough. It's got it has to be bigger than that because of the way the promotion process works.

793
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:49,520
But it has to be bigger than that. And so that, I think, is what some of this struggle is.

794
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:56,990
How do you how do you change that? But I do think another another place of pressure that can help.

795
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:04,729
And sometimes you probably feel like you have no power, but actually, like students have a lot of power, right?

796
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:10,250
Because just like the university seeks grant dollars, they seek tuition dollars, too,

797
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,790
because actually tuition is a bigger part of our budget than grownups, believe it or not.

798
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:22,130
And so if students want training in this kind of area and they're selecting programs based on that,

799
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:27,230
then it's going to push it's going to push things in that direction, at least around education.

800
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:32,030
And then there's also see the accrediting body. Right. So see this?

801
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:35,810
Pushing us for MPH is more toward application.

802
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:44,480
And so they're working right now on a huge revision of the core curriculum for the MPH program that's moving to a team based way,

803
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:49,640
cross-disciplinary teams of students working on application.

804
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:54,770
And so I think that it can also come from like from that place, too.

805
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:58,100
So it can come from like bottom up as well as top down.

806
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,770
But I do think there's some momentum around.

807
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:08,060
I just think it will take a while because these other systems are so entrenched that it will be hard to like make a big.

808
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:14,530
All right. Let's take a break. And then when we come back, we're going to watch a documentary.

809
01:45:14,530 --> 01:45:21,970
I think it's an hour long. So take a really quick break because I talked too much about I'm sorry.

810
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:37,610
Yeah, I suppose.

811
01:45:38,430 --> 01:46:00,050
Okay. Going be because I was like, oh my god, maybe people were gonna die and I didn't want to spend forever reading paper.

812
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:03,440
Oh. Oh. Okay. Yes.

813
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:39,780
Okay. Oh, that's that's da da da da da da da.

814
01:46:39,900 --> 01:47:01,370
Can you see the screen? Okay. You know, that's how.

815
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:14,460
To. So you.

816
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:24,050
And. Because.

817
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:30,520
I think. The.

818
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:55,550
I have a lot of. Think.

819
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:07,490
Oh. Follow me.

820
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:15,400
Thank you. Okay.

821
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:25,900
Okay. What's. Well, there's a.

822
01:50:27,030 --> 02:43:47,080
The they. Hey, we only got about 5 minutes left, but I wanted to.

823
02:43:48,850 --> 02:43:52,960
If anybody had comments or her thoughts on what we just watched.

824
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:02,530
Yeah. Patricia. Aggravating to listen to the mayor.

825
02:44:12,100 --> 02:44:15,220
Yeah. It seems like the mayor was an actor, but I think he was actually.

826
02:44:16,510 --> 02:44:26,080
I mean, he's so ridiculous, but. Yeah. Yeah.

827
02:44:29,240 --> 02:44:46,530
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's.

828
02:44:46,650 --> 02:44:57,650
There's sadness, but I feel like there's also hope. These are the people were able to make changes through collective action.

829
02:44:57,950 --> 02:45:03,540
And I feel like that's helpful. Waiting were.

830
02:45:07,390 --> 02:45:20,160
How? Don't know.

831
02:45:20,250 --> 02:45:24,350
I guess there is hope, but I was. Was.

832
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:40,810
Yeah. Clearly, he sacrificed a tremendous amount personally to help his fine.

833
02:45:48,990 --> 02:45:53,750
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. To ask him to. Yeah.

834
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:58,760
And I think, too, about his students who don't have him anymore to write this.

835
02:45:59,070 --> 02:46:04,130
They love to write. And he was a great teacher. And so they don't have him now.

836
02:46:04,340 --> 02:46:36,050
Yes, they're. I felt like he was.

837
02:46:38,230 --> 02:46:41,560
Felt very much like one we like. Yeah, I think maybe.

838
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:46,260
I know. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Everybody is complex, but I think that.

839
02:46:49,510 --> 02:46:54,190
You have to have an example of something in common, which is health systems don't just act on.

840
02:46:56,260 --> 02:47:01,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I don't know if we really saw Systemic.

841
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:18,150
Yeah. They have to protect the right. And that also, of course, highlighted the need for an actual systemic.

842
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:27,230
Structural. It does happen not just here in Baltimore.

843
02:47:28,550 --> 02:47:33,050
Yeah, and it's such a great example, too, which I hadn't realized when I watched it before.

844
02:47:33,050 --> 02:47:38,209
But interest convergence, that idea, if you're learning about critical race theory and any other classes,

845
02:47:38,210 --> 02:47:42,530
this idea that in order to get that action to happen,

846
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:50,900
these changes to happen, they had to align with like powerful groups that were dominated by white people.

847
02:47:51,470 --> 02:47:55,879
But you saw it with like the environmental lobby and the Audubon Society and stuff, right.

848
02:47:55,880 --> 02:48:04,400
So the because he actually says in there, like, we finally got people to realize that saving this place benefits them too.

849
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:10,910
And that's this whole idea of interest convergence and that like without that happening,

850
02:48:11,270 --> 02:48:19,219
then it's hard to like it's hard to enact change when you're a minority and have less power in society.

851
02:48:19,220 --> 02:48:31,340
And so, yeah, you see how like he had that community had to sort of find more powerful allies in order to like help and the changes that they wanted.

852
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:39,740
So yeah, I think this documentary portrays like a lot of like you were saying, Sarah,

853
02:48:39,740 --> 02:48:47,150
like a lot of ideas about how these health systems of oppression are interconnected and make it hard to change.

854
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:58,520
Have a good weekend. Don't forget, your annotated bibliography is due on Friday.
