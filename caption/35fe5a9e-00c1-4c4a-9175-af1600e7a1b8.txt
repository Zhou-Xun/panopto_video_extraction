1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,600
All right. So we're going to kind of push off the reporting guidelines,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,620
but we will cover those final six slides from the cohort lecture, probably at the end of case control studies.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,520
All right. So our lecture overview, which we always start off with, right, we're going to go we're going to do an overview.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,440
We will talk about the three principles, the study base principle,

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,089
the beacon founding principle, and the comparable but comparable accuracy principle.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,640
So these are really the three principles for selecting our controls.

7
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:40,590
Talk about selection of cases. We're going to talk about selection of controls, and then we'll go over the different designs for case control studies.

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,970
So the cumulative case control, the density case control, the case cohort study and a case crossover study.

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,680
So for case control studies, you're going to compare cases.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,770
Those are disease individuals and controls.

11
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,110
They're usually non disease individuals, but sometimes you're looking at a really bad outcome from a particular disease, right.

12
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,280
So you could actually have controls that are people even with the same disease sometimes like,

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,390
you know, fatal cases of some disease compared to non-fatal cases,

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,680
for example, kind of like given you're infected and get this disease, what what causes, you know, more severe outcomes.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,930
So in a case control study, we always know the outcome.

16
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,410
We're always selecting based upon the outcome.

17
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,250
And then we're going to be assessing exposure. Right.

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,669
So the types of case control studies greater your cumulative case control study a density case control study.

19
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,510
When we talk about those, it's really it's usually done as a nested case control study.

20
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:48,500
So it's nested inside of an ongoing cohort study, case cohort studies and then case crossover studies.

21
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,170
So here we have a diagram of a basic case control study.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,370
And so we've got our controls right, right up here and our cases.

23
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,949
So give us hypothetical cohort that your cases and your controls are coming from.

24
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,790
Right? But we're not doing this study at the time in this particular one.

25
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,010
This is a cumulative case control study. Right. We're not doing it actually at the time that the pieces are emerging.

26
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,580
Right. We're doing it this kind of this end point in time right here.

27
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,560
Is that when people think of case control studies, this is the design people tend to think of.

28
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:36,819
I will say, although these are not done in school, done a lot of genetic happy actually, but like in a lot of settings,

29
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:43,930
we don't do this particular case control design anymore because there are some issues with it which we'll go into.

30
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,180
So our basic analytic approach in a case control study is we're going to compare the

31
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:56,200
exposure odds in disease individuals to the exposure odds in non disease individuals.

32
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:07,089
And we're going to calculate an odds ratio. Remember, and, and we went over before why the exposure odds ratio is equal to the disease odds ratio.

33
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,170
Right. We really want to get at that disease odds ratio. But for a case control study, we're actually calculating an exposure odds ratio.

34
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:26,400
And this is just, you know, that formula E times T over B times C that we'll use for the exposure odds ratio.

35
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,890
So why can't you calculate incidents in many case control study designs?

36
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,470
So the proportion of cases to controls is usually a feature of the design.

37
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,540
That means you can decide how many cases compared to controls you're going to have.

38
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,440
So if the exposure is related to the disease,

39
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,899
then the proportion of the exposed and not exposed in relation to disease for non

40
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,930
disease is really a feature of the design and therefore provides no useful information.

41
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,870
So what do I mean by that? Let's go back and look at our smoking in lung cancer example that we used before.

42
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,800
Right. You could all quickly calculate the odds ratio from this.

43
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:44,149
I'm sure. 9.1.

44
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,510
Yes. So and you've seen this before. Right.

45
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,200
1350 times. 61 over 12. 96 times seven.

46
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,380
All right. Now, you can also calculate the relative risk here, right?

47
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,649
You shouldn't. But like, in theory, you can.

48
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:07,280
And so I've gone ahead and calculated it here for you out of the other, the risk ratio out of this design.

49
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,320
Okay. So everybody see that? All right.

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:23,290
So what about if instead we enroll two controls per case, we're going to assume the same proportion of controls are exposed.

51
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,939
So we're just doubling these numbers right before we have like 61 there.

52
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,380
That's easy to double rate. We get one 122. Can you calculate the odds ratio again?

53
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,660
And we actually calculate the risk ratio as well.

54
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,319
All right. So the odds ratio, right?

55
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:45,400
If you calculate that we get the same thing, right, we still get 9.1, even though we've decided to involve twice as many controls.

56
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,350
Right. But when we calculate the risk ratio, we get 6.3, right?

57
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,460
So before we had 5.0. Now the risk ratio is is 6.3.

58
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,920
Now, let's say we go the opposite direction, right? We choose one control for every two cases.

59
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,290
So now we're just obviously you wouldn't really have half a person here, but we're going to do that, right?

60
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,900
We're splitting in half. Go ahead, calculate the odds ratio again and calculate the risk ratio.

61
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,780
All righty. So we do that again. You should get an odds ratio of 9.1.

62
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,090
We're all starting to feel good. The odds ratios not changing regardless of how we change the design right here.

63
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,040
But the risk ratio is now 3.6.

64
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,360
Right. So that's because our exposure is related to our outcome of interest if you're in.

65
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:22,930
Therefore, you would be kind of controlling both. Right, as you increase the numbers a little bit, at least in the risk ratio,

66
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:36,009
so that the proportion of people in the study that are that are exposed to disease or not exposed to non disease does really related to your design.

67
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:44,169
Right. So we can't calculate a risk ratio here. All right. So I don't want to see any risk ratios like that from from a case control studies.

68
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:49,510
Right. We're always going to calculate the odds ratio. Even though we know there are some limitations of the odds ratio.

69
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,540
Right. Which we discussed earlier in the course. All right.

70
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,230
So situations where a case control study is going to be the best choice is when the outcome of interest is rare.

71
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:06,160
Right. And that's because you would have to have an incredibly large rate of cohort study,

72
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:14,050
for example, which may not be feasible to do when measuring the exposure is really expensive.

73
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,079
You can minimize costs by only assessing exposure in a subset of a cohort, for example.

74
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:28,600
And that's where you often see like a nested case control study, or you might see a case cohort study depending on a number of factors.

75
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,150
The other situation, which this was a more recent, so if you've done a lot of this before, you might not have been on.

76
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:37,389
There is when you need an answer really quickly.

77
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:44,799
A case control study may be the best option. So that would be things like foodborne outbreaks, right?

78
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,680
You'll always do a case control study or you usually do a case control study and then early studies of new diseases.

79
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:50,889
Right.

80
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:57,950
If you think back to Zika, for those of you that were paying attention at that time, all of the first studies that came out were case control studies.

81
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:08,020
A lot of the early source could be two studies where they were either case control or they were what are called case ascertained designs,

82
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,620
which we'll go over in the infectious disease lecture, which is kind of a neither here nor there design in a way,

83
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,430
although I'm always arguing with people about what their design is like. I just reviewed a paper or I was like, That's not a cohort study.

84
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,850
The reason it's not a cohort study is you're enrolling some people based off of exposure in some people based off of their outcome.

85
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,570
Could you take an index case because that's your enrolling based off of their outcome.

86
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:38,799
They've already got SARS-CoV-2, right? And then you enroll the people around them, which is based off of this kind of hypothetical.

87
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
They're going to be exposed. So that's a very specific study design that's used in infectious diseases.

88
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,430
And we'll go over it later. All right.

89
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,850
But for SARS-CoV-2, right, it was a pretty much all case control studies.

90
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:59,349
And then those case ascertained designs looking at transmission, usually a lot of times in household settings,

91
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,280
but in other kind of restricted settings where people had a lot of contact.

92
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,030
All right. So our three principles in case control designs.

93
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,880
We've got the study base principle, the Deakin founding principle and the comparable accuracy principle.

94
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:24,250
I will say if you only read a few papers in this course, I would read some of these classic papers on these principles.

95
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,000
I think they're pretty easy to read will really expand your understanding of case control studies.

96
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:39,490
All right. So the study based principle is the set of individuals or population time in which deceased

97
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:48,640
subjects become cases and members of a hypothetical cohort underlying a or underlying cohort.

98
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,810
So you can think, here's our body of people. Right.

99
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:59,650
These are the individuals who become cases so that the people inside of that cohort are the ones who should be the controls.

100
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,430
So here's the kind of study base right here.

101
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:12,070
You got this initial cohort and then you have people, some of these people who are developing the disease, other people are leaving for other reasons.

102
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,930
Right. But it's this kind of time interval here. Right, that we're trying to get at.

103
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:26,230
So the study based principle is basically that the controls need to be sampled from the same study base in which the cases arose.

104
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,310
They're going to serve as a proxy for the entire study based.

105
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,130
We're not going to be measuring everybody. Right. Just a subset.

106
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,980
And they should be representative of the study base in relation to the exposure prevalence.

107
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,200
And they absolutely must be sampled independently of exposure.

108
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,180
Right. Because if you're selecting on outcome already as a control, right.

109
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,570
They don't have your outcome, then you select on exposure. You're actually controlling the relationship between outcome and exposure.

110
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:05,170
All right. So a types of study base. We've got primary study base and secondary study basis.

111
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:13,030
So for primary study base, it's a defined population in space and time.

112
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,460
In concept, the study base is determined first.

113
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,510
You know, so you might say Ann Arbor and, you know, 20, 22 or something.

114
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,750
It's assumed that all cases in the population during that time are identifiable.

115
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,610
This is a big challenge. So a study base like a primary study base,

116
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:41,530
is not really possible for a disease with really mild symptoms or where some presentations may be very mild.

117
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,820
And that's because it would be difficult to identify all of your cases. Right.

118
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,760
Cases would be identified based on their seeking medical care.

119
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,000
Right. And so yeah.

120
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,040
So so they're not really a primary study base.

121
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,570
All right. So controls are going to be selected from a defined population and a primary study base.

122
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,160
An example of that is a case control study of all persons in the Health Alliance plan

123
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,940
in Detroit metro area that develop acute lymphoid leukemia between 2014 and 2016.

124
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,270
All right. So that's that's a pretty severe disease.

125
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,990
You know, we feel pretty good that will identify all the cases, at least all those that become clinical within that time period.

126
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,980
And we've said who they are. Right?

127
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:45,560
We've got this list of people we can certainly verify who's in the Health Alliance plan, who lives in the Detroit metro area during that time period.

128
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,200
So that would be a primary study base. So.

129
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,060
So I said there's certain circumstances where you can't get a primary study base.

130
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,000
One is if it's really mild, right, because then you'll only identify the cases who are seeking care.

131
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,380
Another is seeking medical care. Usually another situation of that is like male infertility.

132
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:25,520
Right? And, uh, and that's because only men seeking to have kids will, like, come in for as a potential as a case of male infertility.

133
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,630
Right. So. Right secondary study based.

134
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,960
The study based on or study base or population at risk is defined by the cases.

135
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,690
So here you're going to define your cases first and then you're going to try to identify your study bases based off of those cases.

136
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,830
It's not going to be clear as clearly defined in time and space.

137
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,950
And this is used in particular when all the cases cannot be identified.

138
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,910
And controls are those who would, while you hope and wish, who would have been identified as cases if they developed the disease.

139
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:12,560
An example would be all cases of glioblastoma at U of M Hospital in 2014 to 2016.

140
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:20,320
So why wouldn't this be a primary study based? Why wouldn't you use a primary study base for this?

141
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,390
Because people seek care for a glioblastoma.

142
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,860
Are you really going to be from all different geographical areas?

143
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,220
Yeah. They're going to be from all over. Right. Because it's a tertiary hospital.

144
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,989
And so you're you can't just say like, oh, you know, okay, these are my cases.

145
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,520
My controls are going to be people who don't have glioblastoma, who live in Ann Arbor.

146
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,750
Right. Because they're not necessarily going to be representative of your cases in relation to the exposures of interest rate,

147
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,870
sorry, of the underlying population from which their cases came in relation to the exposures of interest.

148
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,190
All right. So primary or secondary study base.

149
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:07,380
Ann Arbor, Michigan, 2016. It'll be a primary study based.

150
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:19,730
You know, identifying your study bases is is can be quite tricky, you know, particularly for a secondary study base.

151
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,970
We'll talk about that a little bit. So challenges in both primary and secondary study bases.

152
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,580
The controls need to be selected in such a way that they accurately represent estimate the

153
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,500
distribution of exposure in the study base rate in the group from which the cases emerged.

154
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,200
So in a primary study base,

155
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:50,220
your your main challenge or what a major challenge is going to be really identification of all the cases in a secondary study base.

156
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,050
The major challenges identifying what your study bases.

157
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:05,270
So there's really a tradeoff write in primary it's easy to identify the controls but cases can be a real can be a real challenge.

158
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,050
And then in a secondary study base, it's easy to identify a case.

159
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,120
But identifying who the proper control set is going to be a big challenge or can be a big challenge.

160
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,320
A study based first quarter of last year.

161
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,750
Mm hmm. If, let's say I said, okay, you got to have a primary care physician.

162
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,090
Michigan medicine, then would you say I do primary surveys?

163
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,410
Yeah, because if you can identify which actually I know you can,

164
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,650
because I was just doing that for my I was just trying to figure out who has a primary care physician in the U of M system.

165
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,790
Then you get a list of everybody that has a primary, that has a primary care provider,

166
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:54,920
and you have an system where if you have any other restriction criteria for your cases, right.

167
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,600
You need to make sure you also apply it to your controls, you know, should be restricted to anything else.

168
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:08,020
Right. The issue there, though, would be how common is glioblastoma?

169
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:18,890
Right. It's not that common. And so you're going to be losing a bunch of your potential cases if you choose to go with a primary study base.

170
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,520
Yeah. So you would like to look at how many cases you would then go with.

171
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,500
How many cases will I have if I cut it back?

172
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:34,420
And then you would, like, try to figure out if you if you possibly had the power to do that or if you needed to move to a secondary study base.

173
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,120
But you would probably need to move to separate SATs.

174
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,350
But that's a great example. All right. Okay.

175
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,620
Right. So the study base doesn't have to be representative of the general population.

176
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,709
That is definitely something that kind of trips people up. Right.

177
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,240
Because your cases will not be representative of the entire or come from the general population.

178
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,700
There may be groups in the general population that you're just not going to identify as a case even if they develop a disease.

179
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:15,040
Right. So really, your study base or those people who would be identified as a case, should they have developed the disease?

180
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:24,880
So it's fine to have exclusion criteria. Criteria do need to be applied equally to cases and controls.

181
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,120
That's going to by putting in exclusion criteria, you're going to restrict the study base.

182
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,630
Unequal exclusion criteria is a violation of the study based principle.

183
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,000
You see it all the time, though, right, where people are like, well, there weren't that many cases,

184
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,739
so we just took any case at of M Hospital, but it was really hard to try to get controls from outside the area.

185
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,950
The cases were already coming to us at the hospital.

186
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,470
Right. So we just did, you know, people who lived in the local area as controls.

187
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,249
All right. You can count. So that's principle one, right?

188
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,360
Our study base principle principle two is our Deakin founding principle.

189
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:21,090
This is not unique to case control studies. Basically, though, known potential confounders should be measured and controlled for unmatched measure.

190
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:29,220
Confounders should vary as little as possible, and one of the ways we do that is through matching or really the way we do that is through matching.

191
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,540
Right. And we'll talk about that later because we have a whole lecture on matching.

192
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:46,710
Comparable accuracy, principal accuracy of the measurements of the exposure in the cases should be the same as that in the controls.

193
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,980
The same measurement tools should be used in the cases, in the controls, and people are often tempted not to do this.

194
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,670
And then this is going to hopefully minimize or eliminate bias caused by differential errors in the measurement of cases and controls.

195
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:08,850
So one important note here is if you're reading Modern EPI, they disagree with this principle.

196
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:18,210
Basically, they think you should get the best information that you possibly can, you know, on both the cases and control.

197
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:31,230
So like the most accurate information. And that's because they think that that kind of non differential misclassification

198
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,450
will not necessarily bias towards the all which which is actually true.

199
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:47,470
So talk about that a little bit later. So for comparable accuracy, sometimes this can involve the use of proxy controls.

200
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,550
So for example, if a case cannot answer questions for themselves,

201
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:59,230
such as if they are dead or incapacitated, right, it can be appropriate to use proxy controls.

202
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,690
Once again, modern AP disagrees with this.

203
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,990
They would say that you should actually talk to the controls themselves, even if you can't interview the cases directly themselves.

204
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,090
All right. So selection of of cases.

205
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:31,239
So for selection of cases, we've got different sources where you'll get them from hospital patients, patients and physicians practices.

206
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:40,150
Clinic patients registries probably actually add out of cohort studies to right case control studies often done inside of a cohort.

207
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,190
But this is like the main place where you see four kind of more classic case control,

208
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:53,229
non nested case control studies, some potential problems for the selection of cases.

209
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:01,390
If selection is done from a single site such as a single hospital, then risk factors may be unique to that setting and not generalizable.

210
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:07,990
So of course you want to get kind of like have the biggest study. You can have multiple sites, but there is a tradeoff in cost there.

211
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,760
So an example of this like not necessarily be representative is cases from a

212
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,100
tertiary care hospital may only be representative of the most severe cases.

213
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:26,920
So any risk factors identified may be risk factors only in persons with severe disease.

214
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,680
I've seen a lot of studies like I study dengue fever in addition to my work on respiratory viruses,

215
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:41,590
a lot of studies around asthma and dengue fever and asthma being a risk factor for getting dengue fever.

216
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:49,480
But they're all pretty much hospital based studies. Right. And in fact, you're not more likely to get a fever if you have asthma.

217
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,950
Kind of really not surprising given it's transmitted by mosquitoes.

218
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,490
Right. But if you get dengue and you have asthma, you are more likely to be hospitalized,

219
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,060
because one of the things that dengue causes is is pleural leakage or leakage into your lungs.

220
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,650
Right. And and if you already have asthma and potential breathing problems,

221
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:19,030
having more fluid in your lungs is is going to be a bad thing, obviously, and thus you're more likely to get hospitalized.

222
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,310
All right. Selection of cases prevalent versus incident cases.

223
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,880
So incident cases can involve lengthy waits. You're you're waiting for those in certain cases to occur.

224
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,230
The problem, though, with prevalent cases, right,

225
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:41,920
is that the risk factors identified might relate more to survival then to the development of the disease.

226
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:52,900
And that is people who die early with the disease might have a very different exposure history.

227
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,720
So here we've got the survival bias. So once again, we're doing a cumulative case control study, right?

228
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,379
This is where we're enrolling our prevalent cases or enrolling pools.

229
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,959
At the same time, it's kind of one point in time. And what you see is we've got these arrows or cases, right.

230
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,380
But some cases don't survive for very long.

231
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,180
Right. So we're actually only rolling here for the most part in rolling cases that have much longer survival times.

232
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,580
All right. Any questions about selection of cases?

233
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:36,990
People think of selection of cases as the really easy part of a case control study, but there are certainly things that you have to think about.

234
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:44,930
So selection of controls, okay, controls must be representative of the population from which the cases arose.

235
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,319
That's our study base principle,

236
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:56,190
right can be really difficult to define the reference population to figure out who would have come to you them had they had glioblastoma.

237
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:03,660
Right outside of people whose primary care provider is somebody that you have and they're probably going to come right.

238
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:13,980
But people come from across the state, from across the region, really, the population that we have kind of forms the sampling frame.

239
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:21,360
So that is like that's the from where we want to select controls and your controls, right?

240
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,490
We already kind of went over this. That should be generally representative of the entire sampling frame.

241
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,890
So here we have our case control study.

242
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,630
Right. So we want these controls to be representative of this entire sampling frame.

243
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,350
One note is that this this actually this design violates the study based principle.

244
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:56,500
Why does this violate the study based principle? Can our controls when we're enrolling them here become cases now?

245
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:03,810
Right. Because we're actually moving them at the end point. All right.

246
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:13,740
So general rules for control selection rules one and two controls should be selected from the same population,

247
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,469
the source population that gives rise to the cases that should sound really familiar at this point.

248
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:25,890
Right. That study based principle control should be selected independently of their exposure status.

249
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,160
That is, controls should be representative of the source population with respect to exposure.

250
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:38,220
Right. We never, ever, ever want to be selecting people based on both their outcome and their exposure.

251
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
If you do that, you'll just you can actually control which direction your your association goes.

252
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,969
And for unmatched controls,

253
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:54,299
the probability of selecting any potential control subjects should be proportional to the amount of time that he or she

254
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:03,300
contributes to the denominator of the rates that would have been calculated had a cohort study of the population been conducted.

255
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:11,100
This is going to be done by selecting controls continuously over the study period,

256
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:21,060
and in particular it will be done that way when a subject's exposure status is likely to vary over time.

257
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,140
And then rule four is the time during which the subject is eligible to be a control,

258
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:35,160
should be the time in which that individual is also eligible to become a case if the disease should occur.

259
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:45,419
So for many studies, this means that somebody that already has the disease or has had the disease cannot be a control rate.

260
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,260
But somebody who develops a disease later can still be controlled.

261
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,680
Right. If they're selected at that time. All right.

262
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,890
So summary of these attributable of this sorry, of these attributes of controls,

263
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,790
we want them to be free of the outcome of interest at the time they're selected.

264
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,890
They need to be representative of the general population at risk of the outcome,

265
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:17,700
who would be identified as a case if they developed the outcome and they need to be selected independent of the exposure of interest.

266
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:26,900
All right. So some of our sources of controls, we've got popular and we'll go through these population controls.

267
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:39,080
Neighborhood controls, hospital or clinic based controls, front controls, and then that controls some population controls.

268
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,170
It can be done if cases arise from a precisely defined and identified population.

269
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:54,920
We know everybody that was in Ann Arbor Public Schools, you know, in this time period,

270
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,079
for example, or kind of any list, straight or geographic location,

271
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,280
if we can specify the location and the time controls are going to be randomly selected from

272
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:13,939
the source population when it's not possible to identify the source population explicitly.

273
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:20,569
Another method of control selection needs to be used right? If you don't have a list from which to select from,

274
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:28,010
or if you can't say a space and and geographic location and time and length going door to door to select people,

275
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:33,770
then we're going to need to find another way to find our controls. Population controls.

276
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:37,880
People always kind of there's this belief that there are the gold standard controls,

277
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:43,790
but they actually can be inappropriate, right, when there is incomplete case ascertainment.

278
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:53,990
So some of the advantages of population controls, random sampling of population is ideal, right?

279
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:00,770
If we can really capture all of our cases. It's great if there's a well-defined population with a roster.

280
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,420
So cruise ship, daycare, those sorts of settings, that's what you're going to think of right away.

281
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,969
But some of the disadvantages are and may be more prone to recall bias.

282
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:19,520
We'll talk about recall bias more later. Sometimes the population cannot be explicitly defined and you have to have a

283
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,219
roster or a list or some way to identify all the members of that population,

284
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,520
or at least a representative subset of that population.

285
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:36,770
All right. So that's one population controls, right? Another method is random digit dialing.

286
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:44,480
This definitely went down for a while. It became not that popular and seems to have increased again more as of late.

287
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:50,060
So it's a sampling of households based on random selection of telephone numbers.

288
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,479
Now it's more, I would say actually, households, more people, but it's some sort of mix of households and people.

289
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,050
And we can talk about why that is. Yes. So we use.

290
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,260
Operation. If you have a primary.

291
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,050
Yeah. I mean, a secondary state of the. Yeah.

292
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,350
You're not in the use of population base, although you see it time.

293
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,979
But you shouldn't. Yes.

294
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,460
I should fix this because it's it's not necessarily just households anymore.

295
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,470
And the reason for that is like this kind of used to be based off of dialing the landline numbers.

296
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:34,440
How many of you have a landline number? Okay.

297
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,999
Yeah, right. Like, it's very rare now.

298
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,639
People do have them. I actually thought about putting one in my house just because I have, you know, various babysitters or whatnot with the kids.

299
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,969
And it might be, you know, and they don't pay attention to their cell phone sometimes, luckily.

300
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,980
And maybe I should get the phone rings loudly in my house, right,

301
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,800
to make sure I can get a hold of them or that the kids could call if there were emergency and,

302
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:05,450
you know, something that happened with the adult that they're with. But anyways, but like a lot of people don't have landlines anymore.

303
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,470
So they'll say household slash people.

304
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,630
And that certainly is kind of a little bit of a methodological problem there. All right.

305
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,560
Potential pitfalls to random digit dialing you can get differential coverage by.

306
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:23,510
Yes, you can have more than one phone line per house.

307
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Right. Increasing use of cell phones. Right.

308
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,219
With many people not having a landline. So you have to include cell phones in here.

309
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,310
So now we're kind of selecting based on household and cell phones differential by.

310
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,250
Yes, yes. And probably age. Right.

311
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:44,420
If you were all 70 and I asked how many people in this room had a landline, would probably get a lot more hands going up into the air.

312
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,280
And then you also kind of have to deal with call screening.

313
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:56,479
But the basic idea of random digit dialing, right, is that you've got some area code, you've got this kind of sarge, right.

314
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,110
And these two digits and then you do random two digits here, call people and include them in your study.

315
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:10,010
So as I said, one of the issues is, is that cell phones are becoming more common.

316
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,780
Uh, so I just selected this one only goes through 2018, right?

317
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:21,530
But here we've got our wireless only like look at that change between 2006 and 2018.

318
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,820
Landline with wireless, it's actually gone down further.

319
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,360
Right? And here we've got our landline without wireless.

320
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:39,420
It's gone down pretty substantially over that time. Some people are now doing it only on cell phones.

321
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:50,140
So anybody see any issues with that? So say, yeah, some older people may be less likely to have cell phones.

322
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,790
Right. There's also like you can buy those burner phones.

323
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,370
Right. Is that what you're going to. No, I was going to say. But most people don't change their cell phone number when they.

324
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,410
Yeah. That is a massive issue as well. Yeah.

325
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:14,240
How many people in here have a seven? Three, four. A large proportion of people do not have a734 number.

326
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:19,030
Right. So that's that's a big issue as well. Okay.

327
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,840
So additional issues with cell phones out of area numbers.

328
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,030
Owners may not answer calls from unknown numbers or they may have them blocked.

329
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,750
Right. Like you be short the number of people who have the general, you of them line blocked.

330
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,770
We discovered that with this study, the ISO study. Right. We like we're like we just called you back and they're like, no, you didn't.

331
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:47,020
I didn't get anything right because they at some point selected to block that whatever it N10 0000 which by the way, that's the number.

332
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:50,919
If you use two of em as a hospital, you would get a call from your doctor from that number, too.

333
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,580
So bad idea to block that one if you happen to use U of M.

334
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,450
But yeah, I know that people would be like, no, you didn't. You didn't call me, right?

335
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,750
We're like, Oh no, we left a message and they're like, Oh, you did? How did that happen?

336
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:07,719
Right. But they kind of just and back and forth. Uh, yeah.

337
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,540
So I might have these numbers blocked. Right. There's also safety issues, right?

338
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:18,220
Like that. Certainly people are concerned with you're calling people, maybe they're driving to answer the phone, etc.

339
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,740
Obviously, there is personal responsibility in that. But another concern.

340
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,280
So we got population controls, random digit dialing.

341
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:38,260
Now neighborhood controls controls come from the same neighborhoods as cases can be done in two ways.

342
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,470
You might have a neighborhood roster or a map, right?

343
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,550
And you could just select based off of that. Or you can do door to door.

344
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:53,890
If the neighborhood is related to the exposure, this matching must be accounted for in the analysis.

345
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,280
Right. You'll consider it kind of a match analysis in that case.

346
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:07,030
Another way that you see people do neighborhood controls now is using satellite imagery in certain certain settings,

347
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:14,560
particularly in low and middle income countries. You'll see people do a lot of neighborhood controls where they select based off of the rooftops,

348
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:21,040
because houses may be inclined to have a certain type of rooftop versus businesses having another right.

349
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:27,879
And then you can actually do a randomized or a spatially designed or whatever you want selection,

350
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,080
but then you'd still get the ordered order in more people. All right.

351
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:40,870
So here we have a map at the home of the case. We just determine, okay, we're going to go for houses out to the to the left first.

352
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:46,450
And then if that if we don't get our controls that we need in these houses now, we're going to go to the right,

353
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,970
then across the street, into the left, and then, you know, across the street to the right.

354
00:38:53,350 --> 00:39:03,009
And, you know, you go knocking door to door. People may not answer their doors, maybe your your depending on what you're looking at.

355
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:12,340
Right. Looking for adolescents, you know, between the ages of 12 and 70 for your study.

356
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,870
Right. And these houses may not have anybody that meets your control selection criteria.

357
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:21,100
So that's why you're going to kind of go and have an order that you naturally go in.

358
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:29,230
What you don't want is you're like people who know this is the house of the case and they're like, okay, I need a select in here.

359
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,459
And they're like, Well, that house looks really nice, right?

360
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,580
You know, so that they're selecting based off of other factors, right?

361
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,460
So you need it to be standardized. All right.

362
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,810
Neighborhood Control's advantages is there's not necessarily a need for a roster is easier if to have a roster.

363
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:55,240
There's many confounding factors that may be controlled or because like that's the inside of a neighborhood tends to be more similar.

364
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:04,420
Right. But there are disadvantages to it can be expensive can be dangerous for the interviewers if they're going from door to door.

365
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:12,970
And it's not really a random selection. Right. People tend to live in neighborhoods around other people that have sort of similarities to that.

366
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:24,850
Right. Neighborhood controls typically require a matched analysis because for each case, you're selecting a particular control or set of controls.

367
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:39,020
All right. So that's neighborhood control. And then we have hospital or clinic based controls using control samples from the same hospital or clinic.

368
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,690
That's really useful when we're full patterns. That is the hospital or clinic.

369
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:52,070
That is that the hospital or clinic is only used to treat a small proportion of cases in the area.

370
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,900
So it can be important to take that into account for control selection.

371
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,850
Some potential problems is this is really not random, right?

372
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,050
It increases the likelihood that the selection is not independent of the exposure.

373
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:19,040
So for hospital or clinic based control, some strategies that you can use are to limit the diagnoses for controls to which to those for which there

374
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,460
is no prior indication of a relationship with the exposure because you don't want your controls in,

375
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,080
you know, selected or kind of an increased probability of that,

376
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:34,760
that exposure in your controls compared to the general study base from which your cases came.

377
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,669
You can use a variety of different diagnoses rather than just one.

378
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,720
So it would dilute the effect of any given one diagnosis.

379
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Or you can select from diagnoses for which there is some evidence or biologic argument to support the hypothesis.

380
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,710
That is, there is no relation for the study exposure to hospitalization for that diagnosis.

381
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:08,000
All right. So hospital controls, the exposure must be unrelated to the disease leading to hospitalization.

382
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:21,650
Right. It's really important to think about that and whether it plausibly could be so advantages of hospital or clinic controls or convenience.

383
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,330
You've got a list of those people, right? It's low cost.

384
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:32,660
You can get comparable information because they're also coming in for medical care or they're also sick.

385
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,030
Right. They're usually motivated to participate in studies.

386
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,620
And you've got comparable health seeking behavior, which is good.

387
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,460
So these people are going to be more similar to your cases on the on that front.

388
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:52,550
Some of the disadvantages are though they exposure may be related to the reason controls were hospitalized.

389
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,309
Different diseases can have different catchment areas.

390
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,340
Right. So that's going to be a concern.

391
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:09,080
The controls may resemble cases more than the population controls would.

392
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,640
And this, once again, is not a random selection. Right.

393
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,360
So an example of case control study of colorectal cancer incidence.

394
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:29,780
So we're we're interested in investigating the potential protective effect of incidents on the development of colorectal cancer.

395
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,680
So our cases are going to be colorectal cancer cases identified at the time of

396
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:42,080
their surgery are controls or hospitalized patients without colorectal cancer.

397
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,890
And you're the investigator, right? So we have to choose who we would choose.

398
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,300
Right. One potential is patients with arthritis.

399
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,930
Right. If we if we had those individuals as our controls.

400
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,210
Right. They're probably taking instead to help control their arthritis.

401
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:09,320
Right. So then you'd have a typically high exposure. On the other hand, patients with pop peptic ulcers.

402
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:09,860
Right.

403
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:16,490
They probably have a typically low exposure rate because that's going to irritate their peptic ulcer and they're going to be told not to take them.

404
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,899
And so you have to think of this, right?

405
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:28,580
So here, if we select people with arthritis right now, we're going to enrich that exposure in the control group.

406
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,120
So it will increase the effect of insets on colorectal cancer prevention.

407
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:46,390
And here you. I will decrease the estimate of the effect of insets on colorectal prevention.

408
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:51,580
That is, that will bring it closer to one. All right.

409
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,700
So that's hospital clinic controls. You'll see a lot of examples of hospital and clinic controls in the literature.

410
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:05,410
We've actually already seen a few before, and there are often major issues with them, particularly for older studies.

411
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:11,770
Of course, hindsight is 2020. We may say that, you know, 20 years from all the same studies being done nowadays.

412
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:17,860
All right. Front controls. So basically the idea of preferring controls is you're going to ask the cases

413
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:23,200
for some names of some of their controls are going to be matched to the cases.

414
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:30,220
So we've got to get do a matched analysis. Right. This violates the study based principle.

415
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:40,030
There are other potential pitfalls. So being named as a friend by the case may be related to the exposure status of the potential control.

416
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:49,630
Right. They like to do the same sorts of things. They're more similar individuals who are less social or less likely to be named as a friend.

417
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:57,760
So you're not necessarily really representing the entire study base, depending on what your exposures of interest are.

418
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:05,020
This allows the cases to provide the list of possible controls. So it's really not a random process.

419
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:13,840
So for control, some of the advantages or it's really convenient or it's easy to identify controls, you're asking somebody else to do it for you.

420
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,489
Pretty controls are going to be motivated. Their friend has the disease of interest.

421
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:23,530
So when you call them up to see if they'll fill out your survey, they're more likely to say yes.

422
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:30,170
Friend controls may also control for many potential confounders, right?

423
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:34,570
Because they may be very similar in sex and age and other factors.

424
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,020
Some of the disadvantages are many exposures may be very similar.

425
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,910
Right. So you can be over matching. It's not a random selection.

426
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,409
So the case is choosing the controls.

427
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:56,620
Right. Thus it's not random and social people are going to have a higher chance of selection.

428
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:05,620
And just as a reminder, friend controls require a matched analysis similar to friend controls, you can have relative controls.

429
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:17,020
So we often see the use of siblings, sometimes spouses or other family members as controls useful in genetic studies or to control for genetics.

430
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,110
It's also really useful to control for multiple exposures such as environmental exposures.

431
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:30,880
So spouses help to control for adult environmental exposures of a sibling can help to control for childhood environmental exposures.

432
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,390
Right. It's not going to be a perfect control. Right.

433
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,970
But you're at least partially controlling for those factors.

434
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:44,530
This one is motivated really by that D confounding principle.

435
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:52,570
But the problem is that it can really introduce over matching. So relative controls.

436
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,370
Some of the advantages are that they're convenient.

437
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:02,680
They're motivated once again because a relative of theirs has the disease or more motivated.

438
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,620
You can control or may control for genetic factors, at least in part, and you control for many other exposures.

439
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,770
Right, because their experience may be similar for at least environmental exposures.

440
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,729
Some of the disadvantages or many of the exposures may be similar,

441
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:25,480
so it may be over matching and not all controls have the same probability of selection.

442
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,820
Right? Like this is really easy to think about.

443
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:38,590
So if you have a sibling, right, and they, you know, they ask you to identify who your siblings are and then even if you randomly select from them,

444
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,490
you know, if you've got one sibling, their probability of selection is 100% right.

445
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:46,030
I'm actually one of six kids, so I have five siblings. Right.

446
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:52,310
So each of my siblings would have a lower probability of selection. All right.

447
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,410
We'll finish up control selection and we'll take a break. So Dad controls our last group.

448
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,370
You're going to select that people as the controls. It's convenient.

449
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,210
They're enumerated. We count them. Right. You can go to a list.

450
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:14,720
The idea basically is if the cases are dead, then the controls should all be dead to allow for comparable information gathering.

451
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:23,690
You've got to be cautious here because the controls are not part of the source population because they're not at risk.

452
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:29,330
They're dead. Right. So there's some issues here. So we're definitely violating the study based principle.

453
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:39,080
However, if the exposure experience of the controls represents the exposure experience in the study base, then it is a valid way to do it.

454
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,970
All right. So review of our control groups.

455
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,050
Right. We've got these are all our different potential controls.

456
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:54,500
So if we have a known group right, then we'll go to a roster of random digit dialing.

457
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,420
This is our primary study base. Right? We have an unknown group.

458
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,020
It's hard to define the group from which the cases came. Right.

459
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:11,840
You can use neighborhood controls. You might have a population register door to door or hospital or clinic based controls.

460
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:19,980
Relative controls or controls. Any questions about the different potential controls?

461
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:34,500
All right. Well, with that, we will take a ten minute, ten minute break and start back up at the pre after.

462
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:55,010
You know, because we're going to do the activity after it.

463
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:01,370
But frankly, my clients, the activity usually takes a long time for people to sift through the information.

464
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,670
We're not doing the one with the different. We may not get to all the different chart case control designs for that.

465
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,130
I can go next time, so then we can work on the chart.

466
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:23,900
However, I would still bring in stretch marks for a logical home because people will get their chance.

467
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:45,820
There was. We'll be a factor in any intervention trials and turning them over to Abraham.

468
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:50,380
So I already sent them to Abraham. So you might want to check for something you may have already done.

469
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,540
So then where did you get this one? Pelicans over.

470
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:58,180
So I couldn't find it like a religious page.

471
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:09,220
You don't know that one could be that stuff.

472
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,800
That's a nice. That would be nice. I've got one. I got two in this episode and I was horrified.

473
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,810
So maybe it's old enough that people not everybody's noticing it before it.

474
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:46,560
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you're trying to make them as smooth as possible without knocking on the door.

475
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,840
And that's where the other McCain comes into effect right away.

476
00:52:51,690 --> 00:53:02,860
Um, we still have, like I used to have, I forget what I take out, for example, sort of like it was like the toxic shock example.

477
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:13,990
Right. And we use parental controls and there's actually a matching not only for you but the brand for them, you know.

478
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:24,970
So that's that's that. Yeah. You want to make them as soon as possible, except not on the basis of the problem.

479
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:41,350
And the problem is for a lot of these ah, insurance each other it's sort of like the smaller but uh, you know.

480
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:53,290
I mean, the purpose would be to cover the case on the exposure of interest.

481
00:53:53,860 --> 00:54:02,290
I just want to know why. Well, actually, it's not really because like you what you're not actually hearing.

482
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,600
It's like, okay, now I'm like, No, these things are hard to really relate to,

483
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:14,260
like the underlying population distribution because we're stepping back now.

484
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:21,180
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

485
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,540
I mean, I find it hard to think about it in terms of my work because, you know,

486
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:43,980
you can't you can't really care about it, which is the point that there is a very little program pretty much like.

487
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:58,710
You know, I'm not sure I would have to, you know, take some cross study.

488
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:09,290
We're determining what to do because due to the amount of required.

489
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,230
So one of the great people in science.

490
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:26,200
He was looking at the region and then the antibody and there's all these different views of the House.

491
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:33,280
I don't know from inside the house, but because you needed like are signs to say that previously,

492
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:41,740
you know, you didn't tell anybody about that but you wanted people to take a day to see people in.

493
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,639
Right. Stands for and got the ball.

494
00:55:50,640 --> 00:56:00,090
We had a paper that we covered really sorry about because I don't like her just because.

495
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:12,270
Because we really want to title. So the the question was following in my friend what is the of which feels like it shouldn't be that difficult.

496
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:21,960
But you can have a similar rate in the race to win on that very substantially.

497
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:28,830
But I've never seen it. Right. And so let me talk about control.

498
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,870
All my results like it.

499
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:37,570
There's too much time. Very highly.

500
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:44,760
We needed the master math exact time period in the morning to deliver out.

501
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:59,790
So we just do it in kind of a different cohort, which led to months from now years.

502
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:06,290
Trials are really over preliminary or I'm never on that topic.

503
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:11,970
Yes. So okay.

504
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:17,790
So I feel like really think about that. Is it how old you are?

505
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:27,020
Yeah, I heard. Yeah.

506
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:34,630
So what I'm finding is we're actually going to find out.

507
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,740
We're going to try to want to control that.

508
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:47,240
I mean, if you look at like the airport, right, like they don't really care, but like you got more variation and you do get seasonal priorities.

509
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:52,540
But I like it just because some people. Yes.

510
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:59,510
Good to know. And also, other than that, when we get.

511
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:12,190
So now the last one that's not very interesting.

512
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:32,170
Well, actually, I think it was six, seven years ago, and then the first year I had people I was going to be responsible for.

513
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:46,490
Yeah, well, it's really the question of considering like like the people were like 20 to 40 months before.

514
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,950
Yeah. Oh yeah. Actually, that was. Yeah.

515
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:55,760
So I thought it was pretty bad, but I feel like it was very hard to find even.

516
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:02,020
Yeah. I mean, definitely understand. Yeah, I.

517
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,360
So yeah, I do.

518
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:19,920
I do recommend not all that I was, but.

519
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,380
Yeah, but I put it. In my life. I never wanted to take that.

520
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:37,850
Yeah, well, it's not large, but this is the first other.

521
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:45,810
Yeah. Yeah, I probably have 100. Yeah.

522
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:52,830
I think it's. It's actually not like it used to be for.

523
00:59:54,170 --> 01:00:05,970
Feel like maybe maybe that is the difference. Thank you so much.

524
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:24,830
So going to you know, I tried to think that I probably will have to say.

525
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,300
You need to go through this.

526
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,790
We're going to be all right.

527
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:44,940
We'll get started back up. So we're going to go a little bit further.

528
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,420
And then we have an exercise that actually usually takes people quite a bit of time.

529
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,610
So then we'll see how much further we get into any any exercise after that.

530
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:59,550
So a number of control groups is it's generally not advised to have a number of control groups,

531
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:07,590
meaning like if you select two or three different control groups rather than just kind of deciding on what control group you think is best.

532
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,580
And the reason for that is it's really difficult to interpret discordant results.

533
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,620
So it's best to determine what the best control group is from the start.

534
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:30,450
But you will see that some studies will use more than one control group because there is no perfect control group.

535
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:40,120
I'm sorry. It's just like semantics question when you say the number of control you're referring to, like distinct cohorts of control.

536
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:46,200
Yeah. Control. Yeah. So like, like, let's say I have a case, a case of whatever, right?

537
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:53,700
I might select friend controls and neighborhood controls and I'm going to compare them to each of these separately.

538
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,910
Right. Well, then the problem is when you get really different results and we'll actually have

539
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:05,190
we're going to have the in class example has a number of different control groups.

540
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:14,219
And I actually think they did a really nice job of rescuing it, but I'm not sure that they originally meant those control groups for those things.

541
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,670
I think they just got different results and had to like figure out why.

542
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:25,410
So sometimes there's no perfect control group or sometimes you want different control groups for different questions.

543
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:33,300
Right. All right. So smoking, smoking and lung cancer, we've seen this paper many, many times now.

544
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,270
Their question was, does smoking cause lung cancer?

545
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:43,650
The cases were hospitalized, patients with a new diagnosis of lung cancer in 20 hospitals within London and the surrounding area.

546
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,549
Right. That Dolan Hill study the controls were hospitalized.

547
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:54,870
Patients in the same hospital that do not have lung cancer but do have other cancers and a variety of other diseases.

548
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:02,690
So we've got some questions we're going to kind of go through. One, is this a good control group?

549
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:08,630
Why or why not? Two, how might the control group affect the risk estimate and why?

550
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,910
Three What is another suitable control group?

551
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,440
What do we think of friend controls instead of hospital controls?

552
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,850
And then five.

553
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:28,970
In the initial report, the prevalence of smoking among cases was slightly higher 99.5% than the prevalence of smoking among controls 95.5%.

554
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,660
What are two possible reasons for this?

555
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:38,059
So why don't you hopefully talk with a neighbor or think about these questions for a moment,

556
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:42,360
see if you can answer them yourselves or what answers you.

557
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:58,830
You get yourselves, and then we will go through them. It's just.

558
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:14,410
Yeah. Smoking has.

559
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:42,700
All right, so what do we think? Good control group. Why or why not?

560
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:50,530
Who thinks it's a good control group would give you a thumbs up? Bad control group.

561
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,830
Thumbs down. Right. Okay. Yeah. Bad control group.

562
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,480
Although pivotal. Extremely important paper. Right.

563
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:06,549
The reason right. Is that the control group is hospitalized. Patients you probably all discuss with one another.

564
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:11,650
Right. But these hospitalized patients may be hospitalized for reasons associated with smoking.

565
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,540
Right. Or for diseases associated with smoking.

566
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:21,610
So how might this control group affect the risk estimate?

567
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:35,720
Odds ratio, right? So how would this control group actually affect the odds ratio?

568
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:46,250
Yep. So we're going to yeah. Biased towards general rule underestimate the effect estimate and that's because the

569
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:52,490
prevalence of smoking is higher among this control group than the population at large.

570
01:06:52,790 --> 01:07:01,680
Or at least we are hypothesizing that to be the case. What is another suitable control group?

571
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:11,070
This answer is actually really obvious when you see it.

572
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:17,220
A non-hospital based control group might be right that we still haven't really identified who they are.

573
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:23,070
They're potentially a neighborhood control match on H.

574
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:28,410
Right. We might be we'd be matching on him in part on adult environmental exposures.

575
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,900
Right. And obviously, ages is related to your risk as well.

576
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,290
What about a friend control group? What do we think about a friend control group?

577
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:45,680
Good, bad, bad, bad, bad.

578
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:49,890
They're more likely to smoke also. Sorry, they're more likely to smoke.

579
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:53,950
Yeah. So if you smoke, you're likely to have friends who smoke, right?

580
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:59,969
So they're bad friends are more likely to have the same smoking habits.

581
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:03,750
So smoking prevalence would be higher among the controls than the general population.

582
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:15,070
And you once again underestimate the risk. It's the question.

583
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:26,509
In the initial report, the prevalence of smoking among cases was only slightly higher than the prevalence of smoking among controls,

584
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:30,770
where two possible reasons for this question is not quite.

585
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,190
Oh, sorry, sir, I have a question. What would be an example of a control group that would overestimate the effect,

586
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:50,210
I guess, for this particular instance, but would overestimate the effect of smoking?

587
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,360
Well, we'd have to select a control group that is less likely to smoke.

588
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:09,230
So if if you were in a population where predominantly men smoked.

589
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:21,200
Right. But you didn't match on on sex, biological sex and your control selection and you selected from the general population,

590
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:28,280
then you would be overestimating because you would underestimate the proportion of smokers,

591
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:35,420
because you're not including much of women in it with the way we think about that.

592
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:42,120
You know what that might not underestimate. Actually, let me think like. But you would need to.

593
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,679
Or if you only enrolled female controls for some reason or you enrolled controls

594
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:54,209
from a setting where women were more likely to be there than you would,

595
01:09:54,210 --> 01:10:02,980
you would underestimate. Ah, you would overestimate. Sorry. All right.

596
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:12,850
So in the initial report, the prevalence of smoking among cases was only slightly higher 99.5% than the prevalence of smoking among controls, 95.5%.

597
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:25,740
What are two possible reasons for this? Smoking and hospitalization are.

598
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:33,240
Yeah. So other hospitalized patients are hospitalized for conditions caused by smoking.

599
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:40,650
So these hospital controls have a higher prevalence of smoking than the the population from which the cases came.

600
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:48,130
Another reason. Smoking was just really prevalent for everybody.

601
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:53,200
Yeah. So everybody but everybody smoked in the general population at the time.

602
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,220
So we had a really like a really common exposure. It's another possibility.

603
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:03,490
Um, third joke possibility is that this is a smoking only hospital.

604
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:09,100
Right. But yeah, so it's, it's either, you know, you see something like this, you're thinking, oh,

605
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:14,230
man, we're somehow selecting based on the exposure or this exposure is very, very common.

606
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:18,010
Right. Those are your two options. All right.

607
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:24,069
So ratio of controls, when we think of the number of controls, not the number of different control groups,

608
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:32,500
but the number of controls, the most efficient design is always going to be 1 to 1, uh, kind of all else being equal.

609
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:36,790
But you can add additional controls per case to gain power.

610
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:44,190
And in fact, occasionally you will see the inverse where people add additional like have more cases than controls.

611
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:49,420
Right? This is usually done well. Number one, based on how many cases do we have in the first place.

612
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:50,260
Right.

613
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:59,470
And and then to the expense of collecting that information, sometimes the controls are much more expensive to get the information from than the cases.

614
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,040
Generally, though,

615
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:13,000
we don't want to go beyond a wonderful ratio because you're going to get a diminishing return as you add additional controls per case.

616
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:19,120
So that's just kind of a rule of thumb. All right.

617
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:25,209
And with that, we are going to hand out the in class activity, this activity.

618
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:31,300
I really highly recommend that you chat with somebody about it and go through it

619
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:36,760
because it is a lot of information to pull out of the write up about the study.

620
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,820
And I don't know exactly when we're going to start back up. I will see how people are doing on the on the activity.
