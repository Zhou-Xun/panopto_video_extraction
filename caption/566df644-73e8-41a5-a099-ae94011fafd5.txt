1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,797
Here, we are at last part of our first class on an introduction

2
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:15,283
to the most important principles of causal inference.

3
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:18,733
Directed a cyclic graphs are very,

4
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:24,261
very useful tool that we will use throughout the course.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,061
Some of you may more or less be familiar with that.

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,961
So let's start from the basics and introduce some important definitions.

7
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,413
A directed acyclic graph or DAG is a set of nodes and

8
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:51,000
edges amongst nodes, each of which is directed.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,815
That is it only goes in one direction such that

10
00:00:55,815 --> 00:01:01,147
there is no direct path from a note back to itself.

11
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:06,117
Here, we see an example of a fairly complex DAG,

12
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:11,332
where we see that the direction of the arrows always

13
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:16,667
follows the future is like a timeline progression,

14
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:22,261
and none of these edges go on into pointing backwards.

15
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,482
Let's say that our goal is to study the causal effect of

16
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:32,961
the factor E on the outcome Y.

17
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,696
Then this directed a cyclic graph in order to be called causa,

18
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:48,350
will require that all the parents that is all the nodes that precede E temporally.

19
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,990
And which have an arrow going in to C, sorry,

20
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,761
going into E and Y have to be present in the DAG.

21
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,100
In this case, we see that Q as a narrow into E, so

22
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,440
it's included in the DAG C as a narrow into E, and is included in the DAG.

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,662
But in addition, we have another set of factors such as B and

24
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:24,514
A that even arrow pointing into Y, we might want to include them.

25
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:28,390
Because maybe some of these factors C and

26
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,661
Q that pointing to E are known to exist, but very hard to measure.

27
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,061
We can understand this more with some example coming up.

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,651
What are the requirements for a diagram that is acyclic to be also called them?

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,068
The arrows that point from one north to the following

30
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:02,631
safe from E to Y from C to E that you have to represent

31
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:07,151
a causal or a counterfactual relation.

32
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,472
For example, the QE arrow is present if after we fix at C,

33
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:22,561
then it's still possible to affect E by intervening on Q.

34
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,305
The second requirement as I was mentioning in the previous life,

35
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:36,061
all common causes of any two variables on the DAG must also be in the DAG.

36
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,126
For example, we see that Q is a common cause of the NY,

37
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:46,675
so we included in the DAG.

38
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:52,644
We see that B is a common cause of ENY, so included in the DAG,

39
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:59,740
we see that A is a common cause of the NY, so included in the DAG.

40
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,907
Some of these common causes affected the E and Y directly,

41
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:11,451
some others, such as B and A affect them indirectly through other nodes.

42
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,884
Note also that formally causal directed acyclic graph is

43
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:23,061
defined by non-parametric structural equations.

44
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,340
For example, we could start by defining via a structural

45
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,579
equation model how Y our outcome is realized.

46
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:41,238
And here, we would say look, how many arrows pointing to Y while we have A,

47
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:48,251
that has a direct arrow that points into Y, we have Q, we have E, and we have B?

48
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,894
So our function F for

49
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:58,026
the explaining how our outcome

50
00:04:58,026 --> 00:05:03,940
Y realizes will include EQBNA.

51
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,018
However, C is not gonna be included,

52
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:14,781
because we see that conditionally on E, C is independent of Y.

53
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:20,705
This leads me to talk about the most important property

54
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:27,786
that DAG have that is absence of arrows connecting nodes in a DAG,

55
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:35,161
reflects the statistical property of conditional independence.

56
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,386
In particular, we can state the C is conditional independent on Y given it.

57
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:46,000
That's why we don't have an arrow that goes directly from C to Y, and

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,751
that's the assumption that's encoded in this graph.

59
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,124
Let's consider a couple of examples rooting them into

60
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,661
an epidemiological context.

61
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,236
Greenland at al gave an example regarding estimating

62
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:08,440
the effect of the use of an antihistamine on asthma.

63
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,472
And they represented their study using this directed

64
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,961
acyclic graph where E is our antihistamine and D is asthma.

65
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,406
And what are the assumptions that the investigators are placing in this graph?

66
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:30,859
First that a air pollution affects asthma only through

67
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:35,140
bronchial reactivity and anti stamina use.

68
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,361
That is conditionally on E and B, A is independent of B,

69
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:48,261
and also that sex affects antihistamine news only through brown calorie activity.

70
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,030
So again, sex is independent of antihistamine used if we

71
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,961
condition on bronchial relatively.

72
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,923
Also we are assuming that there are no common causes of two variables on

73
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,756
the graph, there are not on the ground.

74
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:09,764
Let's say, use other definitions,

75
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:15,040
pass is any sequence of nodes connected by edges.

76
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,367
So for example, we have a path from A to B, to C, to E, to Y,

77
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:26,571
that's a path, but we could also have another path from A to Q, to E.

78
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,665
If the path can also be backward for example,

79
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:34,451
a path from Y to, Q to A is a backdrop path.

80
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,461
A directed path is a path which is such that the order of its nodes

81
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,950
follows the direction of the edges.

82
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,990
So A, B, C, E, Y is a directed path, whereas Y,

83
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,361
Q, A is going against the edges, so it's actually backdrop.

84
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,332
The collider is a node on a path with both arrows on the path going into that node.

85
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:11,246
For example, E is a collider relative to the path involved in C,

86
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:15,140
N, Q, because both Q and C going to E.

87
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:22,654
So E is in a path between Q, N, C, and this path is called collider path,

88
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:27,351
but E is also in a direct path from C to E, to Y.

89
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,490
Again, a collider is relative to the path that is from C to E,

90
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,151
to Y, E is an intermediate variable, but from C to Q is E collider.

91
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,834
Note that a causal directed acyclic graph can help us thinking what

92
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:56,761
could be the different sources of statistical association.

93
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,021
Note that between two variables, let's say X and Y,

94
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:08,440
a relationship can arise, an association can arise in one of three ways.

95
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,337
The first time money is that X causes Y or Y causes X, but

96
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:17,620
then you can also have spurious associations.

97
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,600
For example, X and Y are associated because they have a common cause.

98
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,542
This is what is represented in the graph on the left where health

99
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:32,112
status is a confounder of the drug and cure relationship,

100
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:36,418
this is like our toy example at the beginning of class.

101
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:41,431
But also X and Y might have a common effect K that we are calculating

102
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:46,140
our measure of association conditional on that K.

103
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,196
This is this graph on the right, let's say that our goal is to

104
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:57,540
study the causal effect of extracurricular activities on SAT scores.

105
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,283
And based on this graph,

106
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:05,140
there is no causal effect of extracurricular activities on SAT scores.

107
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,104
Let's say, that I'm telling you that I'm enrolling college students only and

108
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:12,878
asked them to remember their SAT scores, and

109
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:17,540
whether they had extracurricular activities in high school.

110
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,248
And after we collect this data only among the college kids,

111
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:26,940
we studied the relationship between extracurricular activities and SAT scores.

112
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,314
Now, if we do that simply because we have conditioned on

113
00:10:31,314 --> 00:10:34,673
sampling our data from college students.

114
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:40,299
And we know that higher SAT scores increase the likelihood of college

115
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:47,880
admission, and extracurricular activities increased likelihood of college admission.

116
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,073
By simply using this sample, we will find a positive

117
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:55,433
correlation between SAT scores and extracurricular activities, but

118
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:59,151
that doesn't mean that indeed this is a true causal effect.

119
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,244
Note that we would find the same spirits relationship if

120
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:10,142
we adjusted on it later income that is on a descendant,

121
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:15,261
something that comes after descendants of it collider.

122
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,561
Another important notion is when we manage to block a path.

123
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,160
Typically a path is blocked the conditional on C if there

124
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,156
is either a variable in this suspect is E on the path we condition on,

125
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,135
or if there is a collider on the path, but

126
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:45,631
we are not conditioning on the collider or its descendants.

127
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,174
For example, here the path between SAT score and

128
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:55,551
extracurricular activity is blocked by college admission.

129
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,420
But if we condition on college admissions, then we're gonna open a path.

130
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,943
In this graph on the left, if we don't adjust for

131
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:15,170
health status, we have an open path from cure to drug.

132
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:21,140
But if we condition on a confounder health status, we are gonna block the path.

133
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,676
So in somebody if a variable is a confounder, we wanna adjust for

134
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:28,740
it to block his spurious path.

135
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,048
If the variable is a collider, we don't want to adjust for

136
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:38,925
it to keep his spurious path block.

137
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:44,117
Bottom line, you want to adjust for confounding,

138
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:48,351
you don't want to adjust for colliders.

139
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,577
So let's consider an example about how we would go about adjusting for

140
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:59,883
confounding in a complex DAG where say,

141
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:05,151
our goal is to study the effect of the exposure E on the outcome Y.

142
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,903
If a set of variables Z is such that no variable in Z is a descendant of E,

143
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:16,329
and Z blocks all back their paths from E to Y,

144
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:21,078
then conditioning on Y suffices to control for confounder.

145
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,902
This is the famous backdoor criterion by term, I give a for

146
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:32,111
the references in the back of the slides in our end, at the end of the notes.

147
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,401
This is the fundamental criterion to understand how we

148
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:42,286
should choose the factors we should adjust for in our announce,

149
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,461
we should all be three exposure factors.

150
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,684
For example, in this DAG, we have multiple options to block your path,

151
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:54,440
to block spurious relationship.

152
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,137
It would be suffices to control for C and Q,

153
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:02,440
because we block all after passing this way.

154
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,726
So if we adjust for C, we block this particular path,

155
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:11,679
we blocked this particular path, and then if we adjust for Q,

156
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,704
we block this particular path, but it also suffices to control for B and Q.

157
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:23,422
However, controlling for A and Q would not suffice because

158
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:29,102
it would still keep this half involving B and C open.

159
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:34,533
And here, our last example of this environmental

160
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:39,966
epidemiology studied where we want to understand

161
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:45,680
whether anti standing is a causal effect of asthma.

162
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,224
We are allowing for air pollution to be a confounder,

163
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:54,140
this confounding operates through brown held reactivity.

164
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:00,860
Here, we are in a particular situation where bronchial reactivity is a confounder

165
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:06,620
along this path that goes from D to D to E, but it's also called glider.

166
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,110
And by conditioning on B, it because it's a confounder here, so we need to do it.

167
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,104
We actually open a backdoor path, and

168
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:21,451
we call this path that is called M bias, Lucy looks really like an M.

169
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,513
Because there is this path from D to S, to B, to A, to E,

170
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:31,156
that if we condition on D, which we have to do.

171
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:34,472
Because B is a confounder along the path,

172
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:39,040
because there is a direct order from B to E and B to D.

173
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,498
So we need to adjust for before sure, but then since we opened equal

174
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:49,961
glider spoilers path, we also need to either adjust for S or for A.

175
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,250
So I hope that at this review of causal inference of counterfactual,

176
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:04,440
of confounding, of marginal structural models, and bags was useful.

177
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,710
I provide addition.
