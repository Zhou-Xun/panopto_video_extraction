00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:11,080
So in my professional life, I'm a health
and science communication researcher.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,740
What that means is that I spend a lot of
my time thinking about how we can make

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,150
health information or

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,970
scientific information more
understandable to whoever needs to use it.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,960
For example, some of my projects
involve making test results or

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,150
risk statistics more understandable.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,680
The kinds of things you might get back
from your doctor after you go to see them

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,780
about a health problem.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,230
Now, all of my research, as well as all of
my all of my teaching in communication,

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:45,410
when you really boil it down,
is driven by one fundamental idea,

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,550
effective communication is
intentional communication.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,500
And what I mean by that is that
it's not about just throwing facts,

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,560
or data, or
knowledge that we have at people.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,340
It's about taking a step back and thinking
about, what does my audience need?

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,650
What do they need in order to do
whatever it is they need to do?

16
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,710
And when we take that step back and
think about their needs,

17
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,050
we can make intentional choices about
which things we're gonna communicate.

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,300
How we're gonna communicate them, and

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:32,080
the way in which we interact with the
audience to help them get what they need.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,460
And maybe remember stuff or
maybe act on it so

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,899
that your communication is successful.
