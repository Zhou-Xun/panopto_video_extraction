1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,790
So your next assignment is a public health intervention application.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:20,610
And with this, what you'll be doing is basically developing a public health intervention.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,640
And just like the first assignment, we give you really detailed information about everything that needs to be in there.

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,970
Where did it go? I don't know.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,050
Well, it's that I don't know. Maybe that was the word intelligence that could be helpful in this one.

6
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,820
And I'm not sure what does it do?

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:59,510
That's what it did November 1st. All right. That sounds good. So, you know, read over this.

8
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:07,590
We'll go into more detail. But I just want to as you're wrapping up one assignment, be think about the next one and what we do with the assignments.

9
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,140
The assignments actually follow kind of a process of learning and analysis.

10
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,940
So in the first one, you critique an intervention.

11
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:23,250
The next one, you develop segments of an intervention, and then the last one, you actually develop a proposal for an intervention.

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:33,180
And the last one is in the group. So there is this there's thought that went into the progression of the assignments.

13
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:42,840
So the second one would be thinking of public health issue, a population of focus and intervention objectives.

14
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,770
And this is where you learn how to write smart objectives.

15
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,670
How many people know what smart objectives are? Okay.

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,190
When you took my time, I saw a couple of people.

17
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,569
But you learned about those in public health.

18
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,460
Smart objectives are very, very, very important, as opposed to if you're going to go into public health practice,

19
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,770
you always need to have objectives for your public health interventions.

20
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:19,860
So we'll teach you how to do smart objectives and then the intervention activities and then limitations.

21
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:29,040
Additional comments. When you do your final grant proposal, it's much more detailed and you'll be talking more about how you develop the intervention,

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,949
how you deliver it, all those other types of things.

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:42,940
So then we kind of gradually work you up to a full scale grant proposal, and these interventions have to be of a critical nature.

24
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:51,000
That's why we've been practicing that in class too. So the last CRC was that so trying to everything builds throughout the semester.

25
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,260
All right. Any quick questions about this again? We'll talk more.

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:08,970
Yeah, what's the pitch count? You know, I don't have this memorized, like I said, oh, a bunch of pages and think it's on here.

27
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,760
I just going to see. Okay. Yeah, I think it is.

28
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,310
If not, I feel that I will chat about it.

29
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,090
We have how many references. Yeah. So anyway.

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,950
Well we'll get to that. Yeah.

31
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:37,110
Kind of. You know, my philosophy is always like short and to the point, not too much.

32
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:46,140
But, you know, with some of the assignments that the kilos Brady and I ran over some of them and and some folks wrote a lot of information.

33
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,190
And you don't necessarily need to write a lot to say a lot. Sometimes you can say a lot with a lot fewer words.

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:01,680
So I'm less into, you know, like it has to be X many pages, things like that.

35
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:08,670
I really just want you to cover the contents. So, you know, I don't think I've ever marked anyone down for having too few pages.

36
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,690
I have my people down for having too little content.

37
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,250
But if you can say a lot and a few pages. More power to you.

38
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,070
And again, part of that reflective of what it's going to be like if you do go into the field of public health.

39
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,210
You know, oftentimes when we're communicating with communities or work with communities,

40
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,380
we're not going to use all the academic, geeky language that we do here.

41
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,420
And we need to get straight to the point and be very direct. Also, when you're writing grant applications, especially for public health practice.

42
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
If you put all that flowery crap in there, it's going to get rejected.

43
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,389
I mean, I sit on a lot of or have over the years sat on a lot of grant review committees for public health practice projects.

44
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,100
And sometimes people it's like, I read like two pages and I have no idea what you even said.

45
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:04,410
So we want to really help teach you how to be able to say it in a short amount of order.

46
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,070
And it's. Some good guys saying, no, that sucks, which is really stupid.

47
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,780
I mean, you can and that's fine. I am okay with that.

48
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:23,610
So we're talking about critical theory. Last time we ended with what is the critical thing you have to do in public health?

49
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,610
I want to talk a little bit about critical race theory.

50
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:41,010
And, you know, since I started teaching this class, critical race theory has become a really kind of hot button hot issue.

51
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,580
What's that funny? Hot button issue? Okay, whatever it is, that's about a hot button.

52
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,090
That would be really painful right out of the bubble. It's hot. And you pushed it anyway.

53
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,239
Too much political analysis. But it's something that when I first started teaching this, you know, not many people talked about it,

54
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:06,380
but now it's you know, governors are talking about it and we're people.

55
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,100
And in towns and people, all kinds of people are talking about it.

56
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,540
Yeah. I've also noticed, too,

57
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:21,810
one thing that conservatives are really doing now is they're putting the word theory onto something and then that's a way to make it bad.

58
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,220
So, for instance, have you all seen no.

59
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,450
And will comfort woman run against Gretchen Grant?

60
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,669
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

61
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,310
Yeah. I think it was there all the time in Lansing.

62
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:50,010
Um, so on Twitter, there's a commercial about how Gretchen Whitmer wants a drag queen in every classroom.

63
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,670
I mean, has anyone seen that? And it's like, it's really wild.

64
00:06:53,670 --> 00:07:05,940
I saw in an article about this, too, so there was some conservative person don't know who they are that claimed that at some rally

65
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,030
that Gretchen Whitmer was advocating that every classroom should have a drag queen in it.

66
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,510
And I'm not really sure where that would come from. I mean, it'd be a wonderful thing and it really makes school more exciting.

67
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:25,740
But like, I don't know what the, you know, kind of the price tag would be on a drag queen in every classroom.

68
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:34,589
So anyway, so tutor jumped on the bandwagon and there's like no evidence that anything that Gretchen Whitmer ever said,

69
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,590
anything even remotely related to that.

70
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:45,120
And now there's that commercial from good old 2D about oh, my only one that seeing this.

71
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,300
How many people say that? Really, no one seems to help people.

72
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,820
I was like sort of like that. I make this up, but I've seen too many times.

73
00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:02,220
It is terrifying. Um, but she has this, you know, and they even have this picture of like, you know,

74
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,110
someone in drag and talking to a little kid and putting makeup on them or some something.

75
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:15,960
And then they talk about boys competing in girls sports, talking about trans women and all this really crazy crap.

76
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:24,630
But her message is that Gretchen Whitmer wants to talk about sex and gender theory in classrooms.

77
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,350
And we need to get back to the basics of math, science and reading.

78
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,830
So I didn't know that there was a theory, you know, I mean,

79
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,030
I guess you could say there is a theory of gender, but there's multiple theories of gender.

80
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,169
But it's kind of this way when you want to notice the concerns are doing as they looked at

81
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:48,990
critical race theory and now they're just adding theory to things that they want to reject.

82
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,170
Yeah, it reminds me of when people say like, oh, like evolution is not real because it's only a theory, right?

83
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,650
Yeah. Like, yeah, I think. Yeah, exactly.

84
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:08,790
And for some reason and some conservatives minds and I'm open to listen to all different perspectives, but theory is a bad word somehow.

85
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,399
So anyway, so when we think about critical race theory,

86
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,590
it's something that has become part of the common vernacular now, which it never was, you know,

87
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,120
and if you I don't know how many people have actually listened to conservatives who are anti critical race theory,

88
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,809
and they know nothing about what critical race theory is.

89
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,670
I mean, like 000i have considered.

90
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:44,520
But, you know, it's on my list of 10,000 things to do. I have a really good friend who has illustrated children's books,

91
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:54,450
and I want to do like child and adolescent books about critical race theory that actually talks about it as what it's supposed to be.

92
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,640
And there have been there are a number of not a number,

93
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:05,910
but a couple of children's books that have a that address issues related to critical race theory that are being banned now.

94
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:13,920
And. All this other kind of crap long intro to say the critical race theory is something that has been around for a while.

95
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:29,430
As Akilah talked to us about Kimberlé Crenshaw, she's one of the people who have been quite substantial in the movement around critical race theory.

96
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,700
And really, it's it's not a brand new concept in any way, shape or form.

97
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:42,930
And again, like a lot of the other concepts, people have talked about this in different ways, but they just haven't used the label.

98
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:55,560
So it's there are aspects of it that are many aspects of it that you'll notice that are very fiery in and other aspects that go back to other people.

99
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,900
And again, if we look at like black feminists and black feminist theory, there's that dirty word.

100
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:12,510
Like bell hooks and others. I mean, she talked about a lot of these concepts to Audre Lorde, but we just don't see it labeled the same way.

101
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,050
So some of the tenants and Delgado owns the barn.

102
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:25,650
I don't even know how to pronounce it, so we'll just say stuff in their book on critical race theory.

103
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,380
They do, I think, a pretty decent job of laying out what the tenets of critical race theory are.

104
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,600
So the first is the concept of ordinariness.

105
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,280
So this is saying that that racism is ordinary, not aberrational.

106
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,640
So it is something that this is really the way society operates.

107
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,110
So when people are like, oh, you know, that's not racist,

108
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:58,260
or you're just being overly sensitive to all this other [INAUDIBLE], it's like, no, racism does exist.

109
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:09,030
And that for most people of color, racism is something you just you wake up and you experience throughout the entire day.

110
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,690
And again, for people who have privilege and power, especially white privilege.

111
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:20,040
You don't have to experience it and you don't know about it unless you educate yourself or become educated.

112
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,360
But I think that, you know, one of the again, one of the biggest forms of oppression,

113
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,800
as I've talked about before and we talked about in our critical consciousness intervention work is invisibility.

114
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:40,450
So if you try and erase the fact that racism exists, that is even further oppression.

115
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,500
Plus, it directs attention away from what's critical.

116
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:52,320
So, you know, one of the critical tenets of race theory is that the US and most places in the world are racist.

117
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,280
Period. End of sentence. Full stop. You know, it's here.

118
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,050
Whatever one. I agree with that because you can not agree.

119
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,370
I mean, all right. In this class, I didn't think you would.

120
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,420
But, you know, maybe if I was teaching thermodynamics or something.

121
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,220
The second is inverse, convergent or material determinism.

122
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:21,809
So most would agree that our system of white over color ascending ascendancy serves important purposes for psychic material,

123
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,340
as there's little motivation to eradicate.

124
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:34,920
So a lot of this has to do with the concepts that Professor and others talk about in terms of maintaining the status quo.

125
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:42,000
Right. So too many people are benefiting from racism and so they don't want to address it.

126
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,460
And that's so obvious. And all of this anti critical race theory rhetoric.

127
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,250
It's like the people that are saying that are the people that are benefiting from this.

128
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:59,230
You know, and I get so tired of, you know, people that are like, oh, we can't you know,

129
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,520
we can't talk to white kids about horrible things that white people do to people of color because that'll make them feel bad about themselves.

130
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,200
You know, it's like, well, it's reality. Again, racism is a reality.

131
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,740
That's hard for a kid of color to accept. Right.

132
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:22,800
So it's also should be equally hard for white kid to accept that their generations of people have contributed to that.

133
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,150
Right. So it's not like critical race is not something where it's like, oh,

134
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:32,970
we're all going to be warm and fuzzy and everyone's happy and rainbows and puppy dogs, you know, it's about reality.

135
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:41,190
Then the third one is social construction. So race and racism are products of social thought relations, not objective.

136
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,340
Inherent are things that correspond to no biological genetic reality.

137
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,930
Rather, races are categories that society advancement abilities are retirement care being so race

138
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,270
that one of the core tenets of critical race theory is that race is a social construction.

139
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,030
What do you think about that? So that's something that, you know, sometimes in the past we're talking about this class.

140
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:11,580
Some people may agree or not agree. What do you think about this concept that race is a social construct and that we've created?

141
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,690
The concept of race. And that really, if you look at people biologically,

142
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:26,370
obviously there's difference in like skin tone and, you know, body shape, body size configurations.

143
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:34,080
But that can occur within race, across race. But the whole concept of race is really something that we as a people have created.

144
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,540
Agree? Disagree. What do you think? Breathing alive?

145
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,850
Yes. I think I'm quite understanding what you mean by that.

146
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,310
Like, what do you mean? The concept of race, like. Like putting somebody in a category.

147
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:57,350
Yeah. So having to label your black or your white, you know, those are pretty broad categories, right?

148
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,160
But yeah, that, that that society has created those delineations and those labels.

149
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:12,799
You know, there are, again, individual and group differences in terms of certain aspects of biology and you know, how we look.

150
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,370
But at the end of the day, we're all human, we all function, we all have a heart and lungs and, you know, things like that.

151
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,309
But that we've created the labels. Yeah. So maybe I can add to that.

152
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,620
So then I would agree. I think that is something that like.

153
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:37,740
Because like you think about like when unlike when we used to like for a lot of people who identify like within the a category before,

154
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,050
like we had fought to like be considered white in the box.

155
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:48,550
Yeah, we would be fit in like a separate category now because oftentimes we've seen that we don't,

156
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,150
we can't even benefit from our cause like on the rosters like that.

157
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,880
We can't benefit from, you know, being considered a minority within the United States.

158
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,840
I think that people are now fighting to have that separate box to be able to check off.

159
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:09,240
And so I think, like. Yeah, like our. It's all some sort of, like, construct, and it's not very like.

160
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,160
There's nothing. Yeah. It can benefit you or put you.

161
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,510
Right, exactly. Yeah. I think that's a great example, especially with the MENA category because like you said, you know,

162
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,820
in for a lot of statistical purposes and, you know, kind of counting and things like that.

163
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,560
Yeah, it's under white, right. So you would think, oh, well that comes with white privilege.

164
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:43,080
But no, in society you're still seen and viewed as a minority, but you don't get any the way you socially people treat you differently.

165
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,910
But the categorization is a privilege categorization, but it comes with no power.

166
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,090
And I think what I meant specifically with that is like, for example,

167
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:58,440
like on the SATs and stuff like we would like check white and then like, you know, you could get like scholarship or whatever it is.

168
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,040
But like at that point it's like I can't even use my like minority rights called like to my own benefit.

169
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,540
Yeah. So that's true.

170
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:18,900
I remember when I first came here from DePaul University, like in 2012, one of my research team members came with me and he's Egyptian.

171
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:26,520
And so when he came here and went through the whole process, he walked out of his meeting with h.R.

172
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,150
And he looked really depressed and he's usually, it's like really chipper guy and I'll never forget that.

173
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,740
He just said to me he's like, Gary, I'm white. Like, what?

174
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,490
And he's like a very dark skinned Egyptian, you know?

175
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,900
And I'm like, No, I'm from school.

176
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,250
He was like, No. But they told me I'm white, you know, and he's like, from Egypt.

177
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,420
And so, you know, so technically he is African, maybe.

178
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:04,620
And so he was just really disturbed by the fact that they stripped him of his identity, you know, in many ways.

179
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:12,870
And when we were back in Nepal, we did have separate, you know, designations for Mena, but then a whole range of other categories and stuff like that.

180
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,250
So yeah, so that's an excellent one. Yeah, yeah.

181
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,920
Something I was going to say, I feel like it's a really famous example for like social construction of racism, the infamous case like Plessy Ferguson,

182
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:35,700
like that whole case was designed like with impact litigation, with Homer Plessy only having like one eighth, like African heritage.

183
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,750
And so for like outside, he didn't necessarily look like he was black, but he had to like actively like everybody was in on it, basically.

184
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:52,530
But he had to tell like the conductor, like I am like a black man and I am like not going to move.

185
00:19:52,530 --> 00:20:01,799
And then they stop the train. They have lawyers waiting. But yeah, he had to like basically say that he was black in order for like the case to go up.

186
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,290
But they used him on purpose to point out like how socially constructed, like ridiculous is separate cars.

187
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,770
Exactly. Yeah. The ghetto. You know, a lot of these things do go back to legal discourse and legal theory.

188
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,600
Oh, there's a theory, but. Yeah, and it is.

189
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:28,409
I mean, it's, you know, it's amazing. I think especially now that we're I think we see more people that are multi, ethnic, multiracial, you know,

190
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:37,560
all these different things like how, you know, at what point do you say, well, I'm, you know, and and this and that and eight is unhuman.

191
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:46,889
But we're so used to those racial and ethnic categories that we have to squeeze you into that box, you know?

192
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:53,100
And like you were saying, it's like sometimes that box can have benefits and sometimes that box has real challenges, you know?

193
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:04,050
And then for people who do have multiple heritages, there is no box sometimes for you and like know here there's often not amenable.

194
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:12,270
So, you know, there's just so many ways in which we said and this is something that, you know, I know when I talk to other white folks about this,

195
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:21,179
sometimes people don't get it, you know, like once they're not to get I mean, this is extreme.

196
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:28,110
But, you know, I'm kind of like, so let's take a bunch of arms and just, like, cut them and they're all going to bleed the same way.

197
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,499
So, I mean, we're all physiologically human beings.

198
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:41,930
I mean, we all have the same body parts and some people somehow, but people who are, you know, Asian and they have different facial configurations.

199
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,759
I'm like, Yeah, but people who are white have different facial configurations, so you can't think of that.

200
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,360
Yeah, I mean, I think so. That's important. But we're talking about social construction.

201
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,740
It's like I struggle with a lot and I was like kind of first experience ideas.

202
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,770
Like just because something socially constructed doesn't mean that it's not real in the sense of like very real consequences.

203
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,420
So I think a lot of people like. Use the phrase social construction to kind of like dismiss something that's like exactly it doesn't actually exist.

204
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,800
And I feel like that's like an important point to like actually build, understands, understand the difference between like is it like biologically,

205
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,650
biologically constructed or socially constructed, but like it still has an impact on people's everyday lives?

206
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,209
Yeah, that's an excellent point.

207
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,040
And because of that, because it's socially constructed, we have that ordinariness, you know, and I'm thinking as you were talking,

208
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:37,260
I'm thinking the parallel with like when when I was working as a therapist, I worked a lot with kids with chronic and terminal illnesses.

209
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:46,770
And, you know, for a lot of them, they had psychological symptoms that would either exacerbate their medical symptoms or vice versa,

210
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,260
you know, and sometimes, you know, doctors would say, oh, you need to come in and see this kid.

211
00:22:52,650 --> 00:23:00,270
You know, he or she has this or that. But I think it's all in their head, you know, and they were always saying it doesn't really matter the origin.

212
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,899
It matters that that person is experiencing that.

213
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:11,879
So I think in that same way, just because something might be in your head doesn't mean it's not real and just because it's socially constructed,

214
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,590
I really like that point, doesn't mean it's not real too, because everything is socially constructed, right?

215
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:22,350
Gender, socially constructed. I mean, our words are socially constructed.

216
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:29,880
I mean, everything that we have, we've created meaning together and then we've adopted and accepted that.

217
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,830
So it's like growing up healthy and healthy and people in here.

218
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,709
But I think it was always obvious to me how it's a social construct because my parents would just not understand.

219
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,420
But like growing up, any party you go to or something, they're like, okay, yeah, you're Chaldean.

220
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,690
But somewhere like for your term, like what village?

221
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,490
You know, it's not like, really? Yeah. Like then people will actually, like,

222
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:00,900
dismiss you as a friend or dismiss you as like a potential partner because you're not from where they want you to be because they think,

223
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,110
Oh, you're from Syria. These are the more rich people like you talk to these people, you know, and it's like,

224
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,860
Yeah, but we grew up like if we were in Iraq, we'd be 30 minutes away.

225
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:17,670
Right, exactly. So yeah, but my parents didn't think that that was like like they thought, what do you mean, we're different, right?

226
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,370
Well, thanks for sharing. Yeah, that's a really good point. Others all right.

227
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:29,250
Yeah, sure do. So I love this conversation in like, everything that everybody has raised.

228
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:38,100
One thing I was discussing in one of my classes with one of my professors is we were looking at race from like a historical perspective,

229
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,509
particularly like in the United States and how if you look back at old like census

230
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,810
records and things like there were different categories than what we know now.

231
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,850
And so it really just goes to show how not only is it socially constructed, but how it changes over time and then also beginning,

232
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,180
because a lot of times we as Americans think as like as the United States, but like beyond like,

233
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,849
you know, our country, other countries have different social constructs for a race, right?

234
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,049
So so they might find something much different than what we would define it here.

235
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,710
So similar to that of mine, too. Yeah, we got ourselves a lot.

236
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,200
Yeah. You know, in America now that's a real example. I remember the first one I went to in Brazil.

237
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:22,560
You know, Colourism is very alive in Brazil.

238
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:32,370
And I remember we were we were in some museum and they had this like kind of like painting that was but it was,

239
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,070
it was a way to categorize people, basically.

240
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:45,870
And there were 23 different racial categories based on how white or dark your skin was and then your hair texture and all these other things.

241
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:57,479
So they had created names like there were 23, literally 23 names for all these different, you know, people based on how they looked and again.

242
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,570
Yeah. So I think we do often think in the US sense and it's good for us to get out of our own heads.

243
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,350
Next on differential racialization that's meaning consequences of dominant society.

244
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,780
Racialized is different minority groups and different times, and the response to shifting needs such as the labor market,

245
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,160
the popular images and stereotypes of various minority groups shift over time as well.

246
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,470
Who can think of an example of this?

247
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:37,680
So if we think about the way that society racialized is how they portray the stereotypes of different groups and that this can change over time.

248
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,070
Yeah, I just thought of like the model minority.

249
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:49,110
Yeah. When kind of historically like, I guess like black like look at these minorities.

250
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:55,440
Like these other people used to be acting like it was primarily Asian, Southeast Asian immigrants and how.

251
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,390
Kind of like the government. White people weaponized like Asian-Americans against black Americans.

252
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:09,990
You should be more like them when they literally, like, scouted specific people from specific careers to come here.

253
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:15,880
Yeah. Although they had a much larger, longer history being here and a lot more diversity.

254
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:23,190
Right. Yeah. It was a very strategic, you know, selection of who would come here.

255
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:30,630
Yeah. I do know what you said about colorism and Brazil is I mean, I spent my summer there, so I've remember had to respond to that.

256
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,610
That's very true. But the Brazilian elections are going on right now,

257
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:43,650
which is like a big deal because the current president is basically like playing a trump card and saying that if he loses, he's not going to leave.

258
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:52,140
But like so they had the first round last Tuesday and the split was very regional.

259
00:27:52,170 --> 00:28:01,229
So you had like the Northeast that supported like the more liberal candidate and that was like very much more like darker skinned people.

260
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:07,080
And then like the South had much more of like a German and like Argentinean influence and they were like much,

261
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:14,310
much greater in support for like the sort of fascist candidate. So just like that divide sort of exists everywhere.

262
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:19,530
Yeah. Yeah. Robert, you know, they made, you know, Brazil, and I'm really glad you brought the global point out,

263
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,770
you know, around this is so much of like bringing certain people in.

264
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,600
And then in some part, some parts of Brazilian history,

265
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:35,160
they went to like Italy and other places and brought brought white people in to lighten the country.

266
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,060
I mean, that was like the framework and so it was a very select.

267
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,940
So if you look at like immigration laws and policies, they only wanted white,

268
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
fair skinned people to come in to them and lighten the rest of that society.

269
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:58,090
What else? For differential racial. Yeah, I was like, oh, second.

270
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,560
Okay.

271
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:16,409
I like the idea of like the model as of 2014, like crimes increased like significantly because of COVID 19 and how that is being as model minority.

272
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,470
But now all of a sudden like having a negative stereotype.

273
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,510
Yeah. Yeah. That's a great example. I someone somewhere bring that up because it really if you look at the part about

274
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,950
in shifting over time it says you know it talks about needs a labor market.

275
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:36,399
I would also talk about I would also say that it also has to meet other needs, you know,

276
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:47,020
and this was really totally perpetuated by Trump, you know, even in like, you know, how he, you know, called the coronavirus.

277
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:54,159
I'm sorry about that. And then recently I heard he had some kind of I don't got a tweet because he's on Twitter anymore,

278
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,740
but was like totally dogging on, oh, what is her name?

279
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,670
The like child. Yeah, like child.

280
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:10,299
And just really defensive like anti-Asian, you know, rhetoric or was just like,

281
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:16,060
I can't believe that this person had any kind of, you know, job that mattered.

282
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:22,240
But anyway. But yeah, but that's a that's an excellent example of this process of different racialization.

283
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,350
Anyone else? Yeah. Oh. Oh, sorry, Karen.

284
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:35,200
And then, you know, another example that comes to mind is, um, like the sort of just identity of Jewish people,

285
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:42,549
because I think like during World War Two, seen as white, they're seen as like an inferior race.

286
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:48,520
But then afterwards, a lot of people considered Jews of way and it kind of goes back and forth like depending on the

287
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,040
situation and the context in like which way is advantageous for making the argument right.

288
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,489
So exactly like not necessarily in different times other than like obviously World War Two,

289
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,670
but like it goes back and forth a lot just depending on the race.

290
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,270
Yeah. So yeah, yeah, I know.

291
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,230
Yeah. I mean it's like very interesting. I remember learning about like in religious school how the Jewish people were

292
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,990
racialized for like ten years to justify the Holocaust that just went away.

293
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,970
And that's like, not like considered a religion again.

294
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:29,540
So I just thought like, that's interesting. And then like the popular images and stereotypes of, like, nose lengths and all the empirical basis.

295
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,110
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

296
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:42,220
I just wanted to add like I think European colonization, as honestly put it, all these kids that like now because like even just thinking about like,

297
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:51,060
you know, Europe, the European colonization and whatnot, like they even separated regions from each other, right?

298
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:59,709
So like at like the 11 team kind of group, that sort of area like that in itself has been separated into many different areas.

299
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,810
Whereas like. Middle East peace be just one big one.

300
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,170
And so now there is race superiority within the Middle East.

301
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:14,579
And so because of that and some people who are from one place and I guess like that's more

302
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,569
so specific like if you actually understand like the Middle East in terms of politics,

303
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:24,990
but like for example, like somebody who's from one place might think I'm superior because I'm from this place is like,

304
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:31,160
I don't know, I just see it a lot, especially like specifically within like communities that I grew up in.

305
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,100
Oh, if you're like from this place, you're like, I don't know how to explain it, but that's just how I see it.

306
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,340
And I think that again, like it stems all from this idea that like, there's.

307
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,230
I just think we just need to look back at like how how can we address colonization and rape with that and.

308
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,940
Move on. Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,760
One thing that's really scary and then I guess you don't like it is like if you if you look at apartheid in South Africa and folks,

310
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,180
I've ever been there, I went to the the main apartheid museum there and spent like almost the entire day there and

311
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,260
was like totally depressed and crying when I left because I got a little too emotional.

312
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:31,510
But, you know, apartheid was actually developed by social psychologists as a way to mentally and physically dominate black South Africans.

313
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:39,310
And it's really scary. And part of it was that like pitting people against each other and and, you know,

314
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:47,529
the way that know people had to carry around identity cards, you know, with your racial ID and all these other kind of things.

315
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:53,980
So it's, it's scary when we think about this process, then these are not accidental.

316
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:01,959
They're intentional, you know, and when you think about how [INAUDIBLE] up it is, try not to jump up too many F-bombs.

317
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:09,010
But but that one is really I mean, what I read as a psychologist, you know, I almost wanted to, you know,

318
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:18,490
denounce my my membership in the American Psychological Association when I when I read that it was a social psychologist that crafted apartheid.

319
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,370
Apartheid wasn't just like some. Yeah, black people, bad white people going.

320
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:34,130
It was very systematic. And even the role that people from India played in that too, later on when they brought over, you know,

321
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:40,180
like indentured servants, I mean, it's just the whole thing is really that one thing that we like have talked about.

322
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:48,249
We just have other classes like with black women in history, like the stereotypes of like the matriarch and like the mammy character,

323
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:54,260
and then also like having that hypersexual like stereotype of black women,

324
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,300
how that's kind of like changed back and forth and all at the same time over time.

325
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:01,540
And like one thing that's made me think of was like, how recently,

326
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,609
like Aunt Jemima changed their like exactly brand in their bottle from like that made

327
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,889
me like matriarch character that they had and kind of like shifted away from that.

328
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:20,170
But like how that stereotype has just changed over time with what's going on in society and like historically at the time.

329
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,829
So I thought that was just like an interesting thing that specifically was like for

330
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,639
black women throughout history and like how those stereotypes still exist today.

331
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:35,110
Just like differently I guess. Yeah. Yeah. And that's a really excellent point and know there's been a lot of really great

332
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:40,419
writings about like all the different archetypes of black women and you know,

333
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:49,690
and I think even, you know, when we look today at like the kind of quote unquote acceptable forms, you know, for black women,

334
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:56,469
I mean, there are still some, you know, careers positions where we don't really see that as acceptable.

335
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,310
And society has kind of crafted this racialization.

336
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:07,840
And and that's where I think the intersectionality comes in, too, because it's really race and gender and then often other kinds of identities.

337
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,099
And it is really interesting, I think with some in the same I think, you know,

338
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:20,770
there's been writings around Asian women and conceptualizations of, you know, Hypersexualization or the Ninja Warrior kind of construct.

339
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:29,290
I mean, all these different things, you know, that I think women of color have been eroticized, you know, objectified in these different ways.

340
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:37,870
And, you know, a lot of that is discussed in critical race theory because you can even though it's a gendered phenomena,

341
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:40,300
it's a racialized gendered phenomenon.

342
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:51,130
So here and then, yeah, well, I was sure this point earlier about like middle level of discrimination within groups.

343
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:56,800
And like one example I can kind of directly give that I know about is like the way especially

344
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,870
like religion plays a role in the Middle East and especially the country or region you're in.

345
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,430
Because in a country like Lebanon where my dad is from,

346
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:15,580
you have like areas that are predominately Catholic or Maronite and other places that are more predominantly Sunni or Shia.

347
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:24,670
And the way that especially like sex and religion and like how the way that especially like colonization has impacted it and how we

348
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:31,680
see like the way that plays a role with government like different mandates or quotas is like kind of like an imbalance of power,

349
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:39,549
like we're like biased Christians and such and how like especially like in the US,

350
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:45,700
like how a lot of like Arabs here who are like especially if you're Lebanese and

351
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,110
Christian or like you're from the Levant and you're also so white passing nation,

352
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,660
at least from like that. Like people have no.

353
00:37:52,810 --> 00:38:00,040
Like from what I've read, like, for example, the mayor of Birmingham, Michigan, was mayor and I, I believe and like it was,

354
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:05,290
he didn't very much touch on it because he knew the way that like his identity, I guess was racialized.

355
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,190
Right. And stuff like that. And it's the way. It's like proximity to witness.

356
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,730
Yeah. Yeah. I think all that. Yes. I think religion is another one, those intersectional identities, you know,

357
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:21,130
and then again also speak to like, you know, the back to the side before the social construction.

358
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,170
So all these different constructions, you know,

359
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:31,480
mean even that we have that this concept in the world of white passing I mean that's talked about a lot you know,

360
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:39,250
that really sucks to even have that term because that's putting white is predominantly, you know, powerful normative.

361
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:44,320
And then if you can if you can lean into that and be close to that, then you get power.

362
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:50,640
And if you if you don't or can't, you know. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:57,340
I was going to ask for, I guess state like it's like I guess 911.

364
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,870
I guess the topic is like what exactly does racialization.

365
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:11,259
Yes, minority groups cause like I just realized that was playing like literally overnight how much it change and I guess people can disagree,

366
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,310
but he's like, I think looking back, it's like that.

367
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,930
It never happened. Like a lot of South Asian,

368
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,290
Middle Eastern people could probably move through the world with a lot more racial lineage because you seen like prior to then,

369
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:32,590
like he felt pretty much treated like a white person and like never experienced any sort of like discrimination or anything until like 911.

370
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,540
Then overnight there was fiction. Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,270
And I think that also speaks to and I was talking about, you know, with COVID,

372
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,140
you know, that totally changed the way Asian Americans were conceptualized.

373
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,830
Yeah, one last I thought I thought I think these are amazing, great examples.

374
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,980
It is. And this is, you know, related to terms of like popular images and stereotypes.

375
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,650
If you look at athletes over time in the US, especially black men,

376
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:05,709
and the way that black men's bodies have been commodified and used to sell products,

377
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,400
I mean, we go back to LeBron James that, you know, the cover that I showed you.

378
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:15,340
But when you think about how black athletes are understood, conceptualized,

379
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:21,610
either celebrated or not celebrated, you know, that's something that definitely has changed over time.

380
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:27,699
You know, too, from the days when you could play on the baseball field or the basketball court,

381
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,509
but you can't eat in the same restaurants, you know, and other things like that.

382
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:45,249
To the point now where again, when we look at, um, I think like in the NFL, the whole process to call the combine where you know,

383
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:51,300
people basically perform to see who's going to get drafted, who's going to guess.

384
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,959
And it's been equated to like slave trade, you know,

385
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:03,790
because men's bodies are put on display and they see how fast they can run and how much they can do this, how much they can do that.

386
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,110
And those bodies are predominantly black bodies, black and brown bodies, you know.

387
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:13,510
So I think there's the if you really dig into it, there's a lot we could really rip apart.

388
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:21,910
So that intersectionality and 18th centuries of the present single identity, we've talked quite a bit about that unique points of color.

389
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,470
So coexisting in somewhat uneasy tension with anti socialism.

390
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,759
The voice of color thesis holds that because of their different histories and experience of the oppression of people

391
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,739
of color may be able to communicate to their white counterparts matters that white people are likely to know.

392
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:41,350
And the racial minority says, in other words, brings with it a presumed competence to speak about race and racism.

393
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,120
Do you agree with that is one question.

394
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,620
And then the second question is what are the challenges with that, if you agree with that?

395
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,050
So you can answer either one of those. Then think deeper or you can think superficially if you want.

396
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:10,350
Yeah, I definitely think that loss of color brings a different perspective that can help to teach,

397
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:18,570
like how certain forms of like microaggressions and things like that take form and how we can combat it.

398
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:29,820
However, there is the challenge that a lot of times people of color and you really have to fight to make room for yourself and have your voice heard.

399
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:37,910
So even though you see that unique voice, you're able to have this, right?

400
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,280
Yeah. To kind of spin off. What's your name?

401
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,150
To Tusker. Said that, like. Yeah.

402
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,569
People of color create unique perspective,

403
00:42:51,570 --> 00:43:00,400
but also it can become like an expectation for people of color to always be the ones communicating to white people about, like, what's going on.

404
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,250
Like, sharing this perspective.

405
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:08,580
And, like, it's the expectation that we have to share, like our experiences and our perspective and kind of just basically, like,

406
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,350
give them all of this so that they can learn when realistically they can go out

407
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:18,149
and do some of the work on their own and they just are unwilling to or just,

408
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:24,960
I guess like kind of society has just made it the expectation that you could always ask people of color to share like, you know,

409
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:33,569
stuff that might be traumatizing to like talk about all the time and just I think that's like also the kind of the other end of that.

410
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:38,940
Like, yeah, we have unique experiences and perspectives that are like helpful to learn more about.

411
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,000
But also we can't be the only people always talking about like our experiences because we like, you know,

412
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:49,530
that's kind of hard to continually be talking about all the time and bringing back up and like remembering all the time.

413
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:54,330
So I think it's just hard to, I think say that like, yeah,

414
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,979
people of color have great experience or not great experiences, but have that perspective to share.

415
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,940
But like, we're not the only way that you can learn, right?

416
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:12,600
Yeah. And I think both of these points together are really important for us to think about, because I do think that we I agree with you.

417
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,730
And that's always my concern when I when I hear things like this is like, yes,

418
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,930
it's kind of like the again, like a people who are oppressed leading the movement.

419
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:28,469
Sometimes you're too damn tired to lead the movement. Right. And and with this, sometimes you don't want to be the spokesperson.

420
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,990
I mean, that's why at the beginning of class, I always, you know,

421
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:37,889
the semester and talk about not ever asking someone to be the spokesperson for an entire group because like you said,

422
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:45,450
it can be very traumatizing and things like that. So I think one important point for people to think about is that if you don't belong to that group,

423
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,140
don't automatically just jump to a person from that group and say, Teach me.

424
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:57,810
Right? There's a lot of ways you can learn. And even with that, you have to be careful about how you do that, don't you?

425
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:07,410
Back when I was in Chicago, someone taught a class on multiculturalism and so what they wanted to do.

426
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:13,680
So I remind him of what they wanted to do, is to have people be immersed in other cultures,

427
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:22,770
but they didn't really talk to the students about how to do that in a way that doesn't become cultural tourism or to be objectifying,

428
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:29,639
you know, so they would have, like, white students go out to a black church and, you know,

429
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,200
and that's, again, because the term black church has a lot of, you know, issues there, too.

430
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,770
But or they would have straight people go to a gay bar, you know.

431
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:44,849
And so I think there's ways that you can learn, but you have to be careful that you're not doing it.

432
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:51,149
As someone who's looking, it's like, Oh, well, I'm going to study these people or, you know, things like that.

433
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,730
So you need to have like true interaction, true engagement,

434
00:45:54,030 --> 00:46:02,880
not just like sit there in the church or sit there in a club and just like observe the gay people as they engage in their mating rituals,

435
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,750
which is literally how some people that there was like scary as [INAUDIBLE].

436
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,850
I remember the person who took over that course from the other person.

437
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,770
She showed me a reflection paper that a strange person who had never been around gay folks wrote about his experience at the gay bar.

438
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:28,530
And I wanted to kick him out of the program immediately because just the way that he talked about the homosexual was like,

439
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,550
you know, like we're some kind of an animal that needs to be observed.

440
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:42,810
But then to your point to zero, the, the, the, the problem is that often people are given that space to do it right.

441
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:49,530
So there has to be both a desire and a just like the energy to speak.

442
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,510
But then you have to have that opportunity. So both those things, I think, go hand in.

443
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,960
And because we need to create those spaces,

444
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:05,130
but then also not make assumptions that just because the space is created that you're going to fill it, because that's a lot of pressure.

445
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:11,620
He said, I'm so sorry I would not be the right name. Sorry it's not such good stuff isn't going on.

446
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,629
So this is a point, really. It's just interesting to see.

447
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:22,000
Not just like in this class, like other classes not taken like ECG or gender studies.

448
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:30,490
Like when questions are asked, like, who are the people that are speaking up and answering the question consistently every week or every class period?

449
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:36,820
And there's a pretty noticeable pattern. Know, I think that falls into like this like voice of color.

450
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,230
I don't think it's like unless like it's brought up. I think a lot of people don't know this.

451
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:50,530
Mm hmm. Yeah. That's a really great observation that when you're trying to do something that you're like, we haven't really talked about,

452
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:55,990
it's like, the last point is this ethnic slash racial minority said it's like, Oh, I'm sorry.

453
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:03,520
As a gay brings with it a competence to speak about race and racism in that part versus principal competence.

454
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:10,830
Like, I think that really like I just want to emphasize that just because you're a minority doesn't mean you have that competence.

455
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,569
There's plenty of examples of like Uncle Tom's and like people who like people think, oh,

456
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:21,850
because they're like a posse or because they're black, like they have like that competence.

457
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:26,259
And I can think of so many examples where those people are put in like positions of

458
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,030
power and like maybe not necessarily like high positions over like a couple of others.

459
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:37,900
People look to that person for like truths about race and racism and they're just spewing just straight up lies and like,

460
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:44,930
just thinks that's incorrect. So I just want to, like, emphasize because I just don't think we've talked about it so far as that.

461
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,630
Like just because a person is a minority doesn't mean that they like.

462
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:56,020
Not that they should be telling, like they have to tell you about their expenses, but even if they're competent enough to explain,

463
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:03,790
like, I don't know, they'll, they'll think things because they have been socialized almost on that person but just.

464
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,480
Yeah. Like, I don't know. We have, like, a final concluding session. No, no, you can just stop right there.

465
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:15,130
And I don't know. I think that's an excellent point, too.

466
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,840
Whereas I have this a little political, but you know,

467
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:27,380
so I am is Herschel Walker and some of the things you know and George are those two black men running for the same position.

468
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:35,000
And just his analysis of race and gender and sexuality are so different, you know, than his opponent.

469
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:39,320
And I do think that that's a really good point, too, is that. Oh, and even.

470
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:51,090
Can I start on the university? Yeah, I will. So for years we had a dean here in the School of Public Health who was a black man, um,

471
00:49:51,530 --> 00:50:03,360
but who was from the UK and really identified that more as British than black, but was often asked to speak for the black American experience.

472
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:08,930
You know, that person became Provos and then got kicked out for sexual misconduct.

473
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,580
So there are a lot of other issues,

474
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:23,840
but that was a concern that some faculty and students had here was that they were really tokenizing him as he was a black man.

475
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:29,720
So he knows about the black American, you know, experience of our students.

476
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:37,339
And really, when he would talk in other spaces, he would say his primary identity was being British, you know.

477
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:52,160
And so I think that it is a way that people will use race or ethnicity in a very weaponized way to say, okay, we're giving you what you want, right?

478
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:56,780
So we're giving you this, but that person can't speak to those experiences. So I think that's a really, really excellent point.

479
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:05,120
You know, and the hard thing is like, it's like, what is enough experience to speak for that experience?

480
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,000
And I don't know the answer to that. Like, I mean, so at what point,

481
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:17,120
like if someone who has intersecting identities but being black is like down on their list of their own self identities,

482
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,500
you know, should that person be able to speak for the community?

483
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:27,780
And what if they grew up in a place where they didn't experience racism, you know, other things like that, a different country.

484
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,070
Yeah.

485
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:37,190
I feel like if black is high up on there, like even if they had those experiences, they still could believe like white people are superior than black.

486
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:46,520
I guess I'd be more so. Yeah. Okay. They think like, oh, black people should be treated this way as like negative as it is.

487
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,149
Okay, no, that's a really good point. And and you see that, too, in colonization.

488
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,390
I mean, I see that in Kenya all the time where there's you know,

489
00:51:54,410 --> 00:52:02,690
a lot of the leaders still believe that White is superior and have been able to rise into really high

490
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:11,390
positions and then are really kind of in cahoots with white leaders that are then giving them benefits.

491
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,560
And then people think that they're getting someone who is truly representing their

492
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:21,500
voice when they're not really kind of drifting back to make people's voices heard,

493
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,260
but not forced to explain other people's like.

494
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:29,419
I saw something on Twitter about an indigenous woman who was asked to do like a land acknowledgment at some university.

495
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,900
I forget where it was though. And then they she was like, okay, sure.

496
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,570
Like my rate is this much. Then they were like, Oh, we're not paying you.

497
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,250
And when she declined, they asked if she had anyone else she could recommend.

498
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:46,940
And she was like, No, I'm not recommending someone to do that. So like I think also talking about like compensating people for the work that they do,

499
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,800
I think that's been kind of like a bigger conversation lately that like giving people space and like,

500
00:52:52,870 --> 00:53:00,829
like for like good candidates to be kind of speaking for a group, but also like compensating it for the work that they do.

501
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:07,909
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's really important because, you know, we often don't compensate for like emotional labor or like racial labor,

502
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,930
other things, like people who are oppressed, having to do the extra work.

503
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,450
And so that's great to hear the you know, they're like, no, I'm not going to, you know, do it.

504
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:24,680
Because, again, some you know, to me what that says is that their true intentions were tokenistic and not really true.

505
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,630
You know, if you really, really wanted to do that, if that was a priority, you would find the money.

506
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,890
You know, it's not that. It's not rocket science. Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:37,459
Sorry. My name is like, that's okay.

508
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:43,970
My brain is kind of like. So I also wanted to just add like on this thing where a lot of like minorities,

509
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,940
I feel like a lot of times like in terms of like job and like psychological because of a job, right?

510
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:59,570
Whereas like a lot of people who identify with an identity that is considered to be I hate using the term minority because it's just lessons.

511
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:05,220
But like, well, that's how I, we started using minoritized more because it does kind of reflect this is.

512
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:13,809
Final perception, not so much internally that we've been minoritized, but they also have to think of like, okay,

513
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:19,060
well if my kid goes to this school, will he be bullied at that school or is this neighborhood like for example,

514
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:26,190
if I were to go up north like I kid, I would probably not want to go to a grocery store because I would just be like afraid I wear a hat or something.

515
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:36,189
Yeah. And so I think like also just recognizing that, like, like, for example, I think also I'm like going on another tangent,

516
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:45,130
but I don't think like Muslims within Michigan recognize the importance that like African-American Muslims had on the,

517
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:50,230
like establishment of the Muslim population, because without them there,

518
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:58,479
we would not be able to be as comfortable here as it would be, say, like in Alabama or something like that, you know what I'm saying?

519
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:06,580
So like, just like recognizing that not every state has that privilege that you are able to because for the majority of like Muslim Americans.

520
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:14,429
They don't represent like they not represent, but they don't get that opportunity to emphasize, you know,

521
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:22,229
where they're coming from or whatever it is, or display that because it's that sort of like neighborhood environment or community.

522
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:28,720
So I think like just also like let's not dismantle the people that have helped us that.

523
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:34,889
Great. Yeah. Now that's a really good point. I think that, you know, again, it kind of goes back to some of the, you know,

524
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:39,930
all these social constructions and we create of like these groups and categories like, oh, well, you're from that group.

525
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:44,490
And, you know, and like you said, there's a lot of collaborative movements that have occurred,

526
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,369
you know, that have really helped certain, you know, groups of people.

527
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:51,540
And I think it's important to recognize that, see that our time is limited.

528
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,730
And but this was a really amazing conversation.

529
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,180
Do you have the groups for today? Are they different?

530
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,220
I do not have them. Okay. Well, if look, I didn't randomize.

531
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:18,419
That's okay. No problem. So I think we'll stop here so that we do have time for the the C and yeah,

532
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:24,420
I just wanna say thank you to everyone who contributed today and even, you know, I realize that not everyone feels comfortable talking.

533
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:34,470
So if you had great thoughts in your head that you didn't feel comfortable sharing what you're thinking, that's all that I really I didn't do it.

534
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,810
I'm saying no comments.

535
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,279
All right. We're going to be in the same group.

536
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:51,750
That's okay. So I do want to say before this is that I realize that this is sensitive information.

537
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,670
And if I could have a residential program, I realize that this is sensitive information.

538
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:04,320
So these are the four questions I get. It's more about your process and less about saying I identify as X, Y or Z.

539
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:11,370
Again, you don't have to share this with anyone. If you don't want to share anything in the discussion, that's totally fine too.

540
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,759
You can just say, Oh, that's not easy or something like that.

541
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:21,360
So I want everyone to feel comfortable in this discussion because I realize people have different levels of comfort.

542
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,450
All right. So jump into your room from last time. I can, but no, that's okay.

543
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:40,390
I won't do it. You never know everything you your name on.

544
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:45,360
Like, you know, like. All right, okay.

545
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:50,850
Okay. That's what I was wondering, cause I was like, wait, check.

546
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:55,680
I got, like, all fiber. Like I said, I spoke with that.

547
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:02,020
I got the taxes, I got, like, on your email.

548
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,569
So it was about this is my right now you got to do something.

549
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,959
You know you're going to be okay. Yeah. Oh, that's how you do it.
