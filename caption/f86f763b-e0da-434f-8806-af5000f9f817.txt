1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,650
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:09,750
You should all go to a class that you might call how not to destroy your career in 2 minutes, which I think is a very valuable professional skill.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,100
You can also more promisingly call it a class on how to make sure that all

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,430
your good ideas and organizational efforts actually have the desired impact.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,400
Either way, there's no reason that you would want me to tell you about either of these, because I've avoided the first through sheer luck,

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,660
and I don't think I've had any success in the second, which is why I'm really, really delighted to have Destiny Cook, senior PR specialist here.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,830
Join us for a class that I really think should be part of every master's degree in public health and practically anything else.

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,629
But failing that, at least you're going to have the edge over everyone else from all the schools that apparently

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,230
think it's a good idea to go talk to the National Enquirer without any preparation.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,100
So with that, I'm going to head over to an actual professional speech.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,720
Of course, please. Okay.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,900
Thank you so much. I also echo what Scott said.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,740
You don't often get a media preparation in school unless you're a PR major like I was.

14
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,420
So this is a really great opportunity when you're thinking about communications.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,120
It can only help you in your career, right? Like being able to better communicate is really,

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:28,040
really important if you're taking highly complex information or research and disseminating it to a population that may not be public health experts.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,740
Right. So think about that from this perspective as I go through this presentation.

18
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,520
So again, I'm the PR specialist here at the School of Public Health.

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,540
So a lot of my work revolves around research communication.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,730
So when a faculty member, a student staff member who's a researcher has something new that they want to share, that's where I come in.

21
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,969
I figure out what's going to be the best way to disseminate that information,

22
00:01:51,970 --> 00:02:00,610
whether that be a press release, social media, etc. That's the majority of what I do also.

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,120
When you think about news and major things that come out from the school, oftentimes those news releases and things come from me and my team.

24
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,700
All right. So I'm going to start off with elements of news.

25
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:20,010
Basically, to sum this up, it's just what are some topics and things that may become a story?

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,780
So there are a few topics that make a journalist say, Hey, I want to write a story on it.

27
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,730
And that's the elements of news. So first, is the impact does it affect many people?

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,890
Who is it affecting? What audience is? It doesn't have broad appeal, timeliness.

29
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,420
So when you think about things like did it happen recently, what's happening in the news?

30
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,230
What happened yesterday? Right, if there's something breaking.

31
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,430
So think about like what's happening in the war in Ukraine that's super timely right now.

32
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:56,549
You're often seeing a lot of news stories related to it. Next is prominent show stories involving well-known places, companies, groups of people.

33
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,450
So an example would be Twitter, right? They're all over the news right now.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,670
That's Providence there, a big company, and then proximity or closeness to home.

35
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,330
This sort of plays a little bit into impact as well.

36
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,080
But is this happening in your backyard when you turn on the television and think about like your local news,

37
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,280
you're not getting the same news here in like the Detroit ish area as you would in California.

38
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,580
Right. Things are happening in different places.

39
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,460
So your local news is covering different things that are going to be more appropriate for a specific audience.

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,769
Next is conflict. We know this one. We see it a lot in the news.

41
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,010
Right. So stories about people, are organizations at odds with each other?

42
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,620
The example, the Twitter example that I gave, again, this is another example of bizarre or out of the ordinary feeling.

43
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:54,149
We see a lot of this is like BuzzFeed right now post random things or things that catch your eye and you want to click on it and you want to read it,

44
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,469
right? It catches your eye currency or flavor of the month.

45
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,180
So events or situations that are currently in the news are being talked about.

46
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,600
So a great example of this would be the elections, right?

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,319
We're not necessarily talking about elections throughout the whole year, but over the last few months it's been really,

48
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,280
really prevalent when you go and open up Washington Post or The New York Times.

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,270
Right, and then at least 2 minutes interest.

50
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,590
So you want to hear things. You want to hear stories about people, right? What are their lives like?

51
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,940
How have they been impacted? Those are just a few things that make up what journalists want to write about.

52
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:44,820
All right. So this is a little bit blurry, but basically to some, what this photo is, is journalists are they're very many hats now,

53
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:54,509
especially after the 28 recession and the rise of social media, journalists, journalists and their teams decreased significantly.

54
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:02,580
So now journalists are wearing many hats. So they may not just be business reporter, they might be the business and the health reporter.

55
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,749
And while that was within 2008, that was a long time ago.

56
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:15,000
Now that still applies today. So oftentimes you're working with someone who's not an expert in the topic that they're covering, right?

57
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,240
So that's where you come in and you're lending your expertise to them.

58
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,110
All right, so why should you work with the media? As I just said, your lending expertise, right?

59
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,779
You're an expert in the work that you're doing. The way that I'm talking right now in communications.

60
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,649
Right. It makes sense. You're lending expertise to someone in this case.

61
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,260
It's to the reporter and to a broad audience combating misinformation.

62
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,010
Right. Let's say there was a piece of research that has been misinterpreted.

63
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,400
If you're the expert in that field, you can combat that misinformation and say, hey, here's the truth, here's what's happening.

64
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,750
But advancing your professional reputation, obviously,

65
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,629
we know that you want to be able to be out in the media and talk and say, Hey, I'm an expert in this space.

66
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,950
You want to have me on your TV show or CNN or in your newspaper,

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,640
and then obviously that makes sense that it would also enhance the reputation of your organization,

68
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,550
that you're working for your internship, or in this case where I work here, the University and the School of Public Health.

69
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,930
And last but not least, increase awareness about health care policy issues.

70
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,340
That's what we're doing, right? That's why you're stepping.

71
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,140
All right. So before I get into you, you now have an interview there.

72
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,770
I want to go over two different ways where you might expect where you might receive an interview.

73
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,980
Right. So there's a proactive approach and a reactive approach.

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,810
So when you're thinking about a proactive report, our approach,

75
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:54,680
think about a situation where you have a new piece of research that is just published in a journal and you want to share

76
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,860
the findings with a broad audience because they've got broad appeal and people need to know about the information,

77
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:07,460
right? So your communications team or maybe your public affairs team, wherever you're going to be working,

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,260
may send out a news release or may pitch it to a specific reporter.

79
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,740
And in turn, a reporter says, oh, yeah, I want to I want to interview this person.

80
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,000
Like, let's set up an interview. That's one way that you may receive an interview with the media.

81
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,300
On the other hand, let's say something happened in the news.

82
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,900
So I think about often times in my role when there are things like school shootings,

83
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,700
we have a lot of media requests that then come in for our firearms.

84
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,510
Researchers write. They want to talk about the research behind firearm safety and firearm prevention, etc.

85
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,890
Right. So you've got a reactive approach there, right? You're reacting to a media request.

86
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:57,250
So now you've got that request. What do you do? Step one is to one, Google the reporter.

87
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,860
Just take a look. So you kind of understand who they are, what stories they've written in the past, and what tone they have.

88
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,320
That's just going to help you prepare yourself so you know what to do when you're going into the interview.

89
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,460
Next is be timely with your response to the reporter.

90
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,290
I cannot emphasize this enough. This is like one thing that you write down, right?

91
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,689
That one day, right? So that is your very first impression with the reporter.

92
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,230
And let's say that they're on a at a very tight deadline.

93
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,549
They need to talk to you by 4 p.m. today. Don't respond to them at 330.

94
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,440
It's not going to work. So media requests are often first come, first serve.

95
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,129
So the reporters will have in mind who they want to reach out to, and they may reach out to multiple people at a time.

96
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,660
So if you're late to the game, they may say, Oh, sorry, I actually have this covered.

97
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,910
It happened to me in my career. It may it will likely happen to you as well.

98
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:00,080
So the more timely you are, the more likely you're able to get included into that story again.

99
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,220
That also builds a really good first impression because if you're reliable, you're going to want to reach out to you continuously.

100
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,530
So a great example of that is recently obviously we had the COVID pandemic, right?

101
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:20,870
We had quite a few epidemiologists wanting to are being reached out by reporters for The New York Times.

102
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,770
Now, the consistency of our epidemiologists, they're now regularly reached out to these reporters.

103
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:35,149
So much so that I actually we have a one of the epidemiologists writing an op ed in The New York Times.

104
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:44,560
It's coming out on Friday. So being consistent just opens up more opportunities for you because then you are a reliable resource, right?

105
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:51,380
They know they can reach out to Scott, they can reach out to you because you're going to respond and you're going to provide good information.

106
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,100
So write that down, save it. That is probably one of the most important things in this presentation.

107
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,700
The second piece that is also very important is preparing prior to the interview.

108
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,970
So develop some key points. What's your main message?

109
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,889
It doesn't have to be long. You can write one sentence on a piece of paper, but prepare yourself.

110
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,220
What are you trying to convey? So that's it.

111
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,179
All right. Some helpful tips, like I just said, playing your key points ahead of time.

112
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,880
This is really, really important. You do not want to go into an interview cold and then you're frozen, right?

113
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,490
You don't know what to say. You don't know what to go back to. It goes off, goes off track.

114
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,680
So prepare yourself, even if it's just for like 15 minutes before the interview.

115
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,310
Just write down a key point. What you want to connect. Make sure you know the report.

116
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,120
Like who is calling who? So if you're if it's a phone call, who's calling?

117
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,700
Am I calling you or are you calling me? Are we in the same time zones?

118
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,700
Because obviously, in this day and age, you might get a request from the New York or from the L.A. Times,

119
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,170
and you're not thinking, okay, I'll call you at 3 p.m. but that's a different time for that, right?

120
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,169
So being really clear in your communication with the reporter is really, really helpful.

121
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,829
So there's no misunderstandings, right? So think about that.

122
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:21,600
Whether it's a zoom call, a phone call, whatever the case is during the interview, wait for the questions to be asked.

123
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,690
So I will skip down actually to this last bullet because this plays into it.

124
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,389
So don't people don't love silence, right?

125
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,959
It's awkward when you're just sitting here like you want to talk, you want to say something,

126
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,290
you want to build the silence zones, because oftentimes you will just start rambling.

127
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,090
You will say things that maybe you didn't want to say or didn't think that you should say.

128
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,030
So stick to your talking points and just wait for the questions to be asked.

129
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,170
If it's like if it's an actual interview where you're talking with someone,

130
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,790
I should also know there are plenty of times where you may receive a request and you might actually just have to provide written responses.

131
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,330
I love these, to be honest. I love written responses because sometimes it allows you to write down your thoughts.

132
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,890
All right. Take a little bit of time, come back to it, edit them before you send them.

133
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,420
But at least here, in my experience, there are plenty.

134
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:29,400
You're going to get a lot more interviews and things where people want to do a quick Zoom interview because nowadays we live on Zoom, right?

135
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,100
Or a phone call. All right.

136
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,380
So last point here, the second to last one.

137
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,110
So asked the reporter to clarify a confusing question. You may not be the right expert for it.

138
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,800
Maybe it's just confusing or they didn't ask the right question.

139
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,180
It's fine to ask them again. Just ask them to clarify. There's nothing wrong with that.

140
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,480
All right. So also, don't use acronyms or highly scientific jargon.

141
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:06,890
So there are plenty of times where we are just looking to explain the information that we have.

142
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,230
But for the most part, there is an easier way to explain it.

143
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:21,730
We. So do not use acronyms or highly scientific name for our highly scientific jargon.

144
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,860
Think about the audience that you're trying to send your message to, right?

145
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,990
If you're talking to a general audience. They're not public health experts.

146
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:37,240
They don't know what these technical terms mean. So if for whatever reason, you need to use a term, go ahead and define it.

147
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:44,160
The reporter may or may not use it in the story. Oh.

148
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,940
Excuse me. All right. Yeah, actually, I should go.

149
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,620
Thank you. All right. Next thing.

150
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:59,490
This is also another big one in my role in PR crisis communications.

151
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,710
There's no such thing as off the record. Don't say anything jokes again.

152
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:14,490
But I'm going back to the point of don't feel the silence. Nothing is off the record, so just don't say anything off the record.

153
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,230
Also, I will add here, there's no such thing as no comment and do not say no comment.

154
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,030
That is a terrible thing to say. It's better to not respond.

155
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,140
All right. Next is don't ask to see the story before it's published.

156
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,860
So a reporter isn't going to show it to you. Right. They're going to show it.

157
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,500
They're going to send you the link to the U r l after the after the article's been published.

158
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:57,120
Right. And then next is be friendly and be open.

159
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,550
Right? So let's see, they ask you a question that maybe you're not an expert on, right?

160
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,110
They they're not the experts.

161
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:11,220
So they're asking you that it's okay to be open and say, you know what, I'm not the right person to answer that question,

162
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,490
but maybe you can put them in a contact with someone else who might be better equipped to respond.

163
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,329
Or there's somebody else, right. That that can answer it.

164
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,260
Right. It's okay to be open with that and to say that you're not an expert because it's

165
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,170
better than you responding to this question and it being completely wrong.

166
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,530
Right. So being open and being forthcoming is key.

167
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:42,290
All right. So again, on that topic of maybe you can't answer this question, what do you do?

168
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,890
Sometimes reporters might ask a pointed question, right.

169
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,870
They know what they're looking for, a specific response. But you're either not the right person.

170
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,480
You can't quite talk about it or you just don't have like all of the answers.

171
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:07,530
Here are a few examples of things that of like questions and answers and how you might respond to that.

172
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,790
Right. So think about hypotheticals. Will Kogan, this one actually happened three weeks ago.

173
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,410
This one's like a real example. Will COVID 19 become something like the flu?

174
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,550
And our expert responded, I can't quite predict the future,

175
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,460
but I can share what has happened in the past with other coronaviruses is that dot, dot, dot.

176
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,690
So you'll notice throughout all of these I have in.

177
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,550
But I can share. But I can tell you. We'll talk about that in just a moment.

178
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,410
So, again, maybe you can answer policy recommendations.

179
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,600
So the question is, what policies do you think the ship the state should adopt to in your response?

180
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,140
Maybe I'm not in position to make specific recommendations, but I can tell you some policy options have research.

181
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:03,320
That research has shown to be effective. Dot, dot, dot. And then you're going back into your main point class that at least you don't know the answer.

182
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,240
You don't know if you don't know what the what the outcome will be in the city's water.

183
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,810
Safe to drink. I can't answer that definitively, but I can tell you what steps you can take to minimize your risk.

184
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,249
That one's that's a response. That's a pretty canned response.

185
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:26,990
And like public health, I see this from a lot of our this response type, from a lot of our experts.

186
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,760
But where I want to go with this is that all of these things entailed are techniques called bridging.

187
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:46,580
So basically that acknowledges the question that was asked, but that bridges back to the person to the experts main points I love region.

188
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,800
It is like one of my favorite things and once you kind of have an understanding of what it is,

189
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:59,420
you'll find yourself doing it a lot in not just media interviews, but in communications in general.

190
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,980
When I give this presentation a lot, I find myself using a lot of these terms, to be honest.

191
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,209
So next here, few examples.

192
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:18,170
There are so many I just wanted to throw a few on here of bridging techniques that you can use to go back to your main point.

193
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:26,450
So if it's a question that maybe the conversation has gotten off track and you want to go back to your main point again,

194
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,890
if you don't know if it's a hypothetical question and you want to go back to your main point,

195
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:39,320
you can use bridging techniques to use to go back to your key message that you've prepared.

196
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,630
So then you can get back on track and make sure that they know what you're trying to get back.

197
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,690
So a few examples here. What's the most important to know is dot, dot, dot.

198
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,900
With this in mind, if we take a look back at I use that quite a bit.

199
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,090
If we look at the big picture, you'll also notice that a lot of these two might be a great thing to start.

200
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,379
How you end, how you end an interview.

201
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:17,300
Oftentimes a reporter may ask, you know, is there anything else that I didn't ask that you want to tell us so you can start your covers,

202
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,270
that you can basically go back and round up your key message and the key takeaways that you want people to know.

203
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,320
That way it hits home for the reporter and they know this is important.

204
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,920
So bridging techniques, you can honestly go on Google and if you just look up bridging techniques and communication,

205
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,019
you can get a whole giant list of them to just like memorize and use.

206
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:47,630
And like I said, you'll find yourself using that more, much more in your daily life as you get better with using it in the sports communications.

207
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,310
All right. So how is communications involved?

208
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,240
So you are not meant to go through media interviews alone or by yourself?

209
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,720
It can be pretty scary. The more you do it, the easier it gets.

210
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,000
But that doesn't mean it's not a nerve wracking thing, right?

211
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:16,350
So whether you are at an internship, it's your future job here at the university.

212
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:24,209
If you continue continue education here. There are communications teams in basically every organization and they are going

213
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,380
to be there to help support you through any of the media relations that you do.

214
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:37,500
So again, they vary. So here at the university, for example, I'm like, hands on, hands off.

215
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:45,530
If a reporter finds Scott's email, for example, and they email him directly, they can do that.

216
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,490
That's perfectly fine. You may be in an organization where if you receive an email,

217
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,080
you need to immediately send that to your communications team before you can even respond.

218
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,000
Right. So it's going to vary depending on where you're at.

219
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:09,300
So just keep that in mind. But with all of that being said, it is no matter what, how hands on your hands off they are,

220
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,090
it's really important to keep them involved or to let them know, hey, I got this media request from Time magazine.

221
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:21,930
They want an interview tomorrow. Can you help me get my meeting or my my key points or my key message?

222
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,479
Again, we're here to help you,

223
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:33,420
whether that's Liberacion promoting the article once it's been published or if you have been on CNN or something along those lines.

224
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:40,350
Obviously, your organization may be interested in publishing that because you're an expert in your field and that helps them, too.

225
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,450
So again, developing talking points and media training, right?

226
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:51,840
So giving people a crash course if they have an interview the next day or just doing like annual media

227
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,800
training to make sure that you've got a refresher reviewing responses depending on how hands on or hands off.

228
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,230
Some organizations may want to review or may require a review of your responses if

229
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,450
you're doing something like a written response or even sitting in on the interview.

230
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,210
So I actually met with an alarm working at the New York City Health Department,

231
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:22,530
and we were interviewing her for the podcast and her communications person had to be on the call with with her as well.

232
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,399
She was muted the whole time and just listened, but she had to be there.

233
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:34,230
Right. Like that is their protocol. I mean, and organizations previously were saying, I just sit there, I just listen to them talk.

234
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,790
I'm not really doing much, but I'm there in case something goes awry or I need to give more context, whatever the case may be.

235
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,940
So just keep that in mind because everywhere is different. Yeah.

236
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,200
And unless the police are responding to the media, we can do that too.

237
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:56,370
Right. Is let's say that you're in if you are, you're in class, you're in work,

238
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,710
you are too busy to actually respond to the reporter, send them to your communications team.

239
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,650
They're there to respond to say, hey, let me check in with this person to make sure that they're available.

240
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,130
Or maybe I can find another expert, right? Because maybe you're not the right expert.

241
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:18,989
That's what your communications team is there to do. So a great example of this would be early in the pandemic.

242
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:26,700
We had a professor who was doing some work in doing some COVID 19 work in India,

243
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:33,510
and she became inundated, was receiving hundreds of media requests a day.

244
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,170
Obviously, that was taking a lot of time and causing her a lot of distress.

245
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:50,879
So we worked with her to develop a tool to be able to basically pass all the media requests to us so then we could triage them and then say,

246
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,300
All right,

247
00:23:51,300 --> 00:24:01,470
you should do this one, you should do this one, and then pass other requests that are just that, maybe not as timely or may not need her expertise.

248
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,260
How can we pass those to other people to and spread the wealth? So think about that as well.

249
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,329
When you're thinking about working with the media, you may not be the right person,

250
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,440
but maybe your colleague will be trying to keep it in the same family.

251
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,590
Right? Like, spread the love. All right.

252
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:25,050
Key takeaways. Again, a few of these things I mentioned, I was like, write these down, respond promptly to media requests.

253
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,549
Whether that's you know what, I can't take this. I'm going to pass it to communications.

254
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:38,490
Whether you do that or you respond to the reporter and say, hey, I love to let's set up a time response super, super promptly.

255
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:44,490
That is your first impression. And again, that can help you get future media opportunities with that.

256
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,930
Reporter next. Prepare your talking points in advance.

257
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:58,330
It could be one sentence on a scratch piece of paper. I don't care as long as you prepare, because that's do not come in cold.

258
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:06,300
I promise you, you will not do as well as you don't use bridging techniques to stay on track with your main message.

259
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:14,860
So again, that long giant list of things keep if things go awry, if you need to go back to your main message,

260
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:21,670
use that bridging technique, technique to acknowledge the question and then bridge back to your main message.

261
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,300
And last. Reach out to your communications person for help.

262
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:33,040
That's really critical. They're there to help you and to support you in your communications journey and as your journey as an expert.

263
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,919
And, of course, they want to make you they want to present you in most favorable, favorable way possible.

264
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:45,520
So that's it. Lesson at least if you have questions, you can reach out to myself.

265
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,360
You will have this presentation. So my contact information is there.

266
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:57,040
Again, I'm not sorry. Or you can reach out to my boss, Andrea. We both handle the communications and PR here at the school.

267
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:13,500
Dokey. You can see that.

268
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:24,060
Oh, I had a question about the timeliness, and that's something that I struggled with before form organizations where we got immediate requests.

269
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,080
Within 6 hours we had drafted something. We had gotten the board to sign off on what we wanted to say.

270
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,219
By the time we sent the response down, they're like, Oh, this is already published.

271
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,520
Thank you, though. So how do you how do you manage that stress?

272
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:45,390
So a lot of that is education from the outset to the people in place.

273
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,250
So let's say it's a comfort or it's something like that where you do have a lot of

274
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,540
reviews and it needs to go through a lot of people before it can be finalized.

275
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:04,170
It's going to require education on the communicators part or the communicator or other for that person to make sure that,

276
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,290
Hey, we need to do this in the quickest way possible.

277
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:13,920
Are there ways that you can actually maybe you don't need to maybe you do need to change the review process, right?

278
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,310
I actually had this issue in my last position where it had to go.

279
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,120
Things had to go through like five or six people to be able to be published.

280
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,779
And we were missing deadlines or people were not.

281
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,040
They're like, sorry, we already got a response from someone else or a competitor, right?

282
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,420
Like that's not good.

283
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:40,530
So really providing education to the people who need to go through that, who need to go through that review process is really key.

284
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:50,550
It's really just talking about like emphasizing being timely and being prompt in your responses in order to get included in stories.

285
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,620
Can I ask one more? I've mentioned crisis communications.

286
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,860
What is that? How is it different from the presentation you just gave?

287
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,770
So crisis communications is a lot more reactive. So it's a crisis situation.

288
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,060
Let's say that there's a lockdown at a school. There are.

289
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,040
Just think about any kind of like crisis, any form of like crisis.

290
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,470
It's again, working very quickly to communicators role.

291
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,710
It's often working quickly to gather all the facts.

292
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,650
What do we know? What do we not know? How can we develop a statement putting out a message?

293
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,500
Those types of things. So that's it's much more stressful.

294
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:41,480
Fortunately, it doesn't happen as often. So that's something to consider.

295
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:51,199
Often times, too, we you'll in crisis communications, you'll dedicate some form of spokesperson to be the person to send out all the information.

296
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:59,090
Right. It may be the CEO of the company. It might be an expert in that division or department or unit, whatever the case may be.

297
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,110
So in some cases, that might be you, right?

298
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:09,440
You'll be working with the communications person to put out vital and often highly important information.

299
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,700
So I have a question about margins. I know previously you didn't like saying, you know,

300
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,600
it was like a horrible thing to do because it kind of sets up an invitation that there's something else going on.

301
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:35,690
And I sometimes when I see an example of people trying to of it, sometimes it just seems like they're dancing around the question.

302
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,150
And that kind of brings up its own set of implications. So I'm just wondering how you navigate that.

303
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,750
Right. So it's like you give a non-answer, right?

304
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,390
From my perspective, that still works. I do not like the no comments so often.

305
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:57,500
I mean, don't get me wrong, there are some places where they'll say, you know what, give and give no comments.

306
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,860
Like, That's fine. Personally, I don't like it because it just it closes off conversation going forward.

307
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,570
Right. Like they can't ask like they don't want to ask a follow up question.

308
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,910
They may not ask a follow up question. And that doesn't allow you to convey whatever you asked.

309
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:19,910
Right? So that's kind of where I am. I should also note, too.

310
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:27,710
So you will see this this form of communication, especially with bridging techniques, is different for politicians.

311
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,030
So they may not actually acknowledge your question. They'll just go straight to the point.

312
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,460
Right. So you guys can't do that unless you're a politician.

313
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:44,689
You cannot do that. And that's actually some of the work that I've experienced and things that I've had to have had to teach people.

314
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,090
Right. You can't just go straight to your main point. You need to acknowledge that what was said and do it.

315
00:30:50,210 --> 00:31:00,370
You can't just go, all right. I'm talking about this now, right? What do you do when it's an honestly, like, really frightening situation?

316
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,840
Like a lot of press is getting calls from Fox News about what they think about terrorists.

317
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,940
So we, like the university, actually has things in place like that.

318
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,070
So we have in addition to communications teams, we also have a public affairs team.

319
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,990
So they tend to handle like the major any form of like major crises.

320
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,120
We're involved in that process, but they're the ones who handle it.

321
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,400
So from my perspective, I'm a little bit lucky because I get to kind of I get to kind of ask things off, right?

322
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,040
Most communicators don't have that opportunity, and I didn't have that opportunity in my last position.

323
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:54,600
So my question was not so much like live televised interviews, but interviews where there's a journalist that's going to write something.

324
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,729
And I've done this a couple of times,

325
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:03,690
and I feel like you have to be super careful about what you say because they will take that and put it in a different context.

326
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,930
So how do you control I mean, I know you said Google the reporter.

327
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:14,400
What other techniques are there for you being careful about not saying something that can be used in a way that you didn't intend it?

328
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,700
My first thing would be to in situations like that, let's say, yeah,

329
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,320
it is something it's your message is something that could easily be misconstrued or could be taken out of context.

330
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:35,380
That is a situation where I probably would engage with a communicator, like with a professional communication or communications team or communicator,

331
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:44,350
whether that's having them involved in the call or involved in the response, in the development of what you say.

332
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:50,180
That's where I would go with it, especially knowing, yeah, if it's something that could be taken out of context.

333
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,700
I would say to myself, All right, I need to reach out to this person so they can review it.

334
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,930
And then like it's our job to help find those find those things, right?

335
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:04,959
Like if you said a sentence that could be taken the wrong way, I'm going to see that immediately as a communicator and say,

336
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,220
hey, we need to rephrase this or we need to even maybe remove it entirely.

337
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,900
Putin has a very positive priority, really salient goals.

338
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:34,970
One of those goals is does something you just think about, Mike? So I tend to be really glass half full even in really bad situations.

339
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:40,920
I won't I won't lie to you. So, I mean, here's the thing.

340
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:48,389
In 99% of the media interactions that you do, people are not trained like are not out to get you.

341
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,920
These journalists are like they take an oath to be as objective as possible.

342
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,310
Like they want to put you in a favorable light if they can.

343
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:03,060
So don't give them the opportunity to not. I mean, there are some situations, right?

344
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:08,190
Like things that are highly politicized, things that are very contentious.

345
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:13,800
You may experience a reporter who is looking to say something in a very slanted way.

346
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:23,010
Right. That happens. Is your job to go in there with your key message and believe I can build your reputation in a favorable manner?

347
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,900
And then again, that's my job as a communicator to make sure you come off in a favorable manner.

348
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,410
Right. Let's say there is something in an article that you don't love.

349
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,720
Is there a way that you can respond, like we may be able from a communications perspective to say,

350
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,330
hey, to respond to the reporter, to say, hey, we didn't necessarily love this?

351
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,520
Or is there a way that we can make sure that we update it?

352
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,530
Like update his response because he said X, Y and Z in the interview.

353
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,680
Right. There are some things on my end that I could do,

354
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:58,830
but really it's your job to stay on message and to promote yourself in the most favorable way possible.

355
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:10,299
They are in a crisis situation where you are not aware of the situation when it happened and

356
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,770
it is unexpectedly all this media around you becoming something like something like you.

357
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,890
How do you avoid truth, media plans or can you just what?

358
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:28,690
How from there instead of a response, then because you are experiencing of that, whatever happens.

359
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,750
Oh, okay. So I haven't experienced that in time.

360
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:40,810
But if you're you have the opportunity so you have the agency to engage or to not engage with someone.

361
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,390
And that includes the media, right? Like maybe you did see someone, maybe you did see a crime happened and you were the person who actually was there.

362
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,280
Right. You don't have to talk to the media. You don't have you don't have to do that.

363
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,930
I mean, you can say, all right, I'm not in the right place.

364
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,169
There are things that you can say to not get an interview. Right.

365
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:09,070
Like, I didn't experience this. I'm not in the right place to discuss the you're not right like you closed the conversation.

366
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:19,920
You have that as the as the person being interviewed before they ask you a question like you know because I don't know anything regarding media minds,

367
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:24,340
but if you have to like, you know, they're going to interview you.

368
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:30,189
Do you do they give you a list in like meaning that like criteria what what is their

369
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:36,460
main focus and they like just ask you for an appointment and comment assistant posting.

370
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:46,499
Without having to live in situations like that, that doesn't really happen in like I'm going to say in like the majority of scenarios.

371
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,379
That's not going to be the case. You'll be like ambushed by someone that's usually right.

372
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,160
That's something that happens like in a crisis. Right? You are.

373
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,370
You're right there. When a crime happens, you're there.

374
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,880
You're leaving some form of trial, whatever the case may be.

375
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:07,290
Most of these things, this is not something that you are going to have to experience.

376
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,520
So. Again.

377
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:18,440
I guess I should bring you back to my point. You have the agency to take to take interviews or to not finding a response that works for you,

378
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:25,040
that you're not in the right frame of mind to discuss or that you're just not looking to take on interviews is perfectly fine.

379
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,729
But from a professional standpoint, you won't really experience that.

380
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,070
And if you do, you'll be working with a crisis team on that specifically and get.

381
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:48,140
Yes, yes or no. So kind of going back to Jonathan's question about timeliness and service checks,

382
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:56,990
I know that like sometimes people like the the legal side of things become like a limiting reason.

383
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:03,780
How do you I know this is probably like an extreme situation, but it really a type of situation.

384
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,830
Do you feel like you navigate balancing like the legal implication versus like getting something out in like sweat cap because you get something?

385
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:17,240
How do you retroactively about that or do you.

386
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:26,090
Right. So there are one again that pulls me back to the conversation we had about like a public affairs team or our legal team.

387
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:34,310
Let's say that you receive a media request on a topic for your company that you can't really discuss right now, or it's highly contentious right now.

388
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,560
That's something that you immediately forward to your legal team, right?

389
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:44,120
Like that is like that's step number one. In that case, like this is more of an outlier situation, right?

390
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:49,220
Like you for it, it's your legal team. And then you guys will likely have on some form of call.

391
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:56,030
Usually when it comes to that, when it comes to legal, you hop on a phone call, you know, email back and forth,

392
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:05,150
and you go and discuss and figure out what your next step is, whether that's you respond or you don't or your legal team responds.

393
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:17,610
Just a general question on what your thoughts are on the phrase there is no such thing as bad PR.

394
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,990
Personally, I agree with it. Professionally I don't.

395
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,940
Yes. So. So. Because.

396
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:35,590
Here's here's how I'm doing it. Like personally, when you're viewing yourself, like, all right, you're getting your name out there, right?

397
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,850
Like, people are going to know what you've done, whether it's good or bad.

398
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,850
But from a professional standpoint, that makes my job really hard.

399
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:51,930
So from a professional standpoint, I want you to be presented in the most favorable way possible, whether that's for your sake.

400
00:39:52,140 --> 00:40:00,780
The organization's say whatever the case may be. It's really, really important that you're out there in a light and you're an expert.

401
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:07,120
Your. You're not. People are, like, looking to you in a negative light.

402
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:16,960
Right. I suppose playing up at a bar like that, any really salient social media posts.

403
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:29,920
So my thoughts typically when it comes to social media is play like it's really going to depend on the organization to right.

404
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,860
So I can think of like I can think of the university, for example,

405
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,150
people who work for the university typically have a lot of agency in what they can post and what they share.

406
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,290
Right. That may not be the case if you're working for a private organization.

407
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,670
Right. They may say that you can't have or there may be social media policies.

408
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:56,560
Actually, there will likely be social media policies in place saying that you can't talk about work or you can't talk about X, Y and Z.

409
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:07,000
So I highly recommend you guys go into a job or an internship, look into these things because, you know, we're all like, we love social media, right?

410
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,900
We're on it every single day of like pay attention to them.

411
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:16,270
Like pay attention to those rules because you may be unknowingly violating policies.

412
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:19,839
And sometimes that can lead to termination. Right? Like you post something silly.

413
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,190
We've heard stories about nurses posting something silly on TikTok of losing their jobs.

414
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:29,530
Right. That same thing can happen to anyone here if you're not paying attention to the policies that are in place.

415
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:34,900
So from a comms standpoint, read those things when you get a job, read those policies.

416
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:41,020
I remember one time I was I was staying with a friend of Belgium and she was absolutely having an aneurysm

417
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:46,050
because I'm talking to Bloomberg at The New York Times at the BBC with the three line coordination,

418
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:51,340
Andrea. And she just she was dying on behalf of the University of Michigan because she couldn't believe

419
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:55,020
I was being allowed to talk to The New York Times and say what I thought about the world.

420
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,319
And that's and that's a really like that's that was a change for me, right?

421
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,940
Like I think about my last position. I had to be on those calls. I had to see every response.

422
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:09,550
I had to see all of these things. Whereas here in the university faculty, you can respond to things as they wish.

423
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:18,340
Now, granted, there are some rules and regulations and things, but they're not super, they're not super tight.

424
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:23,170
It allows for a lot of agency and what you can talk about and how we talk about it.

425
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,300
So I know you talked a lot about like being reactive in a situation,

426
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:38,020
but for situations that you know are going to happen, the you will probably contact you.

427
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:44,370
Like, for instance, like abortion. Like about the two potential possibilities.

428
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,950
Like do you advise people to prepare ahead of time like either way and stuff like that?

429
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:59,400
Yeah. So that's actually a really great example. So obviously with the whole overturning of Roe, right, me from a communications standpoint,

430
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,960
your comms team is typically going to be paying attention to what's happening in the news.

431
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:12,240
So we had actually been preparing for this, trying to find experts at the School of Public Health who could talk about this in January.

432
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,760
So it was so by the time it happened, we were already.

433
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,480
Basically, what happens is when something big in the news happens,

434
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,890
the university puts out an expert request saying all of these people can talk about this.

435
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,250
They go put together some interviews with them.

436
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:34,770
We had all of our people ready because they knew that this was happening and that this was likely to come.

437
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:39,720
Whereas some of the other schools that we had that were included in that media advisory,

438
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,070
they were throwing together things because they were paying attention to what was happening in the news.

439
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,030
So as an expert, you can also pay attention to what's happening in the news.

440
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:54,029
Maybe you spend 15 minutes a day, not doomscrolling, but just paying attention to what some of the top headlines are.

441
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,689
Right. That can help you to prepare for things.

442
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:05,970
So let's say you do see something that is in your news that can help prepare you to say, all right, maybe I will get some media interviews on this.

443
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,710
How can I prepare myself for this? So that was a great question.

444
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:23,800
So this is a question on the question of how you talk about your interviewing technique.

445
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:31,210
I mean, I suppose the shortest thing is there are a lot like destiny described.

446
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:36,790
I think the only fluke is that sometimes they get. But I've experienced because sometimes it gets so amateurish.

447
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:42,520
Like, I remember one time the Financial Times phoned me up and I'm on some train and no learning like, hi,

448
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:49,690
I'm senior national correspondent for one of the world's most important media outlets, and I'd like to know what you think about blank.

449
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,490
Mike literally just basically mumbles a key word as I'm to a.

450
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,380
And I think that's because he lives in a world where everybody has their lives.

451
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,560
And so the right answer is like, hey, I'm on a train.

452
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,460
Can I call you back in 10 minutes and then frantically, you know, jump off in the middle of nowhere in Seattle?

453
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:14,460
You know, I think about the issues, but sometimes they can come off as really?

454
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,970
Which feeds into when you said frame it in ordinary language. Like I remember every so often for this class,

455
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:28,060
I bring one of the guys who writes for online into the unproduced thing and he had previously been working for the Saginaw Paper,

456
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,520
which is owned by the same people. And he was the staff was the editor in him.

457
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,820
So how much expertise do you think he knows about anything?

458
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,930
He's covering high school sports in the afternoon and then he gets up, you know, and then he goes to the city council and covers the sewer district.

459
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,979
So if you're speaking to somebody like that, you really,

460
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,809
really need to start with like I'm assuming that this person has exactly the level of knowledge of

461
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:57,790
sewers and sports that somebody who lives in Saginaw has because you can't assume anything else.

462
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:04,010
On the other hand, sometimes we really look out and talking to Bloomberg Life again.

463
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,540
I'm doing something else. My phone rings. It's a Bloomberg reporter asking about something we've done,

464
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,350
and suddenly I need to be on my toes with every detail of the federal flood insurance program.

465
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,040
For those guys. You definitely say, I have an hour to go, review my notes,

466
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:23,810
be sure I don't mischaracterize the federal flood insurance program to Bloomberg and accidentally like move the market or something.

467
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:33,530
Yeah, I'll echo that. Like there are times when, like I mentioned earlier in the presentation, sometimes reporters are on a really tight deadline,

468
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:41,520
so they may not do as much preparation as they should, which sometimes makes the interview a little bit rough.

469
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,909
Right. Like that's a great opportunity for you to again ask for clarification.

470
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,959
If you don't know what they're what they're trying to get you to say, ask them.

471
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,080
Make sure that you have a clear understanding of what they need from you.

472
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,780
A question to you. Hello. Would you describe this for that?

473
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,500
Apparently call environment is like a phone interview for somebody who's going to write.

474
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:09,440
And now that we're in a world where there's like three podcasts per journalist and live stuff,

475
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:16,820
like how is it different to think about whether to do a recorded or a live interview and sort of what sorts of stuff do you need to know?

476
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:24,979
So they still so this type of like live interviews, they still don't happen as much as like I will say,

477
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:31,010
they don't have it as much as like a phone interview or responses, but it's happening more, right?

478
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:35,389
Exactly. Like stuff that we're podcasts. People want a Zoom interview.

479
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,800
You'll have a Zoom interview that's going to be displayed on CNN.

480
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:43,459
Right. The pandemic has been a good thing and a bad thing for that.

481
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:49,370
Right. So now you have other considerations. If you're going to be on video, you got to think about your background, right?

482
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,950
You're not going to in most cases, they don't advise you to do a blur background or things like that.

483
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,189
So thinking about what you're wearing, what's in the background?

484
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:04,009
Do you have books that shouldn't be back there? Do you have a michigan Public Health logo in the back?

485
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:09,590
Right. Oh, we had it last when Dr. Fauci was here.

486
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:16,339
You know, we did an interview, right? Like we were trying to find all of the Michigan public health things to put in the background.

487
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,960
So they knew that he was here. And then we had that branding in the background.

488
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:29,479
So your comms team or yourself may do that depending on what the situation is, but those are things to think about, right?

489
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:36,050
You're not going to go on camera wearing a brightly striped outfit that's like a big no no.

490
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:42,740
So think about things like that, what you're wearing, is it something usually a darker colored,

491
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:51,470
less printed item is going to be the best thing when you're thinking about video or live stream or broadcast.

492
00:48:52,550 --> 00:49:00,050
Also, another thing to think about. So for podcasts, understand what type of podcast it is, right?

493
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:05,540
So I think of the example of Population Healthy. The Schools podcast is heavily edited, right?

494
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,780
It's a conversation. So what actually happens is it's a conversation.

495
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,910
I interview someone and then I edit it to sound like it's just the expert talking.

496
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,840
So is it a heavily is it a heavily edited podcast?

497
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:26,750
Is it a train of thought podcast? Are you discussing there technically live with someone and then that just goes straight to the podcast.

498
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:34,330
Those are all considerations and things that you should do in your preparations before you actually get into the interview.

499
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:40,459
Think about those things because that's going to change how you work on it, right?

500
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:45,290
If it's heavily edited, you can stop. You can say, You know what, I don't like the way I said that.

501
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,390
And then you start to run it again, right?

502
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:55,210
You have that ability versus train of thought where you got to be on a piece of news, other people, but not as minded businesses.

503
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:06,720
You got to be on your toes. And also they offer you makeup taken to look like the only person on the show like in various.

504
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:15,450
So I know people have been on Fox and would have been on Fox and the amount of makeup that Fox puts on you is far beyond what you would normally take.

505
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:22,140
It's kind of like Captain Jack Sparrow, but you don't want to be the only person on Fox who doesn't look like Captain Jack Sparrow.

506
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:33,210
So going right on camera, you may look heavily done up, but like actually on camera you won't come off as it will come off as crazy, I promise.

507
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,530
I guess pushing us a little bit because there got a lot of opportunities. I mean, you can tell me it was ridiculous.

508
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:43,400
Like I had a podcast or ever heard of it because how do you make a career in journalism?

509
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:50,020
You start a podcast. Like, what's the decision calculus for that kind of thing other than the bar two requests.

510
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:58,030
So it really depends. So I can give the examples of I have some faculty here at us that only want to do national media.

511
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,409
They are at a point, they're at a point in their career and some of them are at a point in their career where they can do that.

512
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:11,420
Right. So they get they get something from MLive or some small place in like who knows where.

513
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:22,160
Right. They may not take that, but that often allows for us as communicators to then push that to newer faculty or rising faculty,

514
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,000
which is great, because then that gives them an opportunity to discuss things.

515
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,500
And you may have you may actually encounter that as you go into jobs after this.

516
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:36,680
Right. You're like fresh meat, right? They want to get you. They want to get you in there, but you've got to do some practice.

517
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:45,410
So that's usually the case. We've got some faculty who are like, I want to do only national media, but if they're maybe not in the space for that,

518
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:54,709
we help coach them to take on media requests because honestly, the majority of media requests that you'll get are really are great opportunities.

519
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:02,370
It's practice, practice, practice, practice. It's scary at first, but the more you do it, the better it gets done right.

520
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,030
The first media I ever did local radio in Northern Ireland don't want and there are just endless stories

521
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:12,739
beforehand about a guy who hired somebody to build an addition to his house and the car driving.

522
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,280
And it turns out that the guy he hired who had done it wrong was his cousin.

523
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,940
And that's like an illegitimate child that you're the same.

524
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:24,530
And by the time I actually when I'm completely distracted, like forget about what I'm supposed to talk about, I'm really interested.

525
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:29,719
The fate of this gazebo so they don't tell me about the gazebo that was way down.

526
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,820
The what I have to say moral of the story is stick to your points because I'm like looking at my notes,

527
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:40,250
saying what I want to talk about is this insane story with the gazebo, with the child of a cousin and stuff.

528
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,070
But I guess I'll have to tell you. Yeah.

529
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:49,070
So key messages again, if it's one sentence, it's written down on a scrap newspaper, that's fine.

530
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,300
But that's what you're there to talk about. The questions.

531
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,850
All right. Well, if you have questions or let's say that you're working if you're working with like

532
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:07,330
a faculty member on like research and it's going to get published or anything,

533
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,750
let me know because I am happy to give you a crash course.

534
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,410
Like working in actually doing some exercises in terms of like specific research or things that come up.

535
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,790
You can't if you're not already. Obviously I'm doing stuff like selfishly I'm not doing like just promo for our comms team.

536
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:28,390
Follow us on social media. Subscribe to the podcast.

537
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:34,540
We've got population healthy there. Read the vector, please, because there's a lot of good information in there.

538
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,430
But if you've got questions about media or working with the media, I'm happy to answer them.

539
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,980
My contact information is in the presentation.

540
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:49,750
I would also add that don't underestimate university websites like you look at a list of traffic and you don't need to use that site.

541
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:54,190
It's not Huffington Post, but you'd be astonished how many people had a university mole page today day.

542
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,010
I don't underestimate it at all. All right.

543
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:12,100
Thank you very much. Both of the slides of canvas, right.

544
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:24,530
Go enjoy the snow. We don't the to.

545
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:30,990
I think I know what I did.

546
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:58,590
So I know that's not exactly what you said.

547
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:05,300
I think it was terrible.

548
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:17,900
Well, I think I have you know, I'm a little tired of it.

549
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:24,290
I'm not sure that I think you have to do this.

550
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:54,410
I'm planning on a huge part of it because I feel like I'm just going to do everything possible to get her out of there.

551
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:14,570
So I thought I might be able to find more information about this.

552
00:56:21,140 --> 00:57:18,190
Sometimes I guess I just wish I was like, oh, you know, I'm actually, you know, I'm not right.

553
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:23,419
I am. I know.

554
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:32,000
I've got to do the right thing.

555
00:57:41,150 --> 00:58:10,670
Well, I would say this is going to probably look like I guess I don't know.

556
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:40,580
I just want to know, how do you want me to help raise money for police officers?

557
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:57,150
Now, that was really exciting, but now I got to get all of our applicants for I because that's what we do.

558
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:12,490
So I always like to raise my.

559
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:59,440
Feels like $1,000,000, less than $2 million, which is what I learned on London Street, by the way.

560
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:09,840
Wasn't very good eye to eye that she was like.

561
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:29,400
I mean, it was really expensive tuition to answer the question.

562
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:45,140
Like, I like my girls and you know, my heart has all kinds of things like that.

563
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:55,530
But this was not saying, yes, of course I can deliver my sense of direction.

564
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:35,010
So I was like, you know, I'm fine to ways where I don't even have.
