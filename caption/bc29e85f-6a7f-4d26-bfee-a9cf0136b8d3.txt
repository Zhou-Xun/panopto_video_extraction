00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,498
During this module,

2
00:00:06,498 --> 00:00:10,980
we're gonna build on our discussion
of the organization of public health,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,940
healthcare, and regulatory systems by
hearing from a panel of national experts.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,300
This panel is gonna discuss how management
of the US healthcare system, personalized

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,530
medicine and climate change are all
gonna shape public health in the future.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,550
You are gonna hear first hand
about the intersection of

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,780
public health philosophy and values
with public policy and medical care.

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,950
And, as you listen to
the panel discussion,

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,810
I want you to think about how
the core functions of public health

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,980
are really being addressed
in different emerging areas.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,080
Think about some of these questions.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,340
How are the ten essential
services impacted

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,060
by advances in technology related
to personalized medicine?

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,830
How is the role of government
evolving as part of

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,880
the ongoing transformation of the U.S.
healthcare system?

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,310
How is climate change contributing to
the need for public health professionals

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,380
to address new challenges related
to the health of populations?

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,763
Finally I want you to think very carefully

19
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:21,573
about how you would approach some of these
contemporary public health challenges?

20
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:25,703
And what role you would play as
a public health professional

21
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:28,355
to address some of these needs.
