1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,220
All right, everybody, have a nice break. Pretty good.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,860
Okay. I have written the quiz from the last time.

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:26,080
Who's number three? So those are posted. If you have any questions, you can ask me.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:32,590
Um, the graphical abstracts.

5
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,590
I've looked over some of them real quickly, and I'll have them graded by this weekend.

6
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:50,790
Was that a fun activity for you? Did you enjoy doing that? It's a way to put things in that are conceptually different.

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,340
Difficult to visualize. It makes you okay.

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,450
This is this is the relationship between these biochemical events and this immune response.

9
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:12,040
And it related to nutrition. And it helps you capture the idea or it forces you to summarize your ideas in

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,230
a visual format that provides a visual summary that you can think back on.

11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,560
And it's a it's a way to remember things more clearly.

12
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:34,840
Yeah. So I think I've always heard of doing posters like in a more graphical way, and you always end up feeling the posters with a lot of text.

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,110
But like this activity, like thought me like, okay, you can do it.

14
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,739
You can make something more visual, visually appealing.

15
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,639
Yeah. Yeah. I've heard people say, you know, if you put a word on your poster, it really needs to be there.

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:58,630
And if it doesn't, don't put that word, the words. So the posters that seem to generate the best visual appeal are those with lots of pictures.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:12,100
Yeah. Okay. So this was a classic paper in the journal Science Toll like receptor triggering a vitamin D mediated human antimicrobial response.

18
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:27,640
And before this, there was some uncertainty in terms of what exactly was important about exposure to sunlight and tuberculosis.

19
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,440
We knew that while you need vitamin D and you get vitamin D from sunlight,

20
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:45,400
exactly how sunlight and vitamin D are helping you clear infections from tuberculosis as well as other types of infections wasn't clear.

21
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,010
So this is a chest x ray of somebody who has advanced tuberculosis.

22
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:58,630
And when you look at a chest x ray and you look at the lungs, black is good in terms of this represents an air space.

23
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:08,530
So there's not a whole lot of density here. So it shows up as black and then things that show up as white have greater density.

24
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:15,250
And in this case, this could be fluid, this could be granulomas present within the lungs of this individual.

25
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,739
And tuberculosis is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis.

26
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,860
This organism here, as I mentioned last time, it's in human history,

27
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:34,389
one of the probably the most common cause of death from infectious disease throughout human history.

28
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,260
So really important organism that it's been studied in is still problematic today.

29
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:55,020
You remember you remember much about seeing pictures or hearing information about some of the things that were were buried in ancient Egypt.

30
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:06,969
King Tut, remember, you know, many information that there was tuberculosis, mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms recovered from his mummified body.

31
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:15,550
So now you've been in even in in regions of the world where there is a great exposure to sunlight, it was still a significant cause of disease.

32
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:31,510
So long ago, treatment for tuberculosis, especially infections of the skin came.

33
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,990
And this is a lupus vulgaris. This is a form of tuberculosis infection in the skin.

34
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,250
This was very problematic before we had antibiotics to treat this disease.

35
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:54,730
And this is an illustration of what this would look like. People would often get it on their face, on their neck, and it wouldn't heal very well.

36
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,360
And when it did heal, it often left scar tissue.

37
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:08,109
But to treat this a guy name for it is a guy named Meles Fence and came up with the

38
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:16,060
idea that you can treat this with light and the light came from ultraviolet light.

39
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:29,740
So he developed this machine that you could be exposed to ultraviolet light and it would in this case, it would clear up the infection on the skin.

40
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,270
And he didn't understand exactly why it worked, but it did work.

41
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:44,130
And here is an ultraviolet light source shown in the middle in this huge device here and then here telescoping from this device,

42
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:53,050
you have people with protective eyewear and the patients there being treated with that UV light to clear up the infection.

43
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:01,540
And it was found that this type of treatment prevented scarring and hastened the recovery of these individuals with the disease.

44
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:10,120
And then, you know, there are I so showed you a bunch of pictures from people who are in TB sanatoriums where they are exposed to sunlight.

45
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:18,080
And this cleared up the infection and people went from having active TB and

46
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,090
perhaps to late TB and perhaps some of them were even cured of the disease.

47
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:30,880
But before this time, before that 2006, really, we really didn't understand exactly what Vitamin D was doing.

48
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,280
Yeah. Um, are they like different strains of the regulatory?

49
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,210
Like how do you get to skin infections and not their respiratory and that.

50
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:51,990
Yeah. So in terms of the skin and respiratory tract nerves, are there strains that are more prevalent in one or the other?

51
00:06:51,990 --> 00:07:01,200
I'm not certain, but there are different strains that are resistant to the antimicrobial treatment that are really concerning and problematic.

52
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:12,510
So I'm not sure if strain differences explain skin and respiratory tract infections, but that's a good question.

53
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:23,430
So one of the things that was addressed in this paper was this idea that the macrophages and

54
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:31,099
and humans could recognize TB and it could activate the cells to become better killers,

55
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,570
better killers of the organism.

56
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:44,720
And I kind of touched on the idea that you have different ways to recognize pattern associated associated molecular patterns or patterns.

57
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:52,330
These are things on the surface of infectious agents, and they're recognized by many different things.

58
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,960
So you have extra cellular receptors that recognize these patterns.

59
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:04,760
And the one that was the focus of the paper was this toll like receptor one, toll like receptor two complex.

60
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:13,380
And this recognizes the surface of, in this case, mycobacterium tuberculosis.

61
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:22,160
You have other cell surface receptors, TLR, four gram negative bacteria and LPs.

62
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,910
The scavenger receptor recognizes charge.

63
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:33,530
Some microorganisms have a certain net charge that makes them attracted to the macrophage.

64
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:43,940
You have a glucagon receptor, so a polysaccharide in the surface of an organism can activate these cells, the mannose receptors.

65
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,490
Another thing that recognizes the polysaccharides in the surface of organisms.

66
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,660
And then you have some intracellular receptors here for a nod receptor that is activated intracellular level.

67
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:06,560
So the focus here is on toll like receptor two and toll like receptor one in terms of the vitamin D pathway.

68
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,870
So here's a diagram that kind of summarizes what we're going to be talking about today.

69
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,280
So here you have activation for like receptor one, two, two, one.

70
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:35,750
It activates intracellular signaling events that ultimately increase the expression of the enzyme that converts 25 hydroxy vitamin d21 25.

71
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:46,610
It binds to elements within different antimicrobial agents, which increases their expression,

72
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,520
and they're secreted from the cell and they get to where they need to be.

73
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,960
And where they need to be is in the fact of lysosome.

74
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:06,650
So here's tuberculosis. It's being taken up and it lives within the phagosome and here's the lysosome.

75
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:14,240
These two vesicles merge and then you have these antimicrobial peptides and antimicrobial agents.

76
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,780
Now, in this case, cases careful aside, that kills the bacteria within this vesicle.

77
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,310
A lot of other things happen in there. There's a change in P-H.

78
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:39,140
There is the production of the active oxygen intermediates and all of these things converge and kill the microorganisms within this vesicle.

79
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,290
And then here is another type of antimicrobial peptide.

80
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:55,880
This is a baited defense and the F before and it's also produced by macrophages within the cell after they've taken up in this case, TB.

81
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:04,790
Now, TB is problematic in that it can hide within the cytosol of the cells and persist for years.

82
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,700
And that's why you have the granulomas forming. The cell becomes activated.

83
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,050
It tells other cells to come to that site of infection, but it can't kill it.

84
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,790
So the bad tuberculosis lives there and it has the ability to make these vesicles

85
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,080
secrete things that prevent the lysosome from fuzing with the phagosome.

86
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,940
So let's delve into this paper.

87
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,300
It's a short but dense paper.

88
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,799
So the authors talk about this this toll like receptor, the role for TLR to cheer.

89
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,110
I want to do Central America probably activity.

90
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:54,940
I just told you the answer to the question what is TLR to one and what role does it play in innate immunity?

91
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,810
It's this hetero dimer.

92
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:11,230
It's composed of two different toll like receptors, and it recognizes microbial derived ligands from mycobacterium tuberculosis.

93
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:24,050
And activation of these toll like receptors results in an antimicrobial response in macrophages, monocytes and macrophages.

94
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:31,160
Are you are you all comfortable with me talking about macrophages and monocytes as two different types of cells?

95
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:45,220
Okay. Do you recognize this? So one is a circulating cell and one is a tissue resident cell.

96
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,560
The macrophage lives in tissues. The monocytes circulates in the blood.

97
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,870
Macrophages are derived.

98
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,190
Tissue. Macrophages are derived from actually the yolk sac.

99
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:10,850
So their origin was created in the development of a human animal.

100
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:19,710
Whatever the case may be. Whereas the monocytes, they come from the bone marrow and they're continuing circulating in your bloodstream,

101
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,150
then they die after a certain point and you replace them by producing more of the self employed

102
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:35,290
that the tissue resident macrophages have stem cells within the tissues that reproduce.

103
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:42,160
And so you've got a new population of tissue resident macrophages as they turn over.

104
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:54,060
Okay, so there are two distinct cell types. And then you can you can take those cells and differentiate them in culture so you can take a monocyte,

105
00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:01,740
give it a bunch of cytokines and culture, and it will express things on its surface that make it look like a macrophage.

106
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,000
So you'll see that mentioned in a number of papers.

107
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,430
Okay. So question two.

108
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,400
In most cases, the myriad of human innate immune system respond in a similar manner to microorganisms.

109
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,099
What are human in your macrophages different for? How are they different in regard to endogenous?

110
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:30,430
They produce bactericidal agents. Yeah.

111
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:40,180
So in my eyes, the activation of the feel our receptors is promoted by nitric oxide.

112
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,430
But that doesn't happen in human. Right.

113
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:52,330
The primary means of killing within the myriad cells is the reactive oxygen intermediates and the reaction nitrogen immediately.

114
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,540
In this case of nitric oxide that do the killing of intracellular bacteria.

115
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:03,350
Now, I think this is the way this is explained in this paper is an overstatement.

116
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:15,590
It makes this distinction where you have these mechanisms only relevant to you, to mice, and this mechanism only relevant to humans.

117
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:27,290
That's not entirely true. You can you can block these mechanisms and cells from animals and show that they're important in animals as well.

118
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:35,420
So if you if you knock out an antimicrobial peptide in a macrophage or in a whole animal in a in a mouse,

119
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,810
they're not going to clear an infection as well. But the distinction here is the mice are nocturnal.

120
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,780
Humans are exposed, active in the daytime.

121
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:57,320
And so using a mouse as a model for the effect of vitamin D and host defense against infection doesn't work very well by mice.

122
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:06,830
Mice don't need to be exposed to sunlight to make vitamin D, you have to do things to the mice to make them vitamin D deficient.

123
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:18,770
And that adds a layer of complexity to any using any experiments mice as a model for vitamin D and host events.

124
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:29,660
So human macrophages, they make these antimicrobial peptides that are important for their killing of intracellular organisms like tuberculosis.

125
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:47,079
Okay. So to add to add lots of confusion to understanding vitamin D biochemistry that enzymes

126
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:55,180
have been have received these acronyms based on their being cytochrome p450 enzymes.

127
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:06,370
So you'll see some of these things to find a sep 20 7b1 20 7b1 that's the enzyme

128
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:12,280
that catalyzes conversion of inactive vitamin D3 hormone into the active one.

129
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:19,060
Yeah. So that's the alpha one hydroxylase. Why can't we just call it F one hydroxylase, one or one alpha hydroxylase?

130
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,620
How about yes, how about catalyst side?

131
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:35,860
And it's the antimicrobial peptide, right? Mice and humans may capital aside and you might see that referred to in other papers as l l 37.

132
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:44,890
It's pretty much the same molecule. And I showed you a diagram of that earlier.

133
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:59,290
So. DFP, for I already mentioned this is better for defense and better defense for rather this antimicrobial peptide.

134
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,740
And then what does this enzyme do? The Sep 2424 hydroxylase.

135
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,440
Go ahead. Yeah. Inactivates Vitamin D.

136
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:22,010
And so this active form of vitamin D is short lived.

137
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,440
It appears it does its thing and then it's degraded to its inactive form.

138
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,190
If this is around too long, it can cause problems.

139
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,420
It can cause vitamin D toxicity. So it's activated.

140
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,690
It has its effects within a relatively short period of time hours.

141
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,910
And then it's degraded and it goes away.

142
00:18:51,450 --> 00:19:01,380
So I had a student in the lab many years ago and were looking at vitamin D, and we have we have 125 hydroxy vitamin D,

143
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:12,600
and it has a poison label on it because it's essentially fairly toxic, the active form of of vitamin D.

144
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,890
So that's why it needs to be degraded rapidly. Okay.

145
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:25,669
Now we're getting to the good stuff. So on figure one this is a question for the authors.

146
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:34,190
Assess the effects of a toll like receptor two for ligand on macrophage and dendritic cell killing event tuberculosis.

147
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:45,180
What interesting differences that they find in and tuberculosis colony forming units here in a portion of the figure.

148
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,290
Go ahead, Abby. The monocytes and macrophages decreased.

149
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,970
Those needs for the dendritic cells did not.

150
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,080
Right. But what's the difference between media and TLR?

151
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,630
Two, two, one. What's what's going on here?

152
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,959
Needs to. Dendritic cells.

153
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,980
Yeah, they present antigens. They're not very good at killing bacteria.

154
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,460
What's the difference here? It's the media like that. I interpret it and.

155
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:29,400
So yes, you're right. It is the control o that you are too that has the active, you know.

156
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,480
What is that? What does that do? So you have these receptors in the surface of the cell.

157
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,380
And here's the thing that the those receptors bind to the ligand.

158
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:49,849
What does that do? They're both recognizing that the two different forms of the ligand here in this case is the ligand.

159
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,559
And you put that in here. Yes. This is the ligand hears the bacteria grow.

160
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:06,590
But what does this do to the cells? They kill the cells?

161
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,150
Yeah, they activate the cells to kill the bacteria. That's the difference.

162
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,090
So they had a culture of these monocytes and dendritic cells.

163
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:25,600
So you envision a plastic plate with cell culture media in IT cells.

164
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,640
And then they added tuberculosis. But to activate the cells so that they can kill the bacteria.

165
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:40,820
They put in these toll like receptor ligands. The cells see that they become activated and they can take up the bacteria.

166
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:49,830
Kill it. Okay. So how does that happen and what's going on there?

167
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,400
You know, why what what downstream events occur that are relevant to vitamin D?

168
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:05,159
And that's the next question. So what differences did they find in terms of this Alpha one hydroxylase enzyme?

169
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:17,520
What happened here? So here's the the vitamin D receptor, first of all, and then here's a calcium binding protein.

170
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,290
And where we'll get to here in a minute.

171
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:30,480
What's the difference between the media alone and the toll like receptor ligand in the monocytes and the dendritic cells?

172
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:49,280
Carte blanche. Three two IP to 71 was upregulated when the expression was upregulated with the TLR two one yet was exposed.

173
00:22:49,730 --> 00:23:00,740
Yes. So in these maps you essentially take your cells and you break them open so that the nucleic acids can

174
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:09,500
be interrogated and you can measure that increase or decrease compared to some kind of a control.

175
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:21,770
And that's what's shown here in green and red means there's an upregulation of these, and that's the vitamin D receptor and then the enzyme as well.

176
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,780
And so in the dendritic cell,

177
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:34,400
we didn't get much of a change here in terms of growth and we didn't get much of a change in terms of the vitamin D receptor expression.

178
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:43,190
And then when we looked at some other things, you know, if these are these are DC Lamp and I Cam and Cd40,

179
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,680
these are important in terms of maturation of a phagosome.

180
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,990
And they they changed they increased in with the receptor ligand.

181
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,450
But when we look down here,

182
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:09,110
it shows it tells a story that this upregulation of the enzymatic pathways that convert the inactive form to active vitamin D is enhanced.

183
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:20,120
So this is the reason for this, as you said, for the Apple one hydroxylase or one hydroxylase,

184
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,960
it increases some of the other things that they looked at.

185
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,630
Catalyst Capital aside, this the peptide, there's not a change in its expression.

186
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:38,510
There's something that tells you there's something missing with this very defense and it doesn't change at all.

187
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,160
And then the enzyme that inactivates the active form, it doesn't change at all as well.

188
00:24:47,420 --> 00:25:02,120
So there's something there's some connection here between this pathway, the toll like receptor pathway and activation of that precursor vitamin D.

189
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,850
So in the bottom half they did some more experiments.

190
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,860
And they're looking at differences in monocytes and macrophages.

191
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:23,350
They're looking at the differences in those cell types and the in the enzyme for vitamin D receptor, the enzyme that they're converting enzyme.

192
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:31,420
And then they're looking at changes with just total like receptor signaling.

193
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:42,340
And you don't see a whole lot. And the E portion, there's something missing, in other words, in these in these cell cultures.

194
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,220
So yeah, you can get an activation of these pathways through the toll like receptor,

195
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:55,640
but everything has to be in place for that cell to be effective in killing the internalized organism.

196
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:13,660
Okay. So and figure two, they're looking at an effect of the active form of vitamin D in monocytes in figure two.

197
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,430
And what did they find here? Go ahead.

198
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,920
As the apple warm vitamin B increases the minus.

199
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,940
So what do you mean by that? The monocyte increase. To what? The expression.

200
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:32,920
Right.

201
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:45,850
So vitamin D increased the expression of this antimicrobial peptide, and that wasn't there before in terms of what we've seen in the previous figure.

202
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,520
And then what's going on here? That one.

203
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:59,370
In which. What is that? The. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,940
And then how about the baby defensive? And you change a little bit.

205
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,090
A little bit, but not much. Okay. All right.

206
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:23,070
So Vitamin D, UPREGULATE The transcript for capital aside and then the next portion of the figure,

207
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,160
they show another way of looking at this relationship is anybody anywhere,

208
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:38,520
everybody understand what's going on here in B and C, but, you know, so the the B is that was an intermediary.

209
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:47,820
So you can detect the cell which is expressing both Catholicity and then you can see that there is interference to that.

210
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,930
I mean, there are more prevalent problems of the self.

211
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah. Expressing those. Right. So this is the protein.

212
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,820
Right. So you've gotten the cells and they're doing flow cytometry.

213
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:07,739
So the cells are are Permian lysed and then they put an antibody that recognizes capital

214
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:17,370
aside and they can detect on a cell personnel basis which cells are producing cattle inside.

215
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:24,810
And so you get here's the here's the control, and then you get a lot more cells now that are producing inside.

216
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,950
So this is the protein itself, not the message for the protein that's going on here.

217
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:35,370
So that's a way to detect it. And then what's this high tech business here?

218
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,360
What is this you familiar with mass spec?

219
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:50,160
Yes. This is a very high tech way to determine the presence of a protein.

220
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:57,749
Okay. So with this method, they could confirm what they saw.

221
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:07,520
With flow cytometry, there's a possibility that you could have an antibody that recognizes other things that look like cattle a aside.

222
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,150
So this is another way to confirm that the protein is indeed upregulated with that treatment.

223
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,670
So anybody want to walk through this figure de.

224
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:46,170
You know what's going on here. Go ahead, Abby.

225
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:53,310
I don't think this is right, but that's okay. It's a reflection of the capitalist idea.

226
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,290
And this is the 64 most reactive where the infection curve.

227
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,310
Like where the infected cells were. Yeah.

228
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,390
So this is just one monocyte. Right. And they took in this case.

229
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,650
Um. This is an organism that is like mycobacterium tuberculosis.

230
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,049
And they got it to express a green fluorescent protein.

231
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,410
That's what GFP stands for. So you can see it, in other words.

232
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:31,870
And, um. This particular organism doesn't cause disease in humans where tuberculosis does.

233
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:39,910
So doing experiments with live tuberculosis is very challenging.

234
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,990
You have to do it in a specialized facility that.

235
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,900
Limits what you can do. So that's a biosafety level three laboratory.

236
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,390
Okay. We have one in the seventh floor.

237
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:07,370
In those facilities, you can have live tuberculosis in there, but that live tuberculosis can't leave that facility.

238
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:16,100
You have to kill it before you move it anywhere else. Okay. So if you want to kill it and then extract the DNA from it, you can do that.

239
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,710
But you can't take it out and do additional experiments.

240
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:28,460
And most of these facilities don't have all the equipment that you would need to make to do these types of experiments.

241
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,620
So this organism has the same characteristics of tuberculosis.

242
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,260
So you can study this outside the the level three facility because it doesn't cause disease in humans.

243
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,580
That's difficult to cure. So that's why they did this.

244
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,020
That's why they use this organism. And then the red stain is capital aside.

245
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,290
So you take the cell, you add that bacteria, and it makes cattle inside.

246
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,150
And they visualize this essentially they permeable as a cell.

247
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,150
They took the cell. They stuck it down in cell culture dish. After the experiment was done.

248
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,819
They washed away the cell culture. Media fixed the proteins with like methanol.

249
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:21,020
They put methanol for a little while, wash that away that permeable cell, and then they incubated the cell antibodies against the cattle inside.

250
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:28,070
And then they could detect that with a red floor floor under on the back, on the antibody.

251
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,830
And that's what you see throughout the cell cytoplasm. You see cattle inside its intracellular.

252
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,860
And then 5068 is a marker for monocytes.

253
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,340
And when you overlay these images so you're doing these experiments under a microscope

254
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:53,840
and you have a way of flipping channels that allows you to visualize different colors.

255
00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:03,950
So you have a way of catching with the different lenses in the in the microscope green.

256
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,160
And then you change the lens and you get red. You can capture red and then blue.

257
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,510
And then you can take all of these images and acquire them into the software in a computer.

258
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,660
And later on. Lay them on top of one another.

259
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,910
And like you said, the catalyst side staining and this cell is most intense, right where the organism is.

260
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,320
Okay. So that's what's going on up here.

261
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,860
What's going on down here? Now, this is tuberculosis that we're looking at here now in terms of.

262
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,290
An experiment with monocytes and vitamin D and tuberculosis.

263
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,600
So what's going on here? Here and figures e.

264
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:15,490
And figure e. Go ahead.

265
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:26,890
I think the tuberculosis bacteria decrease the cargo side and peptide concentration increase.

266
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,380
Yes, right. Showing that it kills.

267
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:37,190
Bacteria. Yeah. Right. So they did that.

268
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,930
They they made that determination two different ways.

269
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:59,190
The first way was they incubated the bacteria with this uracil in your cells, essentially a new way to assess incorporation of essential elements.

270
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:12,030
I believe it's a nucleic acid that would be a measurement of the growth of the bacteria in culture.

271
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:21,570
So you have to do all of these experiments because it's tuberculosis, it's live tuberculosis in this enclosed facility.

272
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:32,940
And the equipment there has to be used in such a way that it can't leave the laboratory.

273
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:41,339
And you want to make measurements of the bacterial growth that would tell you something about the viability of the bacteria.

274
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,540
And one way to do that is to measure, as is still taking up nucleic acids.

275
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,210
And if it isn't, that would indicate there are probably fewer cells live bacteria there.

276
00:35:51,450 --> 00:36:00,570
Okay. So capital aside, this killing shown here with less your cell uptake and capital aside and it's killing because there's less colony forming X.

277
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:19,810
And then after they did the experiment here, after several days with the bacteria starting here with vitamin D here,

278
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:28,340
here cells now that are treated with vitamin D and you're seeing that with vitamin D, this that bacteria doesn't grow.

279
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,800
But if the cells are just cultured with media alone, they do indeed grow.

280
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,270
So you have more tuberculosis within that cell culture.

281
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:47,690
Okay. And they're growing inside the cell. So if you were to image that, you would see a whole bunch more of these within living in the cytoplasm.

282
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,210
And again, tuberculosis has that mechanism that it can prevent the cell from killing it.

283
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,670
And that's why it's so problematic in terms of causing infection.

284
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,830
You add vitamin D into the picture and enhance their ability to kill that.

285
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,900
Okay. Okay.

286
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:17,420
So. Figure three in this figure.

287
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,950
Figure three The authors examined the effects of production.

288
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:32,240
25 This is the precursor of the active form. 2553 on toll like receptor one two until like receptor one two on catalyst side nnamani.

289
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:42,680
What did they find? Go ahead, please.

290
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,140
Well, Lisbon. Lisbon, I'm sorry I messed up your names all the time.

291
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,010
Thank you very much.

292
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:59,660
So when both the inactive form and the toll like receptor were added to the monocytes, the catalyst setting already was upregulated.

293
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,790
And this did not occur when it was either one individually.

294
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:12,990
Right. So on the left you have the way they measure RNA of transcripts is the fold increase.

295
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,550
Okay. Because you can't count individual RNA molecules.

296
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:24,540
So you get a signal. The signal can can form can come in the form of radioactivity.

297
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,110
It can come in the form of a green fluorescent protein.

298
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,440
And you can measure this by a relative change.

299
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:39,850
So here's the control condition. No vitamin D, no toll like receptor agonist.

300
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,840
And they set this value to one.

301
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:53,790
And then they have the like receptor or the vitamin D precursor to vitamin D, and we get an increase capital of side message.

302
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:00,390
So it increases to a greater extent than here.

303
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:08,430
Now that what they should have done here is just to put a star here to say this was statistically significant, but they didn't.

304
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,760
Because you look at that and you think, well, duh. Yeah, of course.

305
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,180
It's three fold. It's three fold. It's more than the control.

306
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:23,750
But, you know, when you do experiments and you're comparing bars like that, you should always indicate statistical significance.

307
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,879
And, you know, it's it it is.

308
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,260
But they didn't put it in there.

309
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:41,940
They said it in the the caption, the active form of vitamin D is formed which upregulates the inactivating enzyme in the combination and then.

310
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:58,490
How about here? What's going on here? In Fig. three, B and C, where the treatments here are dual calf serum and human serum.

311
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:15,330
Yeah. I got it right this time. Yeah. There was a greater increase in the capital of science and RNA in the human serum like the, uh,

312
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:24,760
last year because, uh, there's more like vitamin D in human serum compared to you don't have there.

313
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,200
Yeah. Yeah, that's a big change.

314
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:35,830
Um, so before this, they were doing all of these experiments in fetal cancer.

315
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:47,049
So in order to keep the cell culture alive, you have cell culture media that has things like glucose and amino acids.

316
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,640
Glutamine is particularly important.

317
00:40:49,090 --> 00:41:04,000
You have the correct physiologic p h, you have minerals, you have other things, growth factors that come from the fetal cancer.

318
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:10,810
One of the things Fidel Castro has is not as much vitamin D, and that's what was shown here.

319
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,219
So when they took serum into blood,

320
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:23,410
they made serum from the human blood samples and they found this robust effect and the

321
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:28,780
levels of vitamin D were much higher in the human serum than in the typical cancer.

322
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,470
So and you said why there's more vitamin D in the in the serum from the humans.

323
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:46,490
Okay. So let's move on to Figure four.

324
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:52,040
And in this experiment, they're working with human alveolar macrophages.

325
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:58,549
Okay. So they switch cell types on you and they switch bacteria on you.

326
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,060
And I have to stop and say, okay, this is why they did this.

327
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:11,540
Okay. So human alveolar macrophages are cells that live in the alveoli in the lungs,

328
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:22,040
and they're specialized cells that are really important in tuberculosis, in the infection, in the lung.

329
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:33,020
Okay. This is the first cell that will encounter the bacteria that can actually kill them under the right circumstances to get these cells.

330
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,770
You have to do what's known as a Bronchoalveolar.

331
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:43,280
Labarge So I've had this done in me four times as a research subject.

332
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:55,940
So what they do is they take a scope, which is with a camera, and they have also another tube with that scope.

333
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:09,290
It's about this long and they give you a drug that kind of numbs up the reflexes in your throat and in your actions they throw out,

334
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:20,350
I should say, within your. And the airway in your throat such that it can relax.

335
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:27,819
Okay, so you inhale this stuff and whether you have a nebulizer and it gives you this this drug,

336
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:34,150
it numbs this area, and they put this thing up your nose,

337
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:39,190
down into your throat, your navel pharynx, and then you say, ah,

338
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:46,420
and you open up your voice box so that the probe can go down through into your trachea and into your lungs.

339
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:58,120
And then they take a volume of fluid sailing and they put it into a lobe of your lung.

340
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,270
And it's cold. It's very cold. And you can feel the sensation when it's in your lungs.

341
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:11,500
And then they suck out the cells and they put a vacuum on that tube and they pull all the cells out.

342
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:21,690
And they'll do maybe they'll withdraw the the probe and then they'll put it in another lobe of your lung and they'll do the same thing.

343
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:28,500
And from maybe three or four washings, that will cover millions and millions of cells.

344
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,730
So it's not a trivial thing to do.

345
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:43,170
You can actually cause significant damage to somebody's vocal folds and their lung if you're not careful with this.

346
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:50,340
So I've had this done on me four times to retrieve these human alveolar macrophages.

347
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,580
I was a postdoc. They gave me $150 every time I served as a subject.

348
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,970
So that was the incentive. So.

349
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:11,670
So they took these human alveolar macrophages from a number of patients, and in this experiment, they cultured them with the things shown here.

350
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,240
So what are it?

351
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:20,759
And that's what does that. So they have human serum again in all the conditions.

352
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:31,600
But what are those two different agents that they use? Yeah.

353
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,320
So that party, Ari, can block the GOP points of view on this.

354
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,160
Change that if they're going to make it. Yeah.

355
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,970
That also is the reality of what this.

356
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:58,220
The reason for that. We are right there blocking the converting the hydroxylase in step and they can block the vitamin D receptor itself.

357
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:07,270
So it's lots of it's actually an electric competitive inhibitor.

358
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,299
It's a competitive inhibitor of vitamin D.

359
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,380
So it binds to the receptor, prevents vitamin D from binding to it.

360
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:20,290
And then so here's that. In this case, you have human serum.

361
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:28,510
So there's vitamin D there. Right? And with human serum and the toll like receptor ligand, you get an increase in capsular side,

362
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,880
but it's blocked when you block the enzyme that converts vitamin D to the active form.

363
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:46,739
And then here they block the vitamin D receptor. And so, yeah, you see the same thing.

364
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:53,340
There's an increase in capsular side and when we block that receptor, we see no increase in capital aside.

365
00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:07,790
So it's actually the vitamin D now that's doing something to enhance capsule inside and production and a very specific selective focused experiment.

366
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:12,080
And then they repeat the killing study. Why do you think they were?

367
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:21,140
They've already shown us previous experiments where cells could keep could kill tuberculosis in culture.

368
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:34,410
Why did they do it again here? Why do you think they wanted to repeat that experiment?

369
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:44,360
Didn't they make the point already? Yeah.

370
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,810
Well, that way it was specifically demonstrating that it was the VTR that was having the effect and not.

371
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,160
Some other factor. Right. Right.

372
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:01,390
So it's another way to confirm what they've seen already, to rule out any other possible explanation.

373
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:09,670
And it's empirical evidence that, yes, it is indeed the vitamin D and that is having this effect.

374
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:17,080
The other point about that is it's the human alveolar macrophages this time,

375
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:23,290
the the cell that's actually going to encounter tuberculosis, the bacteria in the lung.

376
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:34,420
And then so when you block vitamin D, either by in this particular case, they're blocking the receptor binding to it.

377
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,790
The bacteria grow as they do in control conditions.

378
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:52,330
But when we're human serum with a TLR to TLR one agonist or ligand, you actually see a degradation in growth over four days.

379
00:48:53,710 --> 00:49:01,480
So these experiments are tricky. They take the bacteria grow very slowly and they're killed very slowly.

380
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:08,830
So the length of time in which you measure these changes in colony forming units is are several days.

381
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,060
So they're growing intracellular very slowly.

382
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:23,020
These changes occur more rapidly. These changes in terms of cattle side and upregulation can occur within 12 hours.

383
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:31,490
Okay. The next set of experiments are really interesting.

384
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,450
So. This particular set of experiments.

385
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:45,710
They are measuring vitamin D in two different groups of individuals.

386
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:54,620
So what was the difference between Caucasian and African-Americans in regard to Serum 25 Vitamin D3 levels?

387
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:01,160
Go ahead. I mean, Americans were deficient in implications and insufficient.

388
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:07,450
Yeah. Yeah.

389
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:11,080
So there it is. So.

390
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,930
That's what I mentioned earlier. If you have a higher level of skin pigmentation,

391
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:31,310
your exposure to sunlight or takes longer time in sunlight to get vitamin D levels up and they demonstrate this.

392
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:39,200
Do you think this relationship would be different if it were done during another time of the year?

393
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,950
Yeah. In the long in South Africa.

394
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,970
Precise definition, perhaps. I don't know about deficient, but they would be they wouldn't be around 80.

395
00:50:53,030 --> 00:51:05,740
Let's just say that right up here. So how about part E of the figure?

396
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:14,850
Why not? What did they find here? Go ahead, Ilana.

397
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:25,880
The African-American green had lower levels of the chocolate inside that marinate, probably because they had lower serum level.

398
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,390
Right. So.

399
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:34,790
Again,

400
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:49,010
this is a proof of concept in a more real world situation in terms of physiologic levels of vitamin D in serum and how there might be differences.

401
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,200
So it makes it relevant to the human condition in terms of susceptibility.

402
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:06,589
And then in this particular figure, they're showing us, if they supplement with exhaustion,

403
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:13,400
this vitamin D, now that you get an increase and this increases, careful aside.

404
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:22,459
Okay. So for people with highly pigmented skin that immigrate to the United Kingdom,

405
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:30,230
Canada, United States, you're going to see lower levels of vitamin D in circulation.

406
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:36,350
Okay. So in those groups of individuals, they may benefit from a supplement.

407
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:47,509
Now, I'd have to see more data to see what might be going on with chronic diseases that are associated with vitamin D deficiency.

408
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:59,420
But from what I told you last time, from the perspective of here's everybody and large groups of people who might be susceptible,

409
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:05,330
who take vitamin D supplements don't appear to benefit in a measurable way.

410
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:16,160
Do you think that finding might be different if we focused on groups that we know might have greater susceptibility to the deficiency?

411
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,970
You know, we may see like greater benefits.

412
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,900
Right. You might actually see a benefit in those groups of individuals.

413
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:36,040
And again, it doesn't have to be African-Americans. It doesn't have to be even people with dark skin.

414
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:46,440
If you cover up your skin all the time and you live in a cloudy, cold environment and you are an are older than 65.

415
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,350
Very. It's possible that your vitamin D levels will be down in this range.

416
00:53:52,610 --> 00:54:03,810
Okay. So and, you know, when it relates to susceptibility to infectious disease, it's also an important thing to note.

417
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:11,580
So not only the classical effects of vitamin D, but susceptibility to respiratory tract infections.

418
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:18,620
Okay. So we went through this.

419
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,950
Um, sorry. Can you explain? Um.

420
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,410
Again. So if you take.

421
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:31,280
If you take the serum from these individuals who are deficient.

422
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:41,420
And when you, when you culture the cells with exogenous vitamin D, you get an increase in capital aside.

423
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:47,240
So that's what's shown here. I think this is all human serum.

424
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:50,360
These are all done in human serum, not Fidel cancer.

425
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,560
So that's why this is different than what I've shown you before. Okay.

426
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,000
All right. So here's the summary.

427
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:16,830
So the author, the guy who made this these original experiments, who did these original experiments, humans then came up with the summary.

428
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,600
And here is the macrophage here.

429
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:27,840
And there's a total like receptors like receptor two, talk receptor one.

430
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,840
They're being recognized by the cell.

431
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:41,730
And the toll like receptor pathways involves an activation number of activation steps.

432
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:49,210
So the toilet, the bacteria now are taken up and they are living in this phagosome.

433
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:55,320
Okay. And in order for this cell to kill these things, it needs help.

434
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,910
And it gets help from what's going on over here.

435
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:14,370
So the talk receptors activate the cell close to the nucleus and you get an increase in the enzyme that produces the active form of vitamin D.

436
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:24,870
You get some. Here's what's going on. And that's about a hundred of the enzymes are located.

437
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:35,610
These are cytochrome p450 enzymes. So the they we're getting activation of some mitochondrial events here.

438
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:41,820
And there are other things going on in terms of cytokines, L15, interferon, gamma that are important,

439
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:49,709
but it's the active form of the vitamin D now and then an increase in the

440
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:55,440
vitamin D receptor that lead to the formation of these antimicrobial peptides.

441
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,330
And the one that was the focus of this paper was Capital Sidon.

442
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,940
Another term for this is L 37.

443
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:13,560
And in other systems where not the cells that were they were studied, other cell types, there's an increase in beta defense.

444
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:21,960
And with that, the cells now are able to kill intracellular mycobacterium tuberculosis.

445
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:31,010
Okay. And then because this has can potentially have toxic effects.

446
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:34,950
Okay, um. Here it's here. It's saying it.

447
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:43,110
I, of course, is responsible for the upregulation of the inactivating enzyme whilst actually that the, the,

448
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:49,790
the active form itself fashion enhance its expression and it turns off the active

449
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:57,170
form and then the cell goes back to a resting state after the infection is cleared.

450
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:06,980
So before this time we knew sunlight was important, vitamin D was important, but it really wasn't understood how this happened.

451
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:17,840
So within your lifetime, this discovery was made in terms of vitamin D being important against infection, and this is the mechanism.

452
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:29,840
Now, since then, you'll see all kinds of advertisements for vitamin D being some kind of a magic bullet or a wonder drug to treat infectious diseases.

453
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:34,880
Okay. And if you have a deficiency, perhaps it'll help.

454
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,910
But from what we know from population studies, that approach doesn't seem to be effective.

455
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:50,600
If we focus just on people who have a deficiency, maybe we do find a benefit.

456
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:56,810
But what else is going on in people who have who might have a deficiency?

457
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:04,880
So the population say, oh, these people over here have a deficiency who might be in that group?

458
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:11,120
Besides people with highly pigmented skin. And then.

459
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,060
So then again. Yeah. The elderly. Right.

460
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,130
Or HIV? Yes. It's an important distinction.

461
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:28,650
So people who have HIV are very susceptible to tuberculosis and therefore they

462
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:34,710
perhaps are also may have issues with having sufficient levels of vitamin D.

463
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:40,950
So that kind of complicates the interpretation of these studies, right?

464
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,930
You've got a lot of other things that are going on.

465
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:51,300
If you were to ever control those other events, perhaps you'd see a beneficial effect of exhaustion as vitamin D.

466
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,350
But because of that background, it complicates things.

467
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:08,130
So the idea that we all become deficient in the wintertime or maybe maybe insufficient, is a better way to describe the condition.

468
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:15,900
And where we set the threshold for vitamin C insufficiency is also important,

469
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:23,880
should be less than 50 NANOMOLES And if you say it's got to be 70 now, more is your threshold with and a lot of people would be insufficient.

470
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:37,169
And then the important thing is, if you were to consider what vitamin D does in terms of bone homeostasis,

471
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:41,969
you'd look at how that is correlated with parathyroid or thyroid hormone levels.

472
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:47,460
Right. Parathyroid hormone levels go up when you reach a certain a certain threshold.

473
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,120
So that's an important distinction.

474
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:56,670
You know what's going on physiologically when vitamin D drops.

475
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:11,230
So you may have seen a lot of information in the popular literature about vitamin D and COVID 19.

476
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:17,500
And in the very beginning of class, I showed you an example of a study that received lots of attention.

477
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:27,159
And in terms of antimicrobial peptides and viral infections, they seem to be important antimicrobial peptides.

478
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,330
If you knocked them out in an animal model and you infected with the virus, they're more susceptible.

479
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:37,380
And in humans it appears that it's important.

480
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:44,050
They're important in influenza infections and maybe other types of viral infections.

481
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:49,720
But for COVID 19, I don't know.

482
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:59,169
The data and COVID 19 are confounded by a lot of other factors that would increase

483
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:04,960
your susceptibility to having a more severe infection with that type of organism.

484
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:17,960
All right. So that's the the vitamin D classic paper and what I'm going to talk about in Vitamin D in this semester.

485
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:30,080
So where do you go from here? Are you all going to run out and grab a bottle of vitamin D or are you going to

486
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,900
get sunlight and consume fluid with supplement with vitamin D in the wintertime?

487
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:46,750
What's your approach? So I grew up in a warm climate and I am not used to the winters,

488
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:57,340
so I always try to take supplements and just like use the little lamp just to try to avoid some of the effects, like seasonal.

489
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:08,610
But I don't know. I read a couple of papers that also vitamin D associated with like depression and other symptoms like that.

490
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:12,040
So I wonder if it has to do with the immune system.

491
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:21,060
Yeah. Yeah. So with those associations, what other things could be related to depression?

492
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:31,000
In lower vitamin D levels. Little something like.

493
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,970
So that just a little sunlight can be related to friction.

494
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:39,840
Yeah. Yeah. Just not seeing the sun in general.

495
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,170
It's this time of the year. Here we are. Yeah, it gets cloudy.

496
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,390
We're in the Great Lakes region. Right.

497
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:53,910
And it's cloudy between now and, you know, gets worse in December, January, and then it clears up a little bit in March.

498
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:00,720
So that's that's depression. That causes depression, too. So that might be just confounding.

499
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,650
It could be. It could be. So tell me about this UV light you have.

500
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:14,040
Oh, so it's like a movie that I forget how many like he has, but yeah, I've been trying to use it and he helps me a little bit.

501
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,510
I don't think if I get to the levels of, you know, like happy means that I get in the summer.

502
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:24,620
Yeah. Yeah, but it does help. Yeah. So how long are you for?

503
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:28,649
30 minutes or something like that. Usually it's just like 15 minutes in the morning.

504
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,770
It's extremely bright. You're not supposed to really look at it.

505
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,090
Oh, yeah, but it wakes you up in the morning. Yeah, it's really dark.

506
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:40,050
So is it about. About this big. About the size of an impact? Small?

507
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,380
Oh, yeah, but they're like older sizes. They're bigger ones. Yeah.

508
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,910
Okay. Interesting. Just like an experiment that I started, like, two years ago.

509
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,830
Okay. So anybody land was studying this sunlight exposure, and I don't remember what their outcomes were.

510
01:04:56,310 --> 01:05:05,010
So if you go on the on nutrition suite, there's an office or what was an office, um, next to Nancy Poulter.

511
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:09,570
Nice office. And you notice that sometimes it's really bright in there.

512
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:19,420
So I believe in that room there is a device that, um.

513
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,980
Produces light that has the same wavelengths as sunlight.

514
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:33,020
Hmm. So she's used that room to tell you to use in her studies.

515
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:41,120
Now, I haven't asked, but I would imagine if you could go in there and get exposure to that light and you feel better, you know.

516
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:45,499
But this is an ongoing an area of investigation.

517
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,300
And to get to answer the question, you have to take care of it.

518
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:53,810
You have to have a way of controlling for these confounding factors.

519
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,060
So that's that's challenging.

520
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:10,520
So the other thing I want to mention about vitamin D and human history, you have a lot of people from countries where a lot of the populations,

521
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,390
highly pigmented skin, people from Africa, people from India,

522
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:20,870
and they immigrate to North America and they immigrate to Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe.

523
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:33,320
And this is where you see a lot of people or a higher percentage of people from those areas getting infected with tuberculosis.

524
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:39,950
But there's another thing besides exposure to sunlight and highly pigmented skin, and that's more of a social cultural thing.

525
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:51,140
So if you are in a lower socioeconomic class, how might that affect your exposure to organisms like this?

526
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:06,010
Go ahead. I think we talked about in a previous class, like people of lower socio economic status might live in close quarters with people.

527
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,700
So like the change in effect level at higher. Yeah.

528
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:17,080
Your exposure is higher in tuberculosis.

529
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:23,890
The prevalence of tuberculosis in Africa, especially South Africa, is particularly high.

530
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:30,219
And in HIV has been discussed as a potentially causative agent.

531
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:35,140
But there's also a lot of mining that occurs in some of these South African nations.

532
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:42,560
So the miners work long hours in confined quarters that are dark.

533
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:51,310
Right. And there if one of them has tuberculosis, all the other people working there around that individual could get it as well.

534
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:55,720
And they're exposed to dark, damp conditions.

535
01:07:55,990 --> 01:08:05,380
And that makes perhaps a condition of insufficiency or deficiency, even though when they get outside, they can be exposed to sunlight.

536
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:08,920
But if you're working long hours, you might not get enough sunlight exposure.

537
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:15,760
So that's another thing related to socioeconomic status that might affect what

538
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,270
you've seen in terms of it being more prevalent in certain parts of the world.

539
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:30,300
It's it hasn't gone away. People were was a point in the eighties where the number of people infected with the regulations was going down and down.

540
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:36,960
Public health efforts to it was a public health effort in the eighties to completely eliminate tuberculosis.

541
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:42,540
And funding was shifted away from the program.

542
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:49,500
And then we saw an increase in TB. And it's it's risen ever since.

543
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:54,330
It's the controls in the last five years perhaps has gotten a little bit better.

544
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,840
But it is still highly prevalent disease and it's very difficult to control.

545
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:05,190
And now there are antibiotic resistant strains. And if you have one of those.

546
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:09,540
Your chances of survival are significantly decreased.

547
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:14,429
I'm not sure how that's handled, but if you have an antibiotic resistant strain.

548
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:18,000
So this is an ongoing problem. Okay.

549
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:26,510
So I will be grading your graphical abstracts on next couple of days.

550
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:37,310
And then next week I'll post the reading for our discussion of vitamin E and B and then A paper weekdays.

551
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:45,800
Okay. All right. So I will see you on Tuesday and enjoy your weekend.
