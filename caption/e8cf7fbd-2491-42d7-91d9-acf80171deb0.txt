1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:15,360
In this segment, we will talk about a few implications of our work for nonresident African-American families and men's health.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,880
We have made progress in terms of considering fatherhood as a component of men's health.

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:29,080
Since the publication of a commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2006.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:40,180
This commentary suggested that illuminating the psycho social fabric of men's lives may reveal critical links between fatherhood and men's health.

5
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,550
This was a tremendous boost to the type of research that we do because oftentimes

6
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:54,880
people don't consider fatherhood as a social context for understanding men's health.

7
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,150
When we consider African-American men's health

8
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:09,570
there are a number of influences that impact the outcome. Structural influences, for example, when we look at this

9
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,260
we're talking about barriers to medical service utilization.

10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:22,290
There are a number of reasons why there's reluctance on the part of African-Americans to engage with the health care system.

11
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,270
This often comes from the idea of medical mistrust that resulted from the

12
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,720
public health service Tuskegee syphilis study that would lasted for 40 years.

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,040
Racial discrimination experiences within the context of the health care system is also

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,070
something that serves as a barrier and then poor relationships with health professionals.

15
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,570
These are all areas that are receiving a lot of attention

16
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:56,340
now as we try to understand more about engaging men, particularly African-American men, in the health care system.

17
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,240
There's also a historical legacy of slavery and fatherhood. Here

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,280
men African-American men were not allowed to be a part of their families.

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,580
They lived separately from their families and they also did not have the opportunity to marry.

20
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:23,490
This created boundaries around African-American families that has resonated in even in today's society.

21
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:31,560
Another area in modern times is when we have governments influencing family behaviors.

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,190
This has to do with in order for a mother to receive benefits at one time the father could not live in the household.

23
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,250
Therefore, forming family unions became challenging for a long time

24
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,400
throughout the history of African-American family life.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:58,380
These changes may have been made today that help improve those conditions, but the legacy that it leaves behind remains.

26
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,660
Another area, where people live matters for health. We know that's critical.

27
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,000
One of the challenges is that when you're living in neighborhoods where you're experiencing high levels of violence

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,160
it has implications for your health.

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:20,970
Researchers demonstrated physical health, such as blood pressure cardiovascular disease, are influenced by these stressful environments.

30
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,880
Researchers also demonstrated the protective effects of families.

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,630
That's the area that we spend a lot of our time focused on

32
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,150
and we think about directions for future research in this area. Here

33
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:46,080
we are concerned with the role that children in African-American men's health decision making might play. In considering this

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,270
we look for what stage of child development may be most influential.

35
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,340
There is research to suggest that men pay more attention to their health behaviors

36
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,430
and engage in more positive health behaviors when they become new fathers.

37
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:10,570
Our research focuses on the preadolescent stage for the father, because we are concerned not only about the father's health

38
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,980
but his help his health influences on the child.

39
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:24,640
We also ask ourselves for what type of health conditions or behaviors might engaging children work for fathers?

40
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,660
One of the things that we found in our work is that boys, African-American boys specifically, are very aware of their fathers

41
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,370
for example drinking behaviors. In an activity that we had any intervention

42
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:43,780
we had a role reversal scenario. Fathers were interacting with their sons as if they were peers

43
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,920
trying to set up dangers from peer influences while sons were recreating what they saw were

44
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,010
kinds of conditions they saw when they observed fathers engaging in drinking behaviors.

45
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:05,580
This became a hallmark of our intervention in terms of helping fathers request services for drinking behaviors.

46
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,450
The specific characteristics of the child matter for the father.

47
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:17,290
We're looking at gender, for example. That's why our intervention is limited to fathers and sons.

48
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:27,070
We want to understand something about the son's role in influencing fathers health, as well as the fathers role in influencing son's health.

49
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,230
Determining racial, ethnic, and social similarities and differences in these experiences

50
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:43,800
will broaden our understanding of men's health. In any work that we do, we're always interested in the implications of that work.

51
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,850
One big area for implications is policy based implications.

52
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,500
Here we are concerned with what types of policies are needed to assist nonresident

53
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:03,550
African-American fathers overcome structural barriers to family involvement.

54
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:13,540
A big area of concern is addressing disparities in socio economic statuses in the child support payments system with nonresident fathers,

55
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:23,580
This is a key area of concern. Also implementing systems that reward responsible fatherhood behavior.

56
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:33,340
There is research that suggests the public reaction to nonresident fathers typically is that they don't expect them to be responsible fathers.

57
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,820
And this is a falsehood, and this narrative really needs to be countered in terms of understanding something

58
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,720
about those fathers who are responsible that their behavior should be rewarded.

59
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:55,350
Also, consider changes to support more equitable opportunities for non-custodial fathers involvement with their children.

60
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,540
Most often people think of moms as the primary caretaker, which she is.

61
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,640
But the support from fathers can also be an important influence for the outcome

62
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,340
of families and also supporting the parenting efforts of low income fathers

63
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:19,470
specifically. Low income fathers are often not viewed as very protective of their children

64
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:28,710
and these are areas that are beginning to change with the new research that's focusing now on this idea of nonresident low income fathers.

65
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:41,190
So therefore, supportive policies encouraging contact with children and families may have positive benefits for African-American men's health.

66
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,900
The other area for implication is around services.

67
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:54,900
If we were looking at services that we were providing to families, we would want to understand something about what might be helpful here.

68
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:05,430
Here we consider changing attitudes towards nonresident fathers as negligent, apathetic, uninvolved and outside of the family.

69
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:16,740
These negative views have implications for how service providers approach engaging fathers in the services of their children.

70
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,810
We've determined that nonresident does not mean uninvolved.

71
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:32,310
We've identified almost 400 involved fathers who don't live in households with their children and who are very much concerned about the

72
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:40,560
care of their children. Don't overlook fathers as protectors and providers and services to children,

73
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,040
including children's health, children's mental health and child education.

74
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,060
All of these have implications for how fathers can be engaged to help protect their child.

75
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,620
We know that co parenting is necessary to benefit child's health.

76
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,410
Mothers and fathers must work together.

77
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:11,010
There are interventions that focus on this issue of co parenting because of the critical need for mothers to allow fathers to be

78
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:18,810
engaged with their fathers and for them to work together in this co parenting effort in order to protect the child's health.

79
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,390
An important area that we discovered in some of our work had to do with clinicians and

80
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:31,260
whether or not they were ready to be able to participate in the work of their children.

81
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,700
We had colleagues focusing on, therapists specifically, that were developing treatment plans for children

82
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,070
and they had not considered the role that fathers could play in this area.

83
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,860
When we did focus groups with clinicians,

84
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:54,390
they told us one of the things that was a barrier for them was that they did not receive training in how to work with fathers.

85
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,400
They had training in how to work with mothers and

86
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:04,590
they had lots of trainings in working with diverse populations, but they did not have training in how to work with fathers.

87
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:13,390
This is certainly a shortcoming of our educational system for training clinicians to be able to work with families.

88
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:23,090
Question. Are you convinced that nonresident African-American fathers can be positive resources in their son's life?

89
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:38,870
What would you do differently if you were working with nonresident African-American families?

90
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:48,320
We continue to do this research because we believe that fathers are an underused resource for protecting children's and family health.

91
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,980
This is especially true when working with nonresident African-American families.

92
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:02,810
Our belief is that when you effectively involve nonresident fathers and families, you strengthen families

93
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:10,310
and ultimately, communities. Critical to this process was understanding what was important to

94
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:16,760
the families involved. Using a community based participatory research project

95
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,080
process was vital to our success. Using this process

96
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:27,620
we were able to understand from the families we intended to work with perspective what their challenges were,

97
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,540
as well as what they thought would be helpful to address those challenges.

98
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:40,490
We worked with our community partners to understand more about the community in which we were working and how families were involved

99
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:54,020
engaged in living. These were invaluable experiences as we tried to develop a curriculum that would be relevant to the populations of interest.

100
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:05,340
I hope you've gained a sense of new knowledge about thinking of family systems as a critical social determinants of health for your future work.

101
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:15,020
I thank you for your attention. And in this last slide, it lists a number of our collaborators in this work.

102
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,600
This is the type of work that you don't do alone.

103
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:28,340
And we have people representing both the university, the community, as well as our research steering committee that guides this work even to this day.

104
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,100
Our team has expanded and changed over the years,

105
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:40,810
but we typically have a core group of people who are committed to doing this work because this work cannot be done alone.

106
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,400
Thank you.
