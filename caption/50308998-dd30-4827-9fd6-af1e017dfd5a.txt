1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,520
In observational epidemiology. Individuals experience so many different risk factors for an outcome at one time.

2
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:26,420
They're often co-occurring raising the question of how do we differentiate the impact of one risk factor from another on our outcome?

3
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:36,320
In previous videos, we used dogs to detect crude associations between an exposure and an outcome, as well as other factors.

4
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:44,660
On that graphic, we saw how we can found causal associations and non causal paths between different variables.

5
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,700
We're calling that the non causal paths or ones that introduce confounding.

6
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,790
In this video we're going to talk about different analytic strategies and the representations

7
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:00,560
in Dags to show you how you can remove confounding using analytic techniques.

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,650
We're going to talk about how you can reduce and eliminate confounding through stratification.

9
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,870
Identify how to close open paths between two variables in a DAG.

10
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,670
And then we're going to talk about how to analyze Dags to identify minimal sets of confounders needed to prevent confounding bias.

11
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,980
For this particular video, we're going to talk through an example on childhood education and diabetes and later life.

12
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,490
As you might imagine, the quality of a childhood education doesn't occur in a vacuum,

13
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:42,890
but rather it often happens differently between people of different socioeconomic status and other characteristics of place.

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,510
That might be alternate explanations for crude associations between education level and diabetes and later life.

15
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,480
So let's start by drawing ourselves one of our nice tags here.

16
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,000
I have low educational attainment as a possible risk factor for diabetes.

17
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,020
I've put a question mark on there to show that we're asking that question on a dog.

18
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,319
I also have included socioeconomic status as a common cause of educational attainment and

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,469
of diabetes through poor access to healthy foods in addition to socioeconomic status.

20
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:29,690
I've added on this graphic maternal diabetes as a common effect of both socioeconomic status and genetic risk, which predisposes people to diabetes.

21
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,830
So now is an opportunity for you to practice what we've learned in the past about the rules of a DAC.

22
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,790
In this DAG, we see two back door paths.

23
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,560
If you want, feel free to pause a video to look for them yourself.

24
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,629
On the first path,

25
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:58,070
we have one backdoor path that goes through the common cause of socioeconomic status because there are no colliders along the lines of arrows.

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,700
This path is open and it's likely to be a source of confounding between low educational attainment and diabetes.

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,860
On the second path, we have maternal diabetes as a common effect of both socioeconomic status and genetic risk.

28
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:23,090
Because it is a collider, that path is closed and therefore we don't expect any confounding to happen through that particular path.

29
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:32,450
So just as a brief summary, this graphic is showing us that there's going to be confounding of the association of interest by the pathway through SS,

30
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:41,390
but not maternal diabetes. In order to get the right answer between education and diabetes of that association,

31
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:50,870
we therefore must find a way to block or close the open path through socioeconomic status in order to isolate the effect of interest.

32
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,420
The most common way that we block an open path or eliminate confounding is to condition on a variable.

33
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:09,560
Now, what do I mean by conditioning on a variable? What it means is to look at a relationship of interest within homogeneous levels of my confounder.

34
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:16,880
So, for example, if socioeconomic status and income is the only confounding factor of our relationship,

35
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,510
then I should get the right answer or the right association between education and diabetes.

36
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:31,220
If I only look among those people with low income, or if I only look at people who have high income.

37
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:42,710
Now, why does that work? Well, what's happening is that I'm effectively breaking any kind of covariance or relationship between income and education,

38
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,410
because I'm only looking at one level. Right. I basically are restricted to people of low income.

39
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,940
And so therefore it's not really varying with education any longer provided that there is no effect modification,

40
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,160
which means a different association between education and diabetes by income status.

41
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,969
The average of each of the associations among low income people and among high income

42
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,340
people should get me an unbiased estimate of the true and confounded association.

43
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:23,390
For example, let's take this data. Imagine we have information collected on education and diabetes risk in a prospective study.

44
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:30,200
What we can do is we can estimate the risk ratio for diabetes between those of low

45
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,130
educational attainment as compared to those of higher educational attainment.

46
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,780
On the top, what we do to make that ratio is we estimate the risk of diabetes among those with low education.

47
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,200
So basically 172 people divided by 567 total.

48
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,430
And that's the risk of diabetes among those with low education.

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,049
Divide that by the risk of diabetes among those with high education.

50
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:04,010
So 60 over 352. And what we get is a crude risk ratio of 1.8.

51
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:15,710
When we stratify the data by income status, you can see that the associations between education level and diabetes conditional upon income,

52
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,990
is about 20% lower in each strata than what we saw in the Crude Association.

53
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:29,090
Honestly, this shouldn't be surprising to us because what we see is that people with lower educational attainment

54
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,780
often have lower incomes and people with lower incomes are often at higher risk of diabetes.

55
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,280
Therefore, what we have are two positive associations shown as these two plus signs our DAG,

56
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,880
which introduces positive confounding that inflates the Crude Association as compared to the true.

57
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:57,070
Although stratification is a very helpful exercise, especially when you're first learning epidemiology,

58
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,140
the reality is, is that epidemiologists rarely do our analysis by hand.

59
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:12,370
Rather, what we use are multivariable models in which we accomplish our stratification by including our confounding factors in our model.

60
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,490
In other words, we're adjusting for those variables.

61
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,720
Here is an example from the literature where somebody was looking at educational attainment and diabetes,

62
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,430
just like the question of interest we've been talking about. In this particular table,

63
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:36,460
what I want you to see is that on the left we have the unadjusted model with our reporting odds ratios for the Crude Association,

64
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,379
where they see that there's a much,

65
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:46,870
much higher risk of diabetes among those people with lower educational attainment as compared to those people who had bachelor's degrees or more.

66
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,050
However, as I started to include more and more confounders into their models,

67
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,979
effectively stratifying on them, you can see that the associations got weaker and weaker again,

68
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:10,000
showing us that there is a positive, confounding or an inflating of the associations that we're observing between educational attainment and diabetes.

69
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:21,010
Now, one of the questions that we have, of course, is which variables do we need to adjust for and how many variables do we need to adjust for?

70
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:28,989
Therefore, I want to bring you back to our dogs, because one of the ways in which dogs are extremely helpful is identifying again which

71
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,520
factors we need to adjust for and how many of those factors we have to include in our models.

72
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,850
So in our scenario, recall that confounding occurred via the back door path between education,

73
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:46,460
socioeconomic status and healthy foods and diabetes to block the open path.

74
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:55,350
What we need to do is condition on a non collider variable along that path to indicate that we're conditioning on a variable.

75
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,340
What we do is we draw this box around the variable here shown for socioeconomic status.

76
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:07,660
If this variable is a non collider, then conditioning on it which is effectively the same as stratification,

77
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:14,530
prevents confounding to occur via that association because it blocks that back door path.

78
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,580
So just to kind of drive home that point one more time,

79
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:28,000
what you see here is that conditioning or stratifying or adjusting for socioeconomic status will block a previously

80
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,550
opened back door path from diabetes to educational attainment via socioeconomic status and healthy access to foods.

81
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,390
We only need to conditioned on one non collider on a path in order to close that path.

82
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,969
What that means is that I could have just as easily conditioned on poor access to healthy

83
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,760
foods in order to close our backdoor path between educational attainment and diabetes.

84
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,910
Interestingly, I could have conditioned on either one of them or both of them.

85
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,210
Inherently, it is not problematic to conditioned on two non colliders on a path.

86
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,150
The only potential issue is that you might lose precision or power of your ultimate associations

87
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,980
of interests because effectively are splicing your data more thinly than what's required.

88
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,680
As such,

89
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:32,080
the optimal adjustment or minimal adjustment set for confounding would be either to adjust for socioeconomic status or poor access to healthy foods.

90
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,100
Importantly, I want you to note that you do not need to adjust for maternal diabetes or genetic risk

91
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,140
because maternal diabetes was a collider and prevented that path from being open.

92
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:53,959
So no confounding would occur via that pathway. So one final caveat before we close out this video is that adjustment for the right

93
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,830
variables doesn't always imply that there's going to be no confounding at all.

94
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,860
What can happen is that if you have a confounder, that's a continuous measure here.

95
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,820
For example, income. Income is actually not a low or a high thing.

96
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:17,540
It's a continuous measure. And so if what we're doing is conditioning on or controlling for or adjusting for low versus high income,

97
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,900
we can still have confounding by income because of that variation within each of those groups.

98
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,630
In summary. Conditioning on a non collider will close a back door path and eliminate confounding.

99
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,570
Conditioning during our analysis can be accomplished via stratification or multivariable modeling.

100
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:44,020
And finally Dags can be used to select the minimal number of covariates required to remove confounding.
