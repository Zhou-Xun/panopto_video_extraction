2
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:11,051
In this segment, we're gonna go through
the steps of outbreak investigations and

3
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:15,912
how they collect information that
communities need in order to take action.

4
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:21,092
There are ten basic steps, preparing for
field work, establishing the existence

5
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:26,440
of the outbreak, verifying the diagnosis,
defining and identifying cases.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,410
Describing and orienting that data
in terms of person, place, and

7
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,360
time, developing hypotheses
of how that outbreak started,

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,370
evaluating whether or
not those hypotheses are true.

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,790
Then actually refining the hypotheses and
carrying out the additional studies that

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,810
would allow, the epidemiologist
to actually implement control and

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,650
prevention measures, and
communicating those findings out.

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,800
Rather than going step-by-step
through each one of these,

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,670
we're gonna take a few of these steps and
go deeper.

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,530
For instance, step 2, which is
establishing the existence of an outbreak,

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,010
actually starts with an understanding
of how severe this outbreak is.

16
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,310
And whether or
not an outbreak is really happening, or

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,760
is it just a few sort of anomalous cases?

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,830
So, what are the things that actually
figure into the existence of an outbreak?

19
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,890
It's an understanding of the severity
of the onus, the potential for spread,

20
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,930
the political considerations, how much
public concern there is around it or

21
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,560
pressure around getting to
the bottom of that outbreak?

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,960
And then there is a whole
set of public relations

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,380
that has to be figured in even at step 2.

24
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,370
Because as disease pops up in a
population, there's not only the community

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,650
that's at risk, there
are the businesses that may have, for

26
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,020
instance, served the food or
had the food on their shelves.

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,975
There's the political consideration for
how this plays out,

28
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:03,230
cuz nobody wants to point
the finger at somebody

29
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,850
when we don't actually know for
sure that that's the culprit.

30
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,670
So there's a whole set
of things that's step 2,

31
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,740
that are about assessing
kind of the playing field.

32
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,250
Step 4 which is fundamental to this
whole outbreak investigation and

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,040
actually is a part of sort of key

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,740
concept throughout all epidemiology
is the idea of defining a case.

35
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,740
So what are the aspects
of a case definition?

36
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,870
How would you know somebody who
had a stomach ache was a case,

37
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,710
versus somebody else with
a stomach ache was not a case?

38
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,640
Well, it starts with the clinical
information about the disease,

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,990
the characteristics of
the person themselves.

40
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,168
Where were they?

41
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:46,850
Who are they?

42
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,810
Another piece of information is
the place where individuals were.

43
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,410
So if you think about a natural epidemic
that might happen in a conference setting,

44
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,370
where the salad may have
some E coli on it or

45
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,670
something well, who was at the conference?

46
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,760
When were they at the conference?

47
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,057
And then those pieces of information,
person, place, and

48
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:13,354
time, actually provide
a fundamental I'll call it triad,

49
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:18,010
for epidemiologists to look at
with that clinical information.

50
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,358
This is a little tricky in practice
because most of the things that are,

51
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:27,213
I'll call it noticable by and individual,
whether or not they feel nauseous,

52
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:32,290
whether or not they have a fever,
other sort of symptoms like diarrhea.

53
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,200
Those are natural to
many different causes and

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,070
may actually not be part of the outbreak.

55
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,060
That tracking information itself,
that person, place, and

56
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,680
time in a map itself, can be important to

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,630
both communicating as well as to the so
the scientific enterprise.

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,887
So here's an example of
the pandemic in 2009 that was put

59
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:01,936
on to the world wide map, so
that people could see actually

60
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:06,903
what cases were showing up when and
who was getting them.

61
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:11,765
So the sixth step in developing
a hypotheses always has to focus

62
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:15,708
on what we think is the real
source of the agent, and

63
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:20,960
then how is it transmitted,
was it food was it person to person?

64
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,150
Was it basically on some kind of other

65
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,220
mode like a vector or like Zika virus
where it is transmitted by mosquitoes.

66
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,440
And then what are the other exposure
that are associated with the disease?

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,910
Was it going to a conference was it
visiting a particular location in Florida.

68
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,840
And then that is what then
sets up the proposal to start

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,220
the evaluation,
of how those hypotheses can be tested.

70
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,370
The ninth step is implementing
the control measures and

71
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,420
the prevention measures once we've
identified what is going on.

72
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,666
These are very practical, this is how
do you stop the spread of disease,

73
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,420
how do you stop the current epidemic?

74
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,930
And these measures often are sort of
messages to the public of what to do.

75
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,150
But they also have messages to,
for instance,

76
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,700
City Council or State Legislature,
or maybe even Congress.

77
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,310
And those primary controls of the disease
spread is what is the big focus.

78
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,220
This is often not an easy step
because you have to get buy in,

79
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,120
both from the everyday person as well
as from the leadership in an area.

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,710
To give a code a more proximal example of
this I wanna go back to the H1N1 pandemic.

81
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,940
Imagine it's 2009, and maybe you're
the president of the university,

82
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,850
at the time it was Mary Sue Coleman.

83
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,750
And when the actual
information about the H1N1 flu

84
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,390
spread hit Michigan, the real
question was, what are you gonna do?

85
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,540
And so the University of Michigan
pulled on it's natural strengths,

86
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,770
started to give information to students,
staff, and faculty by setting up websites.

87
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,160
Then got a pandemic response team, but

88
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,460
as things were moving in the state and
in the country, in comes football season.

89
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,540
So the question I like to ask students
is okay, if you're in charge and

90
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,090
there's a big football game coming, and
there's this worldwide pandemic, how many

91
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,880
deaths from that pandemic does it take, in
order for you to call the football game?

92
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,180
That's not the only way in which
leadership works with the community

93
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,500
partners, or for instance, in that case it
was the University of Michigan partners.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,840
There's also getting the message out on
how to do this prevention, and there's

95
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,320
whole fields of health behavior and health
education that also moved into action.

96
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,260
And so, we started seeing in all bathrooms
and in all locations different signs

97
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,800
that had been created,
that gave people the necessary clues

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,250
on how to cover up the cough,
cover up the sneeze,

99
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,560
wash your hands, and not spread it to
your other friends and colleagues.
