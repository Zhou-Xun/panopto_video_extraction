1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
okay good afternoon. I need to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
said they were gonna be talking about the US health care system um and I just

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
wanted to know before I start my PowerPoint today is based on some previous lectures and been

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
given in this class um. bye. a number of experts. um Doctor Evans Austin

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is a faculty members here in our wealth management policy program. a doctor plan

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to at the for school. um and Doctor Marianne who Gupta last to be talking with

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
us one week for today joining us for a conversation. so I wanna make sure to acknowledge

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
their contribution. I also wanted to share a few

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
sources of information on some of my files today are holes from these various sources.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
if you could also be really great sources for your papers which I know you all are almost

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
done with their due in like ten days so just kidding. but when you started those papers

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you might wanna rely on some of these um websites of these organizations

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
um there's a number of health related laws. um I've tried to pull

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
a few from across the political spectrum. um. so um

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
do you have a variety of sources to look at and so

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I encourage you to to check out these resources both your phone education and

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
um in for your paper I also sent

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
out another resource on um yesterday for your paper we

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
present it over to a size and some students have talked about particularly following the

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
mid term exams. I'm was some awkwardness or I'm just concerned

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
about writing about race or writing about ethnicity or bringing about. I'm

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
historically disenfranchised group. so we sent out a website. it's

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
a page from Hamilton College. we can they have some really great information

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and advice on how to raise him about race about ethnicity about clouds.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't remember sexual are you teaching is on there not but but that's another resource for you to look that is

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
your job to get your papers. I'm gonna talk for a minute and give you all a moment

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to turn off your laptop and put away yourself

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
okay here's the outline of the lecture today. I so I mean it's certainly

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
just kind of some general statements about the folder with providing the overview of

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the health care system some of the schools some of its challenges

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and just some notes about its complexity that I'm gonna go through and talk a little

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
bit about. components of the health care system. I'm gonna

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
spend some time talking about health care financing I sector friends will talk a little bit

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
about some components of health care financing and his lecture on a gene that we're just gonna expand

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
that conversation a little bit and then um at the end of lecture we'll talk a little bit

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
about what it is for the US health care systems. if there's time

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
left over your to collector. um and I think shopping today once you

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
do just keep a few questions in mind on some things that you might wanna kind of go back to

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
him here's a question who's responsible for providing

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
medical care when is the. whose responsibility is that who

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
should pay for needed medical care. do we think about

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
medical care is arrange for a commodity plus not really these

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
questions from your books for the chapters they your sign from today. I'm chapter twenty six and twenty seven

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and the textbooks and I think I mentioned in the past I've been working with this class. this is my

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
ninth fall. I just read the text book every year um but in preparation

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
for my lecture today next week. did read those chapters again and I think they're really good and I would

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
recommend that you read um. particularly if you are interested in the health care

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
system or if you're really interested in more kind of moral and philosophical

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
issues about health care. there's a couple of key studies where it talks about kind of what

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is the public interest in health care. for is a particularly good chapters

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
so if you kinda got away from the textbook free need. I am but you're interested in engaging with these questions

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
are kind of other debates about the health care system. can't take some time reach to after twenty six and twenty

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
seven. okay. um I

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
just want to know what kind of why we're talking about the

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
health care system sometimes people think that this conversation is a little bit and jeans and the public health

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and so I wanted to bring in our review those ten essential public health services

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that we talked about a lot earlier in the semester when I talked about what his public health.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
we talked about the three kind of core functions of public health and then the ten essential

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
services that were associated with that. I'm in each seeing and features and yellow

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and essential services the yellow and services from my perspective has something to do with medical

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
care or health care or people who operate in that system so for

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
instance certainly doctors have a rule of doctors and nurses and health educators

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
have a role to play in educating people about health issues.

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
number seven linking people with needed personal health services and providing care when it's

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
when it's not available. this is a function of public health and again easy um kinda demonstrate

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
the intersection between public health and medical care.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
okay. um so

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
kinda funny not funny I've heard the best laughter is medicine. that's because care health system is a joke

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that you folks in the hospital waiting room. um to think that my

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
kind of um kind feed into this but we don't the sentiment I mean ones

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
they don't have any idea about why health care system is such a joke or such a mess where some things

72
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that make it kind of kind of the subject of a political cartoon.

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
okay absolutely it's been in the pluses in the news a lot it's kind of a hotly debated

74
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:26,000
political topic um but there's not doesn't seem to be a resolution that's pretty

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
fantastic to spend a lot of money in health care in this country eighteen percent of our gross

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
domestic product is spent on health care costs that's an enormous amount of money

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and as you said in at some of the data have today shows we don't have the best um

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the best health care. the best health. I'm working some the best metrics house for

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
all that money we spend. time getting here in the mind

80
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
great to despite all of that not not a great thing but a great observation. I'm despite

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
all the money we we spend despite some of that um how

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
many never health care system but some politicians and how great it is um not all people have the

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:23,000
same on access and there's differential health outcomes last one.

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
yeah yeah there's a lot of hoops to jump through you don't know who to call you don't know where to call you don't know what

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
your place rely on us. there's insurers and copayments and just complex.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
so yes the people kind of it some point you kind throw up your hands and um and seems like a joke

87
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
um. so they you do you have helped your son and also we're spending

88
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
one lecture on this. when I was a master student in public health. I cooking entire semester long

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
course up on that um. so this is really just gonna be a small or quick snapshot

90
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
of what the health care system looks like but if you think that to say kind of overall I am

91
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
in united states we have a market based system with some components of governmental

92
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
oversight. the system is very complex it's convoluted and

93
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
the patience and probably even as the provider to be really hard to navigate

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
in the united states there's not a single point of accountability. so there's no agency

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
or agency or organization that is charged for insuring the overall

96
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
quality or efficiency. um on the health care system. so

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
there's no single agency was responsible for that I miss which isn't

98
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to say that isn't organized organized between number of different sectors and there are some components of the government

99
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that oversee different components on the health care system but it's not centralized

100
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and so that's what your system has four goals are gonna talk about them and kind of four

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
categories. um this is the first ball in the octumom quality of life.

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
so we so the health care system why you received medical care. into that

103
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you can live a longer healthier life. um so we want people to

104
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
be able to live long and prosper. we want them to have the maximum which you know ball

105
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
house in syllable initial care system to help the poor people and leading longer healthier

106
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
life. another goal of the um healthcare system

107
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
we might think about the system performance and we would think about the performance

108
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
of the system like who has access to care. are the costs are reasonable

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
is the quality of care that people receive is it good quality is it evil quality

110
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
across people 's equity in things like quality

111
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
of care and access to care is it responsive is it is the right kind of care

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
the rank senior of providers available to people when they need that medical care.

113
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
it do think about whole those kind of things as the system performance. because

114
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
it seemed you know a little bit more about quality of care specifically. I'm kinda something you

115
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
might be thinking about in your papers. um the institute of medicine

116
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
publish a report a number of years ago where they just find six elements of quality of

117
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
care. chair should be safe. good quality care is affective.

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
it is patient centered. so it takes into account. really has a starting point

119
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
the needs of patients of preferences of patients I mean sensitive to the cultural

120
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
um the cultural or religious perspective purpose perspective is the patients it's it's really

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
focused on patients. it is timely.

122
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
it is the fish and and again and it's equitable. so again those are six six elements

123
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
we might think about what we're trying to understand what a good quality of care is those

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
are six different comments that we might look at

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
another time kind of framework for thinking about that kind of overall system performance.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
another in situ this is from the Institute for health care improvement. they put out

127
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
a framework called the triple team him and it's a it's a it's a goal

128
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
or something to us to um to to try to means to try to achieve. it's

129
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
about self optimizing health system performance so according I each

130
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I I they believe that any designs or anything so focused around improving health

131
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
care should achieve these three aims so improving the patient

132
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
experience of care both quality and the satisfaction

133
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
care should improve the health of the population. we should be focusing on population health and

134
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
innovation care. when we look in trying to um innovate around um healthcare

135
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
we should be thinking about per capita cost. so the cost to the patients to

136
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the overall cost. I'm up here so really thinking about those three things.

137
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
's is another way of thinking about the kind of system performance. um and

138
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
effort of the system performance. okay. so other in

139
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the form also improving quality of life. thank you about how the system performs

140
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
a circle is kind of winging the costs and benefits of care so is the cost

141
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
of the care doesn't have reasonable benefits are the benefits do they justify

142
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
the cost. when you provide different types of care and there might be um

143
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
there might be some drawbacks or some negative things about that but that that does the benefit of that

144
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
share way those drawbacks. um. is the amount of money

145
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
that we're spending on a specific type of care does that what is kind of the bang for

146
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
the buck so that's your friends about talked about and his lecture on aging that we spend a lotta lot of

147
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
money in the last six months of people 's life on those laces stating

148
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
measures interventions to try to prolong the prolong

149
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
life and save off death is that a good investment of our resources um

150
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
is that something that we really should where we should be spending money. I'm a lotta money at the end of

151
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
life. maybe something to think about and

152
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
then the first call I've a health care system is to reduce the structural flaws. so

153
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
their number of flaws that are kinda built in to the structure of our health care system.

154
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
some of those things and would include the financing of health care system. I'll talk about in a little bit how

155
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
it's financed. we have a fee for service system for the most part. so

156
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
every time every time you see a doctor every type of intervention every test that is offered

157
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
for the cost is associated with that and your book chapters for today

158
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
talked about um sometimes um one of the concerns from one of the reasons the health

159
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
care costs and the med health care costs and you know if they're so high is because physicians

160
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
are worried about being sued so there's concern so there's because the cost of malpractice insurance.

161
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
that's one cost and then another factor of that is that because of concerns around malpractice

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
some sometimes doctors practice what we call defensive medicine. so because they don't

163
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
want to be sued because they don't wanna patient coming back and saying why didn't you test for this

164
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
or why didn't you prescribe that treatment or why did you investigate this time.

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that sounded aggressive. um some um physicians will kinda

166
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
will prescribe more things do more tests try to do more diagnostic procedures

167
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
in order to avoid being sued. so that's that's another

168
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
another flaw. um another example of

169
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
a structural flaws is just how um the allocation of

170
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
allocation of services or the organization of services and providers. so

171
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
we providers are located hi if you if you live in an urban center

172
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
if you're from Boston you're or from New York City. you're from urban area.

173
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
there's a lot of medical providers the loss of specialty care. um but there are fewer

174
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
providers less access to specialty care if you medical resources in the rural areas.

175
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
so that's the flaw of our system and something that we should think about trying to trying

176
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
to reduce. okay.

177
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
have kids some has a lot of problems um and again I've kind of organize them into the chip for

178
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
large for the cost of care after

179
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
us to care access so you can access to care in coverage. um the quality

180
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and accountability and then racial and ethnic disparities. you know she give us an example

181
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
of each he said the cost of care is the largest

182
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the most significant challenge facing the health care system today um there are twelve

183
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
euros that makes that number is three trillion dollars three trillion

184
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
dollars the annual cost of care in the United States I said it was about eighteen percent

185
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
of our gross domestic product and that's three trillion number was actually

186
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
actually dated it up to this point that statistic was from the twenty fifth month I think the next

187
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
slide. yeah shows that that's hot cost reach around three or three trillion

188
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
dollars in twenty fifteen and it's growing on the so the side

189
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
of shows both the total and the per capita spending have just increased

190
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
exponentially so on the access at the bottom of the grass

191
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
is eight years. I'm starting from nineteen sixty to twenty fifteen

192
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and then on the right-hand Y axis is the total spending billions. so

193
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
three thousand billion or three trillion dollars. um that is that total

194
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
spending on health care cost and then on the left-hand um Y axis

195
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
as the per capita funds. so it's not just that folded there's more people

196
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
population is greater than it's suburb and so all of course we're spending more money on care. no

197
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
this line shows actually that the per capita cost of the per person cost of healthcare

198
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
are also rising. also so you see the per capita cost him

199
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
in the twenty fifteen you was around ten thousand dollars per person. so around ten thousand

200
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
dollars per person per year. it's been on health care in this country.

201
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
um document from the second problem

202
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I ask the steakhouse accidents coverage in here is difficult for many individuals

203
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
particularly working class individuals besides it's honorable populations. um but we really

204
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
see differences in access to care and be able to afford care

205
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
really is is most problematic for him so the low

206
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
SES and other historically disenfranchised population. 's

207
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
is this graph shows the um percentage of people who report putting

208
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
off medical street because of the cost. this is a Gallup poll. um

209
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
showing that again in twenty. this is twenty fourteen. the last year that there was data

210
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
one in three Americans said that they were putting off treatment um because of the

211
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
cost because they couldn't afford it. where we seen an example

212
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
of that in this class really we hear someone talk about that earlier in the semester because

213
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:10,000
anyone remember

214
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the example I'm thinking of it is from uh the second week of the discussion section

215
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
when we watched a natural because the studio and one of the um the women who

216
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
was profiled in that video Mary Turner she was the older white woman who

217
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
um who did it work with us and volunteering had two young children at home um and she talked

218
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
about she was gets milk meals or sometimes delayed her medication

219
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
not take her medication as often as she needed to because she was trying to extend the

220
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
life of it. she kind and for all the medication when she needed to.

221
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
you think that that's something that happens for one in three Americans. that's pretty incredible.

222
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
um I remember when I was um taking like US

223
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
healthcare systems there was a news story about

224
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
a young boy who um who had an

225
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
infection in his mouse and by the time that his

226
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
he was able to seek medical treatment for it um. 's is I think a seven year old boy he

227
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
actually passed away. he died from an infection in this mouse that was that

228
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
you came to him that is seventeen is that should not have been life-threatening

229
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
should not have been feed all um the because it was able to go on so long because it was treated

230
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
because his family wasn't able to access it needed medical care. the seven year old boy

231
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
living in the United States died. um from to construction.

232
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
so certainly not all of these cases with you know I'm but knowing how many Americans

233
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
delayed treatment because they're not able to afford it they might not have physical access to a health

234
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
care center. I think that's a pretty starts

235
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
um another problem with our medical system is that the quality and accountability

236
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
are inconsistent and poorly to measure um some part of it is something

237
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
that's really challenging to do when we think about what is good care experience is

238
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
my really very very differently for you and for I I I talked about those six

239
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
crazy. and the institute of medicine things are important and looking know all your care. um

240
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
we wiped away those things very differently and what's important to me or what's the good experience for me might

241
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
be different for you. um. also those measurements a party of care

242
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
they're timely to do how do you measure how old the interaction of the position

243
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
might have. I'm with herself and her patience. I might a be challenging to measure we

244
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
can look at medical records or other indicators that we might look at um but quality

245
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and accountability of the health care system can be challenging to measure

246
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the fourth challenge and I wanted to mention on something that we've talked about repeatedly racial and economic disparities

247
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
are increasing as the number of vulnerable populations

248
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
so this um. this crap shows the percentage of access

249
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
measures for which groups experience worst team or better access to care and you

250
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
see so would be the yellow and graph the bad news that's when people have the worst access to care.

251
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
's if you look kind of across these um these graphs do see that

252
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm there are a number of indicators where those Westport income have much

253
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
worse access to care those of high income. we're Hispanic Americans.

254
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Alaskan natives. um um blacks Asians have worst albums

255
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and way or worse access to care than whites on a number of indicators um not

256
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that things look better if you look at the sixty five plus category largely due to Medicare. but we know

257
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that after care is a significant show. one of the biggest problems in our

258
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
health care system. okay.

259
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:22,000
before I move on to questions about what I presented so far.

260
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
okay. I'm talking about different components of the US

261
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
health care system. there are many components um

262
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
we might think about them broken down into these categories to think about patients.

263
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
different types of providers. there are many different types of facilities or places

264
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
where people receive care. there are many different types of services

265
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
on the different types of providers provide in these various facilities

266
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
other components of the healthcare system. I'm might think about the administration staff that work

267
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
in health care systems. government oversight on those things and

268
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'm gonna spend much time on today we're really gonna focus on these other components. um but I do wanna

269
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
know is that the kind of the governance and the accreditation and who oversees

270
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
hospitals on those other components of the whole care system. were 's gonna focus on these things

271
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
today. so who is been patient a in some

272
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
type of medical care medical or health care facilities sometime in their life.

273
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
okay. many of you who had a good experience of peace.

274
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
- experience. Texas and then you had a good experience. how that's

275
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
about it. tell us when you know why you were in the bank turned on what

276
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:56,000
type of facility you went to what kind of providers you saw and why did you say it was a good experience

277
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
yeah I

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:17,000
guess me well

279
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
yeah you got her right

280
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:40,000
uh-huh uh-huh okay

281
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
okay. alright how was your pain.

282
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
okay. alright the minimal pain well manage pain and what was the outcome. did it

283
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
whatever you wouldn't take to have a cataract address. you have a good outcome.

284
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
okay. alright so positive outcome. alright. thank you

285
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
so that's not the good health care experience. once you. okay. well

286
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I have my my pediatrician.

287
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
okay. so you have a pediatrician who you been seeing for a number

288
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
of years. you going to see her at her office and clinic.

289
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
she ask you questions. she listens to you. she asked about your physical and mental

290
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
health. you trust her. this is good confidentiality renewed. yeah. okay.

291
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
good. you know the homework of an good patient experience here another one. um I don't

292
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
know but

293
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:15,000
like a position like

294
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
something from

295
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
her extension

296
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
okay okay this is some element of your good patient experience like that

297
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
kind of the structure of the facility to be able to see other people being able to see to get

298
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
him and see other people getting treatment maybe like some good social comparison like you have good intention

299
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
questions were answered the things were explained to you. okay. I'm in some good experience you wanna

300
00:28:48,000 --> 00:29:02,000
tell you about a bad experience. yeah tell you what a bad experience

301
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:14,000
like you know

302
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you I

303
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:39,000
know like oh like

304
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
so that's terrible

305
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
yeah. a.

306
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
well they didn't really care about yeah

307
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:03,000
those reasons my life and

308
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I really

309
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
it was late at night there is probably

310
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
a lot of hard work. okay.

311
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
okay. you to hard put into words what what your team about. alright.

312
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
chocolate does not make up for that experience and sorry and you should get to him another delegates

313
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:59,000
more bottles of him.

314
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,000
so

315
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
what

316
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:26,000
yeah oh

317
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
wow okay so anyway he he

318
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
had right um but I don't know how

319
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
hard. wow right. okay.

320
00:31:45,000 --> 00:32:15,000
alright.

321
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
not

322
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:41,000
you need oh

323
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
okay so adverse reactions to medications required emergency in room visit

324
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
communication back to the provider was it like something else lost in translation

325
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
maybe bad record taking who knows. okay. so

326
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
much do you you really wanted to talk but you got good a one. okay let's do

327
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:28,000
it

328
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:39,000
uh-huh.

329
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
okay. for

330
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
are you. um so what

331
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I wanted to what I want you to take away from this conversation besides you telling us where you got treated

332
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
him are all good old boy that um. I will said that I can't miss announcements um.

333
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
so um he shouldn't there people who receive individual services and

334
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
a health care setting um and teaching the people who live lives and contacts

335
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
right so we get hurt and we get sick and weird hours of the night we go to places

336
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
that are convenient to uh we have skin issues and sometimes we have bad

337
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
medication reactions right. so pages and all of our complexity differences

338
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
and cultural practices religious believes preferences are physical and

339
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
firemen are political beliefs patients bring up all about those differences

340
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
in complexity into the health care system. okay.

341
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
another component of the health care of the medical system or the health care delivery system as

342
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
a clinical workforce. so we think about physicians. um

343
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
whether your primary care provider and Internet uh surgeon especially the sub

344
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
specialist. we have a physician. we have a nurses

345
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
nurse practitioners murder me my nurse and that's the tests and so on. I'm on there

346
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
various um dentist pharmacist ophthalmologist optometrist physical therapists

347
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and others who are providing clinical care whether the physician assistance social

348
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
workers chiropractors natural paths on the list is longer than what I have

349
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
on here. um but this is what we think the clinical workforce and the providers

350
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
who are who are offering care within the health care system.

351
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
it's present noting that there are different types of streaming for all of these different types

352
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
of providers. there's different type of medical education and the length of education

353
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
the type of education they receive. there's different codes of ethics there's different types

354
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
of requirements for continuing education. that's a ongoing more in accreditation

355
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
for each of these groups has us and some differences are some pretty significant

356
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
differences in the types of services they provide for him and any kind

357
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
of what has informed their clinical care. okay.

358
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and other components of the health care system or the many nonsensical providers

359
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
who work in the system um so all of those people. someone in reference to

360
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the front desk staff that they saw um people who work in the medical field in the

361
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
billing um lab staff people who provide diagnostic services

362
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
supports. so there's a lot of people who are employed by the health care system

363
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
or by the medical care system who are not providing care to you. but important

364
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
part of that system and keep things going. I mean who you might interact with

365
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
patients may interact with him. who who again who keep things going.

366
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
okay. another component. um I

367
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
was the um the health system and things we think about all the different types the services

368
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
that are provided. um from primary care to specialty care

369
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
diagnostic services different types of treatment medical treatment surgical treatment procedures

370
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
that you might that patients receive um from dental and vision to long

371
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
term care and the life care. Caesar. all entire different fields

372
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
but they're all together and under this big umbrella of the health care system.

373
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
the so again I think this is a long list of things you're not gonna have to regurgitate senseless but

374
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I just want you to think about when we think about the health care system in the United States and all the different

375
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
components and the complexity. we have to think about the different services that are provided

376
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
um. they're in their schools are diverse cost are diverse types providers of

377
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
to offer the services are diverse. um it was something

378
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
to think about. um and then there's a different facilities

379
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
the different types of places where people 's for care is delivered her patients receive care.

380
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
so we think about where primary care is delivered so going to a doctor

381
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
's office going for a clinical visit um going to a

382
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
community health center tickets and primary care. so that's one

383
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
primary care that is often delivered in clinic excuse

384
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
care that kind of urgent care that is needed. um often happens

385
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
in hospitals and clinics but there's a lot of diversity when we think about

386
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
hospitals most hospitals in the United States are nonprofit

387
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
community hospitals. um some some hospitals

388
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
the United States are for-profit hospitals. um

389
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the so what's when you think about that is for profit their goal

390
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
is to make money and right the bullet that hospital is to make money. so

391
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
someone is making money based on your health care experience the type of care that

392
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
you that patients receive in that setting and then there are a few public hospitals

393
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
in the United States have more government support and funding but a wide range

394
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and the types of hospitals that exist some are standalone

395
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
research is a hospital that it's kind of independently run and operated mothers are part of a multi

396
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
hospital system. more and

397
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
more these days um they're part of the larger health care system. so I'll talk about this

398
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
a little bit later but something that is increasingly common in the united states is the Congress consolidation

399
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
of hospitals and health care services so small health small and hospitals I'm

400
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
particularly those in rural areas are being um are being closer being bought

401
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
out being part of a larger health care system. um being brought out and then eventually close.

402
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:18,000
so there are fewer and fewer independently run hospitals.

403
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
this example the public hospitals we would think about the hospitals that are run

404
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
by the VA by the Veterans Administration. there's public hospitals often in urban

405
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
centers. um anyway from the Chicago area. yes with

406
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
a large large public school in Chicago area. this is one of

407
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
inertia. okay. not that I think you know that's another check

408
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
good accounting that's what I think you know kick anyhow that's what public Hospital lard one of the largest

409
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
um Ackerman other what other big public hospital

410
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
thank your friends like give me some of the names of the big public hospitals

411
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Boston city

412
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:19,000
reach me that's

413
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
okay Kelly County. alright baby big public hospitals like that often in

414
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
an urban areas places where where people can

415
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
go and read received care. um academic medical center someone said north

416
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
western northwestern would be an academic medical center. University of Michigan hospital system

417
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
on that's an academic medical center so where there's a connection between the hospital

418
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and university system that's an academic medical center.

419
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
listen to those are all types of hop different and the diversity in hospitals

420
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
when we think about clinics sometimes we think about um specialty specialty facilities

421
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
um whether those are um kind of independently like you know like a cardiac set

422
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
or surgical centers or some um private um cancer clinics

423
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
so those are places where people receive acute care. um another type of facilities

424
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
um we think about the long term care that's provided. people also people who

425
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
are going for rehab after hospitalization or maybe anytime of long

426
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
term nursing home services unless another type of facility that delivers health

427
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
care maybe another component number health care system. um

428
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
we think about nursing homes most of those are for-profit places you go into a nursing

429
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
home someone is making money off that it's the for profit states. there's

430
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
friends I talked about his EEG lecture many nursing homes. our

431
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
finance are most states in nursing homes are financed through Medicaid a large proportion

432
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
of that. um so nursing homes and rehab facilities or another kind

433
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
of components where people receive long term or long term care in the US.

434
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
okay um and then the last kind of stability group the facility

435
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that we might think about it. whose acute care. so home health agencies

436
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
agencies that employ providers usually people with some strange nursing

437
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
experience to come into your home and provide care to you at home.

438
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
we might also think about hospice care. it's it's either um home health agencies

439
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
provide care kind of again in the post acute studying they can provide some kind of

440
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
rehab maybe sometimes some physical or occupational therapy.

441
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
they are providing help use durable medical equipment. we think about post

442
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
acute care we also include things like dialysis centers um and then

443
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
a hospice care maybe not always thought of as part of our health care medical system

444
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
but certainly certainly a component um hospice care is for

445
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
terminally ill patients the people who are who are expected to live longer

446
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
than six months. minimal treatment is provided to people um

447
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
when they are in hospice care it's usually kind of more focused on comfort measures managing

448
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
pain on trying to prevent people from experiencing pain and towards the end of their life

449
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and providing you know emotional or spiritual support for him patience.

450
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
for families. um so those are hospice care providers. hospice facilities

451
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:55,000
or hospice workers to me into your home. I would be another component of our health care system.

452
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:08,000
questions about these various components or input into the health care system

453
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
so overwhelming there's a lot of different points good you can see why this is a semester long class.

454
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
okay. actually we're gonna talk about health care financing

455
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and and starting this conversation. um I wanted to this question. um

456
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
what is the purpose of insurance. what insurance and what the different types of some

457
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
of the different types are shown up our insurance health insurance. I'm travel

458
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
insurance house insurance home insurance. what what is the purpose of

459
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:54,000
insurance why do why do we have insurance policy.

460
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:11,000
please mind seem about that. keep talking you're in right track

461
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
okay prepared to prepare in what way it still happened about is not gonna keep entrances and keep bad

462
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:31,000
things from happening. if a bad thing happens what is insurance to do

463
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
exactly I'm gonna read you exactly what we can Wikipedia says insurance is a means of protection

464
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
from financial loss. it is a form of risk management used to hedge against the rest

465
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
of the contingent on the certain lock. so use the computer in your papers. I can use

466
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
us. um it was I would love the redefinition is but I thought that

467
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
was pretty straightforward. so what's the idea the purpose of insurance kids provide

468
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
you to provide protection from from this uncertainty.

469
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,000
um some kind of a negative negative financial consequences that are associated with

470
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
with a car accident with um something that something bad happens to your

471
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
house. whether that's flood insurance or fire insurance. I'm to the ideas you

472
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
don't know if your house is gonna catch on fire. you don't know if you're gonna get in a car accident

473
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
or if you are in a car accident how bad it's going to be but by having

474
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
insurance or purchasing an insurance policy. you pay a little bit of money

475
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
each month or each quarter whatever is and a lot of other people do the same

476
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
thing and it goes into a pool and then if something bad happens to you

477
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
that insurance company gives you money to give you money pays for the services that

478
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
are needed. I'm to get you back on your feet after that and they get of that.

479
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
give you some when you don't know what's gonna happen. I'm better protect you financially

480
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
from having to cover the entire cost of a new car or new bumper.

481
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
um for travel insurance and from having to pay for a new flight. um so it gives

482
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
you it doesn't provide peace of mind but it really is kind of a risk management

483
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
strategy and there are some types of insurance that you have to house freight. so in the state of Michigan

484
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
if you want to drive a car. you have to have car insurance and ski legal to drive

485
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
a car without having car insurance um other forms of insurance are

486
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
optional you can choose whether you happen or not. just want to kind of talk about

487
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
that idea of insurance. um the other kind of ADM insurance particularly

488
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
when you think about health care is who would buy. when you think that health care if you're thinking

489
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
about if someone find who would buy it right people who are worried about being sick

490
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
or people who knew they were sick. they would wanna have this policies. um so that

491
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
um they didn't have to pay the full cost of their treatment. well you we want people and

492
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
we know the people are going to get sick see if you have any health care insurance is it everyone's house if

493
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
everyone's contributing um some people are gonna get sick and use that insurance need and

494
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
some of those payments. other people are gonna stay healthy. we're not have as possibly care

495
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
and those insurance payments aren't gonna be needed but it's a form of protection for everybody

496
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
everybody who pays into it okay so I think a have I foundation

497
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
because the US health care system is a multi pairs of some that finances. so multiple

498
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
payers financing possible care. I mean we think about private insurance.

499
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
we talk about private insurance those are employer sponsored plans

500
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
because their plans that individuals purchase on the individual market.

501
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
you pay for kind of out of pocket and then another form of financing

502
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
health care that falls into that private domain. our health savings account.

503
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
talk a little bit about stuff. let me think about kind of the public.

504
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm a government sponsored plans. um we think about Medicaid

505
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Medicare. the children's

506
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
health insurance program the state children's health insurance program chip

507
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
with the weather Veterans Administration TRICARE in the Indian health service. so

508
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
these are all programs that are either financed by the federal government state governments

509
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
for a combination of the two so they're public plans. um and

510
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and then for those people who are uninsured who don't have any insurance policy. weird

511
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
is how was their chair paid for where it is that popped from there. um

512
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
they receive care and they can pay for services out of pocket

513
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,000
or they might be covered by what we call the healthcare safety net.

514
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:12,000
okay. segment. you can go ahead and help you save that

515
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and they're probably take out the slide form. I'm the health or safety net would be something like a public hospital

516
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
like clinics that are new or low cost so sometimes we think about Planned Parenthood is part of the

517
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
healthcare safety net. I'm a local health departments and some of the services provided my local health departments

518
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
are part of the safety net. so those are hello or no cost lighting scare

519
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
our facilities the providers that keep that take patience will see people who

520
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
are uninsured.

521
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
so in twenty fifteen and his number hasn't changed much. I'm about fifty five percent of Americans

522
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
were covered through private payer plan. those

523
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
private player pans again this is the green the employer sponsored insurance.

524
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
your employer pays for your plans or Missus and they're yellow

525
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
this private non- group plan so people who buy health insurance

526
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
plan on the individual marketplace because they're paid out of pocket but they

527
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
are asking for insurance. so

528
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
um so the largest single source of health care insurance

529
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
in the United States is an employer sponsored plan almost

530
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
half of Americans receive their health insurance through plans through there or

531
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
through their employer. um

532
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
that's been the case um throughout most of the last eighty or

533
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
so years. um and then fax it to biggest public

534
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
public uh health insurance plans. Medicaid and Medicare

535
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
we're really um doctor friends I'll talk about these in his previous lecture

536
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
but they were really um started to cover the two groups of people work covered

537
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
in employer sponsored plan says if your employer pays for your plans for those people

538
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
who wouldn't be covered from that people who have the age out of the workforce people who are no longer

539
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:27,000
have an employer because the retired hired so those people fall under Medicare

540
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and then who else would be employed when we cover right now people who are out of a job who don't work um

541
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
because they're unemployed they're for low income. those people were cost to be covered

542
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
under Medicaid. so Medicaid and Medicare were really trying to address

543
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
this problem. um who give it cover to by employer sponsored

544
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
plans people who are retired people who are unemployed. okay.

545
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,000
but again most people in the United States get their health care coverage from their employer. okay.

546
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
there are six government programs on the target specific population. so

547
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,000
again who groups for for the health care market hasn't met their needs because

548
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I know they have a lot of health care needs because they're low income or for a couple other

549
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
groups so I talked about Medicare Medicare and the program for people who are elderly

550
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
sixty five plus or disable him and also people who

551
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
aren't in the stage renal disease do they have kidney failure. those individuals are covered

552
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
under Medicare and you're

553
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
automatically eligible for Medicare in this country if you're over sixty five years old.

554
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
but I wanted to just note that Medicare. um well it is um well

555
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:57,000
it has a lot of advantages. I mean doesn't cover everything and many people

556
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
who are on Medicare if they're able to do so they're also purchasing an additional health care plans

557
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
to supplements. um the care that they get with Medicare so it is it

558
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
is good. it is broad but still many individuals have additional

559
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
plans to supplements the care that is provided under Medicare.

560
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I just didn't put this on the slide because they don't think we're not gonna text you wanted

561
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
somebody but you just want to know because it's something that you probably heard about the third

562
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
different parts to Medicare so Medicare part eighty. deals with hospital insurance

563
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Medicare part B is about outpatient care and physician services

564
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
um Medicare Percy talked about. um it's an alternative

565
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Canadians. it's it's a little bit messy. I'm in Medicare part he is around

566
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
pharmaceutical benefits for Medicare part B has to to deal with prescription.

567
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
again you don't have to remember that I'm not gonna test you on it but I will talk about some of the different components

568
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
on Tuesday when I talk about the affordable care act. so I just want you to know part is

569
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
about hospital insurance part fee is about out patients and physicians or physician services.

570
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Margie insurance for health care for house for prescriptions for certain pharmaceuticals

571
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Medicaid is a government program that is available for low income individuals and families.

572
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
well Medicare is paid for by the federal government exclusively

573
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Medicaid. by refinancing the combination by both the federal government

574
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and state government

575
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
whereas Medicare or you're entitled to receive Medicare benefits

576
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,000
for anyone who is over sixty five years old. Medicaid has very strict eligibility

577
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and financial requirements. so you only receive Medicaid benefits.

578
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
if you meet very soon if specific financial stressful. um

579
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
so that's Medicaid um it covers

580
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
um I think if I was a kid

581
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
so I skip the stage the state children's health insurance program um

582
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,000
it's a it's a government program um the for children um for low income children

583
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
to to receive care and encourage I you to read the section in your book that

584
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
talks a little bit more about that program and how it came to exist and how it's gonna continue

585
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
to be financed and fifteen

586
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
percent of your Federal but it goes to Medicare so a huge portion of our federal

587
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
budget goes to Medicare. um billions and billions

588
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
of dollars around Medicare. I mean see that it is possible that

589
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
the Medicare the same percentage of our federal budget as our defense

590
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
spending a huge component and then and then also less

591
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
and Medicaid and chip I mean I'm as that's that portion of eleven

592
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
percent of the budget to Medicare is a huge part of our federal budget um

593
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Medicaid and and support for low income individuals. I'm not the sense I'm kinda going through policies

594
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
um but and um talk a little bit about um some of the different types of care that are

595
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
covered under Medicaid to the long term care assistance and support for that health care

596
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
safety net and in addition some people who are duly eligible for Medicare

597
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,000
source fifty five years or older but also low income. they're duly eligible for

598
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
both Medicare and Medicaid. okay.

599
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I was can we think about it again another cartoon and this is again something that affect your friends followed us

600
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
alluded to. if you look at the slide and look at the cost of the Medicare

601
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
and social security Houston in large for a portion of our federal budget that those cost

602
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,000
containment you think about the weight of those choose social programs um the taxpayers

603
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
are married now. um they will continue to where these costs are rising and so we really

604
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
will think about do need to think about cost containment strategies. how are we going to

605
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
assist our society continue to fund these programs and to provide some of the benefits of these programs

606
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:36,000
offer um and being able to do that in a sustainable way.

607
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I'm not stunned the last they said that there are six major programs Medicaid Medicare

608
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and ship for the for three. the Veterans Administration. um

609
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
it's a large services veterans of the US Armed Forces it's

610
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
the largest healthcare system in the United States. I mean who's VA

611
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
hospitals and rehabilitation centers on the Department of Defense

612
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
is try care system that's for taxes and military personnel and or dependents.

613
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and then lastly that Indian health service which provides services to native America.

614
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
to those are the different programs that the federal government. um. that that the government pays.

615
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
okay. so though this is the chief ways that um that health care in

616
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,000
the United States is financed through one of these six government programs through employer sponsored

617
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
plans um when you just want to know that approximately ten percent of Americans

618
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
is one in ten Americans are uninsured um and that would raise up on insurance fund under insurance

619
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
are highest among racial and ethnic minorities people who've been historically disenfranchised

620
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I understood this craft shows the differences in race and insurance and

621
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
based on recent ethnicity. um you'll and see that um that for every group is statistically

622
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:08,000
significant significant difference between that group and white Americans.

623
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,000
um we're gonna spend a lot more time talking about health insurance. and the affordable care act looks on Tuesday.

624
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I'm wanted to just provide this baseline question. yes

625
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
yeah yeah those who are um who makes you much money so then they don't

626
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
they don't qualify for Medicaid benefits. I'm back of work work for an employer who um

627
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
who doesn't work for a smaller employer so in that Fire doesn't provide hello Karen insurance for

628
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
their um for their employees. that's how many they might work full-time time and they

629
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
were for a small for for a smaller company. so we don't have an employee sponsored

630
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
plan. um see um

631
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
affordable keys so there is a hard requirement for him there. are provisions

632
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
in the affordable care act for him. um for um

633
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
noncitizens on so that rates the on um Hispanic Americans are hundreds

634
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
of interest an for Hispanic Americans are a lot higher. um so for people who are undocumented. they're

635
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:34,000
not required to have insurance through the affordable care.

636
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,000
okay. um. just wanna spend the rest of her time to getting kind of thinking

637
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:46,000
about what is next for the US health care system. um seems to think about

638
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
moving for the health care system faces several challenges it faces many challenges um

639
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
the most significant one weeks eight ' um high cost of care.

640
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I'm for tax payers. um there are other challenges around

641
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
the physician and nursing shortages physician shortages about the round primary care

642
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
for a lot of concerns on that they're not enough primary care physicians. um other

643
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
challenges around the location of providers. we have a lot of certain types of providers

644
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
in some places but not the types of providers that we need in other spaces.

645
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
so it doesn't there is each of those kind of systems that I talked about each other components of the health care

646
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
systems. we could break down each of those components and talk about the challenges that are facing those sectors

647
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
such challenges to facilities how fragmented the disconnection between structures

648
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
shortage in specific types of the physicians are different types of conditions

649
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
and so there are challenges each of those sectors face. um.

650
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,000
so one of the challenges high cost and questionable quality so

651
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
this crap shows um what we wouldn't maybe consider our peer nation or

652
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
nations that we we consider ourselves that we often compare ourselves to him

653
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
and when we look across to friends measures when

654
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
we think about the quality of care. access efficiency health care expenditures

655
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and then the different measures of health and productive lives. um we see

656
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
that overall despite our high cost of care and the United States

657
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
brings seven out of seven countries across these measures.

658
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I'm so really despite high cost. um overall really for

659
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
for um poor outcome despite the fact that we

660
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
spend more on healthcare than any of the other nations and we look at these measures and other measures

661
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
of population helps of those big population house measures around the life

662
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
expectancy around infant mortality or maternal mortality and

663
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
we see that the United States does poorly so beyond what's on those grounds and

664
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
your type of talks about that. we look at the thirty countries who are part of the

665
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
movie CD. we see that you know it takes twenty seven out of thirty

666
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
in terms of infant mortality and we look at life expectancy

667
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
for men were twenty six out of thirty four and for women twenty seven out of thirty four.

668
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
so our life expectancy these big measures the population house. we're doing really poorly

669
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:40,000
as a nation despite how much money we're spending

670
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
this is again something the doctor prance but talked about in his lecture the number of Americans who are sixty

671
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
five years or older is went to more than double in the next forty years.

672
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:06,000
why is that a problem wise again you know the population a problem we think about the health care system.

673
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
yeah that's exactly right. so when people when people ages they get older.

674
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
the number of services they were fire and the cost of the south and the cost associated with those

675
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
days. also gets higher. so this is gonna have a real hostage implications

676
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
those that are sixty five years or older right now every individual in the United States

677
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
over sixty five years old is eligible for Medicare. so it's going to be there's gonna

678
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
have a real significant. our number one challenge is because we know that there are more and more older people

679
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
who costs the most. our costs are only going to go.

680
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
we also be on the cost which is the name again. we know that there are these

681
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
individuals are gonna need more care. I mention that there's really there's some significant concerns

682
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
around shortages both for physicians and for nurses are they're going to be people

683
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,000
to be here for these individuals. that's another concern

684
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
that's their challenge for the health care system is the high levels of chronic disease. we think

685
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:17,000
about um I kinda disagree with framing on that obesity itself some of the disease but

686
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
that but um he was related to obesity. we think about different heart conditions

687
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
we think about diabetes so we know that these rates are increasing so that

688
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
we we think about the health of individuals instead of the bird this um increase

689
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:40,000
the recent funding for place on the health care system. such another challenge

690
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
um and challenge him for a large number of Americans remain uninsured.

691
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
and this is a problem and something that the affordable care act box to address

692
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and something that is in some states. um the affordable care act was successful

693
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,000
in reducing the rates of uninsured but now what some of the political changes

694
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,000
that have happened around the affordable care act. there's concerns that the number the uninsured will start

695
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
to rise again. um so that's it that's another challenge for the health care system the number

696
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:17,000
of people who are uninsured. um

697
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I mention this issue she's a shortage of physicians and focuses goes on

698
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and looking specifically primary care physician um so there aren't enough

699
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
primary care physicians to meet the needs of the population that is true

700
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and that's gonna continue to be a concern

701
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
on the growth of government funded programs is not sustainable.

702
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I think it said this in a lot of different ways throughout the lecture um but we when we look at

703
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
the cost of Medicare um as a percentage of our federal

704
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,000
budget. we just know that we won't be able to continue to

705
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
offer Medicare. asked to do to people. I'm with the same range of services

706
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,000
the way that Medicare 's offers right now it's not sustainable from a financial perspective

707
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
on this and then another challenge. I'm just the US is played by pervasive health and healthcare

708
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
disparities on your writing about that then your paper all of your focusing on the different

709
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
component. I am a different house um that and could well help

710
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
out um and thinking about how the health care system um I perpetuate that the

711
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
extent to which the affordable care act does or does not address that. um this is a real

712
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:44,000
challenge that the health care system needs to continue to focus on

713
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000
um we know that for non- Hispanic whites African Americans and Latinos are higher risk

714
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
for a number of negative health consequences and some of them are listed here on the slide.

715
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
um so what the healthcare system is doing to address these issues. um well

716
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,000
what what things are perpetuating that it's something that we need to continue to look at.

717
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
okay. when we think about how are you going to address

718
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
these challenges we think about how we talk about the health care system the medical care

719
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,000
system. um there are several competing approaches that kind of frame those conversations

720
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
and those policy debates and again I think the chapters that were signed

721
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
for today do a really nice job of talking about some of these different approaches

722
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:40,000
um when one perspective or another has really driven the conversation in the United States

723
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
historically and how we think about these today. um. so

724
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I'm one of the perspective is that health care the health care industry is a competitive

725
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,000
market. there are many people who believe that healthcare is not a right

726
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
that it is a good or a commodity um something that it's reasonable for people

727
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
to profit off us are people and companies are profit off of um and that the best

728
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,000
way to improve on health care or health care outcomes in to be in this kind of market-based

729
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
system where there is competition where people are competing forms

730
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
for patience. um and so um that is one approach that

731
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
that enters into these conversations on health care as a marketplace

732
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
um another kind of perspective or Tom or something missing something that's informing

733
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:39,000
this conversation is um professional norm and the power and the lobbying

734
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,000
power of different professional societies. um and the role that they played these help for

735
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
debates I'll talk about this a little bit more um when we talk about um the affordable character

736
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
on Tuesday. um by professional societies were and insurance companies.

737
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
we are huge part of the conversation around the affordable care act and really continue

738
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,000
to dictate how we talk about health care and the provision of health care insurance in the United States.

739
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
um another perspective um one that is more an online with a public health

740
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
perspective and the social justice perspective. they're not think he's so coming from the assumption

741
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
that health care is a right for everyone should be entitled to care and

742
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
football tears going to quality of care. um in addressing our health care system

743
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
from a perspective of equity. that's another part of the conversation

744
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
another approach to pick frames that debate around health care is really a comparative institutional

745
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
analysis and so what is most successful. where did we see good health outcomes

746
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:50,000
what is the data show what is the evidence around the around

747
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
um different height of scary difference ways of organizing care. um that's

748
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
something else that should be part of the conversation kind of the evidence that we have a and again

749
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
it's not assigned to you but. chapter twenty eight of your text book is on health care research

750
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
and that really kind of informs us approach what do we know about what's working in health care

751
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
um and how do we know that um. so you know that your spare time.

752
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
check out that check. um but I think particularly as we are entering

753
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
into the next presidential election. I moved to be a lot of time there are and they're gonna continue to

754
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
be a lot of conversation um around health care around health insurance

755
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
how it should be financed mom and how we how we think about it as a nation

756
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
and these are some of the different perspectives that you might listen for when you're when you're looking for those

757
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,000
different conversation. okay.

758
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
um any brief um thinking about different opportunities are areas where we

759
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,000
might think about change the affordable care act.

760
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:04,000
it was possible in twenty ten and certainly since it went into full effect in twenty fourteen

761
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
serve and lots of conversations about repealing or replacing different components of

762
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
the affordable care act. um we'll talk about some of those efforts on Tuesday. um

763
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,000
but I think it's worth saying that the affordable care act even when it was kind of minutes fully

764
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
formed when it was passed before different elements started to get repealed or challenged

765
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
in court that has shortcomings and it isn't going to address as you're writing about your papers

766
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:35,000
it's not going to address all of the flaws in our health care system and so thinking about

767
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:41,000
whoever's in office next. what we can do to to support

768
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:46,000
the affordable care act or whether we wanna think about something please. a different type of health care policy in

769
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,000
place that will address more of the challenges. um that's something to that's not opportunity

770
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
thinking about how to improve on the affordable care. 's um.

771
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
thank you know about the different. they're always going to be failures of the market and

772
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,000
government failures around health care and so thinking about ways that the market

773
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
can better be part of the health care system. whether to speak because we have

774
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
this open system. there's opportunities for innovation for entrepreneurs to

775
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
come in and and offer new products or new ways of thinking about health care and the health services

776
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
we receive patient rights versus public

777
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:33,000
expenditures and this is again a place for I would point you to your text book the expertise uses

778
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the word rationing in conversations or on the rationing that has historically been

779
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,000
an absolutely explosive word when we talk about health care.

780
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
um and and what who's going to receive care and what types care of they're going to

781
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
receive it and who's going to find it. but as the as the book chapter argues

782
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:59,000
those are conversations that aren't being really need to be had as we think

783
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:05,000
about how we're going to continue to offer Medicare and some type of form. um

784
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
whether that's for everyone. one is Medicare for all or some and Medicare for

785
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
some um what types of services are we going to offer and who's going to be eligible

786
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
for those services. those are going to need to be ongoing conversation

787
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and another opportunity for change really thinking about how fragmented our infrastructure

788
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
health care infrastructure kids. ways that we could organize

789
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
the system better what are the opportunities for that. where are there places where we can

790
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
have less fragmentation things get better work together whether

791
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
that's through electronic health records whether that's managed care organizations. I'm

792
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
we think about things. the role of inner professional education and different health

793
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
care providers working together. is that it opportunity for improvement in the health

794
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:03,000
care system okay. that's all I have

795
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:14,366
seen on Tuesday have a great weekend
