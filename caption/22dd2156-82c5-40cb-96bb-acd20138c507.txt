00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,680
Hi, this is Matt Zawistowski. In this lecture,

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,840
we're going to apply some of the techniques you just learned for graphing longitudinal data in the data set.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,190
Recall that our example data set consisted of reading test scores collected on students in Minnesota public schools.

4
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:37,350
The data contained scores from the fifth to eighth grade, as well as several potential explanatory and exposure variables.

5
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:47,450
Our goal is to determine how reading scores change over time and to determine any variables that differentiate scores between students.

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:55,090
Since our outcome of test scores is numerical, as is the grade variable, we might start by making a scatterplot.

7
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,280
Even in this simple plot, we can begin to see that test scores appear to increase over time,

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,280
but it is difficult to see the trajectory of individual students, even though each student is represented by a different color.

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,120
The addition of lines connecting the scores on the same student transforms the scatterplot into a spaghetti plot.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,950
We can now clearly observe change for each student and as a whole,

11
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,370
we can now see that student reading scores do, in fact, tend to increase between the fifth and eighth grades.

12
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:35,370
But what other observations can be made from the spaghetti plot? For one, we can now visualize missing data.

13
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,140
There are several students missing the measurement for eighth grade reading score.

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,170
Two such examples are circled here. What else?

15
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:55,010
How about this circle student, while this student might not be considered an extreme outlier, they do have the lowest test score at each grade level.

16
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,350
It is useful to know when one or a few individuals stand out compared to others in the data set.

17
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,970
We would not necessarily exclude this student from subsequent analysis,

18
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,900
but we might want to consider how much the scores from this single student are influencing results.

19
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:21,900
An alternate way to visualize this data is using individual trajectory plots, which shows the data for each student on different axes.

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,940
Again, we can see a subtle increase in scores for nearly all students.

21
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:36,030
We can still identify the students with missing eighth grade test scores, but now we can quickly identify which students they actually are.

22
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:47,630
At a glance, we see that it is students numbered two four, eight, ten, fifteen, nineteen, twenty one and twenty two with the missing scores.

23
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,340
This particular plot might not be realistic if you have a large data set,

24
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,470
but even in that case, you could still use it to more closely inspect a handful of samples.

25
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go back to the spaghetti plot viewing the individual level curse was useful to see all the data at once.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,960
We can next at a mean response curve to provide a longitudinal summary of test scores in the whole cohort.

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,200
This is the black line connecting the mean test scores computed at each grade.

28
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,930
As we suspected, based on the individual level curves, the mean response curve shows a subtle increase in mean reading test scores.

29
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:36,480
As students progress from the 5th to the 8th grade, we can further ask what the form of the changes and test scores based on the plot.

30
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,930
The increase is small from grade to grade, as might be expected, and certainly appears monotonic,

31
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,230
and that the change in scores does not switch from increasing to decreasing.

32
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:57,520
So is the yearly increase in test scores linear to address that, we can fit a simple linear equation to the mean response value.

33
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,090
This is not an attempt at a formal statistical analysis,

34
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,730
but it does appear that a straight line does a pretty good job of capturing the grade to grade change in test scores,

35
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:13,690
at least between the fifth and eighth grades. We'll keep that in mind for later when we actually are fitting models.

36
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,650
Next, we're going to inspect correlation among the test scores.

37
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:26,050
Remember that because of the repeated measures design, we expect that test scores collected on the same student are likely to be correlated.

38
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:33,130
It is important to know if this is in fact true and we can use a scatterplot matrix to visually confirm the correlation.

39
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:39,390
The scatterplot matrix simultaneously shows the correlation of test scores across all time points.

40
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,520
As we suspected, there are strong, positive correlation among the measurements.

41
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,690
The correlation between measurements is very strong for a adjacent grade levels,

42
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,910
but does appear to degrade slightly from measurements taken more than a single grade apart.

43
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:01,950
Still, even between the two first time points, fifth and eighth grade reading test scores still have reasonably strong correlation.

44
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:10,650
So why is this important? Remember that many statistical tests, for example, simple linear regression assume independent outcome data.

45
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,170
This is most certainly not the case here.

46
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:20,480
So we'll need to explore different ways to properly model these data now that we've confirmed the correlated outcomes.

47
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,950
All right, at this point,

48
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:29,960
we've established that the test scores have a subtle linear increase from the eighth grade and that the scores are correlated from grade to grade,

49
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,200
which is something we'll need to account for during analysis.

50
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,800
The next goal of our analysis is to determine factors that might explain differences in reading scores.

51
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,260
To do this, we can create spaghetti plots that are colored according to an explanatory variable.

52
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:54,210
For example, in this figure, we are looking at a comparison of reading scores over time between advantaged and disadvantaged students.

53
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,560
Following the practice of the textbook, I've combined the homeless and highly mobile students,

54
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,130
together with the poverty students, to create the disadvantaged group.

55
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,680
We can see that there does appear to be a difference in reading scores based on risk group.

56
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
In particular,

57
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,330
the advantaged students tend to have higher scores at the beginning of the follow up and fifth grade and remain higher through eighth grade,

58
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,570
although the difference does appear to narrow by eighth grade.

59
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:27,070
Adding the group level mean response curves now allows us to compare the average scores in each group over time,

60
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,690
disconfirms our initial observation of higher test scores for advantaged students

61
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,690
with the difference being relatively constant across the follow up time?

62
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,160
We can use the same graphing technique to inspect other variables in the data set to see what's driving differences in test scores.

63
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,710
So what about student gender? Here is the group level mean response curves, comparing reading test scores between boys and girls.

64
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,690
They're pretty close, much closer than the difference we observe between advantaged and disadvantaged.

65
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,700
Students will want of formally evaluate this with a statistical test or model.

66
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,540
But on first, few test scores do not seem to differ based on student gender.

67
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,750
We could continue looking for effects on reading scores by considering combinations of variables here,

68
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,860
for example, the group level mean response curve simultaneously.

69
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,750
Consider both the students risk group and gender in line with our prior observation.

70
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,870
It appears there's a clear difference in scores between advantage and disadvantage students.

71
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,980
But within each group there is little to no difference between boys and girls.

72
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,050
We need to be careful about getting carried away with looking at too many combinations of variables.

73
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:48,120
Remember, our toy data set is rather small and the purple line for disadvantaged males is only based on three samples.

74
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:56,950
We can also perform subgroup analysis for correlation. Here, the test scores in the scatterplot matrix are colored based on risk groups.

75
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,030
As expected, the scores are positively correlated in both groups.

76
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:09,610
The correlation does appear to be slightly stronger among advantaged students with more grade to grade movement for the disadvantaged students.

77
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,090
This pattern can be difficult to discern by from a plot,

78
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:21,060
and it's a good motivating reason for computing descriptive statistics to summarize what we observe in the plots.

79
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:28,110
So that's our graphical analysis of the data set, I think we learned quite a bit just by plotting out the data,

80
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:36,670
paying particular attention to the repeated measures design. Our initial spaghetti plot gave a good overall feel for the data,

81
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:41,890
we saw the upward trend in test scores across grades and identified one sample that we

82
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,410
might want to keep an eye on because of test scores consistently lower than other students.

83
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:54,190
We confirm the correlation we suspected based on the repeated measures design using a scatterplot matrix.

84
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:03,370
We plotted scores based on the group variables, for example, risk and gender to begin to look for between student differences that affect test scores

85
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,710
are graphical analysis has us off to a great start for analyzing these longitudinal data.

86
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:15,688
In future lectures, we will learn how to formally test some of the observations we saw in these plots.
