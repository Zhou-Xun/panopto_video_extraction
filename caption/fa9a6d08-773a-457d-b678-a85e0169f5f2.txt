1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,200
so first topic in in the mid term review.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,660
so this is the title is Health Texas thermal extremes and I guess I should already qualify

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,760
for title. we could be talking about extremes but sometimes

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,380
it's really cold in the apartment with the pricing terms.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,400
so I guess that's one message to keep in mind that maybe the title is even open but misleading.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,660
so just cold and hot care environment probably talking about in the kind

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,860
of either injury or illness that can resolve and you can start thinking

8
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,780
about the environment. we're placing garments whether their outdoor or indoor underground.

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,600
a_lot_of very ability. especially temporarily time of year

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,947
and so forth. so there's a_lot_of variables in terms of where you might find these kinds of

11
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:04,387
problem. so first. just an example ice cream warehouse I picked out example for two reasons

12
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:09,547
one. when you make ice game you put into storage warehouse it's about

13
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:14,547
thirty degrees below zero. so it's pretty cool. and the second reason is that was one

14
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:19,567
of my summer jobs in college at United here in Detroit working in the

15
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:24,967
icing factory. and that was a fun job. I could tell you about that but I won't.

16
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:30,167
but you can imagine the ninety degree temperature date

17
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:35,307
ninety five percent humidity going into minus thirty three in the warehouse

18
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:41,267
and getting all the guard on to keep your self warm so you don't really subject to

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:46,407
risk area. but you are going through some temperature when you go

20
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:52,207
from inside outside working in mind temperature send to be fairly

21
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:57,655
stable underground alright so. so you were in mind and you're typically

22
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:03,995
exposed to a constant temperature and it's generally cool temperature.

23
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:09,195
delivering the mail in Arizona. you don't wanna touch your door handle in Arizona in the summer

24
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:15,835
right because you can burn yourself it's. you can be very hot here or or another.

25
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:20,855
extreme would be crab fishing in the mirror and see. so before we talk

26
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:26,275
about some of the effects we'll talk about just basics in here in the Clayton.

27
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:31,275
you don't have_to worry about it with respect to doing any calculations. really easy. the purpose

28
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:36,655
of the equation is just to help you. remember the factors that are critical

29
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:42,375
when you're trying to determine whether there may be risk involved in understanding

30
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:47,935
how we lose or gain temperature and in the environment. and just

31
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:53,929
as I said last time this is Shane with Fleet lifted from chapter thirty

32
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:59,149
this is my wrong and that's the re reading and it's an easy region. these are confusing

33
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:04,149
or difficult concepts and a_lot_of the stuff is in to do. so

34
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:09,849
yeah this is the East Georgia Delta or change to the change in slots or storage.

35
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:15,029
depends on metabolic heat or just metabolic processes and your body is

36
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:20,049
generate generating heat. and also working perform. so you can generate

37
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:26,089
much more by doing physical work and then we're gonna be talking about really four

38
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:31,149
factors that are critical in determining heat gain or loss.

39
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:36,709
and those radiance gain or loss of appetite he's lost sweating.

40
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:42,269
conduct if he's lost the of something in his conduction through contact

41
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,289
and then convection the air blows. you loose for example to

42
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:52,781
the ear. and this is shown in this nice little cartoon really kind of

43
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:58,201
help us understand how to understand soup versus radiation transfer so

44
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:04,141
I decided to JUst from the shade to the sun. and you are warm. bye.

45
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:09,641
radiation from ninety three million miles away in the air in between

46
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:14,741
space in between isn't evening. heated up right this is radiant heat.

47
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,961
right by the same token. if you have an extra wall in your. where you live. and it's twenty

48
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:26,021
three below zero. the temperature in the room at eight seventy three. but that whole wall

49
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:31,261
from your bottom which is why seventy degrees can feel differently depending on whether the wall or warmer

50
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:36,501
cold for example so that's radiant lost. that is transferred from another

51
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:41,601
body without feeding the air in between. so that's kind of logical but it kinda helps put it in to

52
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:46,701
perspective. convection is when you lose heat and air. and when the wind blows

53
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:52,035
you at least even more. so that's fairly understandable as well. use what

54
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:58,055
this whether they operate that uses he to do that actual who's your phone calls.

55
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:03,175
like to do that with the contact hanging outside there of everything moisture and you're losing heat

56
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:08,215
that way to pool themselves and their induction. so if it's fifty degrees and

57
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:13,335
the sign is out in your kind of silly and there's a concrete slab sit down on it. if

58
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:18,395
you he's right through right. I can't sit down on the aluminum picnic table or something

59
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:23,395
you feel that he just lose your job dude. keep that transfer

60
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:30,535
by direct contact. so those are the main categories of house. he just gained or lost

61
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:35,815
and. so that it's down to. how do we regulate our own body temperature thermal

62
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:41,075
regulation and you know our our hybrid elements has a thermal

63
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:46,255
regulator capacity. sort of like up furnaces

64
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:51,485
serviced. so you set it up and your temperature goes up in it and pass the legs

65
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:56,685
yeah fairly fairly Merrill range for the human body. and

66
00:05:56,685 --> 00:06:02,085
you are not nervous system that the nervous system that doesn't

67
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:08,785
control muscle moving from channel controls. just roll organ function and so forth.

68
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:13,905
is controlling your temperature regulating your temperature. which is responding to

69
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:19,385
difference is and skin temperatures will change your your skin is sensing the environment

70
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:25,225
and changes in your skin temperature will therefore send the message to your thermostat

71
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:30,605
in your brain. so either you're on stat house.

72
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:35,985
our special life to sense either called in and help you respond and

73
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:41,189
in general if it's cold. this is intuitive you should right. and your skin

74
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:46,369
kinda get spot gimme a call back to slash at you it's your remote lighting fast and your energy

75
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:51,669
stores for animals to get this final reaction. all the sudden there for

76
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,789
pumps up over there. the birds the feathers pop up and they look big and that actually provides more

77
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,849
installation for for animals and for heat and then there's also there is

78
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:06,949
major construction phase. simply needs blood vessel construction so it means narrow.

79
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,969
so the electrical storm and all of her nose and fingers toes and so forth.

80
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:17,369
they need to construct to Sean's blood to the poor. by contrast

81
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:22,389
when it's really hot. then this the blood vessels and the proof reading in your near

82
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,209
your skin. dilate increase heat exchange.

83
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:33,449
with your skin to permit. he lost and also sweating to Foster there. so little

84
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:39,752
bit of the physiology. so

85
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:44,952
yes here temperature in this room. approach the temperature of our skin. we'd

86
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:50,812
stop losing heat as well that makes sense. you can't really cool off. if it's is hot

87
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:56,392
in your body room. your skin is it is in your environment. and by the same token

88
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:01,412
if it's ninety nine percent humidity. you're not in evaporator slept much

89
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:06,852
right so you lose that as a possible source of heat loss so. so the

90
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:12,012
temperature relative humidity can make huge difference.

91
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:17,452
just why you know spending the summer in the cell phone it's hot and humid and in Charleston

92
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:22,472
South_Carolina. can be challenging. because she just can't escape the heat.

93
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:27,632
naturally. so given all that. how easy

94
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:33,052
it is it to predict whether one individual versus another. may

95
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:38,298
have difficulty in a particular environment and based on the question.

96
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:43,618
you could probably guess that it's very difficult because we all are fine to do differently

97
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:49,578
we have different experience we have different levels of conditioning and ability some of us have some

98
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:54,658
illnesses or chronic illnesses so there's a huge amount of very ability and an

99
00:08:54,658 --> 00:09:00,038
individual's tolerance for a particular environment. so it's very difficult

100
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:05,278
to to predict that. okay so sure with Tom Berman's and I'm starting with the worst

101
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,838
thing that can happen and so the most

102
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:16,058
dangerous kind of outcome is. he's stroke and

103
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:21,118
when he's stroke occurs your temperature has increased to the point where your thermostat

104
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:26,118
stops working. your ability to control your temperature. your thermal

105
00:09:26,118 --> 00:09:31,858
regulatory system breaks down. and when that happens. your body temperature issues

106
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:37,040
and pretty rapid quarters you can see that there's ten to fifteen minutes you can rise

107
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,120
to really leave the levels and at the same time.

108
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,520
you're starting mechanism. to also your ability to control. calling

109
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,760
in. by the way our body is much more much better design. as far as

110
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,620
he does then two coolers. so under the circumstances.

111
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,640
stop sweating in the structural regulating temperature goes up

112
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,840
and I can be very dangerous very quick. so you can suffer

113
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,600
serious consequences got disability and so forth. it doesn't happen tomorrow.

114
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,600
but it does happen I'll give you some data about that and one of the things that happens

115
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,880
is your mental status your cognitive function deteriorate

116
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,900
and it. if you read the chapter. it can affect essentially all of

117
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,976
your body systems so here's from the Bureau

118
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:41,556
labor statistics career between two thousand for two thousand fourteen.

119
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:46,576
the number of heat related testing due to occupational exposure you can see the

120
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:52,316
range from eighteen to sixty per year.

121
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:57,376
and I'm sure and most of these kind of deal. there's on reporting. there's no

122
00:10:57,376 --> 00:11:02,556
doubt that there's on report. so we're not having about hundreds or thousands or maybe work

123
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:09,196
on hundreds with you on reporting we're not talking about super common occurrence.

124
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:14,656
so short of heat stroke two years he's exhausted which kind of describes it.

125
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:20,496
you're you're kinda blacked out. you you you dehydrated. you've lost not only

126
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:26,016
water. but you lost your salts from

127
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:31,016
excessive sweating and then you just you gotta quit. you just can't work

128
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:36,412
any more you don't typically see elevations in court body temperature.

129
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:41,512
the way you do with heat stroke. you don't get it altered mental status you just get that fifteen

130
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:46,552
you can inability to function. you might get a headache and various other current symptoms.

131
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:51,852
I actually saw a guy in one of the plants I work in

132
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:56,972
who had all the symptoms of heat exhaustion and without there

133
00:11:56,972 --> 00:12:02,272
with safety industrial hygiene they have one of those infrared temperature

134
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:07,452
readers at the with the air exchange is

135
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:12,452
is working and it was within. GM has specifications

136
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:17,592
for a low range for temperature and humidity between summer

137
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:22,692
and winter and as well within specifications. this individual has a high

138
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:27,734
dollar bill at eight two two in tolerance to heat. I would say

139
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:33,314
and he was heavy and I can remove you a chronic illness or not but

140
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:38,314
but at first I just said well it can't be because I went out there was very hot. he didn't seem very hot

141
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:43,554
so there's a_lot_of individual very ability is what I would suggest. so short

142
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:48,554
of heat exhaustion and may may occur with heat exhaustion or heat cramps. typically

143
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:53,754
you're doing. I have a work and you start getting muscle cramps and they occur.

144
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:59,314
it's an isolated symptom or maybe part of the picture of heat exhaustion.

145
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:04,494
and understandable compete be for those if you are not medically oriented. I think

146
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:11,114
it is a five dollars for losing consciousness is passing out and

147
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:16,808
you typically will be somebody who's standing up for a long period of time or if you've ever

148
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:22,668
down to look at something of the lower shelf after one you stand up suddenly and all of sudden you get a little bit. Lucy.

149
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:28,348
you're just losing some circulation to the brain. can be more readily

150
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:33,488
that can occur more readily in a hot environment. we already little bit dehydrated

151
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:38,488
as an example. your blood pressure if you're dehydrated tends to

152
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:43,648
drop more rapidly. if you go from sitting or lying to

153
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:49,168
upright position. so that's one way of testing to

154
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:55,368
to determine dehydration.

155
00:13:55,368 --> 00:14:00,408
this is the fine print but it's worth. I think in large in this and spending a

156
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:05,468
few minutes looking at some of these topics this is from the IRS document and it's

157
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:10,848
just it's a nice little graphics that gives you a sense

158
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:16,445
for the kinds of factors that can lead

159
00:14:16,445 --> 00:14:21,465
he related down. so at the top is high temperature and humidity would prefer to talk about direct

160
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:27,125
sun exposure. you get that extra radiant heat transferred

161
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:32,405
in your radiant heat source is you're working next to the blast furnace is an example. limited

162
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:38,145
air movement reducing the convection. that cooling mechanism. not enough fluids.

163
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:43,745
so now we're talking about the personal physical

164
00:14:43,745 --> 00:14:49,325
prevention. looks version PTE and clothing gets

165
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:54,645
any calculations done in street calls versus the time texting

166
00:14:54,645 --> 00:15:00,965
and so forth. will be different physical condition health problems.

167
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:06,245
medications can affect one the ability to tolerate the either cold pregnancy.

168
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:12,005
lack of recent exposure so another which are not a climate ties to the exposure.

169
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:17,103
that's gonna be I put a star or asterisk by that lack of recent exposure. lack

170
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:22,403
of a claim position to talk about more advanced stage three Street.

171
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:27,403
more difficulty in the youngsters previous heat related illness. when

172
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:33,063
you talking Madison about an illness and in what's the risk for someone to have an illness well.

173
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:38,523
had it before. that's always on the list of the risk factor.

174
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:44,063
so beware of all just looking through that. it just helps you know a_lot_of this is intuitive.

175
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:50,563
so there's also this interaction between the heat stress and toxicology. where

176
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:56,083
the absorption and actually handling of a toxic and

177
00:15:56,083 --> 00:16:01,783
can be modified by heat. so animal studies shown that.

178
00:16:01,783 --> 00:16:06,923
for example certain toxins exposure trans dermal

179
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:13,191
absorption. candidate for more readily in the heat. so an hour also talking about

180
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:18,931
he has a module later for the

181
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:24,831
session leader toxicology. we're talking about. so just

182
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,751
just can alter it to work in just a fusion metabolism and extreme expression of toxic in's.

183
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:37,111
and if you're working real hard and you lungs are driving along.

184
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:42,211
you've already heard that we can help lots of here in the day and if

185
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:48,211
we're doing a_lot more deep and healing is working harder. we're gonna increase her

186
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:53,351
load of exposure to whatever is in the air and so and

187
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:58,391
also that with more skin from sweating. they can be more

188
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:04,291
efficient exposure to the skin. so there a_lot_of

189
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:10,031
good evidence based treatment and prevention. I should say. prevention

190
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:15,071
techniques for heat related illness I one is managing exposure how much time you spend in the

191
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:20,751
sun web time of day. you can schedule your time in the day.

192
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:25,951
to avoid the hottest times of the day. and take advantage

193
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:31,311
of the cooler times of the day. employers could

194
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:36,451
set up in force periods of Preston fluid.

195
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:41,531
protocols can make a big difference in in the morning. learning

196
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:46,891
his idea about finalization. Cathy recommends have been demonstrated to be effective

197
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:52,111
in the certain population. if you installed it in and helps the body acclimated

198
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:57,831
to the allotted way to the exposure. cardiovascular function is better.

199
00:17:57,831 --> 00:18:02,951
you and your body learn how to select more efficiently in response to hot temperatures. and so that to make

200
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:08,317
a huge difference in your ability to tolerate and just drive home the point.

201
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:13,657
this is from an article. actually offered by the nurse who's the director

202
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:19,757
of outpatient Health Nursing at OSHA and the physician who's the director of occupational medicine.

203
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:24,957
and over these two years. they said let's look at eighty four. enforcement

204
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:30,017
case that old shop has done. in response to some heat

205
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:35,057
related problem. and so I know I also hear that there isn't an

206
00:18:35,057 --> 00:18:40,577
ocean standard for heat exposure. everybody know about the general duty calls.

207
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:46,297
generally cost a_lot_of natural. basically. okay says that we don't have a standard government.

208
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:51,597
the law requires employers to provide an employment and employment environment

209
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:56,657
that's free of recognize hazards can cause serious on this worked out. so they use

210
00:18:56,657 --> 00:19:01,937
the general duty clause. in reviewing these important cases.

211
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:06,957
most of these employers lacks basic essential programs prevention.

212
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:12,257
there a national standard standard setter use as prevention that I've already

213
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:17,497
talked about water and shade. testing working rest schedules and climate

214
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:23,017
change. you're stepping into a job that's delivering the mail in Arizona

215
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:28,777
and so you don't put somebody out on the floor Ralph the very first day.

216
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:33,777
you give them an opportunity to ask for me. just to show that important

217
00:19:33,777 --> 00:19:38,937
that is. I he's ready for investigations enforcement cases there were twenty

218
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:44,277
three dollars in two years and you can see there that that only a small portion

219
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:49,357
from the date I showed you earlier. the number of test related to occupation heat exposure.

220
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:54,677
seventeen of the twenty three has occurred in the workers first three days on the job.

221
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:59,733
eight of those twenty three first day work. get a job. you got to work

222
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:05,153
and you die the first day of work from school. you haven't been acclimated

223
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:10,453
and your employer has provided. just the basic preventative

224
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:15,553
pest and protocols that are well established every time the weather warms up ocean I

225
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:21,253
have send out there e-mails about all the tactics that are available and so

226
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:26,333
all the data there. all we can do a_lot toward toward

227
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:31,913
educating employers that these kinds of precautionary measures can be taken.

228
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:39,253
and again it's a fairly in frequent event. but it's obviously dramatic.

229
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:45,313
so any questions about about heat before we get on to the other end.

230
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:50,373
so call me Marvin's cycle through you can imagine how you can

231
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:56,220
lose heat. the operation conduction convection

232
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,500
wind the last year for temperature. our key factors. and just

233
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,560
if you get this goes back to my very first comment about this the title of the presentation that it can occur

234
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,880
and your temperature is high sixty five degrees in work flow. so you got

235
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,120
not conduct a loss with the closing. and increase of applicants

236
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,220
last week but clothing. and if you ever junk into a

237
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,440
cold leg. if you were going to the ocean. if you ever heard about people

238
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,220
let's see getting down in the drink your water temperature is. some home

239
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,280
and to talk about how many minutes of survival you got. I just wonder scores.

240
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,340
how well water. compared to the same temperature here will

241
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,560
conduct heat from your body. so we all experienced that

242
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,680
know that a cold shower get shivering much more than the same temperature of there. but it's

243
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,688
important with respect to understanding. you so I already mentioned that

244
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:04,168
when it's real cold. the body concerns in the brain and vital organs

245
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:10,148
and it says forget the nose the tolls and the tip tip of the nose fingers.

246
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:15,988
we're gonna provide heat to the essential parts of the body and

247
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:21,008
so you're at risk for losing toes and if you ever heard stories on Mount Everest you know people

248
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:26,408
have_to spend the night in the tent shop for twenty hours and the storm blows

249
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:31,548
through. what can happen. good stories movies and so

250
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:36,688
forth. you get a strong sense of what can happen with five thirty. so the core

251
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:42,088
body temperature starts to drop in. we consume our energy stores

252
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:47,808
trying to stay warm. so you've all experience shivering.

253
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:52,948
I think it's behind that fifty. lots of coordination. and then you actually

254
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:59,308
lose cognitive function. so again the story is on Mount Everest.

255
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:04,428
where you where the people telling the story. we'll talk about how they

256
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:09,988
know they're starting to lose cognitive function. as the record temperature drops.

257
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:15,288
so if you can't make decisions as clearly. you physically can't move it as well.

258
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:20,308
it's difficult to execute. and then later around

259
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:25,348
you stop your brain your skin turns blue your pupils dilated your pulse start flowing.

260
00:23:25,348 --> 00:23:30,468
you lose consciousness. and

261
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:35,848
so there you go. hey buddy it's trying to do anything with your hands in the winter.

262
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:41,728
you been out for a_while and your hands are cold you know you take this kind of like you turn comes

263
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:47,148
and then your skin can for you so when you actually freeze tissue. it

264
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:52,248
can destroy tissue and they're saying gradient from getting

265
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:57,398
pretty cold really cold to starting to be painful but not

266
00:23:57,398 --> 00:24:02,478
yet frozen. so frost and if this is like when it's not quite is bad. you don't

267
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:08,198
get permanent damage. the frost files from the tissue actually freezes and

268
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:13,358
then you lose. if your nose and toes you know all those pictures of people again from mountain

269
00:24:13,358 --> 00:24:19,858
climbing on Everest with black finger tips and toes and so forth.

270
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:25,058
so I think it's worth while knowing you know that that picture. he's a really

271
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:30,258
good one. just have some in your brain you know the difference between the class.

272
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:36,458
radiant heat transfer convection conduction.

273
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:41,578
how is that hot environment is compromise our ability to thermal regulate and what happens

274
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:46,798
with exposure to high environments. the worst case stroke and then the heat

275
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,078
exhaustion and heat cramps heat sink if the symptoms of stroke. we actually

276
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:57,366
get loss of your ability to regulate your thermostat sales

277
00:24:57,366 --> 00:25:03,046
court temperature. shoes you have mental status changes.

278
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:08,586
and then also the sponsor of over lap with toxicology principals

279
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:14,446
with heat exposure in every stress the importance of compensation.

280
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:19,486
you can see just people who guy in the first day of work. what lack

281
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:24,886
of finalization. I did for them. in response

282
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:30,086
a couple of Armand to say hello. love you Sean Core. save

283
00:25:30,086 --> 00:25:36,006
your brain see if your final functions your your your vital organs

284
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:41,286
and just send sure what type of review is and what it does to you. so that's

285
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:46,346
that. will change over and start the midterm review. anybody have any

286
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:52,046
questions about these topics. fairly straight forward pretty interesting

287
00:25:52,046 --> 00:26:13,912
I think you easy to understand

288
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:19,492
okay first of all the Verizon using it to exercise.

289
00:26:19,492 --> 00:26:24,492
fire after this month the next one. she'll see in a second. that was only

290
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:30,024
a few minutes before class and announcement. case anyone missed that

291
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:35,104
so for some house keeping yet about the exam. I just wanted you to know

292
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:41,080
when you can expect things again. see things back I should say

293
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,180
the outline for the case study. each degree submitted.

294
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:52,020
I will be getting some detailed comments back to each group by this Friday.

295
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:57,220
and I'll probably just make sure everyone is seeing on. I'll probably go

296
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:03,280
to Travelers. I'll post campus I'll probably also like e-mail

297
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,520
everybody in each group. just make sure everyone got it. you know to worry about the still being

298
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:15,400
distributed to your partners. okay. so you get that on Friday.

299
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:21,000
with respect to homework one. you'll be providing grades and specific commentary

300
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,080
on what you did. obviously this is as an individual. and I don't think you can have that

301
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,340
by Friday so you can have it by Sunday before you return from Winter break.

302
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:36,792
love you. bye March and for the exam

303
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:41,792
taking Thursday mid term. you'll actually get your scores

304
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:47,271
and grades on Friday. she'll see you in a moment. the reason we're

305
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:52,432
able to do that because it's gonna be computer base and we're gonna use only

306
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:57,731
closing request. so basically it's just great it means that he finished.

307
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:03,271
alright. Gordon. finished with this time. grades represent. so

308
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:08,651
you get that on Friday as well. okay. and actually I think I had to change

309
00:28:08,651 --> 00:28:14,231
the last version you have is runs out the page but exactly what's on the screen here.

310
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:19,851
it's going to be at the house. when you open it up on your laptop.

311
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:25,631
we don't have the number right. I just wanna point something that you know ahead of time. okay.

312
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:30,731
so it's close but you won't you won't need a calculator it's not really

313
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:35,819
doing formal calculations. you're gonna have up to ninety minutes

314
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:41,459
to complete six a.m.. not ninety one minutes. you can't go past that

315
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:46,819
and I'm trying to be accommodating as I can in terms of people's different schedules.

316
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:52,179
that I could do the following. the exam

317
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:57,419
will be available at precisely one thirty p.m.. so for many of you

318
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,540
don't have a class just before they start coming from North Campus or something. you can

319
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,559
just show up here in. just before one thirty and you'll be able to start an exam if

320
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,260
you like to write at one thirty. the

321
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,679
exam is going to close at three ten p.m..

322
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,679
that's for people that are able to start before we usually start a lecture here. so if

323
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,559
you start at one forty p.m.. ninety minutes from that. it's three ten p.m..

324
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,579
alright. and I just wanna point out to make this perfectly clear. if you start before one forty

325
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:39,831
which is fine absolutely fine. trying to accommodate that. I

326
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:44,931
at ninety minutes. if you haven't already hit this is about to submit

327
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:50,052
the response or cell whatever you have at that point will be submitted for you

328
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:55,371
and you will be able to make any more changes. that's true actually no matter when you start but if you start

329
00:29:55,371 --> 00:30:00,391
later start later than one forty seven. you have less than ninety

330
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:05,991
minutes. because you'll be cut off at three ten.

331
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:11,292
you can go past ninety minutes and eventually we'll touch you off and it also pays attention

332
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:16,971
to clock time. you can have three ten. like to everyone. any questions.

333
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:22,331
okay. yes take it in this room.

334
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:28,531
unless you requested received permission before hand to do it elsewhere

335
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:33,811
and that will only be granted if you have too extenuating circumstances

336
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:39,091
but can't really be here on that day. take it somewhere else. you should

337
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:44,234
find a way in case it does come up in principal. you should be able to take it from anywhere anywhere

338
00:30:44,234 --> 00:30:49,253
that you. if you get on Internet you can take it. okay. but we

339
00:30:49,253 --> 00:30:55,193
do want you here in this room. you'll notice.

340
00:30:55,193 --> 00:31:00,234
you can navigate it a test anywhere you want. so you can go back and forth. you can change at this as many

341
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:06,253
times as you want. there's no restriction. you not required to do things in a specific order.

342
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:12,173
the questions will be number. you probably already know that.

343
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:17,333
and we are ready to talk about when the test will and this is just to warn you of multiple

344
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:22,953
choice questions. unless it says otherwise. we're looking for the one best answer

345
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:28,094
sometimes and set something out. but it doesn't say anything else that's what you're supposed to do is pick the one that answer

346
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:33,094
for multiple choice. alright. all questions are gonna be closed and it is

347
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:38,553
gonna be approximately forty five to five questions in approximately forty.

348
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:43,639
multiple choice questions and to follow up with you

349
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:48,799
with one point marble choice we usually be to. some of them are worthwhile medication

350
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,139
one zero three. when you finish the exam. you just put

351
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:59,539
that button down and we are you went through and happens if you haven't fixed

352
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:04,919
it by ninety minutes or about reach is three ten p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

353
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,919
you whatever you done up and will be submitted automatically. also you know

354
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,339
this is timer switch. you can see it everyday. so there's no questions or have any questions.

355
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:22,019
when you get close to ninety minutes. we'll show you and it will take you wherever you are.

356
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:27,259
if you if something goes wrong with your laptop. obviously

357
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:32,439
I think both myself and Emily will be in the room let us know immediately. you

358
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:37,539
probably should also. if you can send that e-mail like it says up there because that

359
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:42,614
will basically alert some like Andy burkhart oh I better come down and see what the problem was

360
00:32:42,614 --> 00:32:48,053
versus having. we wanna make sure it's taken care of

361
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:53,533
and this represents twenty percent of your grade so any questions about the format.

362
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:58,653
I can set everything up here with somebody at the top of the exam when you open it

363
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:06,134
yet.

364
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:11,893
it will be like one long thing in the sense that you can just scroll down through it.

365
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:17,140
you don't actually you don't actually have_to change pages the other thing is that lee this is trooper.

366
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,159
if anyone is taking exam in the upper right hand corner. there's another place you can. you

367
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,839
can. that were questions are numbered. so so if you said. okay I wanna go back to question

368
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,339
three. I'm not sure the answers to everything else that having to scroll back

369
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:38,500
that far. was all one time. hey you can go up there and click on questions for you.

370
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,620
immediately. okay. yeah. so

371
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:49,359
wife you can see it's gonna be somewhere in the mid to higher.

372
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:54,640
okay. so I got a huge amount of time and he basically

373
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,760
have just slightly more than one minute question because a_lot_of them are true

374
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,819
Falls and you know that it's processed faster I think they'll be okay. the other thing is

375
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:10,139
that some of them aren't that some of the multiple

376
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:15,437
choice questions are essentially matching questions bye. I don't like the way

377
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:20,637
that matching was. can't answer the phone. I didn't write it and I didn't agree

378
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:26,077
with I was rated. so we changed all the matching questions into multiple choice questions.

379
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:31,077
what that means the reason I'm telling you that is that you will see you sometime. you'll see a set

380
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:36,097
of answers and will be the same set of answers for two or three or possibly in

381
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:41,437
one case even for re model choice. so you are you know what the answers

382
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:46,597
are. it's like fifty constructed matching right made in the multiple choice. so that all means

383
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:51,797
W a bit faster than you say you doing three miles. nothing to do with each other. because

384
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:58,077
you know what the answers are. so we're I'm pretty comfortable.

385
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:03,237
you will have a_lot_of extra time and I could be wrong but I expect everyone actually

386
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:09,957
finished the exam for sure. I think you can get here.

387
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:15,140
so call me later but you won't have a_lot_of time

388
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,140
to review it. that's true. okay. anything out

389
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:25,440
yet.

390
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:33,581
I think that's all pencil and paper next to your laptop.

391
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:42,160
it's actually way to flag it on the thing I didn't even know that.

392
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,260
I'm not real close on campus as you know. so I guess you can.

393
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,400
anyway. alright. so again if I were you

394
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,781
and I don't have something before the class. I will be here at one twenty five and get all settled

395
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:05,340
in. so that you start right at one thirty that way you can leave at three. but it's up to you.

396
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,380
but again if you can't make it here at the right one for you. you still have a ninety minute. if you have the

397
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,529
three ten. alright so.

398
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:21,569
so let's go through a few topics to be covered. so the first lecture we

399
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:27,148
had was the introduction occupational environmental diseases.

400
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:32,289
Brian is probably doing about a long time coming in to. we talked

401
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:37,369
about Ramsey and even talk about Hamilton here. so this is

402
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:42,869
been recognize this is been recognized for centuries and

403
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:48,089
a_lot_of times only recognize after the Harmony time which is usually hard workers.

404
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:53,729
usually whatever the area and to see workers at the highest exposures.

405
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:59,229
alright. and you should be aware of certain concepts

406
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:04,589
around exposure. understand routes of exposure the three major ones and I think everyone knows

407
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:10,089
understand what's meant by those response relationship. either the severity of the exact increases

408
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:15,168
with those or the probability of the fact by whether you can develop cancer

409
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:20,711
not increases the Anna Anna called she should know what are the things that

410
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:25,990
does the person receives. this is for generic. so it's been ten today. bye. for example

411
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:31,191
insulation on concentration of the agent in the air. how long you're

412
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:36,411
exposed and the frequency with which exposed it only happens a couple times is happening every day

413
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:42,111
at work. they should understand that. by way. I forgot to say that. I would say

414
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:47,171
ninety maybe ninety five percent of the questions you can be

415
00:37:47,171 --> 00:37:52,411
at are either things that are been explicitly covered during that.

416
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:58,471
I mean not fully. but reminding you you need to understand that or

417
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:03,471
maybe re five percent then you getting up to ten percent will be identical to

418
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:10,851
the quiz that you were taking. love you. you have seen most before. okay.

419
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:15,951
so that's that. make sure you understand the definition of latency. you

420
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:21,029
know from the the onset of exposure to and whatever the disease

421
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:26,368
exposure is responsible for the first recognize and understand that late. you can very

422
00:38:26,368 --> 00:38:31,809
by real exposure. I can change the latency and by the exposure.

423
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:37,208
we talked about people getting it use those houses that have these astronomical exposures in a couple of months.

424
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:43,908
so that's a big effect on latency. alright. okay.

425
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:48,989
it's pretty obvious that this is great very ability across individuals and test this is set the ability to

426
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:54,128
exposures and the surveillance is important. your balance isn't great for

427
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:59,128
providing but it's great for identifying where the problem or potential problem

428
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:04,148
early and reacting to it correctly and as

429
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:09,489
an example surveillance or at least data that was collected. this

430
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:14,888
is estimate number of hepatitis_B infections in US Health Care workers.

431
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:19,905
and you so going from made to

432
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:25,425
the mid nineties you had this term. really dramatic drop in the number of cases

433
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:30,565
and health care workers and you should be aware. I

434
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:36,345
need is evidence of it. the two major reasons for that job. first of all the development of an effective

435
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:42,905
effective vaccine and offering at the health care workers. and the second was universal

436
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:48,145
precautions were being undertaken. in most setting. really

437
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:53,338
the reason those universal precautions game it was because people are all worried about HIV and eight bye.

438
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:58,558
actually hepatitis_C was much more of a threat to help workers and was much more heavily impacted in terms

439
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:03,598
of improvement. alright. we do

440
00:40:03,598 --> 00:40:08,719
watch our conversation. so you should know how to distinguish between association and conversations

441
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,938
and how to make instances. I think it's pretty clear because you just did homework

442
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:19,598
while I don't expect people to have too much trouble with keeping in mind what is the criteria and considerations

443
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:24,798
are going to the hill category. you should understand what's

444
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:37,418
the difference between General versus Pacific Carnation. yes.

445
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:48,838
yeah definitely some of that important that I found out.

446
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:54,005
okay. well one of them is not a hundred percent necessary. which one is that Jeffrey

447
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:59,105
Brown. you cannot exposure in because the disease. if it doesn't happen before

448
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:05,105
this time. so that one. okay.

449
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:10,225
I mean there's other things that are very important. the strength of this association. things like

450
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:15,285
consistency with the literature books where is other things like that. I know allergies

451
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:20,465
are pretty weak one and there's experiment experiment needs

452
00:41:20,465 --> 00:41:25,825
like testing weather. when she's identified the cost and actually reduce it reduce

453
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:31,325
the disease out about removing exposure. so you have was important impact.

454
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:36,445
very important practice but it doesn't help a_lot with because alley because we're really in the situation

455
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:50,725
of being able to carry that out. we don't have that kinda day yet.

456
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:56,590
so you know I think you should be aware of this huge overlap and not identical

457
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,890
but it's not like we're gonna we're not gonna be a question. which of these parts here. we're in

458
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:07,430
search in general. there's a concept that we that I really want you to understand.

459
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:12,590
so we don't we're not pass my new shoes and I just like you know actions of history. when somebody happens

460
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:18,030
status we wanna ask you. hello different because we've been using it very much.

461
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:24,750
I'll do the homework about it.. okay. alright.

462
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:30,550
General versus specific conversation. so specific because nation is not

463
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,810
general as business exposure and increase the probability of this

464
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:41,290
as easy .com. when you talking about the population. expenses exposure specific case.

465
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,450
this is exposure occurred and it it actually causes disease. this is

466
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:51,470
the individual which is what all you were doing for your case. so

467
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:57,741
the relationship you have_to job. this is argue specific

468
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:02,862
packages. there is a whole conversation doesn't mean

469
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:08,241
nothing with call. alright. alright. and then

470
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:13,402
alternative definition because ration I think outside five here. you know you gotta worry about.

471
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:18,582
John. entrance is on some of these diagrams are gonna look at and in consideration of counter

472
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:25,122
factual. there's a Hill criteria. you know what all those are. so

473
00:43:25,122 --> 00:43:31,362
you may see a question or two like that. which will be

474
00:43:31,362 --> 00:43:36,362
sufficient necessary and sufficient potential causes. make

475
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:41,781
sure you review that part. understand I think you had a quick question or two

476
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:46,961
that you think that information matches different set of questions and then what's up here to look

477
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:52,738
at all. and make sure you understand how to answer that kind of question. I

478
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:57,858
and sort in a general way. even if you haven't take at the court. what's

479
00:43:57,858 --> 00:44:03,178
up on the screen which is basically the real definition

480
00:44:03,178 --> 00:44:08,538
of hydration. if you had a time machine just to go back and change the person's exposure you would change

481
00:44:08,538 --> 00:44:13,578
the agencies out. but we don't have that. how to re approximate it. I

482
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:18,658
pray my clinical control trial. it's kinda approximate much better than

483
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:24,038
we can usually do in that environment on our space in the house because we can only

484
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:29,118
use it can't ethically expose people. so we can

485
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:34,838
do that but when you doing the treatment. as it explains it it says this is

486
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,238
the reason. there's a strong RCT. is because

487
00:44:40,238 --> 00:44:45,418
this underlying counter that's all the assumption. if you switched everybody in terms of treatment

488
00:44:45,418 --> 00:44:51,498
neighbors the street. the use which all out. but you can't switch everybody there.

489
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:56,824
okay overview of long diseases. you should understand lung

490
00:44:56,824 --> 00:45:01,904
function testing like surround the tree and hadn't heard very basic interpretation of

491
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:06,964
crafting patterns and you should know what to expect for structure disease and cancer

492
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:12,444
patterns and restrictive disease and go over that in a minute. basic stuff about anatomy

493
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:17,484
like how where and why particles might deposit a little bit clearance and

494
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:22,704
defense mechanisms. no that you know bronchitis bronchial month

495
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:28,344
around the contract reacting and contract causing more instruction that sort of thing.

496
00:45:28,344 --> 00:45:33,624
you should know what is meant like chronic obstructed pulmonary disease or COPD

497
00:45:33,624 --> 00:45:38,884
and how they can be diagnosed and we're gonna go through different types of

498
00:45:38,884 --> 00:45:44,284
their service. so call me because you know

499
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:49,530
that. so coworkers are exposed to are interested in so

500
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:55,010
this diagram. the only think you really need to concentrate on is you should know what the definition

501
00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:00,090
is the total on the path what the definition is of the residuals on them because they're important

502
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,390
interpreting disease. and this is absolute long time.

503
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:10,810
how's it going do something like a bottle box in a fancy lap. you can do this in the study.

504
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:15,830
but if if you good information because it tells you. it's

505
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:20,830
talking about how much air is actually inside your loan which you can't measure directly with wrong the

506
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:25,870
you. okay. and you should know what to

507
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:31,434
pass current for someone with normal lung function. basically what they look like. so

508
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:36,794
this one here is flow and leaders per second versus volume X hale.

509
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:41,874
and this is someone that has no line disease is the typical very short quick. I

510
00:46:41,874 --> 00:46:47,394
take off a nice point and comes down and more_or_less the straight line.

511
00:46:47,394 --> 00:46:52,474
you can ignore this part because we're not really dealing with in relation we're just doing the excavation

512
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:57,694
which is this part. and if you look at that versus time you expect

513
00:46:57,694 --> 00:47:02,914
to see you tonight. wrap to take off and increase you notice it. most people

514
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:08,014
are normal long. get almost all the air they're able to take sale out in the first two second

515
00:47:08,014 --> 00:47:13,094
that weekend. we tried to make people keep going to at least six second to make sure that we

516
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:18,134
have that. so if it's flat by the time you get out to six seconds indicating

517
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:23,254
that you obtain the persons for the final capacity. the maneuver

518
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:28,634
for that and then you should know first draft of long season. the biggest

519
00:47:28,634 --> 00:47:33,874
hallmark is at the re show that he won over at cc decrease which also means that he wants

520
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:39,029
to decrease because that thing you can't. the total of the total amount

521
00:47:39,029 --> 00:47:44,109
and you can get out. much suction and

522
00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:49,189
for long was absent on guy. it's at the RV back does I

523
00:47:49,189 --> 00:47:54,229
bet he'll see this increase. so the fraction. total air. you having

524
00:47:54,229 --> 00:48:00,609
your lungs when you take the hand fracture. you left a message

525
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:05,749
too high. you got air traffic. okay. so and these are. so

526
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:11,009
no basically what these are. you know this is like. this is Margaret

527
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:17,969
instructed to see severe obstructed disease versus. it looks like normal.

528
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:25,269
they don't get it. bye. don't hit his IP and they have this kind cavity.

529
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:30,309
after the. if you don't see people with normal. same kinda thing for restrictive

530
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:35,769
lung disease. the Hallmark first round tree. this is the fourth file has_to be

531
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:41,217
decreased home out here you know out while if it's pure restricted

532
00:48:41,217 --> 00:48:46,277
at the same time that if if you want ratios either normal or increased. so if it's pure.

533
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:51,357
you got no evidence of obstruction. okay. if you look at Long

534
00:48:51,357 --> 00:48:57,537
Lions hallmark this is the total patties decrease. so this is severe

535
00:48:57,537 --> 00:49:02,957
restrictive disease. again compare to normal. alright.

536
00:49:02,957 --> 00:49:07,977
so when I got instructions at and it goes with emphysema or chronic bronchitis

537
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:13,357
which together for you to panic and start telling her you Cecil I understand that

538
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:18,477
we are to talk about this and of course in the general population.

539
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:23,617
most common cause of lung disease cigarette smoking. but if

540
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:28,697
you talked about. work with having exposure that may not be reading calls

541
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:34,137
and then a restriction. no that it rises from the

542
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:39,297
regions in transit. correct. decrease is compliant. it's really long. so this

543
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:45,153
test from fibrosis garren. if you get something by. so look

544
00:49:45,153 --> 00:49:50,333
at that and then I have plans specifically I'm

545
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:55,433
calling out these diseases. we were just so

546
00:49:55,433 --> 00:50:00,473
call. you should know how to sign these exposures with

547
00:50:00,473 --> 00:50:05,673
character rises. you should know what the range of health effects are. you should know that

548
00:50:05,673 --> 00:50:11,013
there's long latency in Seaford. typically from any of that. bye. talking long cancerous message

549
00:50:11,013 --> 00:50:16,493
because I need to file. you know thirty forty sometimes even more years after exposure

550
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:21,933
starts before you see the disease and you should know that

551
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:27,133
typically will progress that after you start. even

552
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:32,273
after you remove the person from exposure. because you don't actually eliminate all of the agent from the from

553
00:50:32,273 --> 00:50:37,733
the long. so press passes make sure you understand

554
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:42,857
the relationship between cigarette smoking exposure as best as long

555
00:50:42,857 --> 00:50:47,897
cancer. we need to see Leona. you know that

556
00:50:47,897 --> 00:50:53,717
usually only seen if the person is exposed. that's the Monroe.

557
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:58,717
and it has nothing to do with smoking smoking. not a risk factor for.

558
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:04,297
Long Care. okay. the silica. I need to know that it's Christmas

559
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:09,417
with this three times. you not to memorize three type of the most common one quarter

560
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:14,657
as opposed to market. doesn't cost the next week too. so talk

561
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:19,817
to you. you should understand that eight cost increases.

562
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:25,137
you probably have an active TV because it interferes especially with Matt. which is something

563
00:51:25,137 --> 00:51:30,697
called that type of bacteria and that kills him and

564
00:51:30,697 --> 00:51:35,697
you know about that and also to look at the associates in room two logical diseases it doesn't say here but

565
00:51:35,697 --> 00:51:40,817
also I considered to be approving him in Carson a. even though

566
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:45,995
it is considerably less this message. but it's still considered proven.

567
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:51,255
gimme. has an agent from Long Care. or call our Customer Connie office.

568
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:56,875
you should know. that's the formal definition black long it's more like

569
00:51:56,875 --> 00:52:02,095
informal or like a legal term. results on the server room with logical disease

570
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:08,075
you can see for his best to see at the diagram showing and more last

571
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:13,235
interaction model taking effect on the probability of lung cancer. if you have both especially

572
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:18,235
since figure got smoking understand what that represent us. know what the

573
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:23,315
definition is. this is a simple suit houses. and we are still can

574
00:52:23,315 --> 00:52:28,375
go forward. the council case on concerts and for actually nine this is to see if this

575
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:33,995
is incorrect here. right right there aren't there at your disposal for

576
00:52:33,995 --> 00:52:39,095
our coworkers noon money out. there's many things you can do to make sure the person does better. but

577
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:44,961
you can actually reach her the other line. please. once it's status

578
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:49,961
I called. there's simple seat I repeat is complicated.

579
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:55,421
you gonna be if you forgot to met my brother. but you can also get a diffuse fibrosis

580
00:52:55,421 --> 00:53:00,441
from cold and you can get things like that or something like bronchitis

581
00:53:00,441 --> 00:53:05,721
and COPD. be aware of that. okay. let me know. I space

582
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:11,323
last night high presents to renew and I just you should be able to compare and contrast

583
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:16,723
the two. we'll talk to you. we have a diagram of that in the moment you very seen before

584
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:22,043
and you should know the categories and types of asthma including what differs in terms of positive factors

585
00:53:22,043 --> 00:53:27,423
across categories and in terms of mechanisms and disease will go over this morning to second

586
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,383
and understand a little bit about what are the steps and the diagnosis of occupational.

587
00:53:33,383 --> 00:53:40,103
you know that you need an agent present to work. be responsible. you need to demonstrate.

588
00:53:40,103 --> 00:53:45,203
person is reacting to something in the work place which you can do it. if you did people measures and

589
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:51,363
other ways. and also understand the National History which is basically

590
00:53:51,363 --> 00:53:56,643
the longer the person is exposed sick for they are time to remove from exposure.

591
00:53:56,643 --> 00:54:01,803
more likely it will have a permit. that will reverse removed

592
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:07,143
from this phone. would be the capstone. so this is Amber Shawnee it's all

593
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:12,602
has_to work late at. which includes work aggravated versus true occupation

594
00:54:12,602 --> 00:54:17,602
last meeting. person never had asked until they got this exposure. and remember the big

595
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:22,902
cat is divided between occupation last night and see me you don't get this the first time you ever exposed

596
00:54:22,902 --> 00:54:29,062
to agent versus occupation that and without waiting C reactive airway function syndrome.

597
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:34,062
cost by high exposures single height exposure typically

598
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:39,322
highly irritating substances like on your chlorine and under occupational asset

599
00:54:39,322 --> 00:54:44,702
with latency. there's IG dependent asthma which is true.

600
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:50,582
most for proteins. with classes are available like from Caster burgers or whatever.

601
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:55,782
night. and there's I see independent which has a different mechanism. for

602
00:54:55,782 --> 00:55:00,882
example I can sign it. we talked about making phone Robert products

603
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:05,942
and for this the paint job. their mechanism is not driven by

604
00:55:05,942 --> 00:55:11,122
IG. so you should know sort of what's on that diagram and you should know what's

605
00:55:11,122 --> 00:55:16,438
on table. you should be able to compare and contrast occupation

606
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:23,638
last night hyper sensitivity news and I missed everything that's listed on the table. okay.

607
00:55:23,638 --> 00:55:28,678
enjoy. this exact words right. it's close and just recognize on that. was it

608
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:34,358
was talking about when you see it. alright. so going on. so again the compound

609
00:55:34,358 --> 00:55:39,718
songs and diapers and organic gases. thank you this is the ECT which firstly

610
00:55:39,718 --> 00:55:44,838
study in detail in case we look at. so you should know what

611
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:50,058
are the different types of the sixteenth and the mechanism. so you know

612
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:55,298
for six. fix the agent by placing office

613
00:55:55,298 --> 00:56:00,358
in the air. so I can happen like with. if you are not Eugene environment someone walked into.

614
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:05,398
spoke with Keith. Bruce crashed for a long time for example that

615
00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:11,398
I could be the best thing. it's leaking gas place on oxygen

616
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:16,592
versus agent that directly interfere with cellular.

617
00:56:16,592 --> 00:56:22,012
either with the transport of oxygen carbon style or with the seller or your

618
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:27,052
use of oxygen things like that. if you can stop by or not. simple

619
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:32,532
make. I know for certain chemicals if this is

620
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:37,532
distinct pattern or mechanisms of injury especially. so and

621
00:56:37,532 --> 00:56:42,572
text and and that'll be the key tone because her phone the obviously been thinking because

622
00:56:42,572 --> 00:56:47,672
of Kenya. final before I can cut

623
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:53,312
them out can call today. type of phone. well small cell carcinoma

624
00:56:53,312 --> 00:56:58,632
long which is usually a relatively unusual time. second thing know the basics about

625
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:03,812
a few of those and for diagram Clark Propane. I think everyone knows anyway

626
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:09,632
because we went through it together. bye. know what the actual

627
00:57:09,632 --> 00:57:14,652
sequence of events was and by the way remember first article

628
00:57:14,652 --> 00:57:19,992
we read was not the first thing we read that article and we went back and read that animals

629
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:24,992
but it was it happened earlier. bye. I kinda logical see if it's not to see what you

630
00:57:24,992 --> 00:57:30,212
recommend..

631
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:35,932
oh I'm sorry I was talking too fast. I was just calling. sorry about that.

632
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:42,392
I'm worry about time. okay. yeah. so strike what I just say

633
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:47,572
whatever Doctor Burton usually crack. yeah.

634
00:57:47,572 --> 00:57:52,992
maybe cancer it now. alright. sorry about that. process organic

635
00:57:52,992 --> 00:57:58,572
compounds. so know sort of the basics about their origins and

636
00:57:58,572 --> 00:58:04,552
then wider for assistance. have a file cumulative.

637
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:10,352
and for example we look at it. ET probably five panels

638
00:58:10,352 --> 00:58:15,390
in Houston last year you know just

639
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:20,430
you won't get out lots of detail questions on this but you know the basics. alright returning turning to

640
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,830
metal. generally you should know about the exposure out. you know just in installation

641
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:31,130
in different house now and it's very by metals distributing the body what help

642
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:36,770
us next Thursday and that'll answer your symptoms and also some metal

643
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:42,490
organic farms are potentially much more toxic convenient service. again

644
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:47,790
can talk more central nervous system inspections on. see where that

645
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:52,790
lead difference between activation versus of exposure. usually

646
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:58,490
in relation. main issue and occupational exposure and usually and just in especially for children.

647
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:05,130
children is issuing environmental. I know about the distribution for example

648
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:10,570
high percent is less door in bone for long periods of time.

649
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:16,090
half bye and what has happened with changes in the general

650
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:21,670
election overtime and why you're mad at drop in lead levels compared to

651
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,730
when we were born. and we're still we're young children or even your

652
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:32,430
older children. because we've been using gasoline

653
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:38,070
and everything in the US. okay.

654
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:43,150
for our snack. I see where there's multi organ.

655
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:48,190
normally in effect. by getting the agent care toll season. supposed to see

656
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:53,482
many several others and also knows it. if you can come an agent.

657
00:59:53,482 --> 00:59:58,622
giving long letter and know that

658
00:59:58,622 --> 01:00:03,882
positive you get Internet worldwide. the biggest challenges arsenic is natural

659
01:00:03,882 --> 01:00:09,262
arsenic getting into drinking water system.

660
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:15,542
so that's usually the biggest risk to talk about the most people affected by

661
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:20,782
several countries with Mercury. I don't know what route to exposure typically

662
01:00:20,782 --> 01:00:26,402
are. it's very important that Marjorie has a dental paper pressure and temperature.

663
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:31,582
that means you can get you know racial exposure very easily. I know it's

664
01:00:31,582 --> 01:00:36,682
time to get organs are especially central nervous system also. especially kids needs and

665
01:00:36,682 --> 01:00:42,002
you know that nothing nursery has very different properties in that element in terms

666
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:47,882
of being able to file me away. reach to see that easily. thanks a_lot.

667
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:53,507
had him main non- malignant affect his kidneys

668
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:58,547
and sexy braces that's we're at the store. it's another agent. this

669
01:00:58,547 --> 01:01:05,067
is considered a human person. really is a special case

670
01:01:05,067 --> 01:01:10,447
because the problem really is actually an allergic senses nation. and

671
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:15,587
so that means it can cause a chronic lung disease that can actually cause chronic lung disease. even lung

672
01:01:15,587 --> 01:01:21,027
disease needed gas and younger people that haven't been exposed for that case

673
01:01:21,027 --> 01:01:26,207
because it's a large spaces. has a different natural history. and always

674
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:32,427
tell me how seats we're talking about. okay. I think

675
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:37,447
there's not a metal because it causes a_lot_of it. now American fever is which is

676
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:42,447
you know self Limited. this is you get over it you don't

677
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:47,827
have_to say probably after words program. you know that. actually I'm calling

678
01:01:47,827 --> 01:01:53,863
from eight that cost problem including calling cancer

679
01:01:53,863 --> 01:01:59,263
and there's also a fax kidney making any big issues. Megan is

680
01:01:59,263 --> 01:02:04,503
with higher exposure is like two workers in processing workers doing my name.

681
01:02:04,503 --> 01:02:10,563
where they can look very much like classic part Parkinson's disease

682
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:18,463
changes and control Facey in the way walk. also putting

683
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:23,563
metal deterioration. okay. try and our special cancer.

684
01:02:23,563 --> 01:02:28,683
I have a general understanding Carson Genesis. what it is and how

685
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:34,103
it develops. we have a diagram remind you some of the key issues in the moment.

686
01:02:34,103 --> 01:02:39,343
we're at the clarification schemes for example you know that your cards

687
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:44,543
and all. which are chances arriving at the serial issue. most common

688
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:49,901
type of cancer receiver. like for example that arrived from connected

689
01:02:49,901 --> 01:02:55,681
tissue. so there's different ways there. name. I understand some of these broad

690
01:02:55,681 --> 01:03:01,581
mechanisms and cards Genesis. including for environmental and not special agent.

691
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:06,681
I appreciate the fact that we have all those chemicals in

692
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:11,761
commerce and most of them have never been tested for the parsonage and yesterday. so we don't know

693
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:16,961
it's not like with with respect to that issue and

694
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:22,401
I appreciate it. how about that. not an occupational

695
01:03:22,401 --> 01:03:27,641
exposure sometimes you can have extremely high problem. you have high exposure is usually

696
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:32,741
with me base exposure is worried about much lower exposure. but the large population that

697
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:37,781
I can increase your real lightly. you can select the number of people like

698
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:42,801
in this case. bye. exposures. so here's.

699
01:03:42,801 --> 01:03:48,941
this diagram to remind yourself. these are sort of by six names listed.

700
01:03:48,941 --> 01:03:54,115
go with transformation. Valerie cell line is actually

701
01:03:54,115 --> 01:03:59,195
in through cancer malignancy. I don't read them but have some awareness of

702
01:03:59,195 --> 01:04:05,155
those kinds of things. you shop at all something about the classification

703
01:04:05,155 --> 01:04:10,195
system that you don't have_to memorize this whole diagram but we as you know

704
01:04:10,195 --> 01:04:15,655
we talked about I about the times I would know that I wouldn't know that Tom. sorry about

705
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:21,155
what goes with what. okay. alright. hi Rajeev radiation

706
01:04:21,155 --> 01:04:26,575
radon. so you wanna know the properties is specific for sizing radiation

707
01:04:26,575 --> 01:04:32,515
we'll go over that in a moment. differences between various measures radio activity.

708
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:37,795
for the pass five o'clock today at the moment. and several issues about radon.

709
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:42,955
so this is Cascade we look at a_lot_of times remember it starts raining two thirty eight.

710
01:04:42,955 --> 01:04:48,215
the reason right on still a problem in around is because I half like you're in the two thirty

711
01:04:48,215 --> 01:04:53,259
eight it's about the agent so a_lot_of it still around and re

712
01:04:53,259 --> 01:04:58,519
on two twenty two. the first day think it's made and the fact that it's

713
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:03,579
got a half flight three to four days. I mean just got the

714
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:08,839
right amount of time to migrate the pressure differential the right

715
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:14,019
from soil or rock in two houses or another building

716
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:19,219
and then once it's in there. you can.

717
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:24,479
you can release now the particle and going to type type of money and also

718
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:30,059
release is now the particle in another type of phone he must be further down. also release

719
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:35,359
is part of calling issues those records balance he'll. now you got something

720
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:41,139
like we got hold of that you and when it reaches no particle

721
01:05:41,139 --> 01:05:46,419
because it cost a_lot_of damage now actual energy they have

722
01:05:46,419 --> 01:05:52,139
and all that and

723
01:05:52,139 --> 01:05:57,259
get started in a very short distance. you have a very high exposure to sell. which

724
01:05:57,259 --> 01:06:03,579
is probably why because of cancers.

725
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:08,799
so now the definition out data and again the radiation the three

726
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:14,479
times you get from typical station. bye. but the cascade. we're just looking at.

727
01:06:14,479 --> 01:06:21,119
you should know what they are what they are. you should know how well they penetrate

728
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:26,339
like Alpha doesn't go through these papers. everything paid it goes

729
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:31,433
further. again partner still and you should

730
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:37,393
know the difference. what's on the spot. the difference between threshold of

731
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:42,793
and on threshold threshold affects been determined yesterday.

732
01:06:42,793 --> 01:06:47,893
those response to the same individuals. this would be like you get at you. I have radiation

733
01:06:47,893 --> 01:06:53,313
exposure done and radiation and if it's higher not. sometimes

734
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:58,333
within minutes or hours but within a few days you develop nausea and vomiting because

735
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:03,493
it's interfering with the reproduction of the lining of your intestinal track. so

736
01:07:03,493 --> 01:07:10,393
that happens anybody. it's not problem if you get a not high enough those is gonna happen.

737
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:15,413
so it's not probably is that still Catholic which is basically a

738
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:22,133
fancy word for probably six non- threshold of fact at the parsonage and this is the fax

739
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:27,233
where there's a probability of getting cancer but it's a yes or no thing if you get the cancer you

740
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:32,266
don't. okay. so I understand the difference between these types

741
01:07:32,266 --> 01:07:37,546
of taxes and I was in mediation. we had talked about past.

742
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:42,586
this is a remember diagram showing you. if you go to seven half white you know

743
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:48,426
less than one percent of radio activity that was present before.

744
01:07:48,426 --> 01:07:53,726
actually let me just. so you should understand

745
01:07:53,726 --> 01:07:58,886
that you should understand that. having a short half

746
01:07:58,886 --> 01:08:04,146
life means that it might be a very a_lot_of radiation in a short time and be more potential he has it.

747
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:09,266
it also means that he won't stay for decades. if it

748
01:08:09,266 --> 01:08:15,606
has three short. so when you worry about things like what we do is radio active waste.

749
01:08:15,606 --> 01:08:20,946
change we worried about things that maybe a half six thousand a hundred thousand

750
01:08:20,946 --> 01:08:26,786
euros because it means for tens of thousands of years we have somehow worn our project.

751
01:08:26,786 --> 01:08:32,364
this might be present. and it's it's not like your two thirty eight which had such a long.

752
01:08:32,364 --> 01:08:37,364
you can use it at the door stop because it doesn't actually release radiation very often.

753
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:42,984
so in fact in between. that's really a problem. alright. I take to much time

754
01:08:42,984 --> 01:08:49,924
and we'll see what kind of tobacco auction here you are not ready to back up at half past

755
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:55,624
six this is easy. this was so long ago really for occupational perspective.

756
01:08:55,624 --> 01:09:00,704
talk to you soon probably tomorrow service. and we talked about

757
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:05,704
the big three. we have a Tennessee and HIV.

758
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:11,144
he got me extremely we're all

759
01:09:11,144 --> 01:09:16,244
collected between going in a little possible. this

760
01:09:16,244 --> 01:09:21,624
is the last day for us. you know years

761
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:26,882
since we talked about hepatitis_B.

762
01:09:26,882 --> 01:09:31,902
the dramatic dropping seeing that crap repeating please. I think the

763
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:37,022
TV that happens that you use it. it's typically a case

764
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:42,542
or a an outbreak in an institution because someone. sometimes

765
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:47,563
the health care workers sometimes the patient comes in. that Health Care Staff. don't

766
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:52,862
suspect and don't take the call. so you seen this this is gotta be burning

767
01:09:52,862 --> 01:09:58,222
to your brain. I've already heard that it was really affect second vaccine and

768
01:09:58,222 --> 01:10:03,722
universal cautions and also if you got to the picture with the standard and really dramatic

769
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:09,182
change not that long ago that we improved

770
01:10:09,182 --> 01:10:14,362
this desperate. have be the people got work. so hearing

771
01:10:14,362 --> 01:10:19,563
loss. similarly with Ariana Trias

772
01:10:19,563 --> 01:10:24,882
with spy Rama tree. understanding what audio quality on the tree. actually

773
01:10:24,882 --> 01:10:30,004
mirror measures it's pure tongs Matthew strong accountability to here we're just a pure

774
01:10:30,004 --> 01:10:35,084
towns and furious frequencies or pictures and make sense I think

775
01:10:35,084 --> 01:10:40,224
I understand what either of the numbers in the table or graph graphic

776
01:10:40,224 --> 01:10:46,284
presentation looks like with respect to noise hearing lost.

777
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:51,284
to bed about three or four thousand Hertz. what common

778
01:10:51,284 --> 01:10:57,264
characteristics of hearing loss. this call is playing noise. how we measure sound in decibel.

779
01:10:57,264 --> 01:11:03,104
a weighted scale. my definition preventable and review reversible.

780
01:11:03,104 --> 01:11:08,424
and also that such is noise but there were chemical exposures that can cause

781
01:11:08,424 --> 01:11:13,484
damage. so there's a good example of classic really noisy news

782
01:11:13,484 --> 01:11:18,764
here in lost. all these numbers all these values at a hundred twenty five two hundred fifty

783
01:11:18,764 --> 01:11:23,944
two thousand two thousand Hertz or in the normal range. if you get this tip

784
01:11:23,944 --> 01:11:29,372
in the abnormal range about four thousand in this Recovery at eight thousand.

785
01:11:29,372 --> 01:11:34,372
we have normal feelings. it's really noisy and just hearing loss and at

786
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:39,792
the top. again. more advanced

787
01:11:39,792 --> 01:11:44,872
noise and just hearing loss. compared to the same age and somebody who

788
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:50,132
is. who's got no hearing loss or very little noise induced

789
01:11:50,132 --> 01:11:55,352
hearing loss skin diseases.

790
01:11:55,352 --> 01:12:00,512
we're talking about a contactor advertise for the most part in that

791
01:12:00,512 --> 01:12:05,552
bad allergic first here in contacting behind it your tenant. contact

792
01:12:05,552 --> 01:12:10,792
Friday is much more common that for alert to contact.

793
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:15,912
I just there's patch testing that we can use and I talked about that article it's similar

794
01:12:15,912 --> 01:12:21,072
to the Christmas article for making a termination about specific call station so we know

795
01:12:21,072 --> 01:12:26,512
that exposure to a nickel causes the rash underneath you. watch you to call us

796
01:12:26,512 --> 01:12:32,252
the ration in this particular individual I talked about an article that discussed

797
01:12:32,252 --> 01:12:37,272
using various criteria for that. contact number time is

798
01:12:37,272 --> 01:12:42,432
zero ten. doesn't take much in terms of latency. this is a matter that does as opposed to

799
01:12:42,432 --> 01:12:47,872
alert or contact and retired and she had to get sense of time. you can take a bath and a patch of poison ID.

800
01:12:47,872 --> 01:12:53,032
if you've never had contact with poison ivy for. you will not get a rash

801
01:12:53,032 --> 01:12:58,592
and the latex allergy. it's a different kind of allergic reaction it's not mediated

802
01:12:58,592 --> 01:13:03,632
by cells. so mediated like in hyper sensitivity Newman IDs. it's

803
01:13:03,632 --> 01:13:08,940
like these things. the I GE type. it's the kind of

804
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:15,200
ass mother please and see this mediating my ID that similar kind of allergic mechanism.

805
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:20,200
just a picture and just a reminder of what how to contact number Titus. how much

806
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:25,280
to find. so Worker's_Comp. how

807
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:30,840
it came about individual state laws. there's a grand bargain.

808
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,180
protecting employers from high level exposure and also

809
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:41,180
gave the employee right to

810
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:46,660
to compensation without having to prove that the employer was

811
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:51,980
not having to take legal action. the kinda benefits we talked about weight loss

812
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:57,000
Medical Care vocational rehabilitation. when you get paid if you would your finger for

813
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,380
example that work. a_lot_of very ability. I think I drove that point home

814
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:07,380
from state to state and or Missouri really lots of states. many states most states we

815
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:13,065
don't have even the standard basic

816
01:14:13,065 --> 01:14:19,146
degree. first quarter principals met Jessie by

817
01:14:19,146 --> 01:14:24,545
federal studies. and then the general feeling. failure not only cover injury but also

818
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:29,646
in particular occupational illness. to shift work. talk

819
01:14:29,646 --> 01:14:35,345
about all the different kinds of shift work that there are and intermittent

820
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:40,425
exposures and so forth. very difficult question of defining and exposure

821
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:45,625
and therefore having any allergies that you can make sound in French is

822
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:51,166
from to lot of suggested data. and and but

823
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:58,186
much less solid evidence. so the link between exposure

824
01:14:58,186 --> 01:15:03,445
external use like abnormal lights at night. and how that affects

825
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:08,912
the logical responses. so keen written the importance the

826
01:15:08,912 --> 01:15:14,032
main biological clock the super classic. new players. but

827
01:15:14,032 --> 01:15:19,512
also the fact that there are biological clocks. just give me meetings throughout the cells

828
01:15:19,512 --> 01:15:24,672
of the body. the drive stat for wasteful nurse independently

829
01:15:24,672 --> 01:15:30,432
operating from the driver that initiate sleep

830
01:15:30,432 --> 01:15:35,652
and then peace. I think it's important to understand that. just the concepts behind

831
01:15:35,652 --> 01:15:40,672
the biological possibility. why shift your Canadian

832
01:15:40,672 --> 01:15:45,692
resumes and so forth can have can you print the fax neural fax and so forth. and

833
01:15:45,692 --> 01:15:50,992
therefore the range of health text that can flow from that. so we're still learning

834
01:15:50,992 --> 01:15:56,052
a_lot. the evidence is still coming through there's evidence forward

835
01:15:56,052 --> 01:16:01,212
again some of these affects and there's also established

836
01:16:01,212 --> 01:16:06,372
techniques for preventing. so if you have a population that work shift work. there are

837
01:16:06,372 --> 01:16:11,956
ways of providing tech needs light at night. for example and so forth.

838
01:16:11,956 --> 01:16:19,436
that can help control the shift work health disorders.

839
01:16:19,436 --> 01:16:25,875
it's important to share with the built environment is in the house yet. can be determined.

840
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:30,996
so many of our functions are how we move how we get from place

841
01:16:30,996 --> 01:16:36,116
to place. but we get exposed to and those are the difference. talk about this

842
01:16:36,116 --> 01:16:41,556
last week. this between controlling toxic environment store please two now. the idea

843
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:46,656
of creating an environment that not only prevent. that actually can provoke

844
01:16:46,656 --> 01:16:51,996
promote a healthy and it's part of the reason we came to focus

845
01:16:51,996 --> 01:16:57,396
on the vehicle environment is the fact that their social justice

846
01:16:57,396 --> 01:17:02,616
issues. I mentioned my name Brian this is Cathy School Natural Resources

847
01:17:02,616 --> 01:17:07,917
Department to really drop this question so if Jess's issues possible

848
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:13,877
relationship between the city mental health and building permit exposure to

849
01:17:13,877 --> 01:17:18,957
local neighborhoods neighborhoods are

850
01:17:18,957 --> 01:17:24,717
built environment. examples with there's mixed lots of excuse

851
01:17:24,717 --> 01:17:30,377
and connectivity walking infrastructure and so forth. how close can

852
01:17:30,377 --> 01:17:36,837
improve the health and similar to shield shift work. there's a_lot_of

853
01:17:36,837 --> 01:17:42,677
need for more recovery studies. more rigorous definitions of exposure

854
01:17:42,677 --> 01:17:47,997
and so forth. no technology. so there were pictures of

855
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:54,077
mental scale with two refills. I do suggest you read look at some of those pictures and understand

856
01:17:54,077 --> 01:17:59,877
the fact that science matters and that the size.

857
01:17:59,877 --> 01:18:05,068
talked about the fact that you can take the same absolute mass I

858
01:18:05,068 --> 01:18:10,168
the material in it's macro State versus my procedure and they can have very different health.

859
01:18:10,168 --> 01:18:15,328
so the micro state. the physical temple behaviors are really driven by.

860
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:20,788
these very very tiny structures service area. it's important.

861
01:18:20,788 --> 01:18:26,688
service area to master issues says that just now in a different way.

862
01:18:26,688 --> 01:18:32,208
really what we're what we're asking you to know is sort of the basics.

863
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:37,908
because we really have very limited information. there's so many materials

864
01:18:37,908 --> 01:18:44,308
that we could talk about and there's so much that we don't understand about them.

865
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:49,468
and it's an out_of uniform group. Tory talked about flexing air pollution. there's so

866
01:18:49,468 --> 01:18:54,828
many different constituents to air pollution. so the world of man on the truth there's so many constituents

867
01:18:54,828 --> 01:19:00,148
so many structures and sizes and so forth. so it gets more

868
01:19:00,148 --> 01:19:05,228
more complicated and you know later Ron. you'll get more access into

869
01:19:05,228 --> 01:19:11,348
the precautionary principal and that would sort of warn you to be careful.

870
01:19:11,348 --> 01:19:18,027
we don't really know much about these materials we probably wanna be more cautious safer than sorry.

871
01:19:18,027 --> 01:19:23,788
two. to prevent exposures and have serious

872
01:19:23,788 --> 01:19:28,828
epidemic that Rachel help tax and then the materials. before really understood what we

873
01:19:28,828 --> 01:19:33,948
were exposing people too. but I just talked about today is not gonna be on the exam

874
01:19:33,948 --> 01:19:38,948
it's fairly basic stuff it'll be on the final exam. you know I think

875
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:44,688
you said it right on time.

876
01:19:44,688 --> 01:19:50,261
any questions for either no questions.

877
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:55,341
so this is my last session here I've enjoyed the little bit of time ahead with

878
01:19:55,341 --> 01:20:03,660
you and I wish you all well. thanks
