1
00:00:10,264 --> 00:00:19,894
And you can see here that I've given a suggested reading assignment Chapter eight in either the 13th, 14th or 15th editions of Bailey and Scott.

2
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:31,754
So let's go on to the next slide. So in the laboratory, the microbiology laboratory, we're trying to detect microbial microbial pathogens,

3
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:34,904
and we can detect them by a variety of different methods.

4
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:44,744
We can do culture, which is actually biological amplification because we want the organism to grow in a standardized met method on specific media,

5
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:48,704
and we can identify it from that media. So we look for growth.

6
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:57,044
We can analyze the macro molecular composition of the organism can also analyze metabolic byproducts.

7
00:00:57,044 --> 00:01:05,874
And here we might see changes in biochemical tests. We could see changes in the color of colonies or media that it's grown on and so on.

8
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:11,934
We can detect the organisms protein components, this would be the antigens that using antibodies.

9
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:19,524
There are not antigen or antibody tests for every organism, but for certain ones there are.

10
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:25,884
We can also look for an immune response by a serologic test, a patient's immune response,

11
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:30,684
saying the patient has been exposed to this organism and now has an immune response.

12
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:39,564
And this is what we see. Say, if a patient a person is immunized, we would look to see if they have antibodies that would be their immune response.

13
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:47,874
And we can also look for a specific characteristic nucleic acid sequences by a molecular test.

14
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:53,334
And this is called enzymatic processes an enzymatic amplification.

15
00:01:53,334 --> 00:02:00,014
So there's a lot of ways to detect microbial pathogens. Next slide.

16
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:11,684
So why nucleic acid amplification test, they're also called Nat. So we use these when conventional methods are too slow sometimes,

17
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:20,024
so the generation time for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to reproduce itself is 24 hours.

18
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:29,084
So to get enough M tuberculosis to actually detect takes weeks of growth in order of wrath and the same thing.

19
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:34,514
Legionella is not quite as slow, but it still takes a while to detect that these are slow growing organisms.

20
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:40,484
We need to find out if a patient is infected and then get that patient on appropriate therapy.

21
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:47,474
Sometimes the tests are too insensitive because there isn't enough of the infectious agent that can be detected.

22
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:52,514
So that happens with asymptomatic infection with the human immunodeficiency virus.

23
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:59,174
Or it may happen. What we're trying to detect viral infection of the central nervous system.

24
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:06,834
So those are two examples of of insensitive tests to detect specific agents.

25
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:14,844
Sometimes the tests are too cumbersome. Yes, we can isolate virus viruses from specific sample types.

26
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:18,564
We have to isolate them to get them to grow. We have to put them in tissue culture.

27
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:24,624
You have to have fresh tissue culture in your laboratory and you have to sometimes incubate it for two or three weeks.

28
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:34,074
That's not very good for patient therapy to wait that long to see what they have for some viruses.

29
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:40,014
Human papillomavirus hepatitis C virus. These are non cultural agents.

30
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:45,474
We don't have a culture method, a conventional culture method available for these agents.

31
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:56,154
And finally, and most importantly, there's no single methodology that can identify all the potential infectious and important microorganisms.

32
00:03:56,154 --> 00:04:06,384
You have to have a wide variety of different types of tests in your laboratory to detect the potential infectious and important microorganisms.

33
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:17,124
Next slide. So we turn to nucleic acid amplified test nets, and they have a higher sensitivity and specificity than culture tests.

34
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:25,644
They have a much shorter turnaround time. You can get the test done in a few hours and there's an overall reduction in patient care costs.

35
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:35,394
But and this is a big but the individual cost for test is higher for molecular tests than for culture tests.

36
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:41,484
And some insurance policies may not reimburse reimbursed at the higher rate.

37
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:47,384
So there may be a cost financial cost to the patient.

38
00:04:47,384 --> 00:05:00,674
Next slide. So molecular testing for infectious diseases is very, very important, so we can do qualitative detection of pathogen nucleic acid.

39
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:07,094
And here we're looking for presence or absence of the target molecular target.

40
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:11,174
We can do quantitative detection of pathogen nucleic acid,

41
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:21,344
and this is done to monitor the response to therapy so as the patient is being treated with supposedly an appropriate drug or drugs.

42
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:30,154
Does the amount of nucleic acid from the pathogen decrease and that can be quantitatively then?

43
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:33,074
And then that is a way of monitoring response to therapy.

44
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:41,354
Then there's genetic characterization of the pathogen, and this is very, very important use of molecular testing for infectious diseases.

45
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:49,574
So on very often, specific types or subtypes of an organism have prognostic value.

46
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:55,454
And so you can tell if it's subtype A or subtype Q, whatever it is.

47
00:05:55,454 --> 00:06:02,324
Patients are going to do better, patients going to do worse. Along with this, we can tell if there are resistant mechanisms,

48
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:11,534
resistant mechanisms that would make some drugs inactive and avoid those drugs if possible.

49
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:20,264
Next slide. So here's just a partial list of organisms detected by polymerase chain reaction.

50
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,584
Excuse me.

51
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:31,994
M. Tuberculosis that I've already mentioned legionella Borrelia burgdorferi, massless influenza pertussis, mÃ©nage 2f edema pallidum causes syphilis.

52
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:34,094
Just this list just goes on and on.

53
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:44,624
So these are resistance mechanisms than A and B and an MC that we've got viruses over here HIV human T lymphocytic virus,

54
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:49,184
Ciroma Gallo of herpes simplex two and herpes virus, and so on.

55
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:54,464
And then on the right hand side, we've got some more viruses all the way down through arboviruses and yellow fever.

56
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:58,124
Lassa fever very, very serious. Fortunately, not in the United States.

57
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:07,124
And then on the bottom right hand side, we can detect some fungal organisms by and parasitic organisms by PCR.

58
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:17,204
So it'd be Candida species Cryptococcus, potentially Cryptococcus neoformans, which is a cause of fungal meningitis in immunocompromised patients.

59
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:26,624
And then some parasites Trypanosoma Toxoplasma, Naegleria in the list just goes on and on and on.

60
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:38,084
So what do we do if we're doing a molecular test, we have to process the specimens we have to do, make sure the target can be detected.

61
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:47,384
And then once it's detect we have to do a post-death amplification detection step and then hopefully do some real time detection,

62
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,904
quality assurance has to be done.

63
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:59,444
And then for the test to be utilized correctly, excuse me, utilized correctly, there has to be an interpretation of the test results.

64
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:09,314
So going on, so the goals of specimen processing are we want to have efficient target recovery because if we don't efficiently recover the target,

65
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:14,984
the chances are the test will be negative. We need to maintain the integrity of nucleic acid,

66
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:22,604
the target through the various steps of the test and not destroy it in the process of setting up the test.

67
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:35,114
Excuse me, we may need to remove any inhibitors of the amplification process and eliminate any components that might affect the substrates.

68
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:39,824
And then finally, this is a very important goal.

69
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:50,064
Sterilize any potentially hazardous organisms so they don't get out into the environment, don't infect anyone else and so on.

70
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:58,734
Next slide. So in specimen processing, we oftentimes heat treat the specimens, so the specimen may be added to water or buffer,

71
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:12,164
and then it's boiled or it's heated, and that that heats step releases nucleic acid and then an adequate of this is used as a template for the assay.

72
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:21,854
Next slide. Continuing on with specimen processing, you can have a chemical, you can do a chemical extraction of total nucleic acid.

73
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:29,024
And briefly, what you do is you, you, you utilize protein S proteins, K digestion.

74
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:35,324
And this is a searing proteins that cleaves the peptide bonds near the adjacent

75
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:43,004
carboxylic acid carboxylic group of alphabetic and amino aromatic amino acids.

76
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:49,004
And it is very useful for general digestion of protein and biological symptoms.

77
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:56,234
Samples You can then do an extraction with phenol chloroform as a solution.

78
00:09:56,234 --> 00:10:01,574
You can then precipitate your your protein with salt and ethanol.

79
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:13,744
You then wash the pellet with cold ethanol and then resuspended in sterile water, and then you have your extraction of your total nucleic acid.

80
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:23,374
Specimen processing can also include a silica particle method when this takes advantage of the nucleic acid binding properties of silica,

81
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:28,294
so you can add the dust, the digested specimen to a column.

82
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:34,394
Wash it with buffer. Elude it with water, and you can specifically,

83
00:10:34,394 --> 00:10:43,074
Luther the irony by adding a DNA step and this is all encouraging spin column so you don't have to do it manually.

84
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:52,164
Next slide. So here's a Cajun spin column procedure for micro futures on the left or vacuum manifolds on the right,

85
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:57,114
so you can see you put the the sample in a microfiche tube and it's sliced.

86
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:02,124
And then you add a binding reagent and then on the right, you vacuum it.

87
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:07,584
And on the left, it's washed off. It's filtered, and then both of them are washed.

88
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:12,174
And on the right, on the vacuum manifolds, it's vacuumed again, filtered again.

89
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:18,384
And then you have pure DNA or RNA and you go through another vacuuming step.

90
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:22,434
Oh, excuse me, filtering step on the left in the micro futures.

91
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:32,514
Couple of them. And then you have pure DNA or RNA. So going on with specimen processing tissues, if you're going to be testing tissues,

92
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:39,234
they need to be homogenized prior to testing and this this sample of tissue needs to be ground up to be homogenized.

93
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,664
CSF is considered a clean specimen.

94
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:54,504
It doesn't need any other processing blood, either whole or fractionated can be tested, but it cannot be blood that's been placed in a heparin tube.

95
00:11:54,504 --> 00:12:01,644
If you're looking for HIV, you look in plasma for RNA. If you're looking for CMV, you look at whole blood for DNA.

96
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:07,914
So you once again we can differentiate RNA containing viruses from DNA containing viruses.

97
00:12:07,914 --> 00:12:14,574
Urine can be tested as it is. It's sometimes considered a clean specimen, depending on how it's collected.

98
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:16,104
If it's looking at sputum,

99
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:26,844
it needs to be digested and decontamination before you start the molecular side of things because there's a lot of protein in this material in there,

100
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:34,314
and it's a lot of contaminants in there. And then if you're looking at stool specimen, feces are considered dirty as specimens,

101
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:41,974
and they have a lot of inhibitors present that need to be taken into account and handled.

102
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:50,344
So here is an exam type question, which of the following is a goal of specimen processing for nucleic acid extraction?

103
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:58,854
Do we want to maintain the viability of the organism? Do we want to preserve the amplification inhibitors?

104
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:06,954
Do we want to reduce concentration of target? Or do we want to prevent target degradation?

105
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:15,744
And I can see if we were in class, all of you raising your hands and saying the answer is do we want to prevent target degradation?

106
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:19,044
So all of this testing does not need to be done by hand.

107
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:27,474
There are wonderful types of equipment that can be purchased for laboratories to handle all of the steps,

108
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:33,714
and they vary depending on what you're looking for. But as you can see here in the top, we've got the can,

109
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:41,004
we've got the magnet here on the bottom of the hand, a lot of the pipetting steps that are so specific.

110
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:49,024
But they have been automated and it really does save time in the laboratory. Next slide.

111
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:55,444
So here we have the various steps of a DNA test.

112
00:13:55,444 --> 00:14:02,164
So step a the sample material that would be the cells of could be blood could be homogenized tissue.

113
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:06,724
And as you can see, you don't need very much of them is placed into the wells of the sample cartridge

114
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:11,254
and it can be a tube or it can be a micro-targeted tray and steps B and C,

115
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:17,414
the binding and lysis buffers and protein binding or lysis buffer.

116
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:29,914
Yeah, and proteins K are added to the sample. So that's in steps B and C and then Step D magnetic glass particles are added to the life samples.

117
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:36,364
The DNA binds to the surface of these particles. I think that's really cool.

118
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:50,044
So here we have the binding to the particles in step that step by step E. The magnetic glass particles with the adsorbed DNA in step with

119
00:14:50,044 --> 00:15:01,144
the adsorbed DNA are recovered from the wells of the of the processing cartridge by applying a magnet from the outside of the pipette tips.

120
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:11,824
So here is the magnet on the outside and then in steps F through H, the DNA is washed and eluted from the glass particles,

121
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:24,234
whereas the glass particles are retained in the reaction tip and discarded. And I think this is a very nice schematic that explains how this is done.

122
00:15:24,234 --> 00:15:30,324
So target detection can be done by additional methods. There can be target directed probes are very specific.

123
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:36,684
We can do a gen probe assay for culture confirmation of a number of different organisms.

124
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:41,664
We can do the diet in hybrid capture for detection of human papillomavirus.

125
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:45,954
Those are target detected probes for specific organisms.

126
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:55,284
We can also do target amplification and we can do a PCR polymerase chain reaction for DNA targets.

127
00:15:55,284 --> 00:16:03,424
But for RNA targets, we do reverse transcriptase with RTP cell known as our PCR for RNA.

128
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:11,344
And then there's Nasbe, a nucleic acid sequence based amplification and transcription mediated amplification TME.

129
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:16,474
Both of those are used for target amplification also.

130
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:27,884
And then finally, we can do a Bayer has a branched DNA assay for signal amplification and make the signal more easy to detect.

131
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:37,664
Next slide. Other target detected probes, they could have synthetic genomic sequences specific for an organism of interest.

132
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:46,784
Say you're trying to see if a patient has gonorrhea, there will be specific genomic sequences specific for Neisseria gonorrhea.

133
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:53,474
These can be hybridized with DNA or RNA. Targets in a specimen can be a direct specimen or a culture isolate.

134
00:16:53,474 --> 00:17:01,784
And then the probes are labeled with enzymes, antigens or can be luminescent moieties, or they can even be radioisotope isotopes.

135
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:07,334
And these are all target detected probes. So here's a gaijin hybrid capture.

136
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,764
It's for general culture.

137
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:19,444
You can see what it looks like, and you can see the various genetic sequences and the the capture of the probes on the outside.

138
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:26,674
Next slide. So going along in target detection and target amplification, we have you all of, I'm sure,

139
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:31,894
heard of PCR reactions, polymerase chain reaction of DNA targets works very, very well.

140
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:44,134
This is primer initiated. It requires thermo stable polymerase DNA TPS, which is a lot easier than saying deoxy nucleotides and magnesium.

141
00:17:44,134 --> 00:17:50,464
So double stranded DNA is denatured at 94 degrees centigrade.

142
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:55,474
Then the primers are inhaled at 50 degrees centigrade or higher.

143
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:01,504
And then when their temperature is changed to 72 degrees, the primers extend.

144
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:08,104
They get longer and longer and longer. And this process, this three step process, takes one minute each,

145
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:18,314
and it can be repeated for 25 to 40 cycles so that there's enough present to be detected.

146
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:23,924
So here's a schematic of a PCR reaction, and this is 30 to 40 cycles of three steps each.

147
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:31,604
The first step is DNA tracing, so they take double stranded DNA and denature it, so it's not double stranded anymore.

148
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:36,764
It takes one minute at 94 degrees centigrade. The second step is annealing.

149
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:44,054
It takes 45 seconds at 54 degrees, and it can use either forward or reverse primers, depending on what you're looking for.

150
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:49,874
And then once the parameters are attached, those extended an extension of the of the chain reaction.

151
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:54,704
It takes two minutes at 72 degrees, and as they're extended,

152
00:18:54,704 --> 00:18:59,504
you get enough to detect and that's what you really want to be able to detect

153
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:06,224
what's there and you can get it detected on both sides of this of the DNA,

154
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:13,964
which is which has been separated apart. Next slide.

155
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:18,284
So this is another schematic of exponential amplification, I think it's pretty cool.

156
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:24,164
So we have the template DNA and it has the the wanted gene in red, first circle, first cycle.

157
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:32,714
We have to do the second multiplications. We have four copies, second cycle, we get eight copies.

158
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:36,704
Third cycle, we get 16 copies if we go to the fourth cycle.

159
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:42,134
We have 32 copies if we go out to the 35th cycle.

160
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:49,394
We have 68 million copies, that ought to be enough for anybody to detect. And I say that jokingly, but this is this is great.

161
00:19:49,394 --> 00:20:01,404
It's very easy to be done. Exponential amplification and the the you're amplifying the wanted gene very rapidly to see if it's present.

162
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:14,634
Does not take long. Next slide. So going on again and target amplification, we have researched reverse transcriptase R t PCR for RNA targets.

163
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:26,184
And so when we do this targeted amplification for RNA targets, we do a conversion of RNA to complementary DNA using reverse transcriptase.

164
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:34,104
So this is primer initiated at 42 degrees and it takes one hour and there might be random Hexham Hex summers.

165
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:40,704
There could be algo de TS anchored, which are anchored reverse transcriptase primers and PCR primers,

166
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:45,894
and then complementary DNA is used as a template for the PCR.

167
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:50,544
So going onto the next slide, we have post amplification detection methods.

168
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:56,154
There can be gel electrophoresis. There can be colorimetric micro or tray.

169
00:20:56,154 --> 00:21:01,434
There could be chemical luminescence. Or they could be real time fluorescence detection.

170
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:09,164
So we have a variety of different methods to determine whether amplification has occurred.

171
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:17,804
Next slide. So this is gel electrophoresis, we have an inaugural straw polyacrylamide gel stayed with a of bromide.

172
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:24,314
At the top is it shows all the controls and on the bottom shows which ones are positive.

173
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:29,534
So the first one on the left and the fourth is a weak positive six, seven, maybe the eighth.

174
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:38,874
Another control strip and so on. So top is control's bottom as positive as true positives.

175
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:45,504
Going on with post amplification detection, we could look at a you a colorimetric, micro-targeted plate,

176
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:55,614
so the product captured by the probe is attached to the plate and then enzyme conjugated probes catalyze a colorimetric reaction.

177
00:21:55,614 --> 00:22:04,524
And this is then read on a spectrophotometer that's using post amplification detection by a colorimetric, micro-targeted trade.

178
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:10,194
You can also do post amplification detection using chemical Kemah luminescence.

179
00:22:10,194 --> 00:22:24,434
And this in this test, a conjugated conjugated capture probes catalyze the chemical luminescence reaction, and they're read on a aluminum ometer.

180
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:31,724
So this is an example of real time fluorescence detection. We're using direct detection and indirect detection.

181
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:36,404
This is direct interpolation of dye into double standard strand of DNA.

182
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:42,434
And it uses cyber green dye. So here we have the primer. We have cyber green dyes.

183
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:53,114
And when the primer binds, you get emitted light because due to the cyber green.

184
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:59,054
And if you add polymers there, it multiplies and you get even more light.

185
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:05,354
So you have to have polymerase lengthening the that that new chain to get enough to be detected

186
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:13,514
and the amount detected is an indication of of whether or not the patient is infected.

187
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:21,404
Next slide. So in post amplification detection, we can use real time fluorescence detection with detector probes.

188
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:30,314
These might be dual labeled probes are included in the reaction there would be a reporter probe and a quencher probe reporter to say Yes,

189
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:35,324
I'm here and I'm attached, and the question is to do other things.

190
00:23:35,324 --> 00:23:39,344
Those are detector probes that could also be hydrolysis probes,

191
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:47,294
and these are high can be characterized as they detect probes emit a very low fluorescence.

192
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:51,494
So if you're using Tak, Tak cleaves the reporter from the bound probe,

193
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:59,744
so it splits the reporter off in the bound probe and the amount of reporter cleaved off is proportional to the amount of application produced.

194
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:07,714
And then this is read by whatever type of detection equipment you're using in your laboratory.

195
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:12,184
Next slide. So here we have an amplification product on the top.

196
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:19,354
We have oligo one which contains a fluorescent and I'll go to which has a die or die.

197
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:28,504
And so in comes the light and DNA or RNA, and it's amplified.

198
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:33,904
And here we have our double stranded DNA, it it's it's excited.

199
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:42,124
It transfers the segments here, the labeled segments to our DNA,

200
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:55,324
and that the emission once it's transferred and it binds, there is an emission and that is measured on your equipment.

201
00:24:55,324 --> 00:25:06,784
So all that this next slide shows it's from Kim Biochim in 2003, these are really well known drawings of the various detection, dyes and mechanisms.

202
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:16,484
So cyber green, if it's if it attaches to the DNA, it produces a color that can be detected going down.

203
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:28,924
We have Fred hybridization, excuse me. And so if if we have binding down here as shown, we get a signal that can be detected.

204
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:39,424
We have tech man down here on the bottom and see. And if it binds to a complementary target, you, it will be detected.

205
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:44,764
Molecular beacons are on the upper right hand side. Once they bind, they are can be detected.

206
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:48,934
They can't be detected if they don't bind and then sunrise and scorpion.

207
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:52,504
I think scorpions are cool, so I just because I like the name anyway.

208
00:25:52,504 --> 00:26:06,784
So these are the various detection methods. So we can also do, as I mentioned before, real time quantitation by the number of amplification copies.

209
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:10,894
Excuse me, amplification cycles till it's detected.

210
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:22,564
So you can see in the bluish purple line down on the bottom that we have zero copies at 50 amplification cycles.

211
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:35,944
And if it if it is depending on what is being amplified, it may take 10 copies before it reaches a significant number of 50 amplification cycles.

212
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:39,874
Or if it's a high level quantitation,

213
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:51,104
you make it all the way up to 10 to the fourth copies at 50 amplification cycles depends on what you're looking for and what your methods are.

214
00:26:51,104 --> 00:27:01,304
Next slide. So this is just examples of, you know, the log concentration versus the cycle number on the bottom.

215
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:14,564
And so the log concentration decreases as you get out further to the right and you can see that there is a correlation between

216
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:23,744
a lower cycle number and earlier detection of whatever is a 10 to the six and the top doesn't say what the product is.

217
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:29,714
But in the red line, on the top and a little bit slower detection,

218
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:39,194
it detects that the blue line in the center at 10 to the fifth copies and the Green Line lowered its lower number of copies 10 to the fourth copies.

219
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:47,184
But they're all positives. So you can see you can look at it by cycle number also.

220
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:51,834
Next slide. So it's nice to be able to do this by hand,

221
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:59,814
but it's even nicer to have it an automated and there's a variety of different companies that make automation analytic detection equipment.

222
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:04,164
So the Roche Cobas has been around for a while.

223
00:28:04,164 --> 00:28:15,594
Roche makes cold loss, its use for Chlamydia trachomatis and Nicea gonorrhea detection, herpes, HCV, hepatitis B and cytomegalovirus.

224
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:19,144
The Kobus Tech Man 48. There's a light cycle.

225
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:30,444
There's various amplification and the types of amplification and detection equipment that can be used in laboratories for doing molecular testing.

226
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:34,134
Next slide. So here's a cool boss on the upper left hand side.

227
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:41,724
Obviously, you need a lot of bed space for this. The white cyclers on the bottom and this is the other one, and they're they're enclosed.

228
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:51,624
You don't have sprays of things shooting out, so it's all enclosed once your tubes are loaded and the top is closed.

229
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:54,684
Next slide, so this is the Abbott in 200 takes a little bit of space,

230
00:28:54,684 --> 00:29:02,694
but can do a wider variety of different types of tests on the Abbott and from starting out in molecular labs,

231
00:29:02,694 --> 00:29:10,194
doing DNA probes years and years and years ago. It's nice not to have to do all of the pipetting and to have the equipment do it.

232
00:29:10,194 --> 00:29:15,264
The equipment doesn't make the mistakes that people do for the most part.

233
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:23,064
And it can be computed added to the computers, have computer access right here on the right hand side of a keyboard here.

234
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:24,144
Actually, a couple of keyboards.

235
00:29:24,144 --> 00:29:32,054
So it is fairly automated and it is a very good system and they're all all of the systems have their pros and their cons.

236
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:39,564
Nothing is perfect, obviously, but it depends on what you're trying to look for and how much time and space and money you have.

237
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:47,664
So here's the bill fire fill system and this you insert the pouch into the loading station,

238
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:58,074
you inject the hydration solution, inject the sample, add the pouch to the film array and press the run button.

239
00:29:58,074 --> 00:30:04,974
And what happens inside of this machine is that there is cell lysis.

240
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:12,774
OK, so first you have the sample injection port and you inject your whatever you're putting in there in Liszt's cells.

241
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:19,524
Then you get DNA or RNA purification and you can run multiple PCR is PCR one,

242
00:30:19,524 --> 00:30:25,044
PCR two and you have a water injection site if you need to add additional fluid.

243
00:30:25,044 --> 00:30:35,064
So if you go to a PCR one in a studio looted 100 times, you can get a lot more of a PCR on your second PCR and you get a better identification.

244
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:44,874
This type of system is used to identify multiple infectious agents, such as the respiratory viruses that you see here on the lower right hand side.

245
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:50,304
So in this one sample pouch that you can see on the bottom with the various colors on it,

246
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:56,004
you could detect influenza for rhinovirus or enterovirus, and typically those are not separated.

247
00:30:56,004 --> 00:31:03,054
Influenza H1 2009 coronavirus adenovirus, patella pertussis, respiratory syncytial virus,

248
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:09,984
influenza A, influenza B, metahuman virus and chlamydia there an Ofelia excuse me, pneumonia.

249
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:21,624
So this is a test that you can detect multiple pathogens and so you don't have to do separate tests for each one.

250
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:26,664
Next slide. Well, we have to do quality assurance with all of our testing, we have to make sure that we have RNAs,

251
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:33,234
free materials and yet in our free environment, technologies absolutely need to wear gloves.

252
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:33,634
Of course,

253
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:44,484
the wearing laboratory gowns also and the water that is used in the test must be pretreated to remove all races because if there are races present,

254
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:48,294
multiplication will be disturbed.

255
00:31:48,294 --> 00:31:58,134
So in all molecular labs, we have separation of the work areas and unidirectional floor flow in the laboratory and in the test system.

256
00:31:58,134 --> 00:32:07,434
So we have in one area, we have reagent prep, another area, we have specimen prep and then another area we have amplification and detection.

257
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:12,234
So we have uniform unit, directional flow and separation of our work areas.

258
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:24,064
So there are no contamination problems. And we need all this for appropriate quality assurance for molecular testing for all RNAs.

259
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:32,374
OK. So along with more on quality assurance, we have to prevent cross-contamination of our harmful cards.

260
00:32:32,374 --> 00:32:40,684
So if we have cross-contamination, obviously the test is no good so we can use you and you, which is your asil DNA glycosylation.

261
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:45,874
And as in our prevention of amplicon across cross-contamination,

262
00:32:45,874 --> 00:32:51,034
we also have to use barrier tips so there's no cross-contamination and topical decontamination.

263
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:53,674
Closed systems are critical.

264
00:32:53,674 --> 00:33:02,264
Now we have to put in blank wills or tubes so that when we test them, if they come up positive, we will know that there's there's cross-contamination.

265
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:06,314
Are processing controls are generally spiked specimens.

266
00:33:06,314 --> 00:33:15,944
Specimens that should be negative, but we have spiked them, so we have a positive control and our amplification controls include internal controls.

267
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:21,944
And if the internal controls failure that indicate a failure that there's no

268
00:33:21,944 --> 00:33:30,334
amplification that including shows that there's inhibition of the reaction.

269
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:35,264
Next slide. So I I suppose I will read this.

270
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:42,134
So this is amplification of sodium bisulfite treated DNA, and it's widely used to study DNA methylation.

271
00:33:42,134 --> 00:33:46,064
And you can see the steps here. You can see the explanation.

272
00:33:46,064 --> 00:33:52,574
So the proportion of methylated sequences of a specific DNA region in a sample can be determined by the

273
00:33:52,574 --> 00:34:01,664
analysis of PCR products or directly calculated from real time PCR amplification of bisulfite treated DNA.

274
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:12,284
So there's two ways that you can do the analysis PCR based methods always involve the risk of false positive or incorrect quantitative results.

275
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:17,304
And this might be due to unintended amplification of contaminating PCR products.

276
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:23,464
So you have to be so very careful you don't have any contaminating PCR products.

277
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:29,524
So the incubation of PCR reactions with your cell DNA glycosylated, also known as USG,

278
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:38,534
prior to the thermal cycling in combination with use of de UTP deoxy, you're ready to try for spin, try phosphine.

279
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:46,084
Yes, the DNA and the PCR bifurcation is commonly used technology to prevent cross-contamination.

280
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:55,804
If you got if you have cross-contamination, you have to start over and starting over in any test is takes a lot of time and takes a lot of money.

281
00:34:55,804 --> 00:35:03,394
Since sodium bisulfite treatment converts on methylated cytosine basis into your cell residues,

282
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:11,734
not only contaminating PCR products, but also the converted template days would be degraded as well.

283
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:15,664
So you have to watch out for this also.

284
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:26,944
Now, most tests now on the market are fairly automated, and the concern over contaminating PCR products has been reduced.

285
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:37,064
But it doesn't mean that it can't happen. And so this is something that all persons performing molecular testing need to watch out for.

286
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:45,074
Next slide. So how do we interpret results because we don't know if an organism is dead or alive in a person?

287
00:35:45,074 --> 00:35:55,964
So we have molecular tests of cure, so you could have persistent dead chlamydia if you're doing a test to cure.

288
00:35:55,964 --> 00:36:01,844
Doesn't. That doesn't help you. It doesn't help you know whether or not the person is over, say, a chlamydia infection.

289
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:09,074
If you've got dead chlamydia present, you can have persistent presence of nucleic acid versus disease.

290
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:15,134
You don't know if nucleic acid is active, not active, or if there's actually disease production.

291
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:25,154
So these results presence of nucleic acid or a positive result need to be taken in context with the patient's clinical presentation.

292
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:30,224
We see this in herpes simplex virus of the central nervous system and CSF.

293
00:36:30,224 --> 00:36:33,794
So is the patient getting better? Is the patient doing better?

294
00:36:33,794 --> 00:36:39,144
What are the guidelines on what when you tested the patient's CSF and blood?

295
00:36:39,144 --> 00:36:42,254
Or are they started to look better? So you have to.

296
00:36:42,254 --> 00:36:48,824
Even though you could have nucleic acid, it doesn't always mean that there's disease could be the disease is diminishing,

297
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:59,084
but some nucleic acid is still present. And then finally, be aware of the differences between causal versus casual.

298
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:04,064
This is the difference between necessary and necessary and sufficient.

299
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:10,034
So a patient may have herpes HPV.

300
00:37:10,034 --> 00:37:15,854
That doesn't mean that they will have automatically have a cervical cancer.

301
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:19,754
But we know herpes HPV is not herpes simplex.

302
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:33,564
Human papillomavirus can be involved in cervical cancer, and so if HPV is present, the patient needs to be tested and checked for cervical cancer.

303
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:44,674
Next slide. So what are the applications of various molecular tests so we can detect uncomfortable organisms are slowly growing organisms,

304
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:50,904
whereby it might take weeks to get slow growers to be detected by a growth test?

305
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:58,034
We can identify organisms versus stickiness, our RNA sequencing.

306
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:04,604
We can do prognostication depending on what subtypes of an organism might be present.

307
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:10,484
Now this is not always available for various organisms. Sometimes it is.

308
00:38:10,484 --> 00:38:14,984
We can monitor how the disease is progressing by how much.

309
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:18,914
What is the level of detection in the molecular assay?

310
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:25,424
It won't tell you how many virus particles are present, but it will be a quantitation that you can see if the number is going down.

311
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:30,704
The disease is probably getting better depending on the test that's being used.

312
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:35,744
We can also do genotypic approaches to look for resistance.

313
00:38:35,744 --> 00:38:42,584
So remember I said that sometimes bacteria may have a resistance factor,

314
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:49,634
antibiotic resistance factor that's not being detected, but in the presence of that antibiotic antibiotic.

315
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:59,714
That there is a specific resistance factor for the resistance factor may become active and destroy the ability of that drug to be to be useful.

316
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:07,574
So we want to look to see if there is resistance resistant factors present and we can do this molecularly.

317
00:39:07,574 --> 00:39:11,684
And we can also look at outbreak investigations to all the people in the outbreak.

318
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:19,054
Have the same organism. Are there various different organisms involved in the outbreak?

319
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:26,754
Next slide. So let's talk about influenza since we are now in influenza season.

320
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:33,084
So. This is a side that was made a few years ago,

321
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:41,604
and it has the percentage of visits for influenza like illness reported by sentinel providers statewide in regions citywide.

322
00:39:41,604 --> 00:39:48,594
And so we have the regions are Central Michigan, North, Southeast, Southwest and then the Big Black Line is statewide.

323
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:57,264
So you have down the bottom, you have dates starting with March 11th and it goes over to December 30th.

324
00:39:57,264 --> 00:40:02,814
And you can see that in March.

325
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:11,304
And we had a fairly high number of cases of influence in in northern Michigan and then that dropped down.

326
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:24,174
But then again, it peaked again in June and into July and then again ahead of a smaller peak in September and a larger peak in the in December,

327
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:32,994
which is when we would start seeing influenza. If you look at say, you can also look for the amount of drug in a specific area.

328
00:40:32,994 --> 00:40:41,184
So if we look at southeast here where we are in Ann Arbor, it's the Green Line and you can see that we had a peak.

329
00:40:41,184 --> 00:40:50,524
This is several years ago. As the chart says, peak in percent of visual visits for influenza like illness back in March and April.

330
00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:56,154
Then the numbers dropped down. There was a little spike, a small spike, in July.

331
00:40:56,154 --> 00:41:01,764
And then, as we would expect, the numbers start increasing in the fall and into the winter.

332
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:08,994
So this is data from the state health lab and they use this data and they share this data with CDC.

333
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:13,194
Also, CDC uses this and does national surveillance.

334
00:41:13,194 --> 00:41:23,964
So in this year, 2017 and 18, the 5.8 percent of outpatient visits were due to influenza like illness,

335
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:29,754
which is above the national baseline of 2.2 percent.

336
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:33,714
So some interesting information, and you can get more of this type of information,

337
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:44,104
both on the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website, the M.D. HHS website, as well as the CDC website.

338
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:50,644
Next slide. And then this is just data that I put in from Beaumont Health.

339
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:57,394
And you can see that weekly test volume and this is from January of 2018.

340
00:41:57,394 --> 00:42:05,044
So it goes from the 30 second week of 2017 through the first week of 2018.

341
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:17,494
And the green it green is RSV pink as flu B and blue bars are flu A. And then the total amount of respiratory viruses is the lid,

342
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:27,094
and you can see that as usual, influenza and RSV showed up at about the same time, but it was a big year for RSV.

343
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:39,734
Sometimes RSV is not that big, and it was also a huge year for Influenza A on 20 18 19 year.

344
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:45,874
So these charts are always available, and you can look at them online and see what's going on.

345
00:42:45,874 --> 00:42:56,044
Or if you're doing a study, you can pull the data and look at it that way also. So this is more data from Beaumont Health and this virus detected.

346
00:42:56,044 --> 00:43:01,894
And this is the number of viruses detected and you can see the blue line is the total.

347
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:07,294
And if we go over here to the right hand side.

348
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:16,654
OK, so let's start on the left. So we have in 2017 week thirty two, we had four cases of influenza A influence influenza A.

349
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:27,844
We had a fair amount of human respiratory HIV and then we had the purple, which is a period influenza A one through four.

350
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:34,174
Yeah, those numbers stayed kind of stable for, you know, a few weeks.

351
00:43:34,174 --> 00:43:42,994
And then we saw big increases in HIV and the number of peer influences didn't go away.

352
00:43:42,994 --> 00:43:49,084
But they they weren't that large. But as we got over into the the last weeks of the year,

353
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:55,264
we could see a lot more viral infections and that was exactly what we look for every year viral infections,

354
00:43:55,264 --> 00:44:05,334
picking up when school starts and then as winter progresses and people are indoors, we see a lot more respiratory viral infections.

355
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:15,564
So I have talked about resistance factors, so we've got a couple of good papers listed here,

356
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:27,694
this conventional PCR for metallo beta lactamase by Ellington and all was published in 2007 and it has intrinsic.

357
00:44:27,694 --> 00:44:37,114
To ask, Anita Ballymoney acquired OXA Cava devices in an Acinetobacter.

358
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:46,984
And so there was a paper by Ellington in 2007. There was a paper by Woodard Watford in 2006, another paper in 2010.

359
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:53,404
And Higgins really talked about the most commonly applied technique to detect them amplification targets where they conserved.

360
00:44:53,404 --> 00:44:58,294
Were they variable within the gene of interest, how it interests? How often were they changing?

361
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:06,964
How variable were they? And then a separate post PCR detection using agarose gel was very, very useful.

362
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:16,124
So there's a number of papers here that you can pull up from the library if you're interested in reading about how these studies were done.

363
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:23,954
Next slide. So here's a couple of references for this paper by Blake Buchanan Nate Lattimore in 2014,

364
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:28,274
Emerging Technologies for the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory in clinical reviews

365
00:45:28,274 --> 00:45:33,704
probably have to get this from the library because unless you're an Asymm member,

366
00:45:33,704 --> 00:45:41,594
you probably can't pull micro reviews and then performance and application of the 16 hour RNA gene cycle.

367
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:47,474
And that's publication information is right here. And if you want to look up any more and then of course,

368
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:55,964
your textbook will have information on molecular testing also, and that is it for this lecture.

369
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:58,587
Thank you so much. I'm done with this and also.
