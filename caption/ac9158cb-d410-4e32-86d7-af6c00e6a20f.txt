1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,389
All right. I'm going to use the same thing.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:34,000
And I also think this is because we don't like of these things, like things like that.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,810
You want to make it preservation of display.

4
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,010
Yeah, I know.

5
00:00:48,930 --> 00:01:02,720
When I went to the job, I was I finally got to work in one case and I was like, yes, I was.

6
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,440
Already you?

7
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:38,290
Yeah. I was on the left hand side and I was driving and I was like my husband and my friend.

8
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:47,510
And I got an email from the vice president on Tuesday.

9
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,650
Good afternoon. Everyone knows everyone today.

10
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,750
A lot of excitement going on right now. I may look around and say there's a little few more open spaces today.

11
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:10,350
That doesn't mean we had many people drop because we have many people at the vice president's remarks for climate change right now.

12
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,159
So I think about four or five of your classmates are over at Rackham right now.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,960
I don't think it's started quite yet. They're still undergoing the background checks and security clearance to get in, so that's very exciting.

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,460
How is everyone's first week to all your classes?

15
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,010
I see some happy and some, you know, anyone.

16
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,320
Like in despair. You need some help. We're here to help you guys.

17
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:47,219
Today's a fun day because we're going to spend some time, half the class watching a really neat documentary about epigenetics.

18
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:55,500
But it reminded me that of my son, who's a freshman in high school, came home after two days of school this week and Tuesday.

19
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,440
And I guess both days were really screen heavy. And then I felt really bad that I was showing this movie in class.

20
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
So I hope you guys don't feel like he does after watching videos in class.

21
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,370
I get to that in a few minutes, but I wanted to start a little bit by congratulating all of you guys for working with Yellow Digg.

22
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,130
How many of you guys have been able to access the platform and interact with the platform?

23
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,110
Is anybody still having read some of the stuff that you get stuck?

24
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,120
So I just have to link to that, which is actually are you?

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,040
I'm Katie the one. Yeah. Yeah. I think when she reached out it's very strange.

26
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,540
Yeah. The client support and like a link to reset every reset.

27
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,920
So I think I just that I am okay well if you have any trouble, let me know.

28
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,090
I know that you know it has that point scale.

29
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,079
If I observe that the points aren't obtainable or too much for the size of a class, I can adjust that down.

30
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:04,170
So don't worry too much about the points yet because I can fix that but do interact with the platform you guys have been doing a great job on,

31
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,829
so a few examples in a minute. So it sounds like everybody has been able to find it here under the assignments down at

32
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,850
Yellow Dog and then you have to log in and it's not necessarily your you must log in.

33
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,850
You can have a different password for that as well.

34
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,520
So here's one example. That.

35
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,590
Oh. These are old examples from from a few years ago.

36
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,210
I just wanted to show a few things that you can do within yellow Digg.

37
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,030
You can create polls. So this is one where there is a story about stress and the epigenome.

38
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,629
And then I created a poll about this too.

39
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:48,430
So it's one way to get your classmates to interact and then you can also post seminars.

40
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:55,650
If you guys have been able to find any epigenetics seminars that you haven't seen me disseminate, please post them on here.

41
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:03,190
This is an example of Cindy from years ago. She found this seminar on February 22nd, which is my birthday.

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,040
I think it's a Wednesday this year and and was able to disseminate it through yellow magic.

43
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:16,130
So I have I have a few seminars to disseminate it today. But yes, you can make your own.

44
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:25,330
These are the categories for this event. But yeah, if there is, we could create you can create maybe create a, I'll create a category for seminars.

45
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,450
I don't think there is one. Yes. So the other four stations actually.

46
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,330
Yeah. It goes from week to week, it goes from like I think 1 p.m.

47
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,570
So I think every set just now at 1 p.m. for next week. So last week is over.

48
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,210
But I understand it's a first week, so don't stress out. I'm able to to look at the data and adjust it as needed.

49
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,220
I know that we're all getting back into the swing of things. Yes.

50
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:59,290
I'm sorry if you already addresses the last class, but if you go over, we get extra points one week or fall short the other week.

51
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,489
You just get the maximum every week or you just get the maximum every week.

52
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,790
But I'm able to see the overage. Okay. So that helps me in adjusting it.

53
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,430
So this is just one part of your participation grade.

54
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:19,870
So I realize that the points can be really exciting for really motivating for some and for others.

55
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,770
And it's it's a relatively new tool to the School of Public Health.

56
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,540
So they've asked that I keep the point system on, so we evaluate it.

57
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,330
There's a way for me to directly and put that into your grade, but I prefer to manually do it so I can see.

58
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,370
Yes. Where do you personally get your epigenetics readings?

59
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,210
Because they're so personal. So that's great.

60
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:54,910
And you know, I really like this one resource that's on the canvas home page called EPI Jeannie that is unique in a bottle.

61
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:05,380
And they are pulling in the new research on epigenetics, but they write a news piece about it and it's really witty.

62
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:16,329
It's this run by this graduate student at UC Davis named Ben Laufer and one of the great recent graduates of my lab here,

63
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:23,170
Kari Nya, went there for her postdoc. So I got to know it a little bit, even more about how much use the time, even visa we need about this.

64
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:31,740
I like epi, Jeanie. I also you just you begin to look at the things that you get normally in your emails

65
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,270
from a different lens and you can begin to see what you guys have been doing.

66
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,399
I've seen you guys put that up on on Yellow Day this week.

67
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,760
So I don't have any any other big suggestions from that.

68
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,860
But you can also go to like Google News and type in epigenetics or DNA methylation.

69
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,870
Hi, RNA, I like to do there's not a lot umpire they see what comes up there.

70
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:02,710
I'm like Twitter doesn't Instagram if do like epigenetics decisions like this is a good one.

71
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,240
Yeah that's great. I think that idea. That's how I found out about one of our postdocs papers.

72
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,840
A break with AMD's Twitter feed.

73
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,120
So here's a couple examples that you guys have put up.

74
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,930
So, gosh, you probably can't read that. I can hardly read on the screen.

75
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,459
So, Jennifer, are you here today? So, Jennifer, put this up earlier last week of a news article from Michigan Medicine.

76
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:39,450
Do you want to tell us a little bit about it? Like why this motivated you to put on Yellow Digg, which follows this story.

77
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:51,380
This was this really neat prospective cohort study and that they found the grip strength one which I hadn't I hadn't seen about seen this.

78
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,020
I think I wrote that I was aware of this research, but I hadn't seen the publication.

79
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,860
So that was great that you put that up there because I was able to then read the article.

80
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,879
And then Molly was Molly. Molly then commented on this about the health, retirement,

81
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,900
health and retirement study that you're working on and all the great opportunities for epigenetics within this study as well.

82
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,950
So that was great to see some interaction across people in the class.

83
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,220
And then even before it was announced that Kamala Harris was going to be here today,

84
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:33,299
Emma was Emma posted about climate change and the epigenome, which is a is a relatively new emerging field.

85
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,300
There's a great lab at the University of South Florida that looks at epigenetics and all sorts

86
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,870
of marine types of things like coral and fish and correlates that to changes in the climate.

87
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:53,489
So in this one, you are pointing to the work at Columbia, where Andrea borelli, who's pictured here,

88
00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:00,149
is the chair of Environmental Sciences there, and we collaborate together on epigenetics.

89
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,790
We're about to have a commentary come out in nature on precision, environmental health and epigenetics.

90
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:16,260
So then when I saw this, I clicked to this link to this now almost four years old article that Rachel Morgan

91
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,220
wrote in her first year at the end of her first year of her doctoral program.

92
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,360
And Rachel is going to defend her thesis in May.

93
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,660
So it's coming full circle that Rachel wrote a nice piece for the Public Health School Public Health blog,

94
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:36,060
The Pursuit on Climate Change and Epigenetics. So this was a great reminder for me to link back to that.

95
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,610
And there were so many other good examples like Jen this morning post about Michael Skinner and transgenerational work.

96
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,820
We're going to have some slides about him in one of these lectures coming up.

97
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,900
Michael Skinner is going to be in the movie today, too. He will be the one in the river with the fly fishing rod.

98
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,010
They'll be easy to spot him. Anyone else want to bring up anything that they posted on Yellow Dick this week?

99
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:11,260
So one of the things that you'll be seeing coming up is the four or five people who are not here today for class.

100
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:16,000
They are going to watch the movie, the documentary on their own, and then they're going to post a yellow dick,

101
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,800
a discussion thread on some of the questions that we'll discuss during the second hour today.

102
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,770
So please interact with that and help them understand some of the things that we're going to discuss in an hour or so.

103
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,370
All right. So remember,

104
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:38,100
one of the other assignments that we'll do throughout this semester is to attend one epigenetic seminar and write a one page report on that.

105
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,750
And there are two opportunities that I'm here to bring you today.

106
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:50,430
Hopefully, they'll be four in the series. So this is a reoccurring series that the Rogel Cancer Center has started.

107
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,720
It's about two years old now. It started in January of 21.

108
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,409
They formed an epigenetics working group and they used to have the seminars at noon,

109
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:07,140
but now they're at 9 a.m. on Friday, but they're still virtual and there isn't one tomorrow.

110
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:16,560
But Claudia La Set, who's the director of the Happy Genomics Core here at the University of Michigan, will be presenting in the February one.

111
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,360
And she has been here since the launch of the score, which happened in 2015.

112
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:30,509
And one of the coolest slides that she has shows all the different species that she's worked with all the way from humans to mice,

113
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,530
which you would expect to bottlenose dolphins and hyenas.

114
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:42,140
So that's that's a fun talk that she'll give. And then at the end of the semester, which is too late for you guys to get credit, Tingting will come.

115
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:49,380
She is one of the scientists who works on the computational methods that we need for for genomics.

116
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:57,450
So hopefully they'll fill in March, which and April, which both come before the deadline for the seminar review.

117
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:06,690
And then there's one other opportunity coming up on February 8th from the D.C. Department of Cell and Developmental Biology.

118
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,600
They're having a seminar on metazoan epigenetic landscapes as well.

119
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,069
So I don't know anything about this topic and I think I have a conflict so I'm not able to attend.

120
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,770
So any of you all who attend this, I'll probably ask after February 8th, the venue in Lansing, and give us a short synopsis.

121
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,110
Did anyone else find any other example of upcoming seminars?

122
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,850
If you find them, just send them to me and I can put them in a slide at the beginning of class or a post on yellow Digg and I'll find that.

123
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,260
So today we are going to watch the PBS documentary Ghosts in Our Genes.

124
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,490
But I wanted to point out that on the Nova website,

125
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:56,360
there's a whole lot of companion material that goes with this, including Jean-Pierre Pierre Isa, who you'll see.

126
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,960
He's a clinician who's talking about epigenetic therapy.

127
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,700
Randy Turtle He is the person that I did my doctoral research with.

128
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:13,400
He is featured in the film. And if you pay close attention, when Randi's on with the Agouti Mice, you might see my hand.

129
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,960
Then A Tale of Two Mice. This is an audio slideshow that features me.

130
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,060
This was very exciting because I didn't make it into the actual documentary.

131
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,600
They did this documentary.

132
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:37,340
This was actually filmed with Neil deGrasse Tyson, and they made it into this five minute audio slideshow where it's me and my dog, Duke.

133
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,680
Duke is no longer with us at the top of Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina.

134
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:52,549
But this was when I was interviewing 15 years ago, almost to the day, the dean of the School of Public Health at that time was Ken Werner,

135
00:14:52,550 --> 00:15:01,250
and he's an economist who works on the tobacco policy, and he did not know what the word genetic meant.

136
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,380
And he was like, I know they want to hire this person, but I don't know what she does.

137
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:11,600
So somebody forwarded him this five minute video and he immediately understood and he sent me a note.

138
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:19,340
And Ken and I had the opportunity to be together at a conference this past summer in Boulder, and he recounted that to me.

139
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,290
So I'm telling you all this because you never know what what thing you do in your

140
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,629
pursuit of your public health degree that is going to help you in the next step.

141
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,390
And I had no idea that this would help me get my job.

142
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,210
So if you find this NOVA content interesting, I encourage you to go to the website and look for more.

143
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,130
All right. So before we launched the video, just a couple of things to keep in mind.

144
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,729
I call these practical in importance and challenges in the field of epigenetics.

145
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,850
And so I think you're probably figuring this out on your own.

146
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,940
Lots of things affect our epigenome, and this makes studying it a bit challenging, not impossible.

147
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,020
So nutrition. Chemicals. Physical. Social factors.

148
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,190
There are particularly vulnerable time periods,

149
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:15,680
particularly very early pregnancy in humans and also in the animal models that we might want to model this.

150
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:22,800
So a lot of traditional reproductive and developmental toxicology starts the exposure at gestational day eight,

151
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,070
which is sort of halfway a third of the way through a mouse pregnancy.

152
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:36,510
But that's after all, the epigenome has been reprogramed. So that's not an informative study design for epigenetics.

153
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,610
We have this teensy complication. We'll talk a little bit about more next week.

154
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,670
That's unlike our genome, which is static and doesn't change between cells.

155
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:56,340
Unless you get a mutation, a spontaneous mutation, the epigenome is different by tissue and within tissues.

156
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,130
Even different cell types can have different epigenome.

157
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:09,030
So so that makes using like blood or saliva, which are easily obtainable in humans, really difficult to study a disease like Alzheimer's in the brain.

158
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:20,209
And then finally, not finally middle. There are these like nontraditional dose response curves that we hear about in toxicology and nutrition.

159
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:28,310
Like we like to think like in toxicology more or something is worse, is bad or in nutrition, more of a good nutrient is is better.

160
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:35,780
Right. You know, but that's not necessarily true. There's these sort of different types of j-shaped or inverted U-shaped dose response curves.

161
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,249
And one of the things that the epigenome allows us to do is evaluate changes that go up and go down and

162
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:50,060
put a little bit of a mechanistic eye on what might be behind these nontraditional dose response curves.

163
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:58,600
And then just because there's an epigenetic change doesn't necessarily mean that there is an adverse effect.

164
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,140
There could actually be a positive and adaptive effect.

165
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,790
But more likely, there's probably like no or neutral effect.

166
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:15,520
We have like vast amounts of of of methylated cytosine in our genome, but not all of them are regulatory.

167
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:21,070
So keep that in mind. Just because there's a change in the epigenome doesn't actually mean it's an adverse effect.

168
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:27,220
In fact, when I was at a michigan city meeting probably about 12 years ago,

169
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,930
it was up in Lansing and all the Dow Chemical people were there and they were really

170
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,520
concerned about bisphenol A because they use bisphenol A and so many of their products.

171
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,490
And one of the things they got up and didn't I don't think they knew I was in the audience because I had just moved here.

172
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:54,249
So maybe it was more like 13 or 14 years ago. They showed my study in which phyto phytoestrogens or methyl donors reversed the effects of bisphenol A.

173
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:02,620
They showed that in their slides as a rationale for why we wouldn't want to regulate bisphenol A, because it's not permanent change.

174
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:09,060
It can change with a dietary intervention. And that leads into the second.

175
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,760
This last part I want you to think about when you're watching a particular story arcs in

176
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:23,370
this documentary is that the advances in epigenetic therapy you'll see here in there,

177
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:29,370
John, Pierre, Isa, we'll talk about some other cancer, but they have come a long way in the past 12 years since this was filmed.

178
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:36,810
And now we may be able to use epigenetic intervention pharmacologically to reverse negative profiles,

179
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,020
but there is also this potential to use other things like nutrition or stress reduction.

180
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:49,920
Some people think about mindful meditation also being able to have an effect on our epigenome.

181
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,510
Right. And so these are the questions we'll get at the end.

182
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:04,230
Now, if the audio visual, for instance, works, when you're going to watch the video, any questions before we start?

183
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:23,020
We had a volume was a little bit loud, right, due to the captions.

184
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:33,130
Do you know where I would look on YouTube for the Cox video?

185
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:48,020
She realized I was sorry about that, but no one on YouTube might have.

186
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:19,600
He. Note to Loughner's family in the early 1990 was the biggest project ever undertaken in biology captivated the world.

187
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:26,200
The human genome function will be seen as the outstanding achievement in the history of mankind.

188
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:33,310
Lights off from the endeavor would reveal the chemical structure of each gene within our cells.

189
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:42,230
The blueprint for life itself is not going to save lives.

190
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:57,040
But I'm sure that once we have in front of us and all the letters and just read down the pages, we would understand how the body was put together.

191
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:06,220
Once the code was deciphered, scientists hope to find the genetic cause and cure for every disease.

192
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:14,530
They estimated that the human genome in the Book of Life would contain around 100,000 genes.

193
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,050
And then when they started sequencing the 16 or 17 and slowly went down to

194
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:30,219
much smaller number of 30000 to 25000 as the mapping drew to an end appeared.

195
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,440
This symptoms at about the same number of genes as fish and mice.

196
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:44,020
In fact, we found that in the human genome, it's probably not as complex and doesn't have as many changes as plants.

197
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,010
If so, then animators really question what?

198
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,520
The genome has less genes in this species versus the species that were more complex potentially.

199
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,500
What's going on here? So few genes didn't appear enough to explain human complexity.

200
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:13,180
Even more startling, it turned out the same key genes that make a fruit fly, a worm or a mouse also make a human.

201
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,490
Chimpanzees share 98.9% of.

202
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,370
So what accounts for the vast differences between species?

203
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:35,630
Genes not being the whole story. Long before the genome was mapped.

204
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:43,640
Geneticists like Markus Emery had called hints of this possibility as they encountered baffling genetic conditions.

205
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:53,390
Angelman Syndrome, for instance, named after Peruvian pediatrician who described it.

206
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:01,700
He referred to them as happy puppet children because he described for some time the features of the name,

207
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,480
a rather jerky sort of movement when they're walking.

208
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:18,320
These children have no speech. They are speaking in terms of learning, but are uncharacteristically happy and smiling all the time.

209
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:36,440
The condition is caused by a genetic defect in a key sequence of DNA is deleted from chromosome 15 and then became apparent at the same time.

210
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:46,040
The same change, the same little deletion of chromosome 15 had been clearly associated with a quite different syndrome,

211
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,240
much milder in terms of intellectual impairment.

212
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:58,730
The crocodilians and these children are characterized by being very floppy in the mouth,

213
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:07,430
but once they started eating properly and so on, they had an insatiable appetite and would get very, very large.

214
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,840
Henry was stunned. Angelman Syndrome and broader Willi syndrome.

215
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:20,240
Two completely different diseases were caused by the same genetic abnormality.

216
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:30,750
So it would be bizarre situation and how could we propose that the same thing could cause

217
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:39,960
a different syndrome as we looked at the inheritance pattern for the two conditions.

218
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:48,629
He noticed something, even stranger. What really mattered was the origin of the chromosome.

219
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:57,750
15 had the deletion. If the deletion was on the chromosome 15 that the child had inherited from father and you had probably syndrome.

220
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:04,870
Whereas if the deletion was inherited from the mother, you had to be angels.

221
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:15,150
It was a complete surprise that the same missing strip of DNA, depending on his parental origin, could cause different diseases.

222
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,800
It was as if the genes knew where they came from.

223
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,530
You've got a developing fetus facing this condition.

224
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:35,730
How does the chromosome 15 know where it came from? There must be a time when you couldn't place all that chromosome.

225
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:41,970
Join in a generation to say hi.

226
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,200
I came from my father and we are functioning differently.

227
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,580
So that's the key. The sequence is the same.

228
00:26:51,270 --> 00:27:01,320
The different sets of genes were being silenced, depending on whether it came from the mother of the father or not.

229
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:08,040
It was the first human evidence that something other than genes passed between generations.

230
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,460
Something that could control genes directly. Switch them on or off.

231
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,980
But how exactly did these tags go about silencing the gene?

232
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,740
This on strain of Agouti Mice provides a visual clue despite the difference in color and size.

233
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:42,870
They're twins, genetically identical, and both therefore have a particular gene called agouti.

234
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,220
But in the yellow mouse it's switched on all the time.

235
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:58,020
As a consequence, it inappropriately blocks a receptor and what's called the satiation center of the brain, which tells mice and us when we're formed.

236
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,720
So the yellow animals literally eat themselves into obesity, diabetes and cancer.

237
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,180
So what switched the agouti gene off in the same mouse?

238
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:20,760
Exercise. Adkins now a chemical tag called a metal molecule composed of carbon and hydrogen.

239
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,579
It affixes near the agreed gene, shutting it down to the living creatures,

240
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:35,639
possessing millions of tags like these, some like methyl molecules attached to DNA directly from other types.

241
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:43,470
Grab the proteins called histones around which DNA wraps and tighten or loosen them to turn genes on or off.

242
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,269
And in simple terms, this contact can be thought of as hugging the DNA.

243
00:28:51,270 --> 00:29:00,330
And if these proteins hug the DNA very tightly and it is hidden from view for the cell and gene that is hidden cannot be utilized.

244
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:09,690
So these tags and others control gene expression through a vast network in the body called the epigenome.

245
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,990
That means genetics literally translates into just meaning above the genome.

246
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:24,900
So if you wouldn't think, for example, of the genome as being like a computer hardware or a computer,

247
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:32,370
the happy genome would be like the software that tells the computer when the work, how to work and how much.

248
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,720
Perhaps the best example of an epigenetic phenomenon,

249
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:46,140
you're actually looking at things and you see skin and eyes and hair and organs all have exactly the same DNA.

250
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,340
You can't tell my skin from my eyes.

251
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,510
You said you couldn't really imagine that these are the same tissues.

252
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:04,890
What distinguishes cells is not their genes, but how these genes are switched on or off by epigenetics.

253
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,400
And as development unfolds so intense, we just need to be strong.

254
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,660
And you can think of it as a light switch or switch on the gene.

255
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,730
The light is shining. The gene is often a cell.

256
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:26,840
Doing the science on a light switches off.

257
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:37,400
Everything was dark and green is off. And as the cells combine, the memory of it is and that us know our brains.

258
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,780
That's why these switches and the switches are incredibly stable.

259
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,030
But occasionally some epigenetic switches can be flipped.

260
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:02,290
To turn off the overactive. A good energy centers gave pregnant mothers foods rich environment like B12 or

261
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:07,300
folic acid from which they could make those methyl tags could silence genes.

262
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:21,190
The change was small. The effect huge fat yellow mothers gave birth to thin brown pups no longer prone to disease.

263
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:32,600
That's why, because it was an open box and told us that this cruelty statement developed to

264
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:41,529
the moment because life could not commons by literally tiny little changes in

265
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:48,780
the epigenome for agouti mice revealed the impact that the genetic changes ones

266
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,700
that occur without altering a single chemical letter in the including gene.

267
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,160
It was increasingly clear that genes needed instructions for what to do,

268
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:10,210
when and where and if the thousands of genes identified by the Human Genome Project symbolized the words in the Book of Life.

269
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,490
It was being epigenome that determined how that book got read.

270
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:23,629
We find that by understanding the genetic code and understand life disease and then color,

271
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,040
we find that in fact, the Human Genome Project was just the beginning.

272
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:36,079
What it did was, in all the consultants world can give us some form or understanding another level of biology,

273
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,630
which for the first time is up to the challenge of the biological complexity of life.

274
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:53,240
I think if the epigenome controls the expression of our genes, then you couldn't solve the mystery of identical twins.

275
00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:07,340
These rare individuals are living illustrations of the boundary point between nature and nurture, for since their DNA is 100% the same.

276
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,390
Any difference should reveal the influence of the outside world.

277
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,910
Most identical twins appear so similar they seem the product of genes alone.

278
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:35,150
Consider Hofmeyr and Carlos. Their every gesture seems the same to or take on a and until they show up in nearly the same red dress.

279
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,080
But neither had a clue what the other was going to wear.

280
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:49,890
They go through life in symmetry, and when I see my sister, I see myself.

281
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:55,340
If she looks good, I think I know that day, but she's not wearing makeup.

282
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:02,450
I say, My God, I look different. But five years ago.

283
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,499
Symmetry appeared to break on the mirror.

284
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,940
He was diagnosed with cancer and Clotilda was not.

285
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:21,200
I say I have been told that I am a high risk for that saw over me.

286
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:32,390
In fact, it's not unusual for one twin who had a dread disease while the other does not.

287
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:40,460
But how? How could two people so alike be so different?

288
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:54,590
Intrigued by the mystery Spanish geneticist Manolis Steller set out in 2005 to find the answer to that question.

289
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:03,379
One of the most of us pregnancies that is linked with Hansen's disease all have the same disease and genetics to last,

290
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,340
that there's a higher risk of developing the same disease. But he's not sure they're going to have it.

291
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:23,180
Because I was just under the stage, as Stella suspected, epigenetics was the rest to find out.

292
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,330
He and his team collected cells from 40 pairs of identical twins aged 3 to 74,

293
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:41,960
then began the meticulous process of dissolving the cells until all that was left with the wispy strands of DNA,

294
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,590
a master molecule that contains our genes.

295
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:56,060
Next, researchers amplified fragments of the DNA, revealing both the genes and their epigenetic tags.

296
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,360
Those that had been turned off appear as dark pink marks on the gel.

297
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,020
No notice what happens when these genes are cut out and overlapped.

298
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:20,720
The epigenetic effects stand out, especially when you contrast the genes of two sets of twins who differ in age.

299
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,080
Here on the left is the overlap DNA of six year old Javier and Carlos.

300
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,780
The yellow indicates where their genes are functioning identically.

301
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:43,670
On the right is the DNA of 66 year old Annamarie and Clotilde, in contrast to the younger twins.

302
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,570
Hardly any yellow shines through their genome.

303
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:58,970
Maybe the same. Their epigenome clearly is not identical genes acting on one twin be shut down in the other.

304
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:08,660
Thus, as the years passed, epigenetic changes accumulate in twins as in the rest of us.

305
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:16,160
One of the main findings of research is that it is not any kind of change in function of what we eat.

306
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:23,140
One would smoke, what would drink. And this is one of the key difference between these two things.

307
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:31,710
He didn't have cable, but why does the epigenome change when the genome does not change?

308
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:40,320
In Montreal, scientists Michael, me and Moshe Schiff believe the question contains its own answer.

309
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,590
We have this very, very static genome. Very hard to change.

310
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:54,000
It could be only change by really dramatic things like nuclear explosions or, you know, hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.

311
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,990
On the other hand, we have the dynamic environment that changes all the time.

312
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:06,900
And so what there is there is nothing difference between the highly dynamic world around us and the highly static genomes that we have.

313
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,320
Epigenome is an in-between creature built in a way to respond to changes around us.

314
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:25,580
SCHIFF And many believe that experience itself changes the epigenome as they reach this startling conclusion.

315
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:34,200
They studied two kinds of rats those born to nurturing mothers who licked and groomed them intensely after birth,

316
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:39,750
and those born to mothers who took a more paws off approach.

317
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,950
And what we are particularly interested in is the way those examples might respond to stressful events.

318
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,530
We found the offspring of low looking mothers during periods of stress show greater

319
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,790
increases in blood pressure and greater increases in stress hormone production.

320
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:01,530
They will scream. They will try to bite you just locking into their cage.

321
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:12,300
Those rats will respond differently. To rule out a genetic cause, high licking mothers were given the babies of low licking ones and vice versa.

322
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:20,640
Once again, the less nurturing pups grew up markedly different and not only on blood tests.

323
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:29,070
And so the conclusion from that is it's not the genes that the mother brings into the game.

324
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:37,380
It is the behavior of the mother that has an impact on the offspring years after the mother is already gone.

325
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:49,050
And basic question was, how does the Rads remember what kind of care it received from its mother so that it now has better or worse health conditions?

326
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,840
And one reason that there must be some marked in genes that marks that memory.

327
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,800
But could such a more enduring memory be found?

328
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,880
The researchers focused on a gene which lowers the levels of stress hormones in the blood.

329
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,060
It's active in a part of the rats brain called the hippocampus.

330
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,000
By extracting and analyzing the gene, they could compare how activity Barry McLean Low and highlight rats.

331
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:43,590
The difference was striking. Less nurtured rats had multiple epigenetic marks, silencing the gene, working 14, 16 and all the 17 symptoms of the gene.

332
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:53,790
As a result, with the gene, less active stress levels in neglected rats soared to the highs.

333
00:40:54,030 --> 00:41:02,549
In stark contrast, nurturing rats could better handle stress because they had nothing to demean the genes activity for five,

334
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:10,720
six, seven, nine, nothing here at all.

335
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:20,670
Just the maternal behavior essentially constant the genome of their babies.

336
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,780
We look at one gene, we know how genes were changed.

337
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:36,510
But for me, it was a fantastic thing that just a behavior of one subject can change the gene expression in a different subject.

338
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:44,040
The most surprising phase of the experiments, however, was yet to come.

339
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:51,700
We injected anxious rats with a drug known to remove epigenetic marks.

340
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,120
And as we just didn't strike, the gene turned on.

341
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,320
And when it turned on, the entire behavior of the rat changed.

342
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,090
It became less anxious also and responding to stress like it.

343
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:12,090
Normally we rabbits. And we looked at the way that was marked in rats.

344
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:22,590
And we saw that we actually change the epigenetic marker of that change because I think there was absolutely no changes.

345
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:32,160
Although the work has yet to be replicated, but it appears to be linked to personality traits, albeit in a rat.

346
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,180
To the embassy. And again.

347
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:47,570
Could this have implications for humans? We will not know until the completion of a ten year study now under way.

348
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,620
We will look at children from both nurturing and neglected backgrounds.

349
00:42:54,770 --> 00:43:01,790
So we bring analysis, meaning we have clues that our own upbringings produced the same effects.

350
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:13,790
If you grow up in a family that involves abuse, neglect, harsh system discipline,

351
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:21,980
then you are statistically more likely to develop depression, anxiety, drug abuse.

352
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:31,310
I don't think that surprises anyone. But what is interesting is that you are also more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and obesity.

353
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:39,140
And stress hormones actively promote the development of these individual diseases.

354
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:49,820
So one day we'll be able perhaps to chart the pathway from child abuse to changes in the way certain genes are.

355
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:56,420
Anything that we might see in the brain that unfortunately affect our health years later in life.

356
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,130
This work is controversial.

357
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:14,990
Still, many scientists now believe that epigenetic changes in gene expression may underlie human diseases and even disorders like M.D.s.

358
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:21,140
Cancer of the blood and bone marrow is not a diagnosis you would ever want to hear.

359
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:29,870
And then he started having money. And I.

360
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,540
Your blood work does not look very good at all.

361
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:40,920
And I had no idea leukemia and that there was not a cure for it.

362
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:54,870
And basically, I had six months to live with no viable treatment, and I got a clinical trial experimenting with epigenetic therapy.

363
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,730
It was the result of a radical new way of thinking about the causes of diseases like cancer.

364
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,310
If one has a genetic basis of cancer in mind and one is simply asking what causes genetic damage,

365
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:20,700
cigaret smoking and certain types of environmental exposures and radiation causes genetic damage.

366
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:30,780
Now, if I come in and say, well, wait a minute, epigenetic damage can also cause cancer, then you've got to ask, well, why does this come about?

367
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:40,710
The trouble begins believes is when our stem cells are the master cells that create and replace our tissues.

368
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:49,260
Overwork. Every time a stem cell has to reinvent engineering, it is aging a little more.

369
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,120
And because each time a stem cell divides, there is a finite chance of some sort of epigenetic manage.

370
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:03,630
What we find is that in all of there's been an accumulation of these epigenetic events that is easily measurable.

371
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,820
So where does the cancer come from?

372
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:22,710
Well, if you count as how many times it has divided cancers, which computer science, the offspring, balloons, tissues as epigenetic errors pile up,

373
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,860
the switches that turn genes on and off can go awry, creating havoc within the cell,

374
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:38,640
going up to the levels in mice that are normally active and could not only become silenced.

375
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:45,540
Those are consumers of estrogens, not author genes called on the genes that stimulate the Muslim tumors,

376
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,090
and then the tags such as the methylation tags come off those genes and those genes become activated.

377
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,280
So both ways, I think, more than anything, is a way of getting at this disease.

378
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,610
Could this place tags be rearranged with.

379
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:11,850
In 2004, Sandra and other patients began taking a drug to remove methyl tags, silencing their tumor suppressor genes.

380
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,560
Your number one thing is, okay, is it going to work?

381
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:25,140
And when you know that before this there was nothing, then yeah, it might you being happy that there is a chance to go forward in your life.

382
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:37,370
So we started with chemotherapy. Ironically, the drug just suddenly was tried in conventional chemotherapy in the 1970s and deemed too toxic.

383
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,060
Today, Issa is giving his patients a dose 20 to 30 times lower.

384
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,540
The idea of epigenetic therapy is to stay away from kidding themselves.

385
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,630
Rather, what we are trying to do is diplomacy, trying to change the instructions of the cancer cells,

386
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,490
reminding the cell, Hey, you're a human cell machine behaving this way.

387
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,180
And we try to do that by reactivating genes.

388
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,490
And the results had been incredible.

389
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,330
And I didn't have really any horrible side effects.

390
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:24,430
I am in remission and going in plus direction is a whole lot better than the minus direction.

391
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,350
ROI has not been cured. He has been cancer free for two years and he is not alone.

392
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:43,100
Spectacular results. The complete disappearance of the disease can be seen in almost half of the patients who receive this drug.

393
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:52,460
And 20 years ago, we wouldn't have dreamed that a drug that affects DNA methylation could have such profound effects on patients.

394
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:01,080
As epigenetic therapy takes off some of the expectations for this new science.

395
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:11,770
Many believe that a multitude of complex diseases, from Alzheimer's to autism, may have epigenetic triggers.

396
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:24,130
Consider autism a mysterious disorder characterized by social withdrawal.

397
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:38,650
This is Bridget as she passes her day, running her fingers across her computer screen and in her own world.

398
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,940
She has spent the past 13 years drifting apart from her identical twin sister, Jenna.

399
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,510
As infants, they were very much alike.

400
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:55,480
Their physical similarities are obvious, and all their physical milestones happen at the same time.

401
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,970
And then their first birthday party, we had a big party in the house, lots of goings on people.

402
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,379
And I remember watching Bridget maneuver around the house as if there were nobody.

403
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:11,410
Then she was fixated on which of these would be quite something struck me.

404
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,150
And she was not in tune with some mysterious.

405
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,540
Richard was eventually diagnosed with severe autism.

406
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,380
As the girls developed, so did their differences.

407
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:33,559
Functioning today for Jen and Bridget. They're completely different.

408
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,680
Jenna, who is enthusiastic, productive.

409
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:45,840
You know, Jenna's going to college, talks about it all the time now, which is essentially nonverbal.

410
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:53,550
She doesn't have purposeful, conversational speech. So everything she does say is very memorized because she is taught over and over again.

411
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:01,979
Yes or no? You know what? She's she's.

412
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:08,010
Yes, yes, yes. Good. There's no prescription that you get when your child's diagnosed with autism

413
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,000
and new things come out of their reformed behaviors that are very critical,

414
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,250
that interfere with our ability to learn anything. So we don't know really what the prognosis is.

415
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,880
And for a long time, doctors couldn't really help.

416
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:40,590
Despite millions of dollars and years of searching, no single, definitive autism gene had been found more than a decade ago.

417
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:46,500
Scientists at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore turned their high power images on the problem.

418
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:55,470
They scanned the brains of both healthy and autistic children searching for a biological cause of the disorder.

419
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:03,900
The study was called led by Walter Kaufman's Autism.

420
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:10,200
For a long time, people questioned whether it was the real entity and cause.

421
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:21,300
The way to diagnose autism has been the theory of more and more maladies and those sometimes unethical for identifying the causes of reliable weight.

422
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,830
So by comparing the brain scans of identical twins discordant for autism,

423
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:41,280
Kaufman finally saw the definitive data he was searching for in the brain linked to learning memory and emotions called the hippocampus,

424
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:50,190
smaller in the twin with severe autism. But how could the same genes create different brain structures?

425
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,380
Kaufman asked. And Feinberg at Johns Hopkins University.

426
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:03,780
And suddenly we were able to form an epigenetic hypothesis and a hypothesis based on the same genome.

427
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:11,880
But none of them. Maybe the epigenetic change that's leading to a difference in your brain you don't see in the other twins.

428
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:20,130
Kaufman and Feinberg are now searching for methyl marks in the DNA of identical twins discordant for autism.

429
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:32,310
The work has just begun, but the hope is that by finding identical genes that differ in their expression, some causes of autism may emerge.

430
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:45,420
We know that environmental stimulation, sensory stimulation, how they tolerate stimulation, have an impact on brain development and brain function.

431
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:54,420
And this we know now is maybe, at least in part by the genetic mechanism, epigenetic changes.

432
00:53:54,690 --> 00:54:00,900
Generally, they sound at the cornerstone between our shell and other.

433
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:06,240
All of our genes. The development of the cells of our body and the environment that we live in.

434
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:18,390
So the environment. Mozart epigenome. But my to do more at the far speculative edge of this new science.

435
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:26,940
Some are seeing evidence of an astonishing possibility that genes may not be all that passes from generation to generation.

436
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:44,190
And the evidence comes from this Swedish village huddled on the Arctic Circle over Kalak stands out for one reason its archives.

437
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:52,350
Olav Becker, the Swedish public health expert, has been studying them for more than 20 years.

438
00:54:55,060 --> 00:55:04,240
What makes these records unique is their detail. They track births and deaths over centuries and harvests.

439
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:14,560
This is significant because in years past over killings, this location acted particularly vulnerable to crop failures and famines.

440
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:21,740
In the 19th century. This was a very isolated area.

441
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,150
They could not have have come outside as it was so poor and really had a hard time.

442
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:33,760
Well, there was a famine and they really had a good have a good time.

443
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:42,220
When the harvest for a good patron was studying the connection between poor nutrition and health.

444
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:55,060
When you stumbled on something curious, it appeared the famine might affect people almost a century later,

445
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:58,990
even if they had never experienced a famine themselves.

446
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:07,970
Yourself as and future generations might be linked in ways no one had imagined.

447
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:18,200
Wondering if epigenetics might explain the phenomenon, the ignorance in his research to geneticist Marcus Pembridge.

448
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:25,290
I'm in Tampa. Excited to get this completely out of the blue.

449
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:33,940
And for the first time it seemed that there was some data that you could then start to explore.

450
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:42,540
So that was the beginning of our collaboration. Over.

451
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:50,160
Kayleigh's offered Pembury a unique opportunity to see the events that happened in one generation could affect another decades later.

452
00:56:54,090 --> 00:57:02,490
On the first reporting that the food supply of the ancestors was affecting the longevity of the mortality rate of the grandchildren.

453
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,180
So I was very excited.

454
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:17,160
I responded immediately and we suspected the incidence of lung disease diabetes might show that the environment and epigenetics were involved.

455
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:25,139
So all are called the records for any deaths due to diabetes and looked back

456
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,770
to see if there was anything unusual about the diet of their grandparents.

457
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:42,749
Few months later, he married to say that indeed they had shown a strong association between the food supply

458
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:47,940
of the father's father and the chance of diabetes being mentioned on the death certificate.

459
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:54,540
The grandchild. In fact,

460
00:57:54,870 --> 00:58:04,470
a grandson was four times more likely to die from an illness related to diabetes if his grandfather hadn't plenty of food to eat in late childhood.

461
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,140
This was one of the first indications that an environmental exposure in America,

462
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,830
one that did not cause the genetic mutation, could directly affect his male offspring.

463
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:27,960
We did not think it was some new mechanism transmitting environmental exposure information from one generation to the next.

464
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:36,590
Because these ideas were so heretical hammering you, the results could be dismissed as nothing more than a curiosity.

465
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:48,950
To bolster the research needed to find out how a transgenerational effect impacted each sex and if it was linked to a specific period of development.

466
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:00,350
We wanted to tease out when you could trigger in your ancestor a transgenerational response.

467
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:09,470
So convener and went back to the data. The more they looked, the more patterns started to appear.

468
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,790
We weren't able to look at the food supply.

469
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,190
Every year in the grandfather and grandmother.

470
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,760
From the moment they were conceived right through to the age of 20,

471
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:30,650
we found that their only certain periods in the ancestors development when they can credit

472
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:37,400
this transgenerational response and what one might call sensitive periods of development.

473
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:47,280
They discovered that when a famine was able to trigger an effect was different for the grandmother and the grandfather.

474
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:57,180
The grandmother appeared susceptible while she herself was still in the womb, while the grandfather was infected in late childhood.

475
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:07,950
The timing of this incident period was telling us that it was tied in with the formation of the ends in this time.

476
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:19,830
This suggested what might be happening. Perhaps environmental information was being imprinted on the egg and sperm at the time of their formation.

477
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,780
At last, a sharper picture was beginning to emerge.

478
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:41,340
The next step was to compile their findings through a rough diagram and sent it to Pembrey and from this on his head.

479
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:45,990
He was too excited to wait for the thing to be gone. And probably it's been a long time.

480
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:57,360
In fact, I was recovering from having something done in my heart and he sent it saying, I hope this quickly because he was at a time.

481
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,859
When he looked at the diagram, he was immediately struck by seemingly bizarre connections between gender,

482
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,930
diet and health connections that were most pronounced two generations later.

483
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:18,930
Among men, for example, who experienced famine at around age ten,

484
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:24,930
had a paternal grandson who lived much longer than those whose grandfathers experienced plenty.

485
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:36,180
Yet women who experienced famine while in the womb. And the terrible granddaughters who died on average far earlier.

486
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:49,380
One sided. The food of those results were so beautiful and such a clear.

487
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:55,680
I knew them quite differently and we were dealing with a transgenerational response.

488
01:01:56,010 --> 01:02:00,389
It was so coherent. And that's important, as has the effect.

489
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:05,880
Was coherence in some way was tiny in women eggs and sperm on any form.

490
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:16,140
The diagram showed a significant link between generations, between the diet in one and the life expectancy of another.

491
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:31,070
When you have something important for the understanding of the city itself, for family, that this is something special.

492
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:36,240
This is going to become a famous story. I'm convinced that I get so excited to see it.

493
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:42,660
It's just amazing. Every time I look at it, I'm really excited.

494
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:53,560
It's fantastic. Much about these findings puzzles researchers and.

495
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:01,130
Why, for instance, does this affect only appear in the paternal line of inheritance?

496
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:12,560
And why should family both harmful and beneficial, depending on the sex and age of the grandparents who experiences it?

497
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:24,170
Nonetheless, it raises a tantalizing prospect that the impact of summer can be captured by the genes in the egg and sperm,

498
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:31,400
and that the memory of this event could be carried forward to affect grandchildren to generations later.

499
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:40,130
We are changing the view of what inheritance is.

500
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:48,950
You can't in life, in ordinary development, can separate out the gene from the environmental thing.

501
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:57,469
And this is heavily intertwined and deep roots work suggests that our grandparents experiences

502
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:08,590
affect our health is the effect and epigenetic with no DNA analyzed and written on this attributes.

503
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,830
But in Washington State,

504
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:25,430
Michael Skinner seems to have found compelling additional evidence by triggering a similar effect with commonly used pesticides.

505
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:33,590
Skinner wanted to see how these chemicals would affect pregnant rats and their offspring.

506
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,400
Sorry. It's true that they had lost a pregnant mother with these hellhounds.

507
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:48,210
And then we started seeing between six months to a year a whole host of other diseases that we didn't expect.

508
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:58,830
This ranged between tumors such as breast and prostate disease, kidney disease and human dysfunction.

509
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:07,120
He checked that there were no genetic mutations and then proceeded to bring the rats and

510
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:11,020
mice that was forced to go to the next generation in the same disease state occurred.

511
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:19,040
So after we did several repeats and got the third generation showing it, and then a fourth generation sat back and realized the phenomenon.

512
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:27,450
Three major diseases occurred in approximately 85% of all the animals in every single generation.

513
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:41,670
These discoveries were a revelation. We knew that if an individual was exposed to an environmental toxins, they can get the disease.

514
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:52,350
The new phenomenon is that the environmental toxin no longer affects just the individual exposed to two or three generations down on.

515
01:05:54,270 --> 01:06:00,590
I do know that epigenetics exists and I knew that it was a controlling factor for DNA activity where the genes are silenced or not.

516
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,930
To say that epigenetics could have a major role in disease development.

517
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:14,999
So I had no concerns about the fact that this could have such a huge impact, could explain a whole host of things we couldn't explain before.

518
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:28,260
It took a while to actually see the and no further work has revealed changed epigenetic marks in 25 segments of the affected rats DNA.

519
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:34,100
The implications, if they apply for hubris, are sobering.

520
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:41,969
What this means, then, is what's your grandmother was exposed to when she was pregnant,

521
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:46,920
which can cause a disease in you even though you had no exposure and you're going to pass on your great grandchild.

522
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:54,700
And if a pesticide can generate such effects, why not stress?

523
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:06,150
Smoking or drinking? Related to some, the epigenetic evidence is compelling enough already to warrant a public note of caution.

524
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:11,999
We've got to get people thinking more about what they do.

525
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,350
They have a responsibility for damaging the genome.

526
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:22,740
Then, you know, on their epigenome, they potentially can alter and particularly that of their children.

527
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:28,500
And that brings in responsibility, but it also brings in hope,

528
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:40,650
not necessarily just with you can alter this might our lifestyle choices resonate down the ages affecting people yet unborn?

529
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:45,840
Such ideas remain, to say the least, controversial.

530
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:56,370
But one thing many in the field can agree upon is the need to take a cue from the Human Genome Project and launch a similar effort,

531
01:07:56,790 --> 01:08:02,670
this time to decipher the epigenome mapping the human genome.

532
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,709
The most important thing we can do right now as a big project is science,

533
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:15,510
because it will tell us some very important things about why organisms function the way they did.

534
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:20,400
You know, why haven't they? Do we now know how many genes we have?

535
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,360
We really don't know how they are regulated inside the cells,

536
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:31,050
and mapping the epigenome might give us a much better understanding of this transparent process.

537
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:39,450
The hurdle is that unlike the genome, which is the same in every cell they have,

538
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:44,670
the genome varies from tissue to tissue between individuals and over time.

539
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:51,350
If you follow sequencing in the human genome, there's a difficulty.

540
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:55,710
You're talking about levels of complexity that will dwarf anything we knew about the human genome.

541
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:00,510
But it's crucial. It's essential. That's the way that the futures can unfold.

542
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:04,380
So in a sense, the Human Genome Project was just the beginning.

543
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:14,460
And the end may be the realization that the code of life is more complex and interactive than we ever imagined.

544
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,830
I thought of nothing else for these findings.

545
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:31,270
It is the first time one had a photograph of the earth, you know, this sort of thing sailing through the universe, you know.

546
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:37,740
It had a huge effect on the sort of save the planet type of thing.

547
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:45,660
And I'm sure that's part of why the future generations think in a planetary way, because they've actually seen that picture.

548
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:57,360
You know, and this might be the same if they get to a point where they realize that you live your life as a sort of guardian of your genome,

549
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:05,400
and you've got to be careful of it because it's not just you can't be selfish because you can't say,

550
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,990
Well, I'll smoke or I'll do whatever it is because I'm prepared to die out.

551
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:16,100
You're also looking after your children and grandchildren.

552
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:23,640
This is changing the way we think about inheritance forever.

553
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:38,340
Let's just take a quick break for everyone to wake up. Go to the rest of.

554
01:10:45,860 --> 01:11:02,950
So let's just find out how long it's up in your life.

555
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:09,490
I think it's time for me, for my own well-being.

556
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:14,100
I would like to see your backpack.

557
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:25,020
I'm waiting for the call. Trace three. You know, it's bad when it's translucent material is coming out.

558
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:38,200
Yeah, it's great. It's hard for him.

559
01:11:45,290 --> 01:12:07,330
Even. Before he made such an.

560
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:16,360
Oh, I don't know.

561
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:32,010
At least I don't think he actually called it quits or something.

562
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:40,150
I don't really think you should go to, like, some phone call and be like, all right.

563
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:48,490
Yeah, because I just.

564
01:12:48,510 --> 01:13:02,510
And I feel like it's like I just didn't think you'd ever know.

565
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:16,150
Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. The bedrooms and everything like that.

566
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:24,640
I really. Yeah, she's just.

567
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:29,589
She's now she's like. All right, so. So I misspoke.

568
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,309
I said that was filmed 12 years ago when I when it was more like 15 years ago.

569
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,280
I think it was like 27 when that was filmed.

570
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:45,320
So did anyone notice how many things they said, you know, needed to be replicated or was it studies will will tell.

571
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:54,159
So what were some of those things? You remember what at the very end really talking about the Human Genome Project, right.

572
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:58,390
So they said they said we need to do this, the epi genome project.

573
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:10,830
Float or a few others. You had a story arc. The truth is the twins.

574
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:18,030
Yeah, twins. Mr. Right can't. Oh, yeah. So and so one of the twins was the.

575
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:23,190
The autism must go to the storyline.

576
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:36,050
They had cancer. The cancer. What about those those rats in McGill in Canada?

577
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:43,280
Somebody wrote about this on Yellow Dog this this week to do with the high licking and grooming rats.

578
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:47,540
Did they say that that needed to be replicated the maternal care.

579
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,510
And of course, that big story arc in the middle. Right.

580
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,840
The over Catholics. Anybody been that far north of the Arctic Circle?

581
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,920
Beautiful. I want to go there. So the right.

582
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,730
The transgenerational. We.

583
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:23,510
These are just four examples of things that were talked about in the documentary where they mentioned that we need more we need more research.

584
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:26,749
Right. It's been 15 years. It's a long time.

585
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:32,960
Right. And if anybody you know, if we've come far on the epigenome project,

586
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:37,729
I was going to ask what this is, what it is like possible to do that nobody knows.

587
01:15:37,730 --> 01:15:45,340
And like if you have enough numbers of, you know, it's really not like we.

588
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,520
Yeah, that is the crux of the problem.

589
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,750
Right. So we did have an epi.

590
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,059
They do have in the U.S. based an internationally based epigenome roadmap.

591
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:03,620
They call this and it was in 2015 right about this time.

592
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:07,490
So seven years ago they published 111.

593
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:14,760
Different epigenome. So these in humans, these are different cell types.

594
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:21,150
Different cell types that had malignancies or normal different ages.

595
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,750
And they all got on the cover of Nature and the Nature published.

596
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,559
It was about 25 different papers, all coordinated.

597
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:39,090
So we've done some stuff gen. All right, so maybe one cell got DNA methylation measured and that another cell got a chromatin histone modification.

598
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:50,010
And even though that is huge, no, none of these 111 looked at any of the environmental aspects that we were thinking, beginning to think about today.

599
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:54,270
Nothing of the effects of nutrition, stress, toxicants.

600
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:58,830
And so we're severely lacking in sort of baseline maps.

601
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:07,480
For forever. For everything. And then remember, this is just one person at one point in time and that person's epigenome will change over time.

602
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:11,920
So think we've come closer to finding epigenetics.

603
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:20,740
So you saw in the brain scans, the hippocampus was smaller in the autistic kids and they hypothesized it was due to epigenetics.

604
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:27,250
I think we've come apart and think we've come with this autism epigenetics and 15 years.

605
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:38,940
Well, yes, there are some studies that have taken postmortem brain samples and found changes in the epigenome.

606
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:45,960
One of the things that we don't know with a study like that that's sort of cross-sectional at the end of life is whether

607
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:54,150
there was an environmental exposure that changed the epigenome or whether having the disease itself changed the epigenome.

608
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:59,570
So of course there are some longitudinal studies and Dr. Kelly Borkowski is involved

609
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:04,400
in many of these where they're prospectively looking at autistic children,

610
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:10,460
looking at finding then finding biomarkers in either their cord blood or placenta.

611
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:17,000
And so there have been actually a lot of good strides finding epigenetic associations in autistic children.

612
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:23,720
But at the same time, if you do these prospective studies, you're not you don't have access to that target tissue, the brain.

613
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:28,860
So everywhere we go there is like, yes, but. So keep that in mind.

614
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:38,959
The maternal care one is is actually really cool. There have been replications in a couple other species.

615
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:48,320
So. Sheena Anderson, who was an undergraduate here in Michigan in 2010, came to me and said, Well, I want to do that, replicate this in mice.

616
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:54,920
I want to replicate this. I'm going to Kenya and I'm going to look at that baboon population,

617
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:59,900
but I'm only able to access their stool, so I can't access their blood or their brain.

618
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:06,640
So can I look in a mouse model and see if the fecal DNA replicates the brain DNA?

619
01:19:06,650 --> 01:19:11,510
And so she did that. She found some associations and then she went and did some work in non-human primates.

620
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,750
So there's been some attempts to replicate this in non-human primates.

621
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:24,110
There has also been a really great collaboration between our group here at Michigan and Michigan State that replicated this in the hyena population.

622
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:32,930
And then there have been some other studies that have linked associations of child abuse to altered epigenetic.

623
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:37,880
But of course they're very small studies. So there has been some movement here.

624
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:44,410
And then transgenerational, as Jen pointed out in her yellow tick post today, is highly controversial.

625
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:50,540
It was a really big part of this documentary, but there's still a lot of skeptics out there.

626
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:57,710
Michael Skinner didn't say it or didn't appear in the documentary, but that whole rat study was an accident.

627
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:05,870
A post-doc named Andrea was using really high levels of those pesticides to derail the reproductive system on purpose.

628
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:09,470
They wanted to see what happened, and they were really high doses,

629
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:14,630
high doses that humans would never, ever encounter unless you went in and drank the pesticide.

630
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:19,370
And but then Andrea accidentally kept breeding the mice.

631
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,790
It was a complete accident. She wasn't supposed to.

632
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:29,470
And she had to go into his office one day and say, I accidentally did this, but I'm finding some really different results.

633
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,540
And so he said, What? And then they went back and repeated it and saw it again.

634
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:38,720
So that was a publication in 2005 and science that was a complete mistake.

635
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:46,220
And [INAUDIBLE] tell you that if you ever get to meet him in person and go out in the and fly fish, it's I got to go visit.

636
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:54,400
Michael Skinner It was a 28, 27, 28 and he took me across is just ten miles away.

637
01:20:54,410 --> 01:21:01,160
This is not anything to do with epigenetics, but ten miles away we went to the university, Idaho, Moscow, where those murders occurred.

638
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,880
And I've been thinking about that time a lot recently.

639
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:12,860
All right. So any other new arcs, storylines in this documentary that particularly caught your attention?

640
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:20,830
Amber. I remember learning about the Dutch winter hunger in nutrition class.

641
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:30,730
Yes. Jane, you're an undergrad. Is that in any way related to the trend generation study that they did in this play showed in this movie?

642
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,500
Yeah, that's a that's a great. You didn't take Edward Weber's class.

643
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,900
Eduardo first class? No, it was Olivier Anderson's.

644
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,610
Oh, Oliver. She was my first graduate student.

645
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:51,930
So that seminal study from the Dutch winter famine, which we'll talk about later in the class, too, in the winter of 1944 to 1945.

646
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:58,320
That study was published in 2008, I believe, or the follow up study.

647
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,630
So it was after this film was made.

648
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:09,530
It is similar to that over Kalex thing, but in that there's dealing with nutrition, but the time frame is much different.

649
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:17,730
So in over callous or going back to the 1840s and looking like 150 and 20 years later with a Dutch winter famine.

650
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:28,470
At that time, they had people who were conceived in 1944, 1945, and then 60 years later, they then took their DNA from their blood.

651
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,459
And so it's only one generation, but it is similar.

652
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:37,500
That is a nutritional deficiency of deprivation of nutrition.

653
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:45,300
Now, that was sort of a big focus of like the start of the developmental origins of disease society was of lack of nutrition.

654
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:54,000
But now everything is swung in the other direction to think about thinking about those feasts that they had in the 1800s when they had a good crop.

655
01:22:54,490 --> 01:23:02,220
It's a good question. I think later in this in the semester, I'm going to show one other shorter movie.

656
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:07,730
And I think that that that's when her feminist features in that one just something

657
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:12,170
that was funny is the way they were like physically cutting out that I yes.

658
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:18,179
I was laughing. Yeah it's so great. And just like in 15 years along we've come, we have a machine that can do that.

659
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:24,070
Like mediately now are upstairs. Are they using the thing to cut it?

660
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:30,650
Yes, I did that. Yeah. And it's highly toxic the way the reason that,

661
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:41,160
that those bands glow in the gel is because they want to be in bromide which is like an inner it can cause genetic neurological effects.

662
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:49,530
So we don't use that in our in the labs that are sustainable here in Michigan, which I think is almost now 100% of the labs don't use vitamin bromide.

663
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:52,900
We don't even have to use gels very much anymore. But yeah, but what.

664
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:57,860
But, but it makes for such great TV, right? Not only that, but showing the cutting out, you know.

665
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:07,349
But when Schiff and Meanie were showing the the the film of the gels, you know, they were pointing to the CPG sites.

666
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:13,020
Right. And they're like, there's a methylation in the ones that had anxiety,

667
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,520
but the ones that didn't black lacked methylation and it was just so visually stunning.

668
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:25,530
I love watching. I probably seen this now 25, 30 times and I just love watching it each time to get something a little bit different from there.

669
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:28,890
I saw a hand in the back to Yes. Yeah.

670
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:37,830
I'm so curious if they, like, found anything since then about the injection that they gave them mice to make their anxiety go away?

671
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:48,090
Yeah, that was really interesting to me. That is so that there's a lot of people who are who look at that, study it.

672
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:57,660
Of course, they never show all the details. They didn't inject they didn't inject the rats with the into their bloodstream.

673
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:02,400
They, like, put it directly into the brain, like through a surgery.

674
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:09,720
So it's like a sledgehammer with many things and science are at first, right.

675
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:16,220
And so there are other cities that are sort of trying to look at like a diet.

676
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:21,300
So a diet that's high in those things, will that subtly do it?

677
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:30,480
And with some showing effects and some not showing effects, I think what we really don't know, because we don't have our epigenome mapped to fruition,

678
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,750
is that some genes are going to be most vulnerable to epigenetic changes in development and then set.

679
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:42,750
And so trying to do anything postnatal early in adulthood to reverse that is going to need

680
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:48,630
something like a surgery into the brain and not just a dietary or a sort of blood injection.

681
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,590
So yeah, you can follow that.

682
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:57,540
I found myself taking I want to look up a lot of these things now that this seems like 15 years has been

683
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:03,780
a milestone to me in the and also I was going to text Randy later because I realize it's been 20 years.

684
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:08,999
23 was when he and Rob Waterland published the first Tahiti Mouse model study.

685
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,170
So I'll see if he wants to have sort of a two decade celebration of that seminal paper in the Journal.

686
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:23,010
Anything else? Yes. I guess like with the diet, like when they talked about like with the mice giving them like folic acid.

687
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,470
Was it like exclusively B vitamins or like what what did that diet look like?

688
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:34,159
Yeah, it was a it was a relatively high methyl donor diet of several different parts of the one carbon metabolism.

689
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:39,680
Part of it was folic acid betaine, vitamin B, vitamin B12 and choline.

690
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:46,250
So all together and I know that Rob Waterland, who was the there was only those two authors on that study.

691
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:54,830
And that was the study that got me into that into their lab. I know that they try have tried to sort of do one at a time with different effects.

692
01:26:54,920 --> 01:27:03,889
It's not always the same. And so there's been a lot of now epidemiological studies that have tried to sort of replicate that.

693
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:08,210
But, you know, measuring these things in humans is also a little difficult.

694
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:13,640
So there have been some studies that have replicated that mouse work, but others that haven't,

695
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:20,210
especially some work that John Meeker was involved in when he was in Boston looking at fertility.

696
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:25,910
There were people who were going for fertility treatments in Boston. They were able to show some effects of methyl donors.

697
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:34,529
But and that's a very specific population. So let me check time.

698
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:43,590
So we have about 23 minutes left, and I wanted you guys to have some time to break into small groups.

699
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:49,590
And we can do this one of two ways we can do it by where you're sitting geographically

700
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:53,940
in the room and break off into like sort of six natural geographic groups.

701
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:58,440
Or if you really have a preference for one topic over the other, you can switch.

702
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:06,690
But let me introduce the topics first. And the way we're getting to these topics is from reactions to the documentary that you just saw.

703
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:11,549
So they published a lot of these on their website just after it aired.

704
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:16,350
And so you have anonymous John Doe writing in from Fort Worth.

705
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:24,720
And he wrote, If my grandparents suffered through the Great Depression with some kind of epigenetic change, be present in me.

706
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,850
And so this is really talking about those multi and transgenerational effects

707
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:34,560
that we saw from over Calyx and also in the rat studies of Michael Skinner.

708
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:44,989
Then you also had Jane Doe, but you can probably figure out who it is because you might remember who Brigitte is.

709
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:48,560
So my niece, Brigitte, who is autistic, was featured in the episode.

710
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:55,490
Is there a possibility of one day injecting humans with something that could, in essence, turn off a misled gene,

711
01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:02,180
so to speak, if one exist and possibly offer a cure for autism, which in and of itself is a controversial topic?

712
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,220
Or other ailments? Or is a person's fate decided in the womb?

713
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:12,049
And so this is prompting you guys me to ask you guys to think about.

714
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:19,550
Well, you saw those epigenetic therapies that Jon Preso was using for those two patients at M.D. Anderson,

715
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:25,160
who both had very specific types of end stage cancer.

716
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:30,140
And it did extend their lives. But what about autism?

717
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:38,239
What about childhood obesity? We have shown their collaborations with Julie living in the med school as a pediatrician that we

718
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:45,080
can identify epigenetic biomarkers in the neonatal blood spot that predict an infant who might,

719
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:53,810
at five or six years of age, have childhood obesity. Would we want to intervene at all with epigenetic therapy in other things as well?

720
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:56,780
So that's groups. That's topic two of three.

721
01:29:57,080 --> 01:30:05,450
And then the last topic comes from someone from Little Rock, Arkansas, that said, before my wife and I had our child,

722
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:12,620
I read a few studies on epigenetics, concentrating us studies dealing with dietary methyl donors.

723
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:19,180
And so they both took supplements before trying to get pregnant. And we both continued to take them while pregnant.

724
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:23,540
And when my daughter was born, she came out with blond haired, blue eyes, nothing like ours.

725
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:30,650
All of her teachers have said that she learns extremely quickly and has compared to others and has a fantastic memory.

726
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:36,490
Could our consuming, simple nutrients have provided such physical and intellectual attributes?

727
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,190
So that's topic three.

728
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:52,760
Question Is it sort of where the genetic phenotype of the other parents, I imagine the blue eyes and blond hair, maybe it's not, but maybe not.

729
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:58,219
I don't know. Well, it is still possible to get blue eyes from to who are genetically.

730
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:01,360
It's possible to get blue eyes, some to people who are not.

731
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:06,410
Because you could be a brown eyed heterozygous. Yes.

732
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:14,240
But I think that's I guess maybe we're focusing on the other part of the mom and the dad taking methyl donors.

733
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:22,430
And and also, you know, methyl donors are available over the counter and drugstores.

734
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:27,830
You see them like Sam. He does acid or something, you know, so so this is like my point.

735
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,309
Nutritional little is good, right?

736
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:40,520
So would taking a lot of methyl donors be good for for an adult or is it good in the context of trying to get pregnant or or.

737
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:45,110
We don't know. All right. So everyone want to do it by geography.

738
01:31:46,190 --> 01:31:54,800
Okay. So we will go with this corner will be one and the back corner will be two.

739
01:31:55,790 --> 01:32:03,110
We'll do the middle at front as three, the middle back as four and then five and six.

740
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:10,580
So we'll just spend about 10 minutes at the six or seven, 8 minutes in small group.

741
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:15,740
You guys can discuss this and then all that together.

742
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:25,260
It's in the last few minutes just reporting back, any ideas together and introduce yourselves to each other because this is a really high risk

743
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:41,870
group of students and should be and I'm sure some people listening to that kind of thing.

744
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:48,050
I'm Charlie. I'm a second year choice. I was like, What is you?

745
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:58,940
Yeah. So maybe we should have other situations.

746
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:13,030
All right, well, what do you guys know? I'm ready to start to question a transgenerational effects question.

747
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:17,220
How important? It's funny.

748
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:32,239
That is interesting. So the first thing about this is that if it was in line with things,

749
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:37,190
I'm already kind of doing like eating healthy or like exercising or something that was

750
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:43,700
really beneficial for my descendants that I would be more inclined to think about.

751
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:52,000
I feel like there had to be a lot of person to make me do something really random every day.

752
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:54,740
It's hard to like, think so far.

753
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:07,670
So I took a medication that had side effects and I changed my epigenome to set the occurrence of serious risk of heart disease or depression.

754
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:23,120
We have to change course and go back to this before actually right after all that like a severe risk factor.

755
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:34,939
And so it started out was huge lifestyle choice over 2008, like risk factors like child abuse of children on the history,

756
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:39,560
like something like that because of wonder Microsoft being a bad decision.

757
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:50,860
Like I don't know the exact answer to this but pretty sure it's not like she was like I do like doesn't

758
01:34:50,870 --> 01:35:00,620
go for that much because I think when you have so much imprinting on your kitchen and education,

759
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:07,340
just some modifications kind of get wiped and like come back in a certain specific way.

760
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:20,059
I don't know the exact answer to. But instead of only like I don't know, they're obviously really like sometimes answering questions.

761
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:24,350
Slobodan Milosevic worried about the kids growing up and embryos like, no,

762
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:32,110
I think he's just like and I think like I think that that's like an interesting person.

763
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:36,660
I think about this title. I don't know where to go back on all the way through it.

764
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:45,050
It's still with this with regard to the other side of this conversation.

765
01:35:45,530 --> 01:36:04,790
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, you know, 20 years are already born, so like a small certain things in September 2008.

766
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:15,680
I think the second question, like how certain with anxiety just goes like this, but it does help.

767
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:39,019
Even if they didn't know something, she started keeping a close eye on them and they're not used to be the one thing that's going to get me easily.

768
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:42,130
Do it like this experience.

769
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:52,110
Yeah. I was like. You know, they were like those little bit like the physical legal issue here, like like your grandfather,

770
01:36:54,600 --> 01:37:17,670
because he too was like, I don't know, the Russians don't have hysteria, insurance or something.

771
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:23,729
That's right. Yeah, I know.

772
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:28,760
Like, if you think about epigenetic things. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

773
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:52,350
Think so. I just wonder issues in secret to whether they are doing as well as he says those are the chances.

774
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:55,950
And actually,

775
01:37:55,950 --> 01:38:14,970
first of all as well I think it's options is actually it's not great so I think to change is not to do as much either oneself and I'm that it's not

776
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:33,170
that I don't know so I think it's like yeah I think it's also kind of interesting how they've actually found and how sometimes that exposure and.

777
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,649
Oh yeah. Yeah.

778
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:41,250
That's like. That's right.

779
01:38:42,460 --> 01:39:02,340
Yeah. It just gets really interesting that, you know, I really, I think people are just so naturally to that kind of an argument.

780
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:22,940
I, I think people might be like, I just think they have to wrap up in this because on the other hand, I don't think you should.

781
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:29,130
I really like to see them in the future.

782
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:34,780
Dr. Oz, go ahead. Go ahead. You know, I think it's really like 88.

783
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:41,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

784
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:54,480
I wasn't sure if it wasn't long ago or that they were just like, man, I don't.

785
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:58,700
I don't know. I was like, crazy.

786
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:14,030
So you can only do so much to save lives.

787
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:25,770
So he really I googled it looks like some depends on how much interest is for like a large generation and some kind of destination.

788
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:31,650
And also people don't really know about you guys but I think the subject.

789
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:35,480
All right. I'll bring it back together because we only have 10 minutes left to go.

790
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:40,890
I hope you enjoyed getting to the first opportunity to get to know each other.

791
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:46,950
I try to squeeze them all on the same document here.

792
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:51,959
Are there is there anyone I didn't ask you to to nominate a captain to report back.

793
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:57,120
But is there anyone who would like to report back any of the things that you discussed in any of the three topics?

794
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:06,750
Come. Yes.

795
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:16,980
A little topic two. And we talked about the opportunities and challenges of technology and some challenges we thought.

796
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:26,270
She said there are some ethical reasons for the boundaries of the genetic therapy can.

797
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:32,850
And then another thing is that nothing that you want I mean,

798
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:41,009
it would be extremely difficult because it's kind of changing depending on the surroundings or even ancestors history.

799
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:44,129
So it can be difficult and changing, ever changing.

800
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:50,520
So even if someone finds a therapy that works for one generation or the next.

801
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:53,620
So. That was getting.

802
01:41:56,570 --> 01:42:00,170
I think those are those are just great examples. So ethics.

803
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:07,250
Scott Roberts teacher teaches a great class on genetic ethics and sometimes includes some epigenetics, ethics, ethics in there.

804
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:10,250
And I encourage you guys to bring this up throughout the class.

805
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:16,550
What of that? Then you tend not to steal transgenerational thunder.

806
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:23,750
What we don't know is if we have an epigenetic therapy in one generation, if it will pass down to another generation.

807
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:28,550
Now, that might not have been an issue for the end stage cancer examples that we saw today.

808
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:36,859
But that could be an example if we were to start using epigenetic therapy in younger diseases like childhood obesity or autism.

809
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:43,190
In fact, the NIH director's office about five years ago now had had a special call.

810
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:46,909
Most of the grants that we applied to are sort of like your own ideas in your head,

811
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:50,690
and you need to formulate them and convince a group of your peers to fund them.

812
01:42:50,690 --> 01:42:59,599
But sometimes NIH has very specific topics they wanted to fund, and five years ago they put a topic out on genetic or epigenetic therapy.

813
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:05,780
So expanding beyond CRISPR based therapy and in the RFA you had, if you responded,

814
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:14,270
you had to actually say that you would only alter somatic cells, somatic tissues, so not the germline, the egg and the sperm.

815
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:21,710
And that's really difficult because a lot of the ways that these are administered sort of could go to many different tissue types.

816
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:23,090
So that's great.

817
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:32,450
And then one of the other big things with epigenetic therapy that I think you guys hinted on is they they're currently like sledgehammers.

818
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:35,809
They're hitting the problem on the head. They're misleading.

819
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:42,020
In the case of what we heard about today, the entire epigenome, when you don't want the entire epigenome due methylated you of those tumor

820
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:45,889
suppressor genes methylated because we want those tumor suppressor genes on and

821
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:51,049
so these know though they did not talk about in this documentary these types

822
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:55,250
of genome wide epigenetic therapies often have a fair number of side effects.

823
01:43:55,490 --> 01:44:03,470
And so the whole field has tried to move towards locus specific epigenetic therapy, although it's a pretty slow moving field.

824
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:12,610
Any additional groups want to go and any other comments of the second group from epigenetic therapy right here?

825
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:20,620
Right. You got to say you guys talked a little bit about the ethics of it and then compared it to.

826
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:25,950
It's a little bit like prenatal syndromes.

827
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:32,170
Yes. Yeah. Just the we do prenatal epigenetic screenings that we think about.

828
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:36,290
I see. I do, too.

829
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:39,870
Yeah. Because we could do that on our on the mice upstairs in seven.

830
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:47,460
We could, we could screen away all those yellow mice. And where did you.

831
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:51,870
Are you the same group. Were you were you did you have interest?

832
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:56,980
Okay. You guys want to go next? We're moving to the third group.

833
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:02,410
Topic three, five and six think last year. So some of the things that we were bringing up,

834
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:10,780
but you also add more because like most was you were thinking a little bit about how well educated the parents might

835
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:17,379
have been in terms of already knowing about epigenetics and already like trying to get these different things.

836
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:23,470
So maybe well-educated children is mostly related to the way that they were raising their kids.

837
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:33,040
And then we talked a little bit about how maybe there was a the grandparents might have also had some influence in that as well.

838
01:45:33,490 --> 01:45:43,490
And then we talked a little bit about how the the dose of the dose for animal studies is much more.

839
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:48,969
Is that right? And so when we're talking about it in the context of applying it to human models,

840
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:57,500
it might be even less applicable, perhaps translating the dose from animal models to humans.

841
01:45:57,550 --> 01:46:01,240
Really? Yeah, I thing.

842
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:07,570
This reminds me because you talked about, you know, maybe they're well educated or different.

843
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:11,410
We're not representative of the last line.

844
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:15,759
If I don't get back to my slides, the last slide we're going to talk about next week, we're going to talk about DNA methylation.

845
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:23,980
And at the end of the last part of that class, we're doing a journal club on a on a paper that comes out of the next cohort,

846
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:28,210
which is a cohort recruited at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.

847
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:34,330
And so you'll see there is a visit. This is about folic acid, so about potentially taking more.

848
01:46:34,510 --> 01:46:36,280
So when you read that note,

849
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:45,870
how many of the mothers in that population are taking the recommended amount of folic acid and maybe double the recommended amount of acid?

850
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:49,810
So we can talk about that a little bit more next week. Thank you.

851
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:55,400
Anything else from group? In the back.

852
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:05,380
Yes. Um, just in general, we kind of said that based on the mouse studies like this,

853
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:11,999
it could be possible that these attributes could be due to some kind of nutritional factor.

854
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:20,610
But we just said there isn't enough information to know for sure and there's not enough information of studies in humans either to know for sure.

855
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:27,150
In fact, those agouti mice are famous. They they've gone around the world, they like to get this job.

856
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:32,640
And we have an agouti gene. But remember at the beginning of the film, they were showing like, we have the same genes,

857
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:38,459
we have an agouti gene, but it doesn't work in the same way it does in that particular type of mouse.

858
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:45,330
And that mouse, they had a parasitic piece of DNA jump into their agouti gene, like one of those maize and blue jumping genes.

859
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:51,540
And that causes you to be on all the time if it's lacking methylation and open chromatin.

860
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:55,979
So we don't have that, fortunately yet. It has a bizarre agouti gene.

861
01:47:55,980 --> 01:48:01,860
So there's not a direct translate ability between what we see in those mice and what we see in humans.

862
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:10,590
So what we could say is that it's possible that the change in nutrition might change our our epigenome, but we don't know exactly where.

863
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,540
Great. Thank you, guys. And last but not least, multi and transgenerational groups.

864
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:22,860
Any comments about the Great Depression or other big events in our world?

865
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:35,430
One of the biggest things we talk about is probably just like the effects of standing on the generations and as far as like lifestyle recommendations.

866
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:39,720
I think just living a generally healthy life is the best shot that you have.

867
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:46,740
I think it's like trying to make an overcorrection in the other direction is probably unwise, especially for your future offspring.

868
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:57,330
But if this person is a man, which they are, I guess then they would probably have a better prognosis and a longer life.

869
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:01,680
According to the WikiLeaks research.

870
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:08,309
So I would say just in life, you know, I think that over Calico, the research is really hard to get your head around.

871
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:10,469
And I actually like heard two different things today.

872
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:18,780
So I need to go back because I once talked about it in a in a webinar that was recorded and this is probably about five, six years ago.

873
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:27,209
And Marcus Pembury wrote me and said, I didn't say it right because it's really in that's why I feel like he said the same thing two different

874
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:32,850
ways about if the father is going through famine in late childhood or if the father had a bountiful crop.

875
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:36,239
So I need to go back and look at that.

876
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:41,309
But yeah, it's, it's really hard to wrap your head around. And I ascribe to that too.

877
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:47,040
I call it like Goldilocks, like just right. You know, we don't want too much or too little of a good thing.

878
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:53,659
Any other things on the multi trans and racial. This will be our last opportunity to talk about any of these topics.

879
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:55,880
They will keep coming up throughout the course.
