1
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,250
Having power now is only going to. Minnesota.

2
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,530
It's going to. Last week's untraceable secret ballot.

3
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:08,080
And now in just the. Are you guys. My hope is that, you know.

4
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,100
The real thing that might be in your in your future life.

5
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,890
He gives us different assignments, but he did say that some of.

6
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:32,350
Are you guys? Cool.

7
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,569
Okay. So we will keep sailor.

8
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,240
I confirmed yesterday, I mean in person, and so come around to him.

9
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,940
So I figured what we could to look for is that I kind of have this.

10
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,280
It's like a lecture on, like, how to write a paper. And then I'll also share the bed, obviously.

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:05,490
But I think it's helpful to kind of go through this process and even if everybody has had a great experience or but before.

12
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,560
I think. It's like one of those things that.

13
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,300
If you have sort of a go to process or go to like strategy, you can always deviate from that.

14
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,930
Like if you're feeling some stuff. I feel like sometimes it's helpful to have this like.

15
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,610
Okay. You mean a primary task that I can do to make?

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:41,519
This paper's future work. So that's kind of the stuff is around that and also kind of geared toward, you know,

17
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,420
papers vary but really geared toward like empirical papers and that kind of thing.

18
00:02:50,790 --> 00:03:01,410
All right. Also, I wanted to make sure we you know, everybody did the CBM bio sketches for today.

19
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,450
So I will look at those and give you guys feedback.

20
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,800
And I tend to like you guys will see, but I tend to get in and do like a little like editing stuff too,

21
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,450
just cause I'm so used to as we all are like jumping words and oh, say it this way.

22
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,930
And like, grant writing is like, really, really good for making you just learn how to chop out extra words.

23
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,840
So sometimes that's. Yeah. So is probably going to do.

24
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,370
Oh, oh, sure, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That makes sense, actually.

25
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,820
You know, that's a good point. I should, you know. Ah, just email it to me.

26
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,080
Oh, totally fine. We're, we're a small groups so but yeah.

27
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:49,290
Yeah, that, that, that don't make sense. And I wanted to figure out when we were going to do for each of you guys both teaching,

28
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,939
teaching presentations and topic doesn't really matter quite yet,

29
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:07,920
but these are kind of the three dates that are like most available and flexible in terms of when people want to do presentations.

30
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,540
And I don't know how it aligns with other things that you guys have going.

31
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,310
But yeah. Yeah.

32
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,010
So like on the 28th, it's kind of a session like on so.

33
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,260
Okay. So the next time we meet next week, we'll do the conceptual models part.

34
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,640
So just sort of be musing on like maybe what you think of them as, you know, key variables in your space.

35
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,079
And then the following week, week five is sort of a follow up from that and that's a good time for presentations as well.

36
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,540
More flexible. And so I don't know if looking at those dates, if anybody.

37
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,030
Is inclined towards one or the other.

38
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:06,740
On the 12th, we do have the student panel who's coming that will also confirm and I said it would be in person, but I just think that's not fun.

39
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,980
I can bring some like snacks. And then on the fifth we talk about like research misconduct, conflict of interest and stuff.

40
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:23,680
So it's more info heavy. I don't know if anybody has a preference for.

41
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,210
Right. But I also.

42
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,100
Okay. Yeah. And we could do, um.

43
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:50,830
Yeah. What about others? I'm. On September 28 when played in, does that work for you to do?

44
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,270
I was going to say you could either do we could double up or we could just do one one per day.

45
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,800
Well, it's a little different. They confessed.

46
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,640
Okay. Wait, Amy. Sorry. Did you say the fifth?

47
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,030
Okay, I was thinking. Okay, well, why don't we if we can do each on a separate day.

48
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:23,990
That. That might be good. And then we just have a little more time to, like, get into everybody's idea.

49
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:32,810
I think that would be perfect. Okay, so what do we have? Well, quick over 28, Amy will go on the fifth and then Clark and go on.

50
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:43,040
Fabulous. Okay. Okay.

51
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:52,330
And we can, you know, check in on whatever we need to check in about that as we go forward and talk about all that next week.

52
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,910
Okay. So all right. So I'm going to talk about scientific writing.

53
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,450
And one thing that I think is, you know,

54
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:11,259
sometimes an adjustment for people is this idea of like scientific writing in a really like empirical journal,

55
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:17,620
formulaic way is this sort of very structured, non creative writing style.

56
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:25,690
That said, you can also still do all the good things like engage the reader and tell a story.

57
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,249
And, you know, I think the overarching piece here too is like,

58
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:37,990
know your audience and we'll talk about journal selections and sub genres of research and

59
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,960
interdisciplinary stuff because I think that all it really is important plays in with know your audience.

60
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,040
But I think this is also always really pretty keep in mind because I think it's for balancing like community,

61
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:59,500
communicating these very big complex ideas sometimes and nuanced like methodologies that get really targeting jargon quickly,

62
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,560
but then sort of reading back over it and look like, What the heck am I saying here?

63
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,610
It's like a good way to think about it. Like, is this clear?

64
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:19,180
You know, the other thing that always in every single like paper or certain dissertation or paper for review,

65
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,700
everything this idea about precision of language and we use,

66
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:32,290
you know, lots of overlapping terms, terms that mean generally the same thing is like a little bit different in this paper versus that paper.

67
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,800
And I think that one comment I often, often make is like use the same or pick a term and stick with it.

68
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,760
Like pick it, define it, defended and like stick with it and use it.

69
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,330
We'll talk more about this in conceptual models, but like if you have multiple,

70
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,760
which we usually do have like multiple variables, we're talking about an empirical paper,

71
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,859
just always present them in the same order, which is, I think actually really easy to not think about when you're putting it all in.

72
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,919
You're like, Oh, I got the methods about this. Oh, this is this questionnaire.

73
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,490
You know, you're kind of pulling it all together. And you'd often,

74
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,330
as we'll talk about if you're writing a results section and then you switch in your writing

75
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,860
method section and like that they want a novel person comes in like reads the paper.

76
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,080
They're like, wait, we're switching around. What's the, you know, like,

77
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:28,270
so that's just sort of one very basic thing to kind of remember to double check when your papers are at the point when they have

78
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:36,130
a method and results section in particular to just make sure it's all the same order and proposals for sure it would be okay.

79
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,640
And so I put up this video.

80
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,640
It's kind of a long video of a guy talking with could like, I don't know if people are interested in like listening to it in the background,

81
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,680
you know, but it's this kind of, I've seen it a few times, it's just sort of tends to pop up.

82
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,010
It's this guy from University of Chicago and he's just talking about talking to like a bunch of academics about like,

83
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,520
this is what you think writing is about. And, you know, you think you're writing to like show off your knowledge,

84
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,020
but actually you're writing like for your audience, which is sort of a basic point.

85
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:15,820
But he like illustrates it in a few interesting ways, but he's very like, I don't know, so like a high drama kind of presenter.

86
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,480
So this is pretty cool.

87
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:30,910
So thinking about this, like I often think about giving writing feedback to like in the mind of the reviewer or the consumer of the research, right?

88
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,490
So like often and you guys, I'm sure we've all done this right, we like look at paper like, what's the deal?

89
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,700
Okay, now or like, oh, this is actually really relevant.

90
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:47,080
And then you dove in and it is or you dove in and it's not and you sort of get irritated by wasting your time that you've like the the in.

91
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:57,610
But so like these are the people who are going to be like in your subfield, maybe using your measures that you've used, following up on your question.

92
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:06,730
And you guys are going to be these people too. So like appreciating kind of good, clear writing that, you know, the abstract kind of points you to.

93
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,570
This is what we actually did in the key findings in an accurate way.

94
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:20,740
Usually, often sometimes I guess abstracts are written last and I feel like that's kind of the best

95
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,940
because then you really come in with like this sort of top down perspective and say,

96
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,600
here's the deal with this paper. Like I thought about it, I chewed on these results and like written about them and really thought about them.

97
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,389
And like, here's the boiled down version. What can happen, as I'm sure we're all familiar with?

98
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,690
Like you put an abstract together, like for. Conference. And you wrote the abstract, and that kind of hangs out for a time.

99
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,190
And then you write the paper like that about a year later or something,

100
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,480
and then you go back to Africa and it's kind of thing, but there's sort of a mismatch.

101
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,080
And for that I think happens sometimes in papers that I've noticed as a reviewer, and I sense that now.

102
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,890
Okay, that's kind of that. So it's good to know that that we're we only get a few minutes maybe with this person.

103
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,319
So we want to make our readers job, sample our peer reviewers job sample.

104
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,840
Like I often talk about school feeding the reviewer and also the reader.

105
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,910
So like you want to just give in your message said, here's what I'm going to talk about,

106
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:32,170
reader, here's my variables, here's my method, you know, just really make it clear and simple.

107
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,249
And so how do we do that? Okay, so this is sort of one of these like this is again, like a classic empirical paper.

108
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,710
So we like theory papers. Most tend to be a little bit different. Some of the things cross over and some don't.

109
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:54,910
But this idea of, you know, writing an empirical findings paper and you'll see like this is most papers, right?

110
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:01,239
They have like 1 to 3 objectives or research questions and you always want to this comes into like journal selection.

111
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,520
You always want to know what's the word count that I'm aiming for because that really dictates of style.

112
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,480
And I always advocate if you can, it's much less painful to write a paper on to know the results.

113
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:22,360
And it doesn't mean you don't have a hypothesis of like going into the paper and you should have the research question and hypothesis,

114
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,310
but then get to the results so that, you know, like whether a paper is like a viable paper.

115
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,560
And then this idea of bringing your message that is sort of early on when your know your results.

116
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,280
And I think the other thing and probably have it on the next slide is that this framing the message,

117
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:50,109
that's a good time to reach out to your coauthors as well, even if they've sort of not been that involved in the actual analysis and stuff.

118
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,380
But that sort of saying, hey, guys, this is what we found.

119
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,689
You know, this is like my rough thoughts on it are you let me know.

120
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,879
Your thoughts is more like a phrase I use all the time because someone, you know,

121
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,260
depending on what your results are, what the nature of the study is, you know,

122
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,670
people feel either like they're the pieces of the study and they're like,

123
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,719
hopefully it's been cleared that you can write that paper and you're not like in the central aims of the study, that's sort of a separate issue.

124
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,110
But like even if your finding is like a little bit funky or something,

125
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,000
they didn't expect like that's a good time to sort of bring in the especially those senior coauthors who might,

126
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,130
you know, make trouble down the road if you don't do that kind of upfront.

127
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:43,360
So that's something to note. So I would say step one outline paper in collaboration with your advisor, share with the coauthors,

128
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,419
and then that idea of make sure everybody agrees on the main message and interpretation findings.

129
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:57,729
So like again, you're not going to have every nuance worked out, but I don't know if anybody has had this kind of experience.

130
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,760
But if you do, it can be a little sticky. And I certainly have had this kind of experience,

131
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:11,440
both as a student writer and then as a P.I. and it's just so much better when like

132
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,469
the key players kind of in communication with each other from the beginning,

133
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:22,120
which can be a little bit intimidating too. Yeah, to be totally honest, but that's an important thing to do.

134
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,970
And also working with your advisor to do that and then this is the other part about

135
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,570
that I think is really like a large part of being able to become a productive,

136
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,360
you know, paper producer.

137
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:47,140
And, you know, the number of papers that are considered like a high level of productivity varies across disciplines and subdisciplines,

138
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:55,840
but still that is like the currency of our realm. So we all want to be like reasonably rapid paper producers at some level.

139
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,100
So here this idea of like choosing the first journal to target,

140
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,940
it's so helpful and it like soothes the soul when you get a rejection from that first journal.

141
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:16,780
So like have some other ones teed up but you know you're going to go for and this is a good time to also talk to coauthors and like look at

142
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,870
I'm sure you guys have all heard the tip to like look at what references you're citing and if you're studying a lot from a given journal,

143
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,649
that's probably the general audience for this paper right now.

144
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,400
Well, the strength of the findings, that is really important.

145
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,040
And I think we all can imagine and know and probably have benefited from reading paper.

146
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,030
Words that are like not in the highest journal, but they like made a key point and they weren't like,

147
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,590
you know, the most influential paper of the year, but they were still really useful.

148
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,659
So I feel like a lot of, you know, there's always a match out there somewhere for a paper,

149
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,229
even if it was like, gosh, there weren't a ton of results here.

150
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,730
But like maybe that's also important to know, but it probably is going to go to a lower tier.

151
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:09,450
So just sort of becoming familiar with the journals that are in their will in your, you know, broad wheelhouse of research is important, I think.

152
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,310
And I don't know if people have ever gone to the same thing. Journal.

153
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:21,390
Okay, good. I don't know. 37 little guy.

154
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,450
So that is this helpful? I don't know.

155
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,920
Why is bio semantics? I don't know. Like words about.

156
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,870
I don't know. But it's kind of it's kind of a fun thing to play around with.

157
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,090
Sometimes you can be like, Okay, yeah, those are the journals I would have come up with.

158
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,320
But sometimes you can like plug in your title or your abstract or even some keywords,

159
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,270
and it will come up with, Hey, you should try to do these journals.

160
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,270
I'm going to mess with the lights a little bit like sweating.

161
00:17:51,270 --> 00:18:00,510
These are so hot that actually is okay, but it's not like it's a hot flash or it's like, I don't know, or my math.

162
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:09,030
So, you know, I said the same thing. It's kind of fun because it will like sometimes come up with a random journal and you're like, Oh, I don't know.

163
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,300
And you like, check out that journal. And it could be like a fit for your paper.

164
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,630
And it's definitely helpful, I think, to just kind of keep going back because you just find a few new things.

165
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,549
And I mean, there have been times in my career,

166
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:29,250
like many years of just like not being able to publish papers for various reasons, like writing grants or whatever.

167
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,690
And then you kind of come back and you're like, okay, I got to get some papers going here.

168
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,919
And that like sort of can help,

169
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,400
I think like spark a little bit of like creativity and like going outside of regular journals too that you go to I think can be good.

170
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,830
And the other thing, and I, I think that he said when talked about this too and definitely I forgot to say this,

171
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,880
but like whatever questions you guys have for Kate. Yeah, let's ask her.

172
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:00,930
But this is a good thing to look at this think check submit avoiding predatory journals because

173
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,790
they basically I just feel like scams are getting like better and better in these journals.

174
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:15,420
Like, it's really hard to tell, I think what journals are like legit journals and it's confusing because there's also open access.

175
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,870
Which you guys are probably you as you guys are all nodding.

176
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:31,280
So that is really, I think, more confusing because you have to pay to make your journal to make your paper open access in most cases.

177
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,919
And it's quite a lot of it's like thousands of dollars sometimes,

178
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:43,050
which when I found that out as a faculty member working with medical student medical colleagues for the first time, I was like, What?

179
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,100
That's so unfair, right? And it seems odd.

180
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:56,879
So something's odd to me. But those journals, there are a lot of very legit journals that have open access and they require you to pay,

181
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,470
which always seemed like a weird thing to me.

182
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:07,110
But then there's also all these kind of like sketchy journals, like predatory journals were like, come to us.

183
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,219
And it's just and I think there's a continuum.

184
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:18,270
I don't think it's there's I don't think there's necessarily a hard line below which these journals are like.

185
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,740
We're on things, but there probably are some that are right at the bottom.

186
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,990
But I think it's good to check it out, especially the thing about a new journal.

187
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,160
They go to the website, see if you recognize anybody's name on the editorial board.

188
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,960
Like there's lots of different ways to kind of cross check that stuff. But I think Jeff Smith is a good one.

189
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,919
And then the other journal selection stuff is more sort of more straightforward, like word count.

190
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,870
Do they take qualitative papers? That's always a good question or mixed methods papers.

191
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,459
And the other thing that I put in here, this is website is a lot of journals and I think these are pretty helpful.

192
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:03,070
And I think they have emerged because the journals really don't want to waste their time reviewing junky

193
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,920
papers that are not well recognized and are not responsive to the journals or responsive to the journals.

194
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:15,190
Focus So I think the number of journals kind of have these pretty helpful like big picture submission.

195
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,459
You know, best practices. So that's like a lot to do and think about.

196
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:29,230
But what's helpful, I think about investing a little time here is that, you know, keep a list of like my,

197
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,680
you know, top journal groups and just keep a Google doc or Google sheets or something like that.

198
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,570
And just when you're ready to submit papers, be like, oh, let me go back to my list.

199
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,020
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that journal. Oh, let's see if they're still doing. Oh, they switch their format now.

200
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:50,890
They don't have qualitative methods anymore, you know, so always good to sort of just collate a collection like that.

201
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,850
Um, I might have even said this before, but we have,

202
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,300
we have this paper that was under review for three years that my lab manager was leading, and we finally got,

203
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,110
like I, I actually swooped in and I was trying to be as like, stern and top down,

204
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,220
like know how to be, which is, as you guys probably can tell us, like not style.

205
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,679
But I was just like, listen, that, that, that, that they, we have thought, you know, I was like, this is the worst review process, blah, blah, blah.

206
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,979
I said all these things in a kind, you know, in a professional manner.

207
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:27,580
But like then she kind of got back as a review was still like major revisions, this and that.

208
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,129
And I like documented all the dates that had been reviewed and it had seven reviewers

209
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,950
and I was like pulled out all these facts and I still need to now write this final,

210
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,659
you know, but we have decided like, we're just going to pull the paper and go somewhere else because this is ridiculous.

211
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:46,840
And one person who is an editor on the paper,

212
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,010
like we used measures like the do like the the depression questionnaire that system

213
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,999
like 30,000 studies among some other ones that are also like pretty widely used.

214
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,479
And she was like, Oh, these are antiquated measures.

215
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,309
And I was like, Oh, okay. Like, sure, that's true on the one hand.

216
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,080
But like, is really this the USDA is like that doesn't seem like a good example.

217
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,140
There's so much that happens in this review process and I hope nobody ever has an experience like that.

218
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:26,530
But it's just also reminded me like, okay, also right now, in terms of finding reviewers, it's really, really,

219
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:35,829
really difficult because everybody's just saying no, which is good for that whole like the art of saying no and not taking on too much and all that.

220
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:42,729
And I have also started to say no to more reviews, but it does leave journals like in an alliance too,

221
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,670
so and it's like unpaid labor and all this stuff. So there's like a lot of stuff going on right now that they're not reviewing.

222
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:55,059
So extremism to like have a lot of backup options. Okay.

223
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,950
So switching a little into like the data presentation stuff, which was also one of those readings.

224
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,650
So we probably can anticipate that.

225
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:14,290
So like, you know, a few tables and figures not t usually, you know,

226
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:19,359
some complex analyzes require kind of like you present this table and then this one and then this one and then this

227
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,689
one and like some structural equation modeling and other things like have multiple figures that show multiple ways.

228
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:32,169
But I think from a cognitive processing perspective, like it's really hard sometimes,

229
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,120
especially if one is reading something that's not like directly related to their dissertation

230
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,630
or expertize to make it through a lot more than like five figures and four tables.

231
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:50,650
And this is a disciplinary thing that I would comment on because like in medical journals,

232
00:24:51,700 --> 00:25:02,470
compared to psychology journals as an example to journals they tend to publish and where the sample characteristics live is in different places.

233
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:09,220
And so like in psychology journals, for example, sample characteristics kind of come up in the methods.

234
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,080
You say like, Oh, the participants, this is who they were. This is their like gender, blah, blah, blah.

235
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:21,730
And then in medical journals, that's like other results. And so it kind of moves down to the results and I'm over generalizing,

236
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:29,290
but like that sort of a difference that when people start writing for different like broader disciplines, you can run into things like that.

237
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:35,829
So here and I feel like I'm mentioning this table one because I think it's becoming more dominant as things like that

238
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:43,240
happen in like the medical field tend to like start to shape other fields because it's so dominant in terms of research.

239
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,209
So that idea of table one, like what's your sample, what are your sample characteristics?

240
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,610
And you know, and you can split that up five characters of interest.

241
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,480
So like people have an intervention or you're comparing two groups,

242
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:06,850
you often see this table one like overall participants kind of broken out by groups and that can be helpful, but it feels very simple.

243
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:13,120
But there's always like more decision making and you'd think to create that sort of table one that people go, What's your scene?

244
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,480
And then just sort of clicking along the tables, two and three can be sort of the main findings.

245
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,730
Like one table for a research question is like a nice way to think about it if you can,

246
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:31,270
because that maps on to that idea of like following along your constructs and research questions and results and the like.

247
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,250
Okay, research. Question one. Here's our little tiny blurb of the text of what we found in the results and see table two.

248
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:49,630
Here's the next one. Also, some people like to see some audiences like to see by various associations the like correlations,

249
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:54,910
high squares, really kind of the simple what's the kind of raw association between your variables?

250
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,879
And then some people say like that, take that out because that becomes irrelevant once you like.

251
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,710
Add additional variables into. Modeling. So that's a disciplinary thing as well.

252
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,590
And this is just common practice. But I put that up there.

253
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:17,200
So I will say also like speaking of data visualization and kind of getting more having more fun with that,

254
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,110
people kind of can create some amazing figures and it takes a long time.

255
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:30,040
But like if you get the right finding and you're like, Ooh, I think this can be presented in this really cool way,

256
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:40,090
then it really is worth a thousand words, you know, because it really does give the take home message in a way that is super powerful.

257
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:48,009
But I think just even something as relatively simple as moderation, which we'll talk about next week, but, you know,

258
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,490
that idea of like this group looks like this and this group looks like this,

259
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:59,380
like that is such a clearer way to say it, a figure than to try to describe it in words.

260
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,469
Any does any of this kind of is this like consistent with how you guys approach things

261
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,060
and learn stuff and talk about stuff that I know I'm pretty quiet focused at the moment.

262
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,180
Yeah, I'm using it is positive and thinking about it.

263
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,680
They just got a review back from the review over asking us to put the stuff on Mars equals correct.

264
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:29,850
And that's just something that I don't know if that's a really.

265
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,600
You don't agree you. Oh yeah.

266
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:44,549
We'll talk about that too. That generally. But it's it's really interesting because I'm I'm wondering if it's like they don't

267
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,530
understand when it's packed into the figure like note or something at the bottom.

268
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,129
And so maybe one way to think about it in order to be responsive to the reviewer

269
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:03,270
is to like pull out a little bit of that note and put it in a more like

270
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:09,059
accurate but a little more on a more sort of more colloquial or sort of more

271
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,620
like summarizing the meaning or not the meaning because that's just better,

272
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,420
but like summarizing the findings in kind of more simple language,

273
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:25,919
I don't know if that's something that they're asking for, but I feel like sometimes that can be a stylistic thing.

274
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,760
And if people are really familiar, especially I think with like a complex method.

275
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,389
And it's like described in the statistical analysis section.

276
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:41,510
It has figures with it or, you know, big models and a bunch of numbers and the results.

277
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,080
Sometimes people just scan over that and like, well, okay, whatever.

278
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,350
But then they get to the discussion. They're like, Why do you want to know?

279
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,690
So I need like a little statement at the beginning of the results paragraph that's relevant to that figure.

280
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,220
So we found this here are the numbers and go see the figure.

281
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:04,180
So I don't know if that could be helpful, but that that's a way to like maybe split the difference between this,

282
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,639
like what we always think most people are like.

283
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,580
It's like a violation to put extra stuff in the results.

284
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:20,780
We want to have the theory to be clear, especially with quiet papers, but that's a great example, like a reviewer comment where you're like, Really?

285
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,080
That's not something and everything. Yeah.

286
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:33,260
And there's a lot of strategy, of course, of responding to reviewers and you know, but that could be helpful for the a pretty good point.

287
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:43,370
Are there other like results stuff? And you have a there is a paper in here that's about presenting qualitative results.

288
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,949
And I feel like that's always really hard because it's like, here's our results and our quotes,

289
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:52,370
but then like here's the discussion of them, but I'm kind of discussing them as, you know.

290
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,300
So I think that's a hard balance to. Cartagena.

291
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,620
10900.

292
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,270
Okay. Okay. Oh, here we go.

293
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:18,569
So in general, do not interpret the meaning of the results. This is something that people can have more or less familiarity with.

294
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,510
And it comes up. In different ways.

295
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,660
And so it's this idea of translating your results to a meaningful unit.

296
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:36,020
If we're living in the world of like questionnaires, especially questionnaires that are less well known than the CFD, for example,

297
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:44,420
which does have a clinical cutoff to it, but a questionnaire that's like, you know, self-esteem and a 1 to 5 point scale.

298
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:52,940
Like, what is the three like? I don't know that's in the middle, but like it doesn't translate to sort of a unit of self esteem in the real world.

299
00:31:53,810 --> 00:32:04,639
But if you're working with things like money, BMI, scores, grades, you know, Kilocalories is another one that I worked with where we're like,

300
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:12,620
oh, you actually the raw numbers, you know, this number is actually meaningful because it's a real unit in the real world.

301
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:22,459
And so if you translate like your regression results, like, you know, being a woman, you know,

302
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:33,530
contributing this much to eating a kilocalories of this amount, then it's more helpful for the, for the reader.

303
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:38,839
Oh, physical activity is another one. Physical activity expenditure that has real world units.

304
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,860
So I think again, it's sort of it's like depending on who you're collaborating with.

305
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:53,140
They also might like blood odds of something like the odds of, you know,

306
00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:00,069
having a clinical depression level score compared to that versus a continuous variable.

307
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:04,540
So I feel like people kind of in different disciplines do things different ways.

308
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,379
And then this is the other sort of strategy here.

309
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,060
If you're working with individuals who are really used to this, like, well, what's the level of change?

310
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,080
You know what, you know, if I'm predicting this, how many units does it change?

311
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,839
You can put it into standard deviation units, and that's sort of readily interpretable,

312
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,550
even if your raw scale is like one, two, five, who knows really what that is?

313
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:35,920
We're talking about running that. Oh, okay. Did he would he would he agree with that?

314
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:41,120
I think that's the winning. Yes.

315
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,890
Yes. And it's and it is interesting because it's very like [INAUDIBLE], you know, it's a super detailed kind of results stats question.

316
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,629
But it comes back to that interpretation of people when they're thinking about what's the message,

317
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,010
what's the overarching point and also effect size as one of the.

318
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,490
That we can cross across. The price papers and topics.

319
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,370
So I think it is and I've definitely again, as I've worked with people in different areas,

320
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:13,690
I feel like I've run into this a lot because just the conventions differ.

321
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:26,050
And so I think that sentence of like. You know, this regression analysis showed us that a change in a one unit change in.

322
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:36,750
You know, in my world, like a voracious appetite score resulted in or was associated with,

323
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:44,370
or at least, you know, an increase of 20 kilocalories consumed in this protocol.

324
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,340
So like that sentence, you could say in a result, it's interpretive,

325
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:56,219
but it's really like staying with the factual finding as opposed to going to like, Oh,

326
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,260
so now we might want to think about kids who have a voracious appetite as rated

327
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,250
by their mom at being increased risk to eat more in a free eating situation.

328
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,320
It's like that's a much more interpretive result, that discussion me. Then the first way.

329
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,690
So yeah, I do think I'm glad that that's I'm glad that's consistent with just talking about it.

330
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,579
So that's yeah, that comes up a lot I think actually, and it sort of seems simpler.

331
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,909
And then you're like in the middle of your paper and you're like, Wait, what, what?

332
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,690
How do I do this? Or That's all I am. All right.

333
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,890
So then so like step one was sort of figure out the journals of to read the results of three rate methods,

334
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:43,899
which I also I tend to think about the methods as like it's sort of it can be kind of a hassle if, you know, when you don't have all the information.

335
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,540
And this is a time where you can get delayed on a paper because you're like tracking down information from the people who collected the data.

336
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,969
If it's not well documented,

337
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:59,620
like we've probably all been in that situation either to like provide information to people or track it down and it comes up.

338
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,969
I feel in the methods a lot because you're having to sort of recreate like what exactly happened.

339
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:10,930
And hopefully there's great documentation, but there's not always great documentation for everything.

340
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,300
So all right. So the other thing is methods, maybe the longest section.

341
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,470
And so that can be really painful in terms of this sort short work type journals.

342
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,690
So study design this I feel like is becoming again,

343
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:34,690
I would say it's kind of from the medical field influencing like you'll often see in medical journals like that's a line in the abstract.

344
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:41,560
It's like a headings that says study design was like interventional observational study and like that's all it says.

345
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:50,050
And that used to not, I think really ever appear in sort of in my world in sort of psychology journals, but now it does.

346
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:57,070
So they just want to know like an experimental study is observational or correlational study wasn't an intervention.

347
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,600
So that's something you might look at the journals that you're submitting to and say, like,

348
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:10,509
do they require that since this idea of participants, again, we've all described participants, but just sort of things to think through.

349
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:16,810
And also every study's different. Some are new data collection, some are secondary data analysis.

350
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:27,760
And so, you know, you want to address who were they? How were they recruited, sometimes verbatim, like how the study was advertised to them.

351
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,930
So like we do, I do a fair bit of like eating and obesity behavior research.

352
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,419
And so we want to know, was this study advertised to, like,

353
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:45,729
parents of preschoolers as an obesity prevention study or was it a study about stress and eating, or was it a study about parenting?

354
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,710
Preschoolers like you can imagine people would sign up at different rates, maybe for those studies.

355
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:59,319
And then the other thing, again, that we've all lived with is like you have the people who you tried to recruit,

356
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:05,380
you have the people who actually participated. Sometimes you have the data, some data on people you're trying to recruit.

357
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,490
Sometimes you don't. But also you have missing data.

358
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,270
Probably not everybody filled out every single thing or completed every part of the interview or whatever.

359
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:23,349
And so you want to say like this study, think about the people who are reporting on in this study.

360
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:31,730
Did they differ from people who didn't provide data in this paper and sometimes missing data techniques that I'm sure we'll talk about,

361
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,110
which can be like super robust to missing data, which is awesome.

362
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:42,760
And then you don't necessarily have to say the line about like, you know, people with data on this measure tended to be,

363
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,920
you know, higher or lower income than people who didn't provide data on this measure.

364
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,760
So like this was fixed or generalizability of the sample.

365
00:38:53,630 --> 00:39:03,080
If you have to kick people out of the analysis. And the other thing here, this is, again, like it's been a very straight forward study and say,

366
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,430
okay, here, my predictors, my independent variables, here are my outcomes.

367
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:17,030
And then usually towards the end covariance, I feel like this is another big reviewer thing that varies.

368
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:23,120
And some people really like a lot of justifications for why you picked whatever covariance you did,

369
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:31,489
like maternal depression or income or gender or gender because I don't know, period, in my opinion.

370
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:41,360
But why would these particular variables that you chose in your study act as covariance and so like give me some justification for that.

371
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:50,090
So some people want a paragraph about why the covariates are important and they want it like at the last part of the introduction.

372
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,809
And because that's where they want to understand who the population is, some people,

373
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,860
reviewers and journals, and you can again like look at different journals, see how they do it.

374
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:08,540
Some people want it like kind of only in the measures section and be like there's been some association with this and maternal depression,

375
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:15,199
so we're going to cover it. We're going to put it in a CFD and like very pithy and short and that sort of varies.

376
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,700
And you can get a reviewer comment and you can get reverse reviewer preferences and review thing like put it here,

377
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,819
put it here, give me more information. Don't talk so much about it, cover it.

378
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:31,580
So like people can, there can be conflicting info but have a justification for why you would choose whatever covariates you choose.

379
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:39,500
And the justification has to be better than like, well, the model works better with those covariance and like you have to kind of have a real reason.

380
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,720
And the other thing, again, just good practice to include, you know, reliability of scales,

381
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:54,230
how things were scored like this is something that sometimes like I was just reviewing yesterday and abstracts,

382
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,660
you know, from somebody who knows to do this,

383
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:04,040
but they just sort of forgot to put in like the direction like a high score on this meant more of whatever the construct was.

384
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:10,880
We've gotten a lot of reviewer comments because we've modified scales.

385
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:19,339
So like in the eating behavior world, for whatever reason, there's a lot of like Dutch and English researchers who do all these studies.

386
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:27,620
And so they'll have an item on like an eating scale about like one was like, do you work by like a patisserie bakery or something?

387
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:34,189
And I'm like, this is not our population. And so we replaced it like with a Cinnabon because that was our population.

388
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:40,700
And so like we had to sort of talk about that one another. So once it was published that we just used our version.

389
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:46,460
But that's always an important point too. Okay.

390
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:56,810
So again, with methods straightforward, but there's still a lot going on in the methods in terms of statistical analysis plan.

391
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,990
Sure. Yeah. Good. You guys will probably be getting a sense, like, I am not a statistical experts.

392
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,359
Certainly. I used to be that when I was at a different university.

393
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,710
And then I came back here and I was like, Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, no. People are so good at this here.

394
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:27,050
This is like I'm hanging on. But this is another kind of in terms of the writing, the statistical analysis plans can usually come in the methods.

395
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,480
Sometimes I can float around. Sometimes it can be a different thing.

396
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:38,090
This is another piece where you'd want to say, you know, stick with your order of your questions and your variables.

397
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:47,180
And this is our plan for now, analyzing each one. These are kind of generic, like good practices, I would say.

398
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:56,749
One thing that I think is becoming much more common is just to state what stats for them you used and what your life version it was.

399
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,479
And I think again, that's like floated in from like the medical field a little bit more.

400
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,910
It was less common in prior years, I would say.

401
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,559
Okay, so that's a little more cut and dried in results.

402
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,430
Again, speaking about this idea of one paragraph for each objective you said it would address.

403
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,300
And so this was I was just talking to a postdoc about this.

404
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,320
Like, even if your paragraph is like this was not associated,

405
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:33,350
it's kind of helpful to put that in its own paragraph because that was like question two and like you have and that's results for question two,

406
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:41,059
but it still deserves its own thing. And it was like she wanted to, like, I totally get it, but she wanted to like tuck it away and say like,

407
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,629
oh, by the way, it wasn't associated, but like, let's move on.

408
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,860
And I was like, well, that, that's an actual results and you should just like state it as the result.

409
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:56,510
And then in the discussion you can kind of wrap it up in more context and harping on order.

410
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,600
And I think this is pretty I was kind of just saying that's very dry.

411
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,320
I think it's helpful as you guys get more practice and I think you'll probably do this in Dustin's class,

412
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:14,250
like that idea of like what of all the millions of statistics that we have done, do we report in the results section?

413
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:24,170
And, you know, usually you have you often have your in significant sometimes you have a synthesize that's good practice to put in effect size.

414
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:30,050
You'll have your, you know, degrees of freedom in, you know, lots of different things pop up in those tables, but it's not always the same.

415
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:36,560
And so working with people who have used those analysis and written them up and reviewing other papers from

416
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:47,270
the Journal can get you into a better space in terms of how much to put in the results to talk about results.

417
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:56,420
Okay. So let me talk about the intro a little bit, which I think this is often a really hard section to write because we're all like

418
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:01,640
emotionally invested and like passionate about our topic and we want to write,

419
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,500
you know, the paper on it. And this is a time, I think,

420
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,209
writing introduction where it's really important to like keep thinking about what's my end point of these

421
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:17,630
results and like how much of the big fields do I need to review to kind of get to this paper's place?

422
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:29,630
I think a lot of that will depend on the journal. This is kind of this idea of like if you have to write a tight short paper like 3000 words or less,

423
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:36,770
then you want to steer pretty tight into this type of format because there's just not that many words that you can use.

424
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,090
If you're going for a journal that's more like 6000 words, then you have a little more room to expand in the introduction and sort of say like,

425
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:53,690
this topic started with this, then it came over here and now this paper is sitting over here like you can have a broader funnel to kind of stir.

426
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:03,470
But if you really need to get, you know, like short speech to the point I make,

427
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,729
one of my pediatric colleagues rents a lot for that pediatrics journal, which is great.

428
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:15,080
And the introductions are like, you know, families, family media use with preschoolers has increased in recent decades.

429
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:22,520
This study examined blah, blah, blah. Like it's super short and really, really pithy, and I've grown to appreciate that.

430
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,709
But not all papers are considered normal.

431
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:30,980
But it's kind of a good challenge to say, like, how how much can I like boil down my key points in the intro,

432
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,470
because then you also have more room in the discussion. So this is this like why are we why do we care?

433
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:43,100
This is this paragraph two idea of like, what do we know really specifically about this?

434
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:48,620
Like, what are the studies that are closest to this one that I'm presenting and.

435
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:56,030
Like What have they told us so far? And then we'll talk about the review tables.

436
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,140
And this is like a case where I can talk about this as well. But getting to this is a lot.

437
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:08,180
And then here this paragraph three and these could be the same paragraph or they could kind of like look a little bit different.

438
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,260
But these are kind of the main things you want to do in the intro. Here's the studies that we know.

439
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:19,490
Here are the limitations. And so for some papers that are like really, really narrow focus and there's like a micro,

440
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:24,560
you know, addition to the literature they're going to be like in this paragraph two,

441
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,710
like these guys looked at like, you can't write eating behavior,

442
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:36,740
but like eating behavior and toddler and toddler eating in a sample of, you know, Dutch people who are all white.

443
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:40,430
These people looked at it like this very, very tight question.

444
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,210
And then you say, okay, here is how we are doing in our paper.

445
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,870
We're going to address those gaps and limitations. So I would say also, like you want to point out the gaps,

446
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:57,529
but you don't want to like really highlight the gaps that we're not going to address in this paper because then people will be like set up to be like,

447
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:04,040
Oh, this is great. You're going to get to all these gaps and then you don't like disappointed and you don't want to review.

448
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,699
You were to be disappointed. Okay.

449
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:15,109
And then here that final paragraph is like, okay, therefore we decided to do this and here what are the focuses?

450
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:19,700
If you can generate them, that's nice. And you don't always have hypotheses.

451
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:26,930
But I would say if you have one hypothesis, then for your end you don't for like other objectives.

452
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,799
Then you could say, you know, given the mixed literature in this area,

453
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,820
we didn't have a directional hypothesis for question two, but we did have a question.

454
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:41,700
Okay. So there's always a lot of revising an interest.

455
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:50,400
And then this is just a nice example. I don't know if people have done this before, this kind of like review, formal table creation.

456
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,129
One of those readings I think goes through it pretty nicely.

457
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:06,270
But this is also something that's just again, it's a little painful, but it's it's one of those like it's a good practice to do.

458
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:12,899
And especially if you're kind of delving into like a newer area or if you're like familiar with the area and you're like,

459
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,900
I really need like an update who's done stuff recently and I need to get it organized.

460
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,419
Has anybody in here used? There's a software called Competence.

461
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,160
Competence is web based, maybe. I think it's a program.

462
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:41,520
It seems really cool and I feel like it's the C, O, B, I, D, B and C, I like evidence, but like competence.

463
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,510
I think it's I in mentioning it, it's come up like, you know,

464
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:56,309
things like start to come up in like three different conversations are like this seems to be a thing, but it's, and it's, it's not free.

465
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,610
I think there are free versions that you can sign up for free trials of it.

466
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,120
But I was also going to maybe ask you what she thought of it.

467
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:11,760
But it's basically a way to do systematic reviews, which are this kind of highest level of like formal,

468
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:18,990
formal literature reviews and not every paper like and certainly not these empirical papers I'm talking about.

469
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,479
You know, you might want to find a systematic review in the area of the paper you're trying to write,

470
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,290
but to do a systematic review is a whole different thing.

471
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:34,290
And like this kind of literature review can be helpful for people when you're sort of setting up this call,

472
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,860
this PICO framework, it's like population function.

473
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:44,299
Look at the sacraments. But basically, like, who are your people?

474
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,710
And this is really helpful when you then go to that paragraph where you want to talk about the gaps and be like,

475
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,490
Oh my gosh, all the people were these Australian elementary schoolers.

476
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,639
I'm doing the same exact question with us.

477
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,660
Preschoolers like that. I'm filling the gap like, is that a meaningful gap?

478
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,080
That's another case you have to me. But this is a good way to review.

479
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,080
Like, okay, this is like all my closest studies.

480
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,130
What exactly did they find? And then the doctor keeps going back to the study.

481
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:18,709
So it's good practice. Okay, but yeah, the Providence.

482
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:24,750
Providence. It seems like user friendly and multiple people can work on it.

483
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:31,370
And so if you guys are in the position of doing systematic reviews and I feel like for dissertations it could be super helpful,

484
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,980
that might be something that that you explore a little bit.

485
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:47,510
And there is a post on nutrition. I was talking about this using this to use and I do use and because I sort of grew up using a note.

486
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,760
So yeah, I think Kate probably will talk about this.

487
00:51:51,790 --> 00:52:03,649
We should have her talking out too. But the big downside of a note is it's expensive and it also it like doesn't play well with others all the time.

488
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:11,870
I think. So. I don't know if you guys have all use in there, but I mean, if you're used to it and you do it and somebody can pay for it, that's great.

489
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:18,080
Because it does, I think, do the most stuff I know I do not use like the functionality and I know that I could.

490
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:24,980
But then there are a lot of these free ones like Zo Tarot I know is one that I think people like,

491
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,270
but Judith had to do so tarot is the headache for you.

492
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:40,250
It's really. Yeah, I think that's the thing because like when you're doing a note and your collaborators don't do a note that's brutal

493
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:47,150
and left an almost nothing on and that was I send my notes to somebody else and I like downloaded all the very.

494
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,400
Oh. And I'm trying to figure out.

495
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,580
But the thing I like about this is, you know, you get a little late.

496
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:03,230
The. It is nice.

497
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,780
Despite what you write. That's. Yes.

498
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:18,149
And if you do? Absolutely. I'm probably not a great example, but like I, I end up doing a new and note for like each paper because of the site.

499
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,049
Why you? Because it's just that it's easier and you know, that it's really duplicative.

500
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:29,820
And I'm like from like a primitive, like a data storage perspective and I don't put like PDFs and that which I know people do,

501
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:35,550
but like it's so redundant and it's not, doesn't feel very organized.

502
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,030
But I'm like, I just, I can't, it's been too long.

503
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:43,859
I can't like just start to do that now and I'm like, okay, this paper is kind of similar to this one.

504
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,890
So let me start with that a note and then see what else I need to put in.

505
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:52,110
That's kind of what I do. I do like I export and I save as a new paper.

506
00:53:53,130 --> 00:54:02,220
Um, but the other times that you will want to, you definitely want to use some reference manager for sure.

507
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:11,310
Don't let yourself be caught with that reference manager that works with your team and then also like grant proposals

508
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:18,390
because then you're talking about like 350 citations and like things moving and like you just want to be able to say hit,

509
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:29,010
run and do it. And I have worked with teams like even I would say in the last five years where people didn't use a reference manager like right.

510
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:33,390
And I h our one proposal and I was like, who are you people?

511
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:40,560
I was like stunned. And like my colleague who I gave great my research was like, this isn't a policy school.

512
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:48,560
I think it's just like a sort of a different thing. And her like lab manager was staying up till three in the morning, like putting in references.

513
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,760
Hey, oh, sorry. I'm like, Oh, I'm chatting ten, ten.

514
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:58,200
Oh, yeah. But you know what we're talking about references and reference managers.

515
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:06,299
So and so I'll, you'll appreciate this tape, but yeah, I was working with a team.

516
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,220
We were writing in our one proposal and like they didn't use a reference manager and the,

517
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:18,209
the like one poor person on the team was like staying up overnight to like put in these references.

518
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:26,250
And then, and I was like, and then I had all this guilt because it's, if you can't change anything since, you know, it was just so dysfunctional.

519
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:33,780
So I think everybody uses reference. Managers were just talking about like maybe some pros and cons of each type.

520
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:46,230
And maybe what I'll do is it's kind of good timing because that's not what I.

521
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:54,930
But let me just make sure, okay, I was just going through this like paper writing thing, but I think what we can do everything out of this, like,

522
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,770
better be here now or I will be like, okay, well, I can,

523
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:03,480
I can click through a little bit and then we can like maybe to get some reaction guys break or something.

524
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:14,190
But this so this idea of like this order of writing papers and this discussion piece, this is I found really helpful,

525
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:22,980
even if you don't end up doing it, leaving it that way for every paper, but like to force yourself to kind of say this study found blah, blah, blah.

526
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,520
This study had four key findings. They were this.

527
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:34,860
And then it's like your sort of discussion flows because you force yourself to kind of go to the findings in the most like meaningful.

528
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:41,339
And then this idea here going back to the intro like here's how the findings

529
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,970
are similar or different from what I said before and how they fill the gaps.

530
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:53,040
And then this is again going back to your literature review and say like, oh, I wrote that, you know, did that literature review six months ago.

531
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:00,620
Let me double check that. Nothing exactly on this topic has come out and it's like P three like you can pontificate here.

532
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,170
This is like the mechanisms like here's why this might be, here's why this might be.

533
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:12,449
And so this is, again, really short and this could break out into like finding one in a particular situation,

534
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:16,080
finding two in a pontification and finding for you the interpretation.

535
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:23,190
Okay. And then I think we are all familiar with these, but like the strengths and limitations,

536
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:32,339
everyone has strengths and everyone has some data from the study and I think this is like such an obvious one.

537
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:36,569
But reviewers will always say, like, you didn't say it wasn't, you couldn't prove causality.

538
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:40,350
And so just stick that one in if you have that observational study.

539
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:50,799
And I think I'll share these slides here. This is also really relevant for really different journal dependents.

540
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,980
So like if you're writing for like pediatric psychology, they'll want some clinical implications for writing, for policy focused journal.

541
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,810
That's where they might want to help patients.

542
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:07,250
Others might not want implied implications really much at all, but it really depends on the journal the way.

543
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:12,280
And so I think I'm just going to click through because I think I've said this.

544
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:21,740
From the start of being an order using similar using consistent terminology, not using causal language appears as correlational.

545
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:27,530
Study what we all do and I kind of go through and I like try to hack it out and keeping the table up to date.

546
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,980
We didn't talk about the alerts, but we could talk about that.

547
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:38,390
And then the abstract, which is, I think what I started with talking about and then sort of our reading.

548
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:46,430
So I think this is I will say this is like a little paragraph that just sort of like really talking about 15.

549
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:54,440
It's like this is sort of a super tight way of thinking about up writing a paragraph like a very micro level.

550
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,719
And then that's that qualitative write up article.

551
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:09,560
So I'll share this with you guys. And then and now this is like perfect for keeping here, but like seeking feedback,

552
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:18,590
writing on what they're doing and just sort of helping to kind of get in this mode of being, you know, productive people with there.

553
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:24,060
So yeah. So what I pause and that's actually not.

554
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:33,310
But I will. Do you want me to log out and you can get kind of this is like new technology.

555
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,590
Like last time I was here, it was like it was at a table. I know.

556
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,550
Yeah, that's next. I know. I like. I feel like it's it's kind of it's a good.

557
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:46,760
Yeah, yeah. Um, I'll just sit up here and if you guys want to take, like,

558
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:54,870
a little mini break while we get set up and then we can come back and person in a bit to run to the restroom.

559
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,170
Another think. I'm going to do that.

560
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:09,800
Oh, here we go. Worst of the.

561
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,010
Nothing comes to this. I'll take it.

562
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,100
Maybe. I don't know if I'm still in your seat. If I sit here. I know your.

563
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,080
Yeah, that's right.

564
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:30,440
I was hanging out downstairs and I threw my backpack on and I bent over to pick up my bag, and it was like this weird popping thing all over back.

565
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,330
So I'm like, I'm going to see if I can sit there and know is yes.

566
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:39,170
Like I don't even know. Like, it was strange. She's like, Oh, do that.

567
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:43,550
And you know, what I've done is I've actually I think I think that if I can get my left.

568
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,230
Oh, for sure. Yes, yes. Let's talk about, um.

569
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:55,160
Oh, I mean, it's. It was such a weird angle to go.

570
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:03,080
Should have known better than to do that. And I have to ask, how are you feeling?

571
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:14,930
Oh, yeah, I feel fine. And I do sort of a little bit of a feeling like I mean, I just wonder, is this your first time?

572
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,860
Yeah, the first time I had it, yeah. So I kind of feel like. All right, well, okay.

573
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:24,350
The other thing I don't know exactly, and my husband got it at Memorial Day and then I had to wait here.

574
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:28,610
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

575
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:35,659
You can get it. You mean I didn't know about that?

576
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:40,570
So I. Well, I feel like right now people are being exposed to everything.

577
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,720
That's right. Like that. I mean. Yeah, yeah.

578
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,690
Oh, yeah. So I, I love, I love to see the long hours.

579
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:58,810
We just skip, like. It's not with this new fangled setup here.

580
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,700
According to the U.S.

581
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:21,140
Yeah. I managed to get Corbett all week. This is my laptop. Oh, look at, you know.

582
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:28,510
I mean, I know I've got to do something right after this and have to spend the extra.

583
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:43,540
No, that's the feeling here. I feel this is going to.

584
01:02:46,370 --> 01:03:05,130
Yeah. So. This weekend.

585
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,090
It's going to be that one. That's what I thought was going to get a preview in Saturday's flap.

586
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:19,800
I feel like they need to ship. They maybe I don't know who, but I don't know whether I would have gone swimming yesterday.

587
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:26,320
It was nice. I feel like a memorial. Since I get stuck in a hole, I feel like I need to share.

588
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,240
That's true. All schedule yesterday. And I would hope.

589
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:44,960
Yeah, that's true. I feel like that climate change, they really need to adjust its climate here.

590
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:49,760
And I think that. Matter?

591
01:03:50,920 --> 01:04:02,150
No. Solid computers. That's good. If you would like to just come over to the side lane, HB 800.

592
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,320
And so this is such a nice small business. Everybody just.

593
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:16,469
Yeah, a nice, cozy group. If you could just get to the slides and then actually have the notes document open, like, feel free to take notes.

594
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:19,170
It's your document. But I'm going to chat with each of.

595
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:26,460
And while I show things, I'm going to try to pull in whatever your topics are and play around with certain things.

596
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:34,460
Were you able to get to the right place? It is case sensitive.

597
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:42,930
And then the notes you can just get to the slides and then the notes link is on the slide.

598
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:51,660
So. You just get to the slides. Go for it.

599
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,810
All right. So, I'm Kate, sailor. I'm an information ist at the drop in Health Science Library.

600
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:06,530
John, if you guys have wandered around, have felt kind of weird, fake post-pandemic times, but our library is open.

601
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,470
We're, like, just around the corner from St Angelo's.

602
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,950
We are open. It's. It's a little bit confused.

603
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:20,060
Our library went through the renovation and then the medical school kind of owns the whole building now.

604
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:24,770
And we are now just like on half of one floor within the medical school.

605
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,700
So the whole building is called the Public Health Sciences Library.

606
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,080
It's very, very confusing.

607
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:38,220
The whole building is called the library when in fact we are just within the building and the whole building is owned by the medical school.

608
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:47,180
I say this because if you ever want to wander over there to study, the building has separate hours than the library.

609
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:53,900
Library, I think the building. Why do you think there's a website that has the link building, building hours?

610
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:59,629
I believe the building gets looked at like five or six and they have like a security guard.

611
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:05,360
And as long as you're affiliated with any of the health sciences schools, you just bring your own card in and show it and I'll let you in.

612
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:13,670
You might be able to swipe in. I'm not really sure what the outdoor situation is like, post-pandemic or whatever, but it is a little bit confusing.

613
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:20,870
So the whole building is open 24 hours a day and you just have to have a time card to swipe in the library.

614
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:25,910
Library where I work has different hours in the building, but that's where we're housed.

615
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,630
We don't have any books in our library. So that's like another shocker.

616
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:35,000
Like after the renovation, we moved our whole print collection offsite because like health sciences,

617
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,180
we're like, I want the thing that was published this morning electronically.

618
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:44,719
So we didn't have a ton of useful print materials, probably, probably most materials.

619
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:52,549
But like usually those are like government reports and like slowly over the years that pushed it online.

620
01:06:52,550 --> 01:07:00,110
So for the most part, you can get everything online. If not, you can request to have items delivered and picked up in another library location.

621
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:06,379
So I am your point person. I can be a good general information hub.

622
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:13,310
So we work with people all across the university, different departments, schools units, research projects, research labs.

623
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,670
So generally, if you question about anything, I might not know it, but I'll definitely help you figure it out.

624
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:26,030
But for the most part, people contact me like, Hey, I'm ruler of you or I need oh.

625
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:31,410
So perception management tools to reduce. I know.

626
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,320
I know. Originally.

627
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:45,700
So are you still using end loader your access to it so so I don't I was there at least.

628
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:53,610
Certainly, you know, there's somebody out there right now is waiting to see what we do here.

629
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:02,080
I know about you. Do you still have access to your Xperia using it?

630
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:07,750
I just have experiences and I'd be quite nice to have access till I get up again and I know when.

631
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:13,200
Yeah, that might be okay. You guys are now starting fresh.

632
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,140
You're familiar with them? You said no. Okay, cool. I was like, you know what?

633
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:25,670
I'm actually going to I'm jumping into this library here. I have a very hard time recommending mentally at this point, like they have cheap.

634
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,799
They got bought out. They used to be amazing. They got bought out by Elsevier.

635
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:38,840
And Elsevier is like. I mean, it's at this point, it's just a very different product than what it was like even ten years ago.

636
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,340
So at this point I really if people aren't using any tool currently though,

637
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:52,950
tarot is really like our kind of recommended tool and notice also fantastic, but it's not free.

638
01:08:53,220 --> 01:09:00,680
So the university doesn't have an institutional license where it is super expensive, unfortunately.

639
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:06,210
Like if you have some type of affiliation with the hospital health system, the health system provides that note to.

640
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:14,650
But the rest of the university does not. So I would recommend you guys getting my research narrow.

641
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:19,360
You're already familiar with it? I will say Nusantara apparel just launched.

642
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,560
I don't know if you've made the upgrade. Oh, my gosh. It's. It's like magic.

643
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:27,370
We can talk about it seriously. Like they like men.

644
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:32,349
The way I used to have a really cool, like PDF if you were editor,

645
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:38,530
you can make annotations and type things and highlight things, etc. We did not have that for the longest time.

646
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:47,170
Wells Otero six, now has all sorts of four PDF tools which are like a game changer, especially for doing the lit reviews.

647
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:55,840
So we can talk about that a little bit and have general library stuff slides here, but especially because it's such a small group,

648
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:01,600
I wonder how to go around like how do you introduce yourself and like what is your topic of interest?

649
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:05,620
What do you think I can do to help you? What do you hope the library can to help you?

650
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:09,830
What kind of questions do you have? And then we can kind of like this session.

651
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:13,270
So I can I can kind of talk about anything for like hours and hours and hours.

652
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:19,420
I want to make it relevant to you guys. And since there's such a small group, that'll be very easy to do so.

653
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:24,530
All right, let's start here. What is your name? Hi, there.

654
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,960
How do you spell your name? And.

655
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:34,020
I am. Yeah.

656
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,960
Like, what's your research area when you work on? Well.

657
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:43,610
So right now we're working. With demands for support in the house of.

658
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,350
Nothing with us now.

659
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:59,520
But I really want to focus I want to put this on we haven't done the interest sat down and I other things like that in a community health decision.

660
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:13,800
And overall our hope. So they decided right now I really need experience in the United States.

661
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:18,470
And I held a meeting. But I think it'd be more.

662
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:26,010
And my. The President able to.

663
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:31,270
Data collection. We'll.

664
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:41,570
And so you have experience with and you know where the.

665
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:48,460
Zoot here. Yeah. Okay.

666
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:55,420
It needs a new brush and a little bit about my background.

667
01:11:55,420 --> 01:12:03,180
So I was working for. The policy provides for years of transition based on.

668
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,670
Here was circumspect. But my research interests.

669
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,130
On health care, especially in school and community spending.

670
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:26,820
Recently. Specifically about houses and selling things that I think you can be really helpful with is the.

671
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:32,320
Really has not been that I think people pretty about the community space.

672
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:40,650
There seems to be a lot more and more traditional freer institutions and so understanding of what is known about.

673
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:51,930
American youth population. I also started to work with.

674
01:12:54,860 --> 01:13:00,490
Are you participating in the writing lab? Okay.

675
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,160
Okay. I just met with. What did I just meet with the other day?

676
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:15,070
We scheduled to scheduling them right now, but that it was, uh, and that with Mack Murphy and Eliana that we were ready.

677
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:18,250
Okay, cool. So we're doing it. What did they like? Yeah, yeah.

678
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:22,420
There's two writing labs session. I'll put a link in the notes.

679
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:32,610
Document copy. Training lab. So it sounds like they have like a handful of I don't know, it was like 20 or 30 people with every cohort.

680
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:36,989
They had an email list and then there's scheduling a series.

681
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,740
They used to just do kind of like an accountability writing group thing for a long time.

682
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,380
So anybody using the healthy minds data,

683
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:49,310
they would kind of get together and like talk about what they're publishing or the researching, but then the accountability.

684
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,150
I think it's the pandemic. This kind of made everything really hard.

685
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:57,549
And so now they're kind of relaunching this writing lab, but it's more of an instruction based thing.

686
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:04,260
And so they're doing. But there.

687
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:11,390
So I don't know how they're publishing these things, but the first session we're actually talking about is Otero.

688
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:17,000
And so that's like November 14th. And then we're doing one in December and like.

689
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:26,180
Yeah, it's kind of a new, you know, search strategy element.

690
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:31,670
So, okay, cool. That's like, I love it when, like, things kind of come together. Like, I just met them a couple days ago.

691
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,950
Yeah, we just met. I know.

692
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:43,950
Just about hilarious in response to. So many different, including source.

693
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:07,100
Oh, I'm thinking now, too. You're talking about data collection and private data and entertainer.

694
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:14,000
I'm not sure if you guys have any NIH funding or if you're connected with an engaged project.

695
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:19,140
But there is a new policy that may launch at the start of next year related to.

696
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:28,440
So that's another thing. If there's folks around here that are working on any kind of data like this is going to be anything we're like,

697
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:36,400
you need to share your data, make it available. And so we are like at Tubman, we're doing a lot of, you know, what I have to document?

698
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:45,620
So here's a guy I grew up with and there's a big group across campus called RDC Research Data Stewardship Initiative.

699
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:55,860
So that is going on. And they're doing all sorts of like right now, it's kind of an awareness raising period.

700
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:02,160
At TODMAN, we're going to be doing a lot of education related to the NIH data sharing stuff.

701
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:05,579
So as those workshops and I'll maybe, oh, actually,

702
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:13,200
could you share or add to your canvas site and I will just push any announcements we're going to have in other scheduling a couple workshops.

703
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,570
So maybe I'm interested in this group or if you guys know of other people that would be interested.

704
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:23,389
Sure that information's all that stuff kind of just coming out.

705
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:27,260
Like, we just I just went to the first, like, town hall for this RTC.

706
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:35,560
So that may also be. Data management.

707
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:40,060
Like sessions. But I didn't know that that's her dream.

708
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:44,240
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, really? So we have to put that stuff.

709
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:52,229
All the research his. Something like I never remember what.

710
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:58,300
The end of the day. So we're not leaving.

711
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:02,670
This research guide adds this is all just in an emerging.

712
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,850
Yeah. So this is launching January 23.

713
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:14,020
Like we're trying to tell everything is very important. They are aware of it.

714
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:17,590
And then we're updating this tab as new stuff comes out. So.

715
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:29,630
So this is a side note because there are things that, like you should be aware of.

716
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:40,310
And this is one. Our series linked.

717
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,650
Of that? Oh, yes.

718
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:51,890
That scholarship. Yeah.

719
01:17:52,170 --> 01:18:00,860
I forgot. My. My stuff is not working. All right.

720
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:16,500
Have. I'm fighting with Clara in front of the Audi R8.

721
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:21,360
Clear? Yeah. Come on. From New Mexico's.

722
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:35,450
There was research by the cancer. My preference is probably quality service.

723
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:42,070
Last year, I was going to do a randomized clinical trial, but.

724
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:50,360
In that population on. I'm interested in.

725
01:18:52,200 --> 01:19:01,000
In looking at income support groups. Make that transition and expertize.

726
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,920
But make sure that the cancer is fractured but have.

727
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:10,990
I'm happy and I'm interested in the end of.

728
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:43,020
We will continue to. And it's really about getting more quality experience.

729
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:50,320
So. All sorts of good information about you guys.

730
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:55,779
Want to jump back over to the slide. So basically, I have kind of all of these resources.

731
01:19:55,780 --> 01:20:00,270
These are like little bookmarks. If you want to just jump down further in the presentation, you can do that.

732
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:07,450
There are tons and tons of slides. This is actually the slide deck that I just always use for this class and I'm like, I just keep updating.

733
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:14,140
So there's tons of stuff in here. I don't expect to go through all of it, but depending on kind of what your research areas are like,

734
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:17,860
I try to dump everything in here that's possibly relevant. All right,

735
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:26,530
so I'll start out with kind of a general orientation of library resources to make sure you guys know what you have access to and how to get to it.

736
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:31,240
So depending on where you're coming from, wait, libraries set themselves up differently?

737
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,569
I mean, there's so many different systems and like, how do you get to the full text?

738
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:40,510
And it always looks different and it's always complicated. So I want to make sure you guys kind of know how to get to stuff.

739
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:51,300
So the first thing, and I would say probably the best way is through this thing called a research guide and all, you know, we can put this in.

740
01:20:54,170 --> 01:20:57,410
This is like about you and the things you were talking about.

741
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:01,080
But the research guys actually this is also.

742
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:04,370
Research guide. Not one I want to look at right now. Here we go.

743
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:09,590
Okay. For some, I got my head so big, screwed up.

744
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:12,890
She can't see me. So what we do with these research guys,

745
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:20,930
we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of research guides for pretty much all of the department schools programs at University of Michigan.

746
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:25,680
Right. Current events engineering, health sciences.

747
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:33,920
So we've got like over 70. So what we do with these research guys is we kind of have our own liaison area.

748
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:39,520
So I work with the community. I also work with Department of Pediatrics and Ophthalmology in the hospital.

749
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:43,340
I also have the School of Nursing. So those are the areas that I'm responsible for.

750
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:49,440
So I try to stay aware of all the stuff that we subscribe to in the library that are relevant for each of these departments.

751
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:56,070
And I dump them all into my research guide because I will show you the library website in a minute.

752
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,959
It's as good as it can be. Like we have a massive library system.

753
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,880
And so to make one tool that like lets you discover everything is impossible.

754
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:11,890
Like they did a massive overhaul of the website like or like 18 months ago.

755
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:18,700
And it's, it's beautiful, but it's really hard to find library resources.

756
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:22,600
So research guides are probably your best bet for finding things.

757
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:30,339
Everybody kind of does their guides a little bit differently. Some people have like lots of links with.

758
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:37,510
Some of them are more like educational. But, you know, I create this guide based on like I work with faculty and they're like, Oh,

759
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:42,940
I am doing this new assignment and I need my students to be able to find evidence based interventions.

760
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:45,690
And so then I'm like, Ooh, let me find resources that can help.

761
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:50,439
So if there's stuff in here that's like not relevant or there's an updated thing or you're like,

762
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,589
Man, I discovered this other evidence before, you should contact me.

763
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:58,930
I will. This is for you guys. This is the Databases tab.

764
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:08,520
And so we have hundreds of thousands of databases for so many that we spend, I don't know, something like $24 million on library.

765
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,550
We have a huge budget, huge library collection, which is fantastic,

766
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,690
but it can make it a little bit difficult to figure out like, what database should I be searching?

767
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:20,530
How do I get to it? So again, research guys, probably your best starting point.

768
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:28,720
So for most of my folks, these are like the the heavy hitting databases where we usually start,

769
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:34,840
depending on what your topics are, there might be some other like population based databases we want to pull at.

770
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:41,949
But usually Sinal is a great because anybody searches at all like yeah so set all well it's you know nursing

771
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:47,100
an allied health database it has a lot of really good coverage for public health and especially for each.

772
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:53,500
So I love seeing all pregnant users, but man, I love that.

773
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:56,680
Number one, I love that because you will always have access to it.

774
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:05,020
And then where you end up, I mean, we speak with surgeon, you don't always have access to full text when you leave the University of Michigan,

775
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:09,410
but you'll be able to search it and get to at least open access stuff from wherever you end up.

776
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:13,660
Books has to be updated. I think it's like 38 million now.

777
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:20,400
Scopus. Search. Scopus. We got one person that I love school.

778
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:25,200
It is a ginormous database. I think it has something like 80 million citations.

779
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:31,870
But I love Scopus for public health stuff because a lot of your topics cut across multiple disciplines.

780
01:24:32,350 --> 01:24:34,030
Or I'm like, I had someone that was like, Oh,

781
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:40,000
I'm interested in the design of cities and sidewalks in impacting walkability and like adolescent obesity.

782
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:46,360
And I'm like, okay, great. Well, search PubMed and get a lot of stuff about like obesity and health things.

783
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,850
I'm like, Oh, this is more like civil engineering design of city.

784
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:56,340
I don't even know anything about that. So I'm like, Let's go to Scopus, because it cuts across life sciences, health sciences,

785
01:24:56,610 --> 01:25:01,200
health sciences, social sciences and physical sciences is huge across a ton of things.

786
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:11,520
So I love school best for pretty much most public health projects and this is like a very similar database to PubMed.

787
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:15,750
It has much more global focus.

788
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,989
So does a lot of non-North American literature.

789
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:23,480
I love and base. It is huge. There is some overlap, right?

790
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:28,889
And so a lot of these databases will have overlap like Codman has Medline that

791
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:33,000
Medline shows the certification Scopus has Medline actually sent all as Medline.

792
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:38,430
So you're going to see a lot of overlap between these databases, but there's still tons of unique content.

793
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:44,909
So when you're doing a live review, depending on what your topic is, probably going to be pulling in from a couple of different databases.

794
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:50,250
So like that walkability question, it's like, well, yeah, let's look at like Club Med for like.

795
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:57,089
It wasn't obesity, but then maybe let's pull in some like I don't know the civil engineering is that whoever designs like cities and

796
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:04,350
sidewalks and things so pulling in different perspectives that kind of approach your question from different disciplines.

797
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:08,520
I'm usually your questions have a lot of really interesting like facets to them and so

798
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:12,240
we want to make sure that we're looking at databases that will give you an average.

799
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:21,450
Depending on your topic. So things like population specific databases, so it can like age line if you're looking for things like,

800
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:26,130
you know, gerontology, Hispanic American periodicals index, you know, probably.

801
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:37,339
Oh, you're so LGBTQ source. So we've got some population specific databases, so we might have like pub med and LGBTQ stories and topics,

802
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:43,900
and that might give us nice coverage or a certain question, a lot of stuff and age related social sciences.

803
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:47,560
So I pulled and these are some of the most common ones that folks need to search.

804
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:54,440
By no means is this all of the social sciences databases, but these are the ones that like at least folks that I've worked with,

805
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,499
use other databases, things like Eric So of behavioral health, education.

806
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,310
So Eric has an education database, so there could be a lot of really interesting stuff in there.

807
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:10,610
A lot of it is like K-through-12 education, but there's also a lot of coverage on things like general health education.

808
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:18,349
So sometimes we'll pull that in global health again, depending on your topic, that might be a good one to pull in criminal justice.

809
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:24,640
And this I should probably like move up to the top because I'm really excited about another really big one with HP aging.

810
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:32,570
So you have access to all of the databases from anywhere like you don't have to be on campus.

811
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:38,430
Another common question, I. No. You don't physically have to come to the library.

812
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:43,529
You have access to all of these from anywhere. It's just a matter of your level one log into like what?

813
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:47,040
You log in to check your email. So you'll just click on any of these.

814
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:53,460
I'm already locked lockdown. So it's probably not going to ask me to log in and then bam, you have access to it.

815
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:59,210
So you have access to everything from everywhere. Oh, I will say this.

816
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,450
I always tell myself to add it and I feel I still haven't done it here.

817
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,230
Does anybody search Google Scholar? Right. So some people are.

818
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:12,230
Yeah, I suppose like it's like a dirty secret or something. Like, I love Google Scholar.

819
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:20,160
It is like a one instrument. So you can build a really focused, refined search, but it can be a great starting point,

820
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:26,220
especially for some of those age beauty questions that are like, I don't know, they cut across so many different doesn't even know where to start.

821
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:32,370
I will say I'm going to update. You are putting this on my to do list.

822
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:41,010
So Google scholar and public or to a human resources in that everybody has access to them.

823
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:46,080
You don't have to be affiliated with University of Michigan to search. Anybody can get to the public domain.

824
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:52,770
Anybody can go to Google Scholar. But with those two particular databases and we do strongly encourage that you

825
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:57,659
access them through this link through this link link on the library website,

826
01:28:57,660 --> 01:29:01,200
link on the research guide, because it's the same Google scholar.

827
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:08,480
But what this link does is on the back end, and I'll have you log in with your level one and it will connect you to the full text.

828
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:12,899
So a lot of people that search Google Scholar and they'll get their titles and then the link

829
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:17,310
over to like any library website are going to help me try to get to the whole tapestry.

830
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:22,500
But if you come to Google Scholar from this link and I will put it on a research guide,

831
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:32,580
I'm not going to forget and I do something like, let's see here, we'll do community college and this has performances.

832
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:35,170
Do something like this.

833
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:45,090
You'll see some of these like it defaults to like the publisher is the first link so you should be able to get to it directly from the publisher.

834
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:48,930
Like in these cases I'm not sure, like open access and you would have access to it anyway.

835
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:57,600
But you'll see down here, as long as you come in through the library link, it gives you this link availability at Michigan.

836
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,580
So if it's something that's maybe not open access, this links you to the stuff, the library password.

837
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:05,249
So that's kind of a hidden trick for a lot of people.

838
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:10,110
Search Google Scholar either directly or they're like googling things and it takes you to local scholar result.

839
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:14,910
And then I think like copy the title and then try to find it in my pub matters thing.

840
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:22,380
But you can kind of bypass that and get the direct link availability in here and then go to item.

841
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:27,350
So same thing with PubMed. If you're in.

842
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:38,130
What is going on? Like, I can't like my. Very strange.

843
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:42,480
Well, let's just pretend I'm in a private window in Firefox.

844
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:47,880
And if I just go to Club Med Deco, I can absolutely do a search.

845
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:51,990
But if I come in to Cabinet at U.N.

846
01:30:54,470 --> 01:31:00,690
And I do. I'm logged in.

847
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:06,060
You can actually see the URL before I did that. The URL is like pubmed and yada yada equals you.

848
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,840
When. When I click on any of these articles,

849
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:15,390
I'm going to see this and get an icon and this is going to be what you want to click on to get to the full text.

850
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:22,290
I will say in PubMed they have added this very slick tool.

851
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,450
They meaning University of Michigan Library.

852
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:36,030
So it's so slick that sometimes it makes it more difficult depending on your operating system and your browser can behave a little bit differently,

853
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:41,370
but you'll click on the and get a link to get to the full text that wimpy this was.

854
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:45,840
I just thought of course the company's ago and like we were having some weird issues with this.

855
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:57,000
Let me grab this. There's like a whole group of things that the metadata is wrong.

856
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:12,959
And so they're. That's not normally.

857
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,590
What? A broken thing.

858
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:24,590
We. The other day. I was trying. And that there's yeah, there's something bigger going on.

859
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,669
They thought it was limited to one particular publisher because I just happened to click

860
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:32,060
on three or four articles that were all from the same article in the same journal.

861
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:39,760
But I am now seeing it as a bigger problem. Okay.

862
01:32:52,450 --> 01:33:00,460
Okay. Well, let's just imagine this normally does not happen, but there's some weird thing going on with our blinking.

863
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:06,400
So normally you'll click on that and get it and that little key pops up.

864
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:13,810
And so depending on how your operating system, your browser setup, sometimes you click on it and you're like, Well, nothing happened.

865
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,110
Where's my full text? That lib keys, very light.

866
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:20,620
And it will actually download the PDF automatically for you.

867
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:25,360
So some people have it set up where it will open up the PDF as a new tab.

868
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:27,669
And so then it's very obvious that it's downloaded.

869
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:34,329
But like for me, I don't it just goes to my downloads folder and I'm like, I click on and get it and I'm like, Where is it and get it and get it?

870
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:38,080
And it's actually just sitting waiting for me at the piano, my normal folder.

871
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,230
So it's slick, but you kind of have to know how it's like.

872
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:49,510
But yeah, this is definitely down, which is unfortunate because it's the start of the year and everybody's teaching, okay?

873
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:51,310
So normally it doesn't do that.

874
01:33:52,480 --> 01:34:00,130
So yeah, so Google Scholar and PubMed are kind of unique and that come in through the link on the library website on the research guide.

875
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:06,130
So I did show you very quickly, actually, the Taubman website.

876
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:15,010
So up, open. So research guys, probably your best bet for getting to stuff.

877
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:20,990
Another option is the library website and I do have links to everything.

878
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:24,129
You know, I've got link links and screenshots if you want to come back. Really great.

879
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:32,890
What do I click on? I've got links and screenshots here, but the the library websites, I show you this for a few things.

880
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,430
So these are hours eight and five today.

881
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:39,610
This is what the building looks like from the outside.

882
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:48,130
This is Katherine Street like right here, Angelo's restaurants like over here, that school of nursing over there.

883
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:56,550
So if you walk in from Katherine Street, this is actually the fourth floor kind of confusing, but really built into a hill.

884
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,489
So this is the fourth floor. There's four or five or six.

885
01:35:00,490 --> 01:35:06,819
I don't actually think there's a first floor, but like two and three are like med school admin offices,

886
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:12,220
like construction things, five and six med school study rooms and stuff.

887
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:16,340
But you walk into the fourth floor, there's a little coffee shop, which is very nice.

888
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:25,299
Well, I'll be there. Suits, sandwiches, there's some just open, like seating areas you could study, but then there's a big glass wall.

889
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:28,629
It's got double doors. That's the library. Library.

890
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:31,840
So that's like where my office is. The library library.

891
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,380
Glass doors. Interior glass doors. That's this, right?

892
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:40,900
The exterior doors. I don't actually know what their hours are. It doesn't matter to you guys that you are affiliated.

893
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:45,470
You should be able to barge in or the guard will let you in.

894
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:52,510
So those are our library library hours. I scroll down here.

895
01:35:52,550 --> 01:36:00,080
So this is another way to get to stuff. These are just the most frequently used databases across all the health sciences.

896
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:07,490
So we work with pharmacy dentistry, nursing home, public health, kinesiology, medical school, and we work with the whole hospital.

897
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:11,629
So like board vitals probably won't be relevant to you,

898
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:17,959
but things like sent all those quick links to similar things like Google Scholar or you know, second or Scooper.

899
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:22,340
So you can get to some resources that will be relevant for you from this page.

900
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,120
So that's another option. And then.

901
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:34,870
The last option is this thing called library search. So, like, this is why I just don't love the library website.

902
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:44,809
If I am a student and I'm like, Oh, I want to find a book on mental health and like I'm going to type in the search box.

903
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:52,270
And this search box actually just searches the library website, very confusing, not library collection,

904
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:56,930
library websites like you're not going to find books through that little search box.

905
01:36:56,930 --> 01:37:00,530
Like if you're looking for me, you will find me here.

906
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,930
But this does not search the collection.

907
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:09,500
This version of the election, which I feel like this should be the priority search package wants to search the library Web site and anyway,

908
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:14,000
we have provided their feedback. You have to click on this little Explorer button up at the top.

909
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,530
It's kind of hidden. Then you'll see library search show up here.

910
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:24,080
This is going to be how you search for books, journals.

911
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:26,570
This helps you find the databases.

912
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:35,060
So by default, this library search searches everything and buy everything that catalog articles, database, online journals, guides and more.

913
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:40,460
So if I'm interested in, you know, cancer survivor.

914
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:48,530
I'm just doing a keyword search and searching everything. You'll see this brightly colored a bento box.

915
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:52,090
So, like, it gives us all this stuff. And again, this is why I like.

916
01:37:52,130 --> 01:37:55,340
It's so complete. It's too much. It's like a firehose. Really.

917
01:37:55,870 --> 01:38:03,620
I want to find an article. So the catalog one isn't surprising that I'm not supposed to buy a machine.

918
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:08,000
Maybe we just do panther, because it's a bit bigger topic here.

919
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:12,230
So the catalog, you can see there's like 40,000 results.

920
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:18,110
I'm going to just tell you right now, ignore this article's search feature.

921
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:24,490
This is great for, like, undergrad humanities. It. It's not powerful enough for life.

922
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:30,490
I want to find out. Our city is related to, you know, breast, neoplasms, anything like that.

923
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,790
You can't do much with this. It's against the one instrument like Google Scholar.

924
01:38:35,090 --> 01:38:43,520
Just a couple of keywords. And it's it's not powerful enough to make a really good search specifically for like health sciences.

925
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:49,819
You can find people. So Sarah Samuel's one of my colleagues. She works for the Department of Ecology and Oncology.

926
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:52,910
So that's what she shows up here on databases.

927
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:59,780
So if we've got like encyclopedias or if we had a cancer specific database, they'll show up here, you know, get online journals from here.

928
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:08,120
Sometimes there will be like other, like, oh, hey, we work with research guides on stuff that are related to cancer catalog.

929
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:12,229
I'm going to actually I'm going to do I can do view catalog results.

930
01:39:12,230 --> 01:39:16,430
And that's the same thing as if I had just clicked, you know, these tabs here.

931
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:21,170
I'm going to do a quick search for wound care. I did this one recently.

932
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:28,329
So I said that we don't have books in our library.

933
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:33,090
So unfortunately I'm going to like browse the shelves. But like, let's say there's a book that you want.

934
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:36,220
It's not available electronically. Looks like we own it.

935
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:43,270
Right. It shows up in our catalog. But if you scroll down, you'll see this is where it's available.

936
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:49,610
So this H. S RS is actually R. [INAUDIBLE] find this collection such as our remote storage remote.

937
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:53,470
I don't even know what it stands for, but that's part of this collection of sciences remote.

938
01:39:53,770 --> 01:40:00,249
Something like is on shelf, which means you can check it out, but like you can't physically go to those pages.

939
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:05,680
R. S So you have to say, get this. Log ins.

940
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:09,010
I'm not logged in here. This will give you more options when you log in.

941
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:16,030
You can, you know, find it in a library, the find in the library.

942
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:19,510
This is like not public remote shelving, but it certainly makes sense in this case.

943
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:26,219
If you want the entire book, you can say, hey, I want to pick it up at and these are like pickup locations.

944
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:31,870
So maybe maybe you live down in central campus and like captures a close spot for you to pick up.

945
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:35,499
Maybe you live up here and Robin's a better spotter. Hey, maybe you're up in Flint.

946
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:44,050
You can pick it up there. I get this item usually takes depending on the time of day and the days at the request, usually a couple days,

947
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:51,040
but then they'll get you an email in three days, depending on what your situation is like.

948
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:59,410
Your office. I don't really know the criteria and it changed a few times, but you may be able to have it delivered like a mailbox.

949
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:05,230
I know there are some requirements, like if you've got like a departmental mailbox and there's like a door that like,

950
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,860
you know, there's it's all confusing. So you may be able to have it delivered.

951
01:41:09,130 --> 01:41:10,890
I would say, like if it's something you're interested in,

952
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:17,950
you try it and then you'll see if you have the right situation where they'll deliver it to you or if you're like,

953
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:23,560
I just need this one article in this print journal scanned or I just need this one chapter.

954
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:30,280
You can place the request. Yeah, they won't. You can't say like, oh well you have all this book, it's only in print.

955
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,240
Can you scan the entire book. Very, you have to comply with that copyright restriction.

956
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:40,570
So it's like there's some, you know, formula for like very small percent of the entire thing that they'll scan.

957
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:45,700
But you can do that. It's usually pretty quick turnaround and then they'll email you a link,

958
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:50,110
make sure you download the link right away because it will expire after two weeks.

959
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:58,870
That's all that information will be in the email that you receive. So that's kind of how you get stuff, get books.

960
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:09,510
Or whole journals or we've got a huge DVD desk with media library and they're familiar with that, but it's on a central campus in Hampshire.

961
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:15,930
They are holding their streaming videos and there's like DVDs or TV shows, movies.

962
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:19,800
It's awesome. It's huge. So you can also get DVDs and whatnot.

963
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:24,630
Let's see, teaching people to feel in that's example that.

964
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:28,670
Yeah. And signing or something. Mm hmm.

965
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,660
Yep. You do ethnic cleansing every campus.

966
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:39,840
Yep. So you can contact them. And now I haven't actually looked at their page since the website redesign.

967
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:47,990
But you'll see there's like options to use filming courses if you can find a video, there is viewing like couple spots.

968
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:54,709
You can watch the videos there if you need help trying to figure out like how I know we do a lot of stuff

969
01:42:54,710 --> 01:43:01,460
where like student groups want to host a community screening of a documentary or something you can contact,

970
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:07,070
ask with, and they'll help you like secure the public whatever license you're allowed to, you know, show it.

971
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:11,000
So they're amazing. So you can always just like shoot them an email here.

972
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:16,999
So yeah, I love asking if they've got everything. So that's the catalog.

973
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,299
Her answer from the catalog. That's library search. Right.

974
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:24,470
So just ignore the articles. It's not going to be enough for you.

975
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:29,570
But, you know, filling catalog items like journals or books or things, that's great.

976
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:36,050
We talked a little bit about the Get It button, right? So that's going to be like, how do you get to full text?

977
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:45,140
That's what it looks like in Google Scholar. And then in most cases, when you click on the and get a button except in PubMed right now, of course,

978
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:52,760
you'll be taken to a screen that looks like this PubMed as the only one that has that link key that will do the magic pdaf download.

979
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:57,980
But pretty much every other database you click on and get it. The next thing you'll see is a screen like this.

980
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:02,940
You'll see a bunch of big blue buttons or maybe one big blue button, and then you can expand it.

981
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:09,890
There's more options. So sometimes we'll have access to a journal like we pay for like these platforms and like set some journals.

982
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:13,280
And so like we might have that journal on a couple of platforms.

983
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:20,659
And so that's what these different things are. It'll be the same journal article no matter what you click on, but you'll click on this go to item,

984
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:25,160
or sometimes it's a read article and then you get to the full text.

985
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:30,830
So that's in a majority of cases because we have a huge library collection.

986
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:36,060
There are cases, though, where we don't have the item. That's really like one of two situations.

987
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:40,670
One, we have it, but we don't have it electronically.

988
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:46,640
So it might be in print, sitting on a shelf somewhere. The other situation is that we don't own it or we don't subscribe to it.

989
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:50,929
They've really streamlined this process. It used to be so clunky before,

990
01:44:50,930 --> 01:44:54,829
but now all you have to do is just click on this button or this button request to

991
01:44:54,830 --> 01:45:00,170
have a copy delivered and magically all your citation data will get bumped over.

992
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:03,860
I mean, not all. I just want to warn you, sometimes these are required fields.

993
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,229
Sometimes it'll miss, like the page remembers or it'll miss the date.

994
01:45:07,230 --> 01:45:10,710
Then you have to kind of go back to the citation and you're like, Oh, it's, you know, whatever.

995
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,570
2017. And then you click submit request.

996
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:23,650
And it will be that same process. Like if you requested, we get this or get an email, this is what your elliptical looks like.

997
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:27,800
I don't. I know what Elliott stands for. Maybe something in our library law library for that time.

998
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:35,239
So this is what your alien account looks like, and you can actually even just place requests through the Iliad.

999
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:38,690
So if you're like, Oh, I have a book chapter and you have all the citation information,

1000
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:43,850
you can place the request directly through here, or and yet it will also take you to this.

1001
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:53,210
You'll see this. Can you all request completed requests like once you have the item, like the scanned article or the book chapter that's scanned,

1002
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:59,420
you can click this completed request and it'll give you a list of everything you have ineffective or you'll download the PDF.

1003
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:07,309
You can also customize it like, Yeah, obviously I'm going to have been shipped to Dublin because I'm there most days, but you can customize that.

1004
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:11,600
Like if you're in the store in Flint, you can set that as like a default.

1005
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:16,459
So that's interlibrary learning, it's free. So please don't give her anything afterwards.

1006
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:22,720
You're like 50 clicks deep in Google Search like 2:00 in the morning and it's like, hey, $40 for this article.

1007
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:31,190
Like, we will pay for it. Don't pay for anything so we can get it through interlibrary loan because they're really good for the whole turn around.

1008
01:46:31,190 --> 01:46:34,820
Like if it's an article, for example, that we're just not subscribed to.

1009
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:39,570
This is a public good day. It's fast. Like, I'm always really surprised.

1010
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:44,169
Like, I think they say, like, 2 to 5 days.

1011
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:49,300
But sometimes I'll place the request in the morning and I'll get the link, you know, in the afternoon.

1012
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:55,090
But I think it depends on like if it's a hard to find item or if it's something where it's like we don't own it.

1013
01:46:55,270 --> 01:47:01,239
Some other library has it. It's in print. They have it buried in some, you know, so it might take a few more days for them to get up.

1014
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:07,660
And it's usually pretty quick turnaround. But I'll say, like, try to do all your library search and give yourself a buffer.

1015
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:12,700
Yeah. So it's like you have at least a little time now to get interlibrary loan items or whatever.

1016
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:20,450
All right. So that's like all the stuff you have access to. Any questions about that bridge to the lake?

1017
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:24,240
Search construction. My questions are. Oh, okay.

1018
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:27,840
Cool, cool. Excellent. So search business.

1019
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:30,990
That's the next section I have here. And so it's great.

1020
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:35,670
You guys were already talking about like doing great reviews and we've got lots of tools and tips and resources.

1021
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:41,370
So like, I'll cover a lot of stuff today, but if you want to schedule a consultation with me, we can kind of go through the nitty gritty,

1022
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:46,380
like make sure you have all the way databases lined up, make sure you we have your Notaro set up correctly.

1023
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:52,080
There's all sorts of ways to stay organized. And so, Tara, but the other thing I love about tarot is that.

1024
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:55,990
And now know what? I want to pause on that search.

1025
01:47:55,990 --> 01:48:01,000
And let me just talk about Zohydro really quickly so maybe you guys can kind of get started that you're not you haven't used it yet.

1026
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:05,230
So so, Carol, I'll put this link in the document.

1027
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:10,300
So basically so far from searching on the track about zero for a minute.

1028
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:17,739
So so, Carol, what you want to do is you're going to start out at the springboard we love.

1029
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:21,309
So tomorrow it is open source. It's a free product.

1030
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:24,700
Unlike, you know, Mandala, which is like a proprietary. Elsevier owns it.

1031
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,470
So Tarot has an amazing community.

1032
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:35,250
Like trying to get tech support on Mandalay is nearly impossible.

1033
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:39,759
Like you email them and they're like, we'll we'll get back to you in 5 to 7 business days.

1034
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:44,790
And you're like, It's Alexa. Like, you have to get on my Twitter and complain and trigeminal everybody.

1035
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:50,830
You know, it's a it's a real pain. Mandalay documentation is horrible.

1036
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:57,850
Like they make all these updates and like, their documentation is a huge lag until they like actually update the documentation.

1037
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:06,310
Like Mandalay, there used to be Mandalay desktop, which was like a piece of software that you download and they shifted from that to the.

1038
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:10,230
The reference manager, which is like an online thing.

1039
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:16,410
It's very messy, very hard. Like I want to help people that are using anyway going through this big transition and I'm like,

1040
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:20,819
Well, it'd be great if there was some documentation that kind of clarifies what you need to do.

1041
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:25,350
It's so hard. I mean, so. Zahara.

1042
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:32,120
We do not have that problem. There is amazing documentation and all this, like, quick start stuff.

1043
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:35,820
Very easy to read. Fantastic. Love the documentation.

1044
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:43,620
The forums are fantastic. So this is the community where you can ask questions and they I mean, you get an immediate response.

1045
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:46,409
They're helpful. It's just that this huge community of Totara users.

1046
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:50,910
So if you have a question about it, it's likely someone else has already asked the questions.

1047
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:54,000
You can kind of search through any of these discussions to get more help.

1048
01:49:56,010 --> 01:50:03,510
So basically what you're going to do with so tarot, you've got also tarot that or you're going to create an account, oh, actually, you know what?

1049
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:07,260
I might even have some zucchero sites that I can just dump in here.

1050
01:50:15,870 --> 01:50:18,900
This is like, yeah, yeah, I'll give you these.

1051
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:23,990
So this is what an introduction to. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1052
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:33,490
And it just adds Notaro to the mix. All right, we'll make that.

1053
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:41,520
But the year after. Just plug it in right here.

1054
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:54,130
Introduction, I think. Interesting.

1055
01:50:55,210 --> 01:51:00,480
I'll just grab all these slides. So these will basically walk you through, like how to get software to set up.

1056
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:06,000
I will say I think these are slightly outdated, but not in any significant way.

1057
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:20,650
Reports. So it might look a little bit different because this a lot of the screenshots of are so terrified, but there are no significant changes.

1058
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:26,850
At least from this slide deck. So basically you're going to go to Sotero.

1059
01:51:26,910 --> 01:51:31,200
You're going to set up a free account and that'll be a username and password

1060
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:36,210
you can put in any email does not have to be connected to U of M in any way.

1061
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:43,590
And there's like a set up wizard. So as you go through it, it'll be like, Do this now, do this now.

1062
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:47,580
So then you will be prompted to download the software.

1063
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:57,410
You can create your account and so terraform and then you're going to download the software and then once you have the software downloaded,

1064
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:03,340
oh, software is so slick. To do that, you have to it.

1065
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:05,260
So this is what the desktop looks like.

1066
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:12,700
I do a lot of teaching from this, so it's usually like very messy, but this is basically what the software looks like.

1067
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:17,230
But what you want to do is once you have the software downloaded, you're going to need.

1068
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:20,580
Connected to a super adored account we just created.

1069
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:21,960
So there there sink.

1070
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:29,880
Because then no matter where you are, you can be on like a library computer, an ecological ParaNorman, you can think nations in there.

1071
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:37,590
There's this little sink button up here and that will keep whatever you've added or removed or edited to a haircut,

1072
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:43,660
or it will be reflected in the desktop software. And so I've got you know, I won't go into details again.

1073
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:48,730
I'm just like telling you that this is a thing that you might want to look into and then we'll get back into the.

1074
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:55,380
Searching here. But again, I've got, like, screenshots and whatever.

1075
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:59,710
Right. Oh. And then the other thing, and this is like, oh, my gosh, this is straight up magic.

1076
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:04,170
This will it will like walk you through this.

1077
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:07,510
It will automatically recognize what browser you're using.

1078
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:15,429
And so as long as you're using Chrome and Firefox, I don't think that's the case.

1079
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:19,870
Or maybe I don't think they have a safari plug in.

1080
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:24,229
Forgot what they call connector. They all they all these tools have their own version of this.

1081
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:29,110
I think that there's also an Arab connector. They don't have one for Safari yet.

1082
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:40,490
I feel like it's in the works. Maybe it's been in the works for a long time, but what it will do, this is literally magic if I do the answer.

1083
01:53:41,080 --> 01:53:44,800
Survivors, cancer survivors. Get quick search and send all here.

1084
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:50,889
And I'm like, oh, you know what? This article, this is so important.

1085
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:54,040
I don't wanna lose this. This is a Web connector.

1086
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:58,090
So this is just one way that you get citations and tears of hero library.

1087
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:05,410
So the Web connector, this icon is tricky because the icon actually changes depending on what you're currently looking at.

1088
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:13,240
So like, if I wanted to actually save this slide that so hard to see, but it actually changed it to a little like prison thing.

1089
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:18,159
So if I hover you'll see it says save to go to a Google presentation for fun

1090
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:23,080
things let's save it so I can kind of I've got these like groups I can expand,

1091
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:28,300
right? So if, if you remember when I opened up my desktop, you can see I had all of these groups and libraries and things.

1092
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:32,100
I'm going to just save it to this test folder. Right.

1093
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:36,780
So it's like saving. One of my.

1094
01:54:42,180 --> 01:54:49,430
Weird repetition. Every guest should just automatically show up there.

1095
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:56,209
We can also do it and you'll see again the little icon change that now looks like one piece of paper with like the corner folder.

1096
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:59,500
Never recover. It's as safe as Otero go.

1097
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:04,130
So again, I can do that and I can pick whatever folder I want to put it into.

1098
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:08,360
I could also be like. I don't know. Something like this again.

1099
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:13,340
Another. I put my folder wherever I want to put it or if I'm looking at like.

1100
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:20,670
Let's see here. I just do this breastfeeding.

1101
01:55:22,410 --> 01:55:26,310
So Kara's amazing. Or just general websites?

1102
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:31,270
So like, you know, if there was something really important on this, you know, that matters.

1103
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:35,200
Let's say you wanted to keep this. You want to say this again.

1104
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:39,530
This is all I can't change. So Carol recognizes that this is a Web page.

1105
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:42,879
I can see that there. So that's the web.

1106
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:52,480
And that's like one way you can get stuff in there. And so I can go to my seven year old daughter blog.

1107
01:55:52,590 --> 01:55:57,960
And I have always loved what? Now.

1108
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:10,690
So I've got my test folder. That's where I was saving a bunch of stuff.

1109
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:19,850
The name was created to make it over here really quickly. Here we go.

1110
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:25,220
So there's HBO. That's the Google presentation I saved.

1111
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:31,190
And you'll see it grabbed the URL, grabbed whatever metadata I can type in and edit anything here.

1112
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:36,410
There's that article I grabbed or it's or pulled out as much as I could.

1113
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:42,560
Here's that other article that pulled in. And again, you can like it looks like this one was missing some of the metadata.

1114
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:49,090
Here's that CDC website. Right. So the Web and is just one way to get stuff in there and.

1115
01:56:50,490 --> 01:56:55,550
Connector. That's. So I just dumped those slides in there.

1116
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:59,220
I won't go into depth about the tarot, but it's a very cool tool.

1117
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:05,550
I'll play around with some stuff in the databases. That's why I kind of wanted to give you this little overview.

1118
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:12,140
There is just something weird going on. I think it's just my computer keeps click on the.

1119
01:57:13,190 --> 01:57:19,380
Very strange. All right, I'm going that. Library, search literature, search basics.

1120
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:22,690
Here we go. Since I have some of your topics,

1121
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:28,150
we use those because I think it's way more interesting than my like I don't even know what this research question is here.

1122
01:57:28,690 --> 01:57:36,550
So typically when you're searching for literature, we're going to go through these seven ish steps.

1123
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:41,840
I can have like an undergrad that's like the final three or reviewed articles from my assignment.

1124
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:49,220
We're going to go through the steps. I could also be working with a team that's working on a systematic review over the past two years.

1125
01:57:49,250 --> 01:57:53,390
It's a massive search project. We're also going to go through this in steps.

1126
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:57,770
It just really depends on like what the question is, why we're doing it.

1127
01:57:57,980 --> 01:58:01,250
We may come back to any one of these steps multiple times.

1128
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:08,000
We may spend a very long time like working on a big evidence synthesis project, like a systematic review, scoping review.

1129
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:15,130
We spend a very long time on this stuff. But this is basically the process that we're going to run through.

1130
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:21,240
So I might jump into this and this is the probably the most frustrating part of the process.

1131
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:24,640
We spent a really long time on this first step. The research question.

1132
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:29,340
You may have a brilliant research question, absolutely amazing.

1133
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:35,790
But it might not be the easiest thing or the best thing to like translate into a literature search.

1134
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:40,980
So I would say this is probably less the case with like graduate students.

1135
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,630
But sometimes people will come in and they're like, I want to do a systematic review on breast cancer.

1136
01:58:46,170 --> 01:58:49,380
I'm like, Well, that is not a thing we can do.

1137
01:58:49,950 --> 01:58:54,480
Because basically you're like breast cancer and we're going to get 500 million results.

1138
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:58,770
Like, there's not really a question with that. Like, what about breast cancer?

1139
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:03,060
So sometimes your research question, even if you're just interested in breast cancer,

1140
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:07,560
sometimes it's just too broad to do like an effective or an efficient search.

1141
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:10,020
So then we might have to come back to the drawing board.

1142
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:15,330
You know, we might do that big brother search, and I might send one way with 50 million results really skim through these.

1143
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:20,160
Is there an angle related to breast cancer that maybe you want to focus on a little bit more?

1144
01:59:21,990 --> 01:59:25,380
So this is usually the case when I grad students.

1145
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,420
Usually the question is amazing. I'm like, oh, my gosh, that's brilliant.

1146
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:35,760
How does the diagnosis of HIV during pregnancy impact the risk of IPV in low and middle income countries?

1147
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:39,180
I'm like that. Wow. That's a very important, significant question.

1148
01:59:39,190 --> 01:59:44,520
But like, maybe nobody has asked that question before because it is so focused.

1149
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:47,850
And I'm like, so should you. But yes, nobody's done this.

1150
01:59:47,850 --> 01:59:55,380
I'm doing it. So, like, that's really very exciting. But so sometimes if you want to, like, do a substantial search of the literature,

1151
01:59:55,410 --> 01:59:59,760
like there might not be much out there that hits kind of all angles of this question.

1152
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:04,229
So then sometimes you have to go back to the drawing board again where we kind of adjust

1153
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:07,379
the scope to the question where we started out too broad and that was too narrow.

1154
02:00:07,380 --> 02:00:11,460
So then maybe these are all just hypothetical questions and actually search them,

1155
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:17,370
maybe something like just general physical mental health outcomes after experiencing domestic violence, teen pregnancy.

1156
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:21,509
Maybe that's a more like answerable question for a review. What might that be?

1157
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:28,050
The exact question that you're interested in? But we might need to kind of cast a wider net to actually get some stuff for you to review.

1158
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:36,200
Another big question is kind of early. Early in the stage is like, look, why are you doing this?

1159
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:42,620
What is the purpose? And so this, I would say, is probably like the most common question I got.

1160
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:46,120
And I've done this faith before. Actually one the.

1161
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:55,229
I'll put it in that. I put an updated reading on this reading this week, but that's good.

1162
02:00:55,230 --> 02:01:00,930
Good. Yeah. This further reading. Yeah, this one. Is it the family of reviews highlighted by your family?

1163
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:04,259
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Grant and Booth are amazing.

1164
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:10,919
I think Booth published a newer kind of like 2016 or whatever, and I find the family of reviews is really,

1165
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:17,040
really helpful because it goes into so much detail, but it can be a little bit overwhelming because there's a lot of stuff in that article.

1166
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:23,820
So if you feel a little like overwhelmed looking at the family over a few times, I think it's just I don't think Grant worked on that one.

1167
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:31,410
I think it's just really. Yeah, yeah. This might be a good like just a quick intro because it's a very lightweight article.

1168
02:01:32,970 --> 02:01:39,810
And so I love it, I love it. I love it because they, they take these 14 review types.

1169
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:49,020
There are way more than 14, but these are just very frequently I mean, this is a little bit older and 15,009.

1170
02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:58,940
Yeah. So for this paper, what they did is they looked for review articles and then basically they said, well,

1171
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:04,010
what were the methods that those you know, if they said it was a systematic review, what methods did they use?

1172
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:08,270
They said it was a rapid review. What happens? But is that basically what this paper is?

1173
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:12,250
But I love it for this table, right? This is actually fine.

1174
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:23,450
This is a little bit easier to process than the bigger like the the booth family erm article goes into a little bit more depth.

1175
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:31,910
So it's kind of like part two. This one's nice for just like an intro like okay well what the heck is a critical review, super quick description.

1176
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:38,629
And then these are like the main areas where like how you do it will be different depending on what you're trying to do.

1177
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:43,880
And so that's why I like talk about it, you know, at this stage of the game, like, what is your question and then what?

1178
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:49,610
What are you going to do? Right. Some people will be like, you guys heard about systematic reviews.

1179
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:54,530
Everybody introduces everything. Everybody wants to do a systematic review.

1180
02:02:55,130 --> 02:02:59,360
It is just a tool for a very specific job.

1181
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:03,800
Sometimes people are like, Oh, that's the best recommenders.

1182
02:03:04,370 --> 02:03:08,210
Yeah, it's great for a very, very specific job.

1183
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:14,660
And so sometimes people have their question and they come to me and they're like, I'm trying to fit this question into the systematic review method.

1184
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:21,050
And I'm like, Yes, because that you need to do scoping review or you need to do a mapping.

1185
02:03:21,390 --> 02:03:27,410
Like that's why it's so painful. It doesn't quite fit, but I feel like systematic review is like a buzzword.

1186
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:30,410
Everybody wants to do one because it's it's a huge amount of work.

1187
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:35,059
And it is the, you know, if you think about like levels of evidence and evidence based health care,

1188
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:40,370
like usually systematic reviews are right there at the top is like a secondary data source,

1189
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:48,499
you know, like beyond that, like, like our cities for like primary studies, there are lots of tools out there.

1190
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:52,010
So depending on what your question is like, I always feel terrible when someone's like,

1191
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:55,910
Well, this is my question and this is what I'm trying to do with my review.

1192
02:03:56,420 --> 02:04:00,290
I want to do a systematic review and like, well, is that really the right tool for the job?

1193
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:03,800
It's I don't know how to change my question so that I can do a systematic review.

1194
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:10,569
What we. Wow. You know, like let's get the right tool because this is the question you're interested in.

1195
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:14,530
This is what you're passionate about. Let's not change the question to squeeze it into this method.

1196
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:23,050
So I would say number one question I get when I talk about these things, which the review type is the most publishable.

1197
02:04:23,380 --> 02:04:28,240
Everybody wants publications. Publications. They're all perfectly publishable.

1198
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:35,049
There are some factors that come into play like, well, if, you know, if you're invited by a journal to do a publication and they're like,

1199
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:38,740
We want you to do a systematic review, well then you're probably doing this kind of review.

1200
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:42,970
But like let reviews, I feel like people just kind of brush them aside.

1201
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:48,280
They're a very important tool for a very important job. It might be a brand new field of study.

1202
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:55,660
Like I worked with a nursing Ph.D. that was doing access to green spaces and parks like like ten years ago.

1203
02:04:56,110 --> 02:04:59,419
And there was just not a ton of research out there.

1204
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:05,260
And so we ended up looking at there was tons of stuff in like conference proceedings, but that's where all that it was.

1205
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:09,700
It was so new that there wasn't like a 20 year study out there on the thing.

1206
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:16,689
Like her specific question was very new and so she couldn't really do a systematic review or know there just wasn't much out there.

1207
02:05:16,690 --> 02:05:20,470
And so in those cases, like, let's just do a review of what's out there,

1208
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:28,600
we do a really kickass literature review and borrow from like the stuff that makes a scoping review or systematic review very exhaustive and rigorous.

1209
02:05:28,930 --> 02:05:35,330
We can do an amazing search, but then there's pieces of the methods that don't make sense depending on what your question is.

1210
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:40,210
So like, all of these are perfectly publishable. All right, rapid rise, hoping review, state of the Art Review.

1211
02:05:42,070 --> 02:05:43,149
So I love this table.

1212
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:48,820
The premise is like print it out because it really just gives you a quick description and then like, how are these things different?

1213
02:05:49,570 --> 02:05:54,130
So as far as like comprehensiveness, like if I think about stuff like in a spectrum,

1214
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:59,169
you know, one end like review, there's no like published guidelines.

1215
02:05:59,170 --> 02:06:03,070
Like if you publish a literature review, you could have just Google grab a couple articles.

1216
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:07,960
Great. That's a review. You can also do a really comprehensive search on the back end.

1217
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:15,970
Great review with no expectations when we get into kind of be more like capital, our research method,

1218
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:22,450
we call these evidence synthesis projects three key things like a meta analysis, a systematic review, a scoping review.

1219
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:26,500
There are published guidelines and there's like specific requirements for these projects.

1220
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:32,230
And the reason they have these very specific guidelines is that they're trying to address

1221
02:06:32,530 --> 02:06:37,770
all sorts of kind of weaknesses and doing a late review like primarily addressing bias,

1222
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:44,740
right? So there's very rigorous prescribed methods for how you do this because like you're going to bring bias into the project.

1223
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:52,600
The publishers are bringing bias into the things they publish, the databases are bringing bias into the things that they index.

1224
02:06:52,900 --> 02:07:01,150
So there's all sorts of bias that comes into all of this. And so the methods are really ways to kind of make sure you're seeing all the literature.

1225
02:07:01,150 --> 02:07:05,709
So it does talk about great literature, I'm sure, at some point, but like in like a systematic review,

1226
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:09,970
you want to find stuff that's not published and you're like, Let me find something I publish.

1227
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:13,480
We're going to look for like clinical trial registries.

1228
02:07:13,810 --> 02:07:19,690
So sometimes there are clinical trials that haven't published yet, but maybe, maybe they have data that's available.

1229
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:23,350
So if you have it, you're like, I'm interested in this intervention in this population.

1230
02:07:24,430 --> 02:07:29,770
Maybe there are trials that were started and terminated because of severe issues.

1231
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:33,670
And if you're trying to write a paper saying, Hey, this intervention is very effective,

1232
02:07:34,510 --> 02:07:38,170
you're not going to find an article that's like this trial was terminated.

1233
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:44,110
There's all sorts of adverse events going on. Well, then we're going to search clinical trial registries, right?

1234
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:47,980
That's not traditional in literature, but like we're trying to find everything on that topic.

1235
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:54,279
And so that kind of gets around a publication bias, right? You're not going to see a lot of publications, only negative findings or things like that.

1236
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:59,770
So, you know, those evidence synthesis projects typically like meta analysis,

1237
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:05,610
scoping review, systematic review, those are kind of the three heavy hitters.

1238
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:09,670
You're going to have guidelines like GBI during a break institute or like Cochrane

1239
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:13,330
will actually have like a handbook or a manual to guide you through the process.

1240
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:21,580
And again, very specific tool for a very specific job. So that's something we'll talk about early, early on in the process.

1241
02:08:22,390 --> 02:08:25,510
The next thing to think about, kind of where do we want to search for these things?

1242
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:28,780
Like sometimes people come in with a question, Oh, what was the question?

1243
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:35,920
It was such a good question, but it was impossible to search. It was like, Oh, what was the question?

1244
02:08:36,190 --> 02:08:41,620
Like how how do different multi organizational coalitions to.

1245
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:46,320
Community. And they wanted to search Poland for that. I'm like that.

1246
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:50,640
You're not going to find articles that are linked. This is how we define community.

1247
02:08:50,670 --> 02:08:52,520
So like for that one, it's like, you know what?

1248
02:08:52,530 --> 02:08:59,030
Maybe we do a Google search for like a handful coalitions that you're interested in and then we dig through the about US section and,

1249
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:02,820
and see if there's a general, you know, speaking to how they're defining community.

1250
02:09:03,090 --> 02:09:04,649
So like databases.

1251
02:09:04,650 --> 02:09:11,100
Journalist That's probably not the right resource or like I want to learn about the history of the teach back method and public health.

1252
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:14,880
Like, I'm probably not going to find like a research article on that.

1253
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:21,360
It could be like a text book or a book, right? So making sure we're like using the right resource to answer your question.

1254
02:09:21,570 --> 02:09:25,410
And sometimes that's not straightforward and that's absolutely something that I can help you with.

1255
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:32,069
Things like great literature, maybe, you know, patients going to trials, policy papers, data sets.

1256
02:09:32,070 --> 02:09:38,870
That could be another thing. We can help you out. Actually, talking to people is super helpful and I feel like this is often overlooked.

1257
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,970
So like, you're typically working with like a mentor on your project.

1258
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:46,710
Talk to them, what are the new words? And usually you'll have a topic in mind.

1259
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:51,600
Erin Cancer. Well, carcinoma, neoplasm tumor, tumor, breast cancer.

1260
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:56,400
They'll probably know that like lingo and all the synonyms that are like most important to include in a lit review.

1261
02:09:56,910 --> 02:10:01,170
They'll also know, like, this is the journal this you need to read.

1262
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:05,280
This journal is like this is important to know because then we're going to make sure we're searching that journal.

1263
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:11,860
They may also know, like these are the experts. So now we're going to look at the publications by those experts and see like,

1264
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:14,670
okay, what, what are other keywords they use or where are they publishing?

1265
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:22,530
So talking to people can actually be really informative for your like review the I kind of all that stuff.

1266
02:10:22,770 --> 02:10:27,299
All right. That's like my favorite. So I'm actually going to like we're not we're going to ignore this one.

1267
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:30,930
I'm actually going to do this with some of your questions. Did you do.

1268
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:37,080
So social supports help behavior racism impact interactions in the health care.

1269
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:43,050
So what are we going to do? Like this is not really like a question that's basically I just grabbed a bunch of terms.

1270
02:10:43,950 --> 02:10:52,079
Sometimes you come into a lit review with like a formal research question, you know, and it could be a very structured research question.

1271
02:10:52,080 --> 02:11:00,030
I don't know if, like, I'm less familiar with like public health, like structuring, like in the clinical area, they have things like people questions.

1272
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:05,700
P i. So that's like population intervention, control, comparison and outcome.

1273
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:12,030
Sometimes words like PCC, which are like population contract and concept, there's spider questions.

1274
02:11:12,180 --> 02:11:15,300
There are lots of ways that research questions can be structured.

1275
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:23,850
It's nice if you have a question that's structured like that because it forces you to think about these kind of big main concepts in your question.

1276
02:11:24,240 --> 02:11:28,560
We don't have that here because I was just typing notes, but like, let's let's, you know,

1277
02:11:28,620 --> 02:11:34,380
take the next step here and boil your question or topic down to the main, the main areas.

1278
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:41,160
So I see and I don't know if all of these as you were talking I don't know if all of these fall into the same question.

1279
02:11:41,490 --> 02:11:45,480
So you can tell me like, no, get rid of that. But like, oh, okay.

1280
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:48,870
So like racism, I'm going to pull that up to the top. We'll have that.

1281
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:53,480
Now, that being concept one. Social supports, health behavior.

1282
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:59,690
Those kind of feel like separate things health, communication, impact, interaction, health care systems,

1283
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:04,070
health communications, where people just maybe will just start here for now, for simplicity's sake.

1284
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:08,250
Tell me a little bit about social supports. What does that mean? Here's an example.

1285
02:12:09,060 --> 02:12:12,650
Yeah. So there's like a. And that's what important.

1286
02:12:12,710 --> 02:12:18,610
But really it's because that family, friends and community members with adolescents.

1287
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:25,660
Providing their emotional or some sort of. I need to.

1288
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:37,640
It is like. Feeling a loved one in.

1289
02:12:39,870 --> 02:12:42,120
That works. And then what behavior are you interested in?

1290
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:50,510
Like any health behaviors, specific health behaviors, so specifically how they interact with primary care.

1291
02:12:50,610 --> 02:12:54,680
So I'm going to. Let's go back to the.

1292
02:12:55,950 --> 02:13:00,750
I say nutrition. That's such a hard one to get a read on.

1293
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:09,580
Yes. That's good. That's a good start, I think.

1294
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:17,139
So I might, for this question, start out with a super fun Z.

1295
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:24,370
Let's just use second row. So I think for your question, I'd probably do like pub med psych and, and.

1296
02:13:24,850 --> 02:13:28,420
This. Thank you.

1297
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:35,400
So basically what we're doing here is what we have here. We're taking your questions and we're going to boil it down into the main concept.

1298
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:40,740
So, for example, I like domestic violence, pregnancy, mental health for years.

1299
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:44,220
We're going to just simplify it a bit racism, social supports and health behavior.

1300
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:48,720
The next step is to think about synonyms.

1301
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:52,250
Right. So in this example, I did domestic violence, pregnancy and mental health.

1302
02:13:52,670 --> 02:13:57,740
There could be an article like I could dump those into a problem that and I find some relevant stuff to be great.

1303
02:13:58,430 --> 02:14:03,320
But just because of the way, you know, databases work in language work,

1304
02:14:03,590 --> 02:14:12,590
there could be an article that has something like impact of IPV on maternal depression.

1305
02:14:13,190 --> 02:14:17,380
Like that would be relevant, but it uses slightly different language, right?

1306
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:21,470
So we take a minute, you know, boil it down to your main concepts.

1307
02:14:22,770 --> 02:14:27,570
And then we want to think about synonyms. So like family or friends which supports help behavior.

1308
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:31,140
Maybe we just physical activity, nutrition just to keep it easy.

1309
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:36,420
So we've got three concepts potentially have multiple synonyms within each concept.

1310
02:14:36,810 --> 02:14:43,470
And then what I'm going to do is within the concept I'll have like social support or family or friends or teacher.

1311
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:49,680
This is where bullying operators come in health behavior or physical activity or nutrition.

1312
02:14:50,430 --> 02:14:56,970
Then I'm going to combine those concepts with and so I want concept one and concept two and concept three.

1313
02:14:59,230 --> 02:15:06,290
Something like this. But I know.

1314
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:13,200
Here we go. All right. So. So to do these side by side.

1315
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:28,420
All right. So this is not going to be an intuitive way to search, but it's very effective.

1316
02:15:28,450 --> 02:15:31,780
It's very efficient. It's called control vocabulary.

1317
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:36,010
And so partner has control vocabulary. You're probably more familiar with it.

1318
02:15:36,010 --> 02:15:41,820
Mesh Medical Subject Headings. Second Focus control vocabulary.

1319
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:49,660
All control vocabulary. Basically, the control vocabulary is an official tag for a concept in a database.

1320
02:15:50,170 --> 02:15:53,920
So it's one way that we can search. So this is just keyword.

1321
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:57,130
So I'm going to run this search just for fun. This will run it.

1322
02:15:57,880 --> 02:16:05,200
I'm going to click on a record that comes up. So I did racism. So that's looking for the word racism anywhere so it could show up in the title.

1323
02:16:05,590 --> 02:16:09,219
It might be like the Center for Racism and Health, right?

1324
02:16:09,220 --> 02:16:14,709
It could be like an author affiliation. It could be like racism in health care.

1325
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:18,520
It could be like the name of a title. It could show up as an author.

1326
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:22,390
Supplied keyword could show up as a keyword somewhere in the abstract.

1327
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:27,819
So that's keyword searching. But what I want to show you guys is something called control vocabulary.

1328
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:34,300
Search for your subject search. So what happens is this article gets added to like invoke.

1329
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:38,230
Same thing with fun. That citation gets added. So now same process.

1330
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:45,370
But then on the back end, someone will read this article and they're going to assign tags to the article.

1331
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:52,600
So these are usually unique tags that are very clearly defined for that specific database.

1332
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:57,730
So I can scroll down here and I can see subjects like this a little bit bigger.

1333
02:17:00,490 --> 02:17:03,940
Here we go. Subjects of these are all, I think, incitement.

1334
02:17:03,940 --> 02:17:09,160
Both are called descriptors. Of course, they're all called something different, but they would simply work the same way.

1335
02:17:09,970 --> 02:17:16,660
So I can see just a glance that this article is about curriculum, medical education, medical students, racism,

1336
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:23,790
teachers, blacks, which is a very unfortunate subject that again, we have, but they have not responded.

1337
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:29,680
Communication skills, discrimination and discrimination. But maybe they want to grab that as a potential synonym.

1338
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:39,010
Right. So what we can do is we can build a search using these subject headings instead of just relying on keywords.

1339
02:17:39,430 --> 02:17:44,540
Keywords can be kind of messy. Like, for example, I could be interested in literacy, right?

1340
02:17:44,540 --> 02:17:55,150
And I can type in literacy is a keyword. I might get articles that are like the HPV immunization clinic was run out of the high schools literacy lab.

1341
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:01,959
That article is not about literacy, but it will pop up because that keyword just showed up somewhere in that article.

1342
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:07,060
Once it's indexed, nobody's going to say literacy, Internet literacy, and I'm not sure about that.

1343
02:18:07,490 --> 02:18:12,500
So keywords just pull keywords up anywhere to control vocabulary.

1344
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:16,989
You're really precise. So to get to it, that's going to look a little bit different.

1345
02:18:16,990 --> 02:18:23,530
If you've got the screen full size and I'm going to go to this, the saurus up here,

1346
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:29,139
it's usually called like an index pub band is called mesh signal to signal subject

1347
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:34,120
headings but in second so I'm going to go up here to this and I'm going to say,

1348
02:18:34,120 --> 02:18:37,570
hey, is there an official tag?

1349
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:42,250
And we know there is because we just saw it. I'm going to go for racism. I'm going to browse.

1350
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:44,260
I can scroll down here.

1351
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:51,100
These are all things that are either somewhat related, the keyword matches, or if it's just an alphabetical order, which it looks like this one is.

1352
02:18:51,730 --> 02:18:57,970
But that looks like the racism I want. So I'm going to click on this one to learn a little bit more about this tag.

1353
02:18:58,870 --> 02:19:03,330
Need to. This is the scope note.

1354
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:07,580
So this tells me that how I can vote defines it.

1355
02:19:08,390 --> 02:19:13,129
These control vocabulary are also often organized in a hierarchical structure,

1356
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:20,060
meaning that they're usually like a big, broad concept, and then it like boils down to narrower and narrower concepts.

1357
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:23,570
And there might be a couple different branches visually.

1358
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:26,540
They don't display it that way in ASCO databases.

1359
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:33,620
But we can see here broader terms of racism falls under racial and ethnic ethnic attitudes, which with that might be of interest.

1360
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:39,230
And then under racism there are narrower terms. So I have internalized racism.

1361
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:43,520
Systemic racism and anti-racism. Oh, wait, no, this one not there.

1362
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:51,710
Here we go. The nice thing is they compose. They also give you related terms like, oh, anti-racism, anti-Semitism.

1363
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:56,040
So, like, we, you know, we might want to pull in some of these also, like, ooh,

1364
02:19:56,040 --> 02:20:01,140
look down here, racial bias, racial disparities, racial justice, racial poor like you.

1365
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:06,799
These all look like very relevant terms. So what I can do is I can say, yes, I can vote.

1366
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:08,060
I will take racism.

1367
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:19,350
I think we probably want the is probably anti-racism I'm not sure I just for the sake of time I might grab just like a couple of these.

1368
02:20:21,970 --> 02:20:24,150
Something like the racial trauma. Right.

1369
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:32,740
And so because this is in the same concept, bubble concept one, I want to combine all of these before I want any of them.

1370
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:36,310
I want articles that are about racism or racial trauma or racial justice.

1371
02:20:37,650 --> 02:20:49,170
That click ad with four. I also document that everything I search in a separate word document, Google document.

1372
02:20:50,310 --> 02:20:54,900
Because sometimes a database crashes. Sometimes you only have a few minutes to search.

1373
02:20:56,150 --> 02:21:00,180
You'll be able to pick up where you left off as you craft your search.

1374
02:21:00,330 --> 02:21:04,230
Sometimes you run your search and like, Oh, this is a hot mess. Oh, man, these are perfect.

1375
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:06,240
A lot of stuff I don't want anyone added.

1376
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:14,550
Some of these search strings can get really long too, and it's a lot easier to edit their instead of this, like a little box or like, little line.

1377
02:21:15,390 --> 02:21:22,260
So I always document my search and if you plan on publishing a literature review, you just like capital are research.

1378
02:21:24,940 --> 02:21:32,800
This is like systematically stopping review. You need to document everything you've done and properly rationale for why you did it.

1379
02:21:33,220 --> 02:21:37,800
So you need to say what database you search, what platform you search through. Exactly what keywords did you find?

1380
02:21:37,810 --> 02:21:41,140
How many results did you get? What the new search you got to track all of that.

1381
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:45,130
So that's our concept, one concept to social support.

1382
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:50,290
And I'm not even going to pay attention to concept one. I'm done. I'm going to just jump ahead and we're going to look for concept you.

1383
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:54,950
So social support. I feel I can go. Do you have a look at that?

1384
02:21:55,790 --> 02:22:03,559
Like there is a social support. Yes, I'm going to I can click here, but I actually want to click on the record so I can see the note.

1385
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:06,140
I can see if there's higher or lower level things I want to include.

1386
02:22:07,430 --> 02:22:16,040
Yes, we want social support that falls under this big brought us social behavior that sounds probably way too big, but there are no lower level terms.

1387
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:24,199
But we do have these related terms. So maybe little family relations, friendship, significant other social interaction,

1388
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:27,530
social networking, if you see anything that's got like a plus sign.

1389
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:36,959
That just means there are lower level terms under it. So I can click on that social interaction so I can post which remember that I clicked

1390
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:40,170
on all those other things so I don't have to worry about it and reminders for me.

1391
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:46,700
But these are the narrower terms, right? And we might not need all of the trademark teasing that integration.

1392
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:53,670
Maybe not, but let's just go with what we've already clicked on, because I think we got some family and friends and stuff in that mix.

1393
02:22:53,910 --> 02:22:57,170
I mean, we would spend much more time. You in a crappy.

1394
02:22:58,020 --> 02:23:02,010
Real time. So that's my savvy concept of behavior.

1395
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:06,170
Okay, let's see what you got. So I give up. I'm not even paying attention to the results from that.

1396
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:13,060
I just want to see. I worked my concept three o that health behavior there's actually a heading for it.

1397
02:23:14,050 --> 02:23:18,280
Great health behavior scope. No. Yes, narrower terms.

1398
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:25,780
So this looks like it's providing maybe specific health behaviors like healthy eating, hygiene, preventative health behavior.

1399
02:23:26,380 --> 02:23:31,209
If I'm lazy and I see there's lower level terms and I don't want to feel like I can just do this,

1400
02:23:31,210 --> 02:23:35,470
explode that health, I can just grab whatever's underneath that term.

1401
02:23:35,470 --> 02:23:38,950
Also, you know, maybe we want safe sex, maybe self care.

1402
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:46,840
When I was active, living exercised. That's part of it.

1403
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:51,249
All right. And I just add, all right, I could switch that again.

1404
02:23:51,250 --> 02:23:54,690
But because these are all that same concept I want to use over.

1405
02:23:56,070 --> 02:24:00,570
Again. I haven't even run that search yet. So.

1406
02:24:01,710 --> 02:24:08,740
Two. Hands up. Three, two. Then I'm going to. Combine all the two and three and you go to advanced search notes.

1407
02:24:08,750 --> 02:24:10,190
We're going to see those little search boxes.

1408
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:19,970
I could absolutely copy one and two and three, but I'm not going through I mean, you could could absolutely get the same results about three one.

1409
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:25,340
And I do this separately and that one. So I'm just going to feed my search history.

1410
02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:29,150
So most databases will have a search history that would show you why I'm doing this.

1411
02:24:29,190 --> 02:24:33,650
Just a second. So there's my first concept. There's my second concept.

1412
02:24:34,920 --> 02:24:48,610
My third concept. So unfortunately EPSCO does always clear this out before you start playing around with combining stuff in the search history.

1413
02:24:48,610 --> 02:24:52,640
Otherwise it will like all in in youth affairs. So I can take a.

1414
02:24:53,490 --> 02:24:58,020
And see, like, okay. If you're like, oh my gosh, 151,000 results, that's okay.

1415
02:24:58,080 --> 02:25:02,490
Because we're going to combine that's just one concept. We're going to combine it with two other concepts.

1416
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:06,630
So I can say I want to, and that's my racism.

1417
02:25:07,310 --> 02:25:14,299
My social supports and my whole behavior. And then I want to search and know what's nice.

1418
02:25:14,300 --> 02:25:18,020
Like, all of this is, like, perfect. I couldn't have planned this any better, so.

1419
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:26,360
So we got one result right now, and I can scroll down here and kind of see what this looks like, right?

1420
02:25:27,580 --> 02:25:30,819
But this is like what I'm talking about, that really narrow question.

1421
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:38,020
And it could be there's a few kind of next steps. One, we could go back and we can add more terms to each concept,

1422
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:42,400
which I probably would because I feel like I feel like there's going to be stuff out there on this topic.

1423
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:46,840
But this is actually a perfect example where you're like, Oh my gosh, just one result.

1424
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:52,479
Well, it could be that there's not a lot with racism, a family or something.

1425
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:55,720
So maybe I do like racism and health behavior.

1426
02:25:56,260 --> 02:26:03,549
And so you're out your search box. So when you have them split up like that, it just gives you another layer to like, okay, well, one, two and three.

1427
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:05,790
I didn't get much, but maybe I look at just one and two.

1428
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:11,290
Well, let's just see what two and three gets me then you kind of get a better feel for like, what's out there.

1429
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:16,720
So this one was what to enforce. This is racism in health behavior, right?

1430
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:21,760
So it's like services for juveniles is emotional. And so you can kind of see things bolded.

1431
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:27,700
You can also add a page options and expand what are those details?

1432
02:26:28,210 --> 02:26:32,050
And that will open any abstracts so you don't have to like click on every single thing,

1433
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:40,870
but you can kind of see anything like bolded in this might be where we go through and we're like, Oh man, let's see.

1434
02:26:40,870 --> 02:26:45,730
Probably you can also see we get books, we get dissertations, we get a mix of things.

1435
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:51,220
Also academic journals. You know, so we might find some other keywords.

1436
02:26:51,700 --> 02:26:56,740
This is that like iterative process. That is super frustrating to people.

1437
02:26:57,100 --> 02:27:00,910
But I search all day, every day and I haven't yet.

1438
02:27:00,940 --> 02:27:04,480
It has never happened where I do one search and I'm like, I'm done.

1439
02:27:04,570 --> 02:27:08,560
It's never happened. And so that's what gets really frustrating for people.

1440
02:27:09,460 --> 02:27:11,950
I would say you probably don't want to like, okay,

1441
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:15,640
let's start from scratch and I'm going to build a completely different search and I'm going to build it.

1442
02:27:15,940 --> 02:27:21,130
What you want to do is like, take what we've done and we're going to edit it like, okay, well, how do the results look?

1443
02:27:22,970 --> 02:27:26,540
Doo doo doo doo doo. Oh, I guess I did expect that promise, but.

1444
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:31,720
But I did. I will prove it. Do, do, do, do.

1445
02:27:32,050 --> 02:27:35,550
Here we go. Organize your search.

1446
02:27:35,660 --> 02:27:39,580
Here we go. So that means the north, right? So that's the same concepts.

1447
02:27:39,580 --> 02:27:43,240
We want orders because I want either of them and for different concepts.

1448
02:27:44,110 --> 02:27:49,129
This is basically what your search looks like. It's parentheses kind of work, like order of operations and math.

1449
02:27:49,130 --> 02:27:52,300
So that's like one concept in the second concept.

1450
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:56,440
And third concept, I always capitalize my ends,

1451
02:27:56,470 --> 02:28:02,860
cause some databases require that you do it and if you do lowercase it ignores them and will

1452
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:08,290
automatically and your things when if you like wanted or needed lowercase for and then the end the.

1453
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:12,870
Doing the exact opposite of what you want to just always capitalize your ends and worse.

1454
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:18,350
This is typically like when you're documenting a search strategy. Like for me personally, this is what it looks like.

1455
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:21,389
This is the database, these are the concepts. This is worth buying them.

1456
02:28:21,390 --> 02:28:28,140
This is the date that I searched the English language limit so that typically the stuff you're documenting, this is where we are now.

1457
02:28:28,290 --> 02:28:31,530
And evaluate in your search results, how many results did you get?

1458
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:37,080
Did you get a bajillion results? Is that expected? Is that something that's been, you know, researched forever?

1459
02:28:37,470 --> 02:28:40,800
You're like, okay, a bajillion results is probably not helpful to me.

1460
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:44,670
Welcome back to my search. And I didn't get too many results.

1461
02:28:44,670 --> 02:28:47,880
It could be. I need to add another concept.

1462
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,480
I need to think about ways to limit it. Maybe I just look at the last ten years.

1463
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:56,730
I know that's always the go to and I'm helping them with like a scoping review or like, oh, 5000 results.

1464
02:28:57,030 --> 02:29:00,660
Let's just look at the last few years. I'm like, Well, hold on.

1465
02:29:01,110 --> 02:29:04,200
What if there's a really important article that was published three years ago?

1466
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:12,660
So in those cases, like how to keep that date limit, it's like a last resort because it's super limiting for something like a scoping review.

1467
02:29:14,010 --> 02:29:16,540
But you know, maybe for your project when I think about that one.

1468
02:29:16,540 --> 02:29:22,050
A What are your objectives when you trying to do maybe just looking at the last five years is totally reasonable for your project.

1469
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:29,010
Maybe, you know, at a concept, maybe you switched your ends and orders, which happens often.

1470
02:29:29,610 --> 02:29:34,080
You know, maybe there's an error in your search. So there's a lot of like running the search.

1471
02:29:34,140 --> 02:29:37,680
Let's look through the results. Maybe we only get one result. Okay.

1472
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:40,680
Well, we know there's probably more than one article on this topic.

1473
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:48,600
Let's sift through some, like, racism terms. Oh, maybe I just need racial, maybe I need African-American, maybe I need, you know,

1474
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:54,210
some other turns to my concept to broaden the search or make it a little bit bigger.

1475
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:59,040
So this is where it's iterative. This is where people get very frustrated, but like, it's just part of the process.

1476
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:03,840
You're going to run, edit your search a little bit, rerun it, edit your search.

1477
02:30:03,930 --> 02:30:06,300
And so there's not a magic number we're working towards.

1478
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:11,490
I think that's like the number three most popular question, like what's the right number of results?

1479
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:21,450
So it all depends. So like if we're doing a systematic review, I usually have a threshold like I record search and that's usually where we start.

1480
02:30:21,450 --> 02:30:27,239
And if I'm focusing way more than 3000 results, I'm like, that might be the right answer for the question,

1481
02:30:27,240 --> 02:30:30,660
but for feasibility, I want you to be able to complete this review.

1482
02:30:31,590 --> 02:30:36,360
We're going to have to like focus the question a little bit more, not the 3000, some magic number,

1483
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:43,469
but I just know once you hit more than 3000, those projects can take like 18 to 24 months to complete.

1484
02:30:43,470 --> 02:30:50,820
I'm like, I want you to stay within that time frame because that's a lot of stuff to train and maybe find your results the right answer.

1485
02:30:50,940 --> 02:30:56,490
So there's not really a right answer. It depends on what your topic is, what you're trying to do with that,

1486
02:30:56,520 --> 02:31:02,180
and how thorough and exhaustive do you need to be as far as like skimming through titles and abstracts?

1487
02:31:02,190 --> 02:31:06,300
Usually like 3 to 500 is a nice number and you can kind of just think through these,

1488
02:31:06,990 --> 02:31:10,500
you know, if you're seeing 10,000 results, that's like I'll come back to the drawing board.

1489
02:31:10,800 --> 02:31:18,600
If it's for an actual like evidence synthesis project, 3000 is kind of the upper limit, but not that it means that that's a great number.

1490
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:22,890
It's like I just like completing the project, so there's not really a right number,

1491
02:31:23,490 --> 02:31:26,520
but you'll know when it's like most of the results are pretty relevant.

1492
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:31,860
I'm kind of seeing things that I would expect to see. That's usually when, you know, you're kind of like, No, done.

1493
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:38,830
So what we had to start earlier we were talking about the hurt riding and that more here.

1494
02:31:38,850 --> 02:31:46,250
Let's start with the results of your paper. Very careful in the Journal article like that level of review is going to be more like that.

1495
02:31:46,280 --> 02:31:49,870
An overly specific question. Mr. You're already, you know what I mean?

1496
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:53,130
Or like just sort of making sure you have the space covering to your question.

1497
02:31:53,580 --> 02:32:01,620
This is more like that big picture. It's not like scholars or researchers or researchers like you need to master the topic.

1498
02:32:01,710 --> 02:32:07,770
So just I just wanted to just because these two sessions are kind of together like this is a much bigger piece.

1499
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:15,080
But yeah, this is like you go through some of these processes to like find the updated articles through meandering Google Scholar.

1500
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:19,680
You've got to know the topic very I'd like to so yeah absolutely.

1501
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:26,670
So we can kind of make I could have someone with the same exact research question like it could be that undergrad looking for three

1502
02:32:26,670 --> 02:32:31,740
peer reviewed articles or it could be someone that just needs to find like clinical guidelines or it could be a team doing it.

1503
02:32:31,750 --> 02:32:35,340
The same exact question. The searches are going to be completely different.

1504
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:40,260
The methods for kind of answering it will look very, very different. So and it's not something we would ever want.

1505
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:46,110
You guys are going to be librarians, right? We that's what we're here to help you with that process so we can kind of figure out,

1506
02:32:46,110 --> 02:32:50,310
like, what's the right mix of things to search for, the right way to search.

1507
02:32:50,490 --> 02:32:53,670
We can help you with that. But this is good for like I'm just starting out.

1508
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:57,180
I want to see what's out there. So this will kind of get you started.

1509
02:32:57,180 --> 02:33:01,979
But as far as like evidence synthesis publishing that reviews your typically if you can even go through

1510
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:07,020
like the Cochrane handbook and it will recommend cooperate with the librarian on this project,

1511
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:13,920
but for something like this you can absolutely go off on your own. I have some people that are like very excited searching and they're like this.

1512
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:17,909
They love it. So how about it? But I'm here to help you with any of this stuff.

1513
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:22,980
Also, some of the things you can kind of play around with our phrase searching.

1514
02:33:24,150 --> 02:33:34,290
And so that's basically where you use multi if you've got a multi word phrase like heart attack men that have sex with men like multi,

1515
02:33:34,290 --> 02:33:36,810
it has to be a commonly occurring phrase.

1516
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:45,150
But what we can do is play around with these double quotes and it forces the database to keep those two words together.

1517
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:50,969
Right? Some databases automatically turn things into phrases, some don'ts.

1518
02:33:50,970 --> 02:33:59,190
A pub med, for example, does not. So if I do the search in pothead, it will do pubmed that actually I will show you up on my does.

1519
02:33:59,190 --> 02:34:07,790
It does a lot of stuff. Sometimes it's helpful, sometimes it's not. So I can say, hey, I want to search our home to search heart attack.

1520
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:13,540
So I typed those two words in there, just loose PubMed.

1521
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:18,530
There's a bunch of stuff you can actually see. This is called search details. You can see what it does on the back end.

1522
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:22,130
This is all this extra stuff is called automatic term mapping.

1523
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:29,750
Super library, nerdy stuff. But it's very helpful to kind of know that it does stuff you don't really know have to do know how,

1524
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:35,510
but it in one way is going to take the word heart and it's going to look for that anywhere.

1525
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:39,529
It's also going to pull in like a bunch of other stuff, like Heart in all fields.

1526
02:34:39,530 --> 02:34:46,510
So I can have Dr. Jim Heart is the last name. It will pull that up and then it's going to look for the word attack anywhere.

1527
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:52,099
So it could be Dr. Jim Hart doing research on the asthma attacks that will come

1528
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:56,090
up in this results set because it's just pulling those two keywords up anywhere.

1529
02:34:56,750 --> 02:35:01,880
It's also doing a bunch of extra stuff with MASH, but I will with that could be a whole nother hour long class.

1530
02:35:03,260 --> 02:35:07,850
But then if I take this phrase double quotes around it.

1531
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:15,920
And we were on it didn't do it, number one.

1532
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:22,059
Turns off all this automatic turn mapping the number two. It's going to look for heart attack as an exact phrase.

1533
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:25,390
And you kind of see that it really pulls the results down.

1534
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:32,350
So that's one thing you can kind of play around with. Phrase searching can also play around with limits.

1535
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:37,270
Depending on what you're looking for in a lot of databases, it will give you in public.

1536
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:42,790
For example, you need to do come over here and you'll see they haven't listed as article type,

1537
02:35:42,790 --> 02:35:45,790
which this I find is a little bit messy because it kind of blurs.

1538
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:51,370
Research method of research design with publication type, it's kind of like an all in one.

1539
02:35:52,150 --> 02:35:58,150
But like, let's say I want to find articles about her, I want to find a meta analysis about heart attacks and click on this.

1540
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:01,900
And that's like one way to like filter and refine your results.

1541
02:36:02,350 --> 02:36:06,260
If I look at. Here we go.

1542
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:11,050
So you can do the same kind of thing in a lot of these databases.

1543
02:36:11,710 --> 02:36:15,140
You know, maybe I want to only look at a certain date range.

1544
02:36:15,430 --> 02:36:19,240
Right. So a lot of these databases would give me because these like filters or limits.

1545
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:25,030
Maybe I want to look for academic journals published since 2013.

1546
02:36:26,350 --> 02:36:30,190
Maybe I'm only interested in English language.

1547
02:36:30,670 --> 02:36:34,870
Right. So these are just ways to kind of filter your results, focus them a little bit more.

1548
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:43,510
And it's a pretty much all databases will give you like some variation on these limits to play around with.

1549
02:36:45,010 --> 02:36:48,750
Sometimes, and this is all part of that iterative review advise process.

1550
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:56,589
Sometimes you're like in, for example, that like community definition coalition question like this is a really great important question,

1551
02:36:56,590 --> 02:37:00,010
but like I don't think PubMed is the right resource.

1552
02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:08,979
So it could just be a mismatch of resources. And then the final step of the process, if like him, you have a way to like track.

1553
02:37:08,980 --> 02:37:12,100
We've spent all this time crafting your search and selecting articles.

1554
02:37:12,430 --> 02:37:17,560
I want to make sure that you haven't lost your work. You come back to it, you can find the articles you can and run the search.

1555
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:19,899
There's a lot of ways that you can do this,

1556
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:25,090
and I'm happy to like work with you one on one because it's and there's just like a million different ways you can do this.

1557
02:37:25,090 --> 02:37:29,110
And it really depends on, like, your personal workflow. Are you collaborating?

1558
02:37:29,110 --> 02:37:32,850
What tool are you using? This is where I publish literature review.

1559
02:37:33,460 --> 02:37:37,750
So there's all sorts of tools and strategies to kind of help you with this one.

1560
02:37:38,680 --> 02:37:42,790
Since all of you guys search that, I'm going to ask you guys haven't my scba.

1561
02:37:44,250 --> 02:37:48,530
You heard of this? Yeah, we talked about that. Oh, awesome.

1562
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:51,990
Yeah. So I highly recommend setting this up.

1563
02:37:52,350 --> 02:37:53,429
It's also important.

1564
02:37:53,430 --> 02:38:00,810
It's like all connected on the back end to, like, science TV and, you know, all the NIH funding stuff all kind of connected on the back end.

1565
02:38:02,440 --> 02:38:06,040
If you don't have one set up, that's good. You can ignore this thing now.

1566
02:38:06,190 --> 02:38:11,409
They used to have their own log in and then they retired it and now they do like a third party log in.

1567
02:38:11,410 --> 02:38:20,170
So like we used to be able to use your Facebook log in, which I don't know why you would or Google or Night or I.R.A. comments or Orchid.

1568
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:26,800
So you've got all these options, but you can do Google and it will connect to your Umas account,

1569
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:33,070
or you can actually go into like institutional log in and then look for University of Michigan.

1570
02:38:33,070 --> 02:38:38,740
It works exactly the same way because your your email is the Google account.

1571
02:38:38,740 --> 02:38:47,500
So it will work exactly the same way. So you create your my SBI account using whatever third party logging you want.

1572
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:51,190
And so what will happen is the.

1573
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:59,170
This is what it looks like up here when you're locked in. This dashboard is kind of like where all your stuff goes.

1574
02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:07,140
And so if you do have, like, managed funding, like, you'll need to keep your bibliography updated so you can add your own publications here.

1575
02:39:07,170 --> 02:39:11,680
That's a whole separate thing. What we can talk about later, right?

1576
02:39:11,750 --> 02:39:17,829
You can add publications to your mind, holography. Um, you can kind of ignore this recent activity.

1577
02:39:17,830 --> 02:39:22,120
It used to be really helpful because they put your PubMed searches here.

1578
02:39:22,450 --> 02:39:26,109
So as long as you were logged in, if you're like, Oh, I did that really good search.

1579
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:29,709
I mean, hopefully you would never be in that situation because you're documenting research that he's around.

1580
02:39:29,710 --> 02:39:38,490
But it used to provide you with any search that you ran in the last six months, but now they got rid of it when they rolled out new PubMed.

1581
02:39:38,530 --> 02:39:41,740
Wanted to have a 2021 I think January.

1582
02:39:43,390 --> 02:39:49,960
Yeah. So it's now it just keeps your searches, which I'm like, that's not helpful at all.

1583
02:39:50,110 --> 02:39:54,489
Yeah, I'm saying just kind of ignore that you can save searches.

1584
02:39:54,490 --> 02:40:00,760
So this is something that is especially helpful when you're working on these long term projects so we can collaborate,

1585
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:06,370
crafted, beautiful cover that search and then you can save it and it works.

1586
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:10,240
You can set it up. So then we'll just send you any new articles that match that search.

1587
02:40:10,570 --> 02:40:15,910
So like you may have done a really great web review, thrown up whatever for an assignment,

1588
02:40:16,420 --> 02:40:18,940
but then something you're going to have to keep your eye on.

1589
02:40:18,940 --> 02:40:27,010
So instead of like going to Pokemon and rerunning the search, you know, whenever you remember, you can set up these saved searches.

1590
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:32,000
And you can have it. You name it. This is absurd.

1591
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:37,640
Then you can turn on email updates. You can say, Hey. Email me the first Sunday of every month.

1592
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:41,480
Give me 20 items. Give me 100 items.

1593
02:40:41,750 --> 02:40:47,900
I would recommend putting a little note in here because like a year from now, you might be like, what was this for again?

1594
02:40:48,770 --> 02:40:52,610
And so you can set those up as email alerts, which is super, super helpful.

1595
02:40:53,210 --> 02:40:59,180
You can also set up collections if you want to save citations. But if you're using zucchero, that's probably not as helpful.

1596
02:40:59,180 --> 02:41:01,880
Zucchero is going to be better, but there is an option.

1597
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:09,649
For example, like I'm doing this webinar this afternoon, so this is kind of a cool feature I can set up.

1598
02:41:09,650 --> 02:41:16,490
Like I found a bunch like on gardening and mental health, and so I grabbed a bunch of citations.

1599
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:23,420
And I made a public link so I can just share this link with anybody and then I can get to those 27 citations.

1600
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:27,299
So that's kind of a cool feature that's maybe a little bit harder to do from within.

1601
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:32,010
So Carol, here's a way to do it, but like that's one useful way of saying,

1602
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:35,550
see me that, you know, if you've got an NIH stuff, we can talk about that later.

1603
02:41:35,850 --> 02:41:39,900
But this is basically what the MY and CBI dashboard looks like.

1604
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:48,630
I will say if you spend a lot of time searching PubMed, this is like, uh, like my favorite feature.

1605
02:41:49,710 --> 02:41:53,880
You can go and I'll put this link in the notes down here.

1606
02:41:58,650 --> 02:42:09,000
The CPI. You can go in.

1607
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:15,630
So you can turn on highlighting.

1608
02:42:15,640 --> 02:42:22,209
I find this so helpful, especially because I think by default that it's just bold and you've got a long list of results.

1609
02:42:22,210 --> 02:42:26,430
It's very hard to see the ball so you can pick whatever color you want, right?

1610
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:37,870
So I'd recommend something bright. You can also adjust what the results look like when they're displayed so you can turn the abstract on.

1611
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:47,250
So summary is basically just the title and like the basic citation information, abstract view is that bigger view and I'll show you why it's helpful.

1612
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:53,720
And I think that's probably good there.

1613
02:42:53,740 --> 02:43:05,889
They've changed some things with the New Med. He used to be able to change like the number of results that appeared and the sort preferences.

1614
02:43:05,890 --> 02:43:09,430
So. Chris and.

1615
02:43:10,060 --> 02:43:13,320
Stuff with the old actually before we.

1616
02:43:16,230 --> 02:43:20,370
Thinking of what I can do here for you. If we take like.

1617
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:29,300
It's kind of a cool thing and. Second row, I can sit like Cher at her memory.

1618
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:36,420
So we did. One, two, three. And they gave us one. This, actually.

1619
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:50,230
One result. But then we can play around with the new language too.

1620
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:55,400
What did I do to. So that was great.

1621
02:43:56,490 --> 02:44:07,130
One and three. And that was, what, 139?

1622
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:20,450
So then you can come back. And this is why my documentation you at any point can then click on this, click on this, and it will rerun your search.

1623
02:44:20,460 --> 02:44:25,050
Or you can just copy and paste and rerun up. Right. So search documentation, very important.

1624
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:30,480
Did it to do. And that's.

1625
02:44:42,750 --> 02:44:50,900
What was interesting. No comment on that. So I'm going to take what did be not look at the data that's.

1626
02:44:54,350 --> 02:44:58,500
Oh, it's cancer. I'm trying to think of one that I can do that.

1627
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:02,199
I think that. Forced migration.

1628
02:45:02,200 --> 02:45:05,830
I did. And I worked with at least. This place.

1629
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:10,980
A good marriage. Remember who you are.

1630
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:19,310
I want an HPV. Steal from myself and see.

1631
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:30,080
Did I it. Oh, it was trans gender populations.

1632
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:39,920
Oh, here we go. It would benefit Castro, maybe. Oh, yeah.

1633
02:45:40,010 --> 02:45:43,940
Let's just steal these. Just because I.

1634
02:45:53,690 --> 02:45:56,780
Oh, it's weird. It's like. It's like a different.

1635
02:45:58,670 --> 02:46:04,310
You. Interesting area. Just for fun, please.

1636
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:10,320
Because I already have this thing here. Not necessarily sure if these are all like forced migration.

1637
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:14,700
I know this is different, so these might not all be relevant because I just stole from another project.

1638
02:46:15,210 --> 02:46:19,290
But we can. We can tidy it up as we go.

1639
02:46:19,290 --> 02:46:22,890
So we're interested in like forced migration and something related to maybe cancer.

1640
02:46:26,270 --> 02:46:29,600
So. Oh, and this is fun, too. So I can kind of show you what all this.

1641
02:46:30,580 --> 02:46:38,050
Means so in Club Med. So just like we did in Second Bow Pub that has those kegs for things.

1642
02:46:39,350 --> 02:46:42,860
In Club Med. Their tags are called mesh medical subject headings.

1643
02:46:43,310 --> 02:46:46,610
Work is exactly the same way as those descriptors and psych info.

1644
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:50,260
So I click on this. To the side.

1645
02:46:53,110 --> 02:46:57,700
Since I kind of have that migration refugee, like you can clean that up or whatever.

1646
02:46:58,780 --> 02:47:07,900
So let's just tackle like cancer, like, okay, from that, what, what can you tell me about cancer or do you have any subject headings, tags for cancer?

1647
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:12,580
Lots of them. So I click on this neoplasms.

1648
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:17,260
And this is what the problem. MASH record looks like.

1649
02:47:17,890 --> 02:47:19,990
This is the scope note, right?

1650
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:28,030
If I'm interested in a very specific aspect related to cancer, maybe like, you know, radiation effects or like psychology, I could click on that.

1651
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:34,900
Keep scrolling down. These are also very helpful as a keyword.

1652
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:38,080
So I'm going to just dump it over here in this list. We're going to kind of craft.

1653
02:47:38,470 --> 02:47:44,740
This is a more sensitive search. So like what we did in psych info was a very focused search.

1654
02:47:44,740 --> 02:47:47,139
We just use control vocabulary for this one.

1655
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:53,650
Just because I have it handy, I'm going to show you how we can combine control vocabulary with just keywords.

1656
02:47:53,650 --> 02:48:00,820
So like, okay, neoplasms by default that includes a there's our article or our term of interest.

1657
02:48:01,830 --> 02:48:04,890
By default. That includes all.

1658
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:07,760
All of these lower level terms. Right.

1659
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:14,930
Which we may or may not want, maybe for this version of the search, we wanted to keep a broad range, like, okay, let's just grab all that.

1660
02:48:15,350 --> 02:48:23,780
Otherwise I can say like, no, I only want the high level neoplasm do not include lower level terms, but we won't mess with that for now.

1661
02:48:24,380 --> 02:48:33,680
So we've got neoplasms. So again, I'm like that we could have an app tracking my search here.

1662
02:48:34,420 --> 02:48:39,690
I'm just going to show you how this works really quickly so I could take this search.

1663
02:48:39,710 --> 02:48:44,000
It's structured exactly in a way. It's kind of like a programing language, right?

1664
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:49,220
It's called syntax. It's got to be written exactly the right way for somebody to, like, do what you want it to do.

1665
02:48:49,870 --> 02:48:53,020
So this search, when I have the search filter, it's perfectly structured.

1666
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:58,390
I can say take this over and search common. So what this is going to do?

1667
02:48:59,370 --> 02:49:05,370
It's it's going to give us all of the articles. That have been indexed or tagged.

1668
02:49:06,470 --> 02:49:15,260
And this is where it gets a little frustrating. Like This one's a huge concept album one.

1669
02:49:15,260 --> 02:49:22,130
But again, we're going to tighten with like refugees, so it'll get smaller. So the tricky thing with COVID, it's like we have 3.7 million.

1670
02:49:22,220 --> 02:49:27,410
That's totally fine. That's not actually all of the articles that are about cancer that are in public.

1671
02:49:28,550 --> 02:49:32,720
There's going to be stuff in PubMed that hasn't been indexed yet.

1672
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:38,600
Right. So it's either very, very new and it doesn't have mesh terms assigned yet or it's very,

1673
02:49:38,600 --> 02:49:42,860
very old and maybe some of those lower level terms, they weren't using those yet.

1674
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:50,690
So this section serve of all of Club Med, all the stuff that's in problem that we're actually only seeing a small percentage of it.

1675
02:49:51,050 --> 02:49:57,760
So to make the search more sensitive. Right. The first second poster treated with a very precise search music control vocabulary.

1676
02:49:58,180 --> 02:50:02,770
This type of search is called a sensitive search, so we combine everything that's potentially out there.

1677
02:50:02,770 --> 02:50:06,400
So this is going to be more like something with a scoping review or systematic.

1678
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:11,180
So this gives me 3.7 million. That's actually not everything.

1679
02:50:11,210 --> 02:50:17,540
So what I want to do is I want to expand on this. And so I'm going to pull in all these additional keywords.

1680
02:50:18,140 --> 02:50:24,680
And then when you see this little tag here, this team, IAB, stands for title or abstract.

1681
02:50:25,250 --> 02:50:29,600
So what's nice is that I just can't serve as a keyword by itself.

1682
02:50:30,200 --> 02:50:33,820
It's going to pull up cancer and offer affiliation.

1683
02:50:33,830 --> 02:50:42,950
So maybe someone's actually doing like a health education intervention on pediatric and something mental health, yadda, yadda, yadda.

1684
02:50:43,250 --> 02:50:48,950
Articles not about cancer, but maybe one of the authors works at the University of Michigan Cancer Center.

1685
02:50:49,430 --> 02:50:52,550
That article is going to come up. It's not about cancer at all.

1686
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:58,820
So usually if the keyword shows up in the title or an abstract, it's going to be a little bit more relevant.

1687
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:04,770
So we can kind of just quickly do this to IAB to cut out those articles that are like or,

1688
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:08,180
you know, there's tons of journals that have the word cancer in the title.

1689
02:51:08,930 --> 02:51:10,220
Just cancer by itself.

1690
02:51:10,250 --> 02:51:15,740
That's going to pull off every single journal, every single article that's in every single journal that has the word cancer in the title.

1691
02:51:16,340 --> 02:51:19,460
So that to me is a very quick way.

1692
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:24,160
To. To their to focus the search.

1693
02:51:25,130 --> 02:51:28,340
Further. Really.

1694
02:51:28,360 --> 02:51:31,710
And we actually were kind of at odds and. I know.

1695
02:51:32,980 --> 02:51:37,860
I thought I could get myself. And I will talk.

1696
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:41,790
I will talk. I'll just do it very, very quickly. It's like humor for.

1697
02:51:44,930 --> 02:51:49,820
So if we do something like that again, you can do it with all those keywords we have there.

1698
02:51:55,570 --> 02:51:58,660
So I mean, go to Harvard and go to my advanced search.

1699
02:51:58,660 --> 02:51:59,980
That's where my search history is.

1700
02:52:00,340 --> 02:52:10,810
Men search history again very common which databases so I can take like my refugee's search, put it in this query box.

1701
02:52:10,870 --> 02:52:12,009
I could just run the search,

1702
02:52:12,010 --> 02:52:16,780
but I actually just want to add it to the search history for now because I want to do that thing where I can find the search history.

1703
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:21,230
So I see 1.6 or one. 63,000.

1704
02:52:22,250 --> 02:52:26,810
Then I take this. I do have a chance to get all my other keywords in there, but nothing bad to history.

1705
02:52:27,780 --> 02:52:33,100
So, you know, we had 3.7 just adding those additional keywords were up to 4.6, right?

1706
02:52:33,110 --> 02:52:38,210
So the keywords are important for a sensitive search. So then I can say that one in concept.

1707
02:52:40,510 --> 02:52:48,950
In one and two. And again, this was a very broad it probably wouldn't do a very sensitive search, just two concepts.

1708
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:56,320
So we would probably want to add a third concept. But again, I just kind of think like in there for you, so you can rerun that search if you wanted.

1709
02:52:57,350 --> 02:53:01,400
So that is super quick trip component to the section.

1710
02:53:02,270 --> 02:53:06,590
So you need to do once you're logged in and you've got all those like settings.

1711
02:53:07,070 --> 02:53:11,780
I just want to show you what the highlighting looks like. But literally, I can talk and talk, talk, talk.

1712
02:53:12,230 --> 02:53:17,390
So if you've got questions about like what journal you need to publish and what's like open access,

1713
02:53:17,810 --> 02:53:22,340
you're looking for your research funding, citation management stuff.

1714
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:25,220
These are all reasons to contact me.

1715
02:53:25,640 --> 02:53:33,620
So here you can kind of see all of these articles are the abstracts are opened, you can see the keywords are highlighted.

1716
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:37,489
And so this combination, you can kind of quickly skim through.

1717
02:53:37,490 --> 02:53:43,640
And I also love doing like a control by hand where I can look at like maybe I want to see like breast cancer,

1718
02:53:44,120 --> 02:53:49,879
so then I can do a quick control, find and jump through a bunch of the results to see like breast cancer.

1719
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:55,150
Maybe that's another concept I want to pull into the search. So that's another cool thing.

1720
02:53:55,160 --> 02:54:01,460
Once you have the abstracts open and the highlighting turned on, it can kind of help you skim through to kind of figure out what's out there.

1721
02:54:02,870 --> 02:54:06,380
All righty. So you've got a bajillion slides for me.

1722
02:54:06,410 --> 02:54:11,370
I'm actually going to move my Otero slides down because I pasted them in the wrong spot.

1723
02:54:12,440 --> 02:54:13,700
I am a resource for you.

1724
02:54:13,730 --> 02:54:25,070
Contact me if you kind of want to pick up where we left off or if you want to tackle a project, I can help you with data management stuff.

1725
02:54:30,450 --> 02:54:34,530
All I wanted to do. The 40 is.

1726
02:54:36,530 --> 02:54:40,010
Here we go. So you've got lots and lots of stuff in here.

1727
02:54:40,310 --> 02:54:49,230
Research got to get to the things. Yeah.

1728
02:54:49,860 --> 02:54:54,820
All right. So, yeah, it's good that you can do that.

1729
02:54:54,850 --> 02:55:00,450
My hands in the with other lines, because I feel like that that's when I was struggling, just trying to block it.

1730
02:55:00,540 --> 02:55:05,530
So it wasn't like that. Well, did you have like a nine, eight or the NCBI log in?

1731
02:55:05,550 --> 02:55:09,300
I think that it forced you to retire it. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought.

1732
02:55:10,590 --> 02:55:18,390
Yeah. I think it means you log into the I think it was like in June when they like officially retired it and they like forced you to.

1733
02:55:18,670 --> 02:55:22,230
Yeah. Like log in and connect it to third party.

1734
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:27,980
Yeah. Yeah. Like that. I love that. I just feel like they were trying to track.

1735
02:55:28,430 --> 02:55:36,340
Yeah that's good to get around grounded but like, this is all so amazing and I had never done anything to talk about it.

1736
02:55:36,350 --> 02:55:44,090
I feel like this research topic was like, you know, I forgot the notes there.

1737
02:55:44,510 --> 02:55:49,060
You got the slides, you got my contact. So.

1738
02:55:49,390 --> 02:55:58,720
Yeah. So feel free to reach out. I'm usually in the office, although I've only been doing Zoom consultations because it's just so easy.

1739
02:55:59,110 --> 02:56:05,470
Although my step count is down, I used to get like 10,000 steps without even trying.

1740
02:56:05,590 --> 02:56:11,650
Pre-pandemic. Now I'm like, oh, 3000. But yeah, I usually do zoom consultations.

1741
02:56:14,660 --> 02:56:20,110
You know, one hour Tuesday through Friday. Did you know that?

1742
02:56:20,810 --> 02:56:26,770
Are you guys. All right.

1743
02:56:26,770 --> 02:56:31,450
So I was going to add, if you can. Yeah, I can do that.

1744
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:39,979
Yeah. And then we can go from there and all people going to you guys on the side that also wants the document.

1745
02:56:39,980 --> 02:56:47,630
But I. Cross means you guys pain.

1746
02:56:49,890 --> 02:56:55,709
And don't like so much. That's a little overwhelming.

1747
02:56:55,710 --> 02:57:00,820
But we will like guide you through the process. I have to ask, what is this?

1748
02:57:00,840 --> 02:57:05,210
It's very cute, but I don't know if I should think it's cute, huh?

1749
02:57:05,670 --> 02:57:13,490
And it's a camera that, like, if you are missing or something or on Panopto the recording on campus at all, like film memory.

1750
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:17,850
So some of these rooms have it. Some of it and some don't.

1751
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:22,100
But yeah, like I would say, it's like next.

1752
02:57:22,110 --> 02:57:26,339
Because I was on a meeting yesterday and there was just one person they were trying

1753
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:31,620
to get in on this and like he never ended up getting it and it was just after.

1754
02:57:31,710 --> 02:57:35,700
So it's like, okay, cool. It may work.

1755
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:42,690
It may be in a meeting and somebody you know from there and it said, Well, what about it?

1756
02:57:42,990 --> 02:57:46,200
So I looked away. Yeah. And the camera.

1757
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:50,650
Oh, it's just.

1758
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:58,070
Yeah, that's for me. I mean, it's yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff, but yeah, it's this like a pandemic per it.

1759
02:57:58,080 --> 02:57:59,490
Like, is that an upgrade? Okay.

1760
02:57:59,530 --> 02:58:07,889
And so yeah, and I feel like it's for the hybrid thing and I feel like when I film like that they said they were doing a,

1761
02:58:07,890 --> 02:58:13,530
um, a new process where there is automatic recording of classes.

1762
02:58:14,470 --> 02:58:18,220
I don't know that I did it this fast, but I did.

1763
02:58:18,220 --> 02:58:21,370
And then yesterday I was trying to find the recording and like I said,

1764
02:58:22,350 --> 02:58:28,050
they like don't record in different ways because I don't like write up and I'm like, that's really important because record it.

1765
02:58:29,250 --> 02:58:36,010
But then. So it's like, great when it works, but, man, it doesn't.

1766
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:40,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah. How was your. Yeah, it hurts.

1767
02:58:40,510 --> 02:58:44,200
I'm like, Oh, let's do it. I hurt my back before I came up here.

1768
02:58:44,200 --> 02:58:49,029
I think my bags definitely were lower and just it was like that sound.

1769
02:58:49,030 --> 02:58:53,130
Your body shouldn't make noise, too.

1770
02:58:53,380 --> 02:58:59,740
Like, I don't know if I'm, like, like a stretch. It'll, like, maybe make the sound and, like, put it out.

1771
02:58:59,910 --> 02:59:03,580
I don't know what I did. Falling apart. I feel very old today.

1772
02:59:07,300 --> 02:59:11,210
All righty. You got me thinking that much.

1773
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:15,680
Yeah, I'm sure everything. They got my phone.

1774
02:59:16,300 --> 02:59:20,264
Yeah. Make you. Yeah.
