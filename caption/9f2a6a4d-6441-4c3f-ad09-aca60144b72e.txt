1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,535
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:13,140
you will be able to explain

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,995
basic concepts about
log-binomial regression.

4
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:21,645
Finally, we reach our last
generalized linear model.

5
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:24,330
There are definitely more
generalized linear models,

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,085
but these are the
four that are more

7
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:28,875
often used in
epidemiological studies.

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,350
The log-binomial
model is relatively

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,915
similar to the logistic
regression model,

10
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:36,780
both are used for
binary outcomes,

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,745
so we are modeling
proportions or probabilities,

12
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:43,310
and therefore both follow
the binomial distribution.

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,540
The difference is in the link,

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,280
while the logistic regression has

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,790
the logit or log
odds as the link,

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,890
the log-binomial model, as

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,135
its name indicates, has the log.

18
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:58,040
Once more, with the
log-binomial model,

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,770
you have a dichotomous
or binary outcome,

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,315
so you either don't have

21
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,550
the event or you
do have the event,

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,020
and you model that as a
probability or a proportion.

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,740
Well, it happens that

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,655
both risks and prevalence
are proportions,

25
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,830
so the log-binomial
model is going to

26
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,900
help us to get risk ratios

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,490
if you are in the context of

28
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,265
a cohort study or
prevalence ratios,

29
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,085
if you are in the context
of a cross-sectional study.

30
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,260
This is the most
important thing that

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,560
you have to learn about
the log-binomial model.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,425
When you exponentiate
the measures

33
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,020
from the log-binomial model,

34
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,240
your interpretation
of that measure of

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,765
association will depend
on the study design.

36
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,615
If you have a cohort study,

37
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:41,750
you will interpret
that as a risk ratio.

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,625
If you are in
cross-sectional study,

39
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,435
you will interpret that
as a prevalence ratio.

40
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:49,820
Finally, I wanted to
make a distinction about

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,150
using logistic models
versus log-binomial models.

42
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,980
If you have a binary
outcome, you could use both.

43
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,330
You've been using
logistic regression so

44
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,520
far for all your binary outcomes.

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,100
Remember that if you run
logistic regression,

46
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,219
what you get from your
models are odds ratios,

47
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,110
and you have to
interpret them as that,

48
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,260
odds ratios, not risk,
not other things.

49
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,540
Using one model or the other will

50
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,970
depend on the type of the
study design you have.

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,760
If you are in the context
of a case-control study,

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,130
you have to use
logistic regression.

53
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,110
What if you are in the context of

54
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,755
a cohort study or a
cross-sectional study?

55
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,190
Well, you can still use

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,880
logistic regression and
calculate odds ratios,

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,335
but on top of that,

58
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,880
now you'll have a new model
that will allow you to

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,715
calculate risk ratios
if in a cohort study,

60
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:41,170
or prevalence ratios if in
a cross-sectional study.

61
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,925
Don't worry if this
feels unclear and dizzy.

62
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,100
In the next videos,

63
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,975
you will see examples of

64
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,890
each of the uses of the
log-binomial model.

65
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,025
In summary, in this video,

66
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:55,010
we learned the most
basic concepts

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,690
about log-binomial regression.

68
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,840
In the next video, we will
continue with an example of

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,427
log-binomial regression using
ProcGen model once more.
