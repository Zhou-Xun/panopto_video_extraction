1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:14,410
Hey, good morning, folks. Welcome to hopefully your last three classes.

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,960
Anybody have a class tomorrow? Excellent. So slightly fall over three days.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,550
Yes, I know it's super busy time yet. Hang in there.

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:32,710
I wanted to start with an announcement and I played close with this at the end of the class in case others joined.

5
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,290
Most of you have sent me this.

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:45,820
This is the debate instructions file off the home page, the campus home page, and at the very end, I think it's the fourth page.

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,990
There's this evaluation form where you evaluate each of the members of your debate.

8
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:59,080
It's just a word. It's just a word doc. If you can complete this, uh, you know,

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,310
put in the score and any relevant comments for your debate team members and

10
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,320
just email it to me as an attachment if you can do that by the end of today.

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,670
That would be awesome. Maybe the latest early, early tomorrow would be fantastic.

12
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,080
And this is actually, if you remember,

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:26,980
it's actually described in the instructions about a third of each student's grade comes from the peer evaluation from your debate team members.

14
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:32,530
So said, I just take it and kind of plug that right in to the grading.

15
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:38,410
In terms of updates on grades, I got a tutorial on the canvas site.

16
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,390
If you remember I was struggling, you know,

17
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,990
a month ago or so with the exam scores and people who took it online through canvas versus took it in the classroom,

18
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,240
and I had to create two different assignments just to be able to postgres what you know what you got?

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,020
And I got some help in getting that rearranged so that portions the grades correctly so that tomorrow I should

20
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:06,670
be able to upload the proposal grades if I get all of the feedback from you all on your student evaluations,

21
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:17,920
the the debate grades and then as another reminder on your course evaluations, I think you have until the end of the day tomorrow to complete those.

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,220
So I'll probably wait until maybe Saturday morning to actually enter grades for the for the participation.

23
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:31,990
Remember, if we hit the 90 percent mark, the whole class gets an extra one percent with you on the participation component.

24
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:40,450
And then at that point Saturday, I should be able to actually finalize course the full course semester grades and get those get us posted.

25
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:48,020
Any questions about these logistics? OK, cool.

26
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:58,190
Let's see what was next. We've got a little bit of a bouncing around class agenda today.

27
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:10,250
OK, so we're actually going to pick up where we left off on Tuesday and have a little bit of discussion about our

28
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:21,530
previous debate right around use indoor spraying of DDT to help in addressing malaria once we're done with that.

29
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:30,230
I'll pull up, hopefully successfully. The Zoom reporting from last night from the group of students has completed the course asynchronously.

30
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,410
We just watched that debate together and then have a little bit of discussion around that.

31
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,870
Once we're done with that will kind of wrap things up for the course and for the semester.

32
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:51,920
All right. So if you can somehow magically transport yourself back to Tuesday as the class period was ending, we were talking about who's in favor.

33
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,880
Let's go ahead and revote just to maybe get your minds back to thinking about it.

34
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,330
Who is in favor of indoor spraying of DDT for malaria?

35
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:10,820
And I remember there were a lot of like and waves, right? Anybody firmly against spraying?

36
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,350
OK? Nobody. So I'm going to actually start with the hand wavers.

37
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,060
So what what? What makes you, you know, kind of lawful on this?

38
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:26,150
What are the thoughts that are informing that in decisiveness? Yeah.

39
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,480
I think it should only be done in like areas where it's really prevalent.

40
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,770
So like it's not like a widely used thing like across like a thumb across the world, but just like where it's really high malaria rates.

41
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:44,880
But then still like the environment, safety and stuff, there is a lot to go and make it safe, but it's still very effective what it does.

42
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,290
So in in areas where it's kind of out of control, you use that as almost a last resort.

43
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,350
But if there are other mitigation strategies that are that are effective in the meantime, hold off.

44
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,820
OK, Rebecca. Yeah, it's great. And that's sort of what the situation is now.

45
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,560
But I think emphasizing that we should really be.

46
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,870
Solutions are not very much like a long term solution.

47
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:33,340
And also can't really. Putting effort on correctly applying, it seemed like there was a lot of like health effects from incorrectly applied and.

48
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:45,990
All right. And really minimizing it, but the risk of malaria is a lot higher than.

49
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:53,460
Sure. Sure. Thoughts from anyone else on how you could maybe go on either side of this government.

50
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,840
I just think it should be available to countries like as an option like they

51
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,680
can decide to use that advance what they think is best for their situation.

52
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,100
So I think the main problem with banning it before was like, everyone's just stop it being produced,

53
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,820
but like they weren't paying attention to the people who needed it.

54
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,610
And also, I think they'll probably still spray pesticides for a long time, even with other malaria control methods.

55
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,660
So I think like rotating the pesticides like prevent plague resistance.

56
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,240
Insects is also important things like having that available to be a part of the rotation.

57
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,190
There's also. Excellent point. Any any other comments that folks have?

58
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:47,150
What about those that are just, you know, strongly in favor of why? Why do you say that?

59
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,900
It seems like the right thing to do.

60
00:06:48,900 --> 00:07:02,400
I, uh, I put out the debate assignments and I think it was right after that that I saw news on a vaccine that had been proved right and I was like,

61
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,330
Oh gosh, I'm totally throwing these guys for a loop right midstream of the assignment.

62
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,420
And I know that, you know, the groups touched on it a little bit, but anybody care to, like,

63
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:25,550
offer, you know what, what the prospects of that are at least maybe short term versus long term.

64
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:33,140
Anybody feeling someway informed after your maybe a little bit of research it,

65
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:41,400
but I think it's very promising long term, like what one more and I think a long time and.

66
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,800
I think there's a lot of potential there for folks for the vaccine incentive.

67
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,680
Or in addition to the and insecticide, yeah.

68
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:05,570
But I think my recollection is that currently is partially effective or I think it's only recommended in children under certain.

69
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:16,140
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now and we you know, we've seen the challenges even with, you know, a huge,

70
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:24,470
huge investment and acceleration on all fronts for vaccine distribution and implementation with with Colbert, right?

71
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:31,080
And so that's, you know, unfortunately not the case for malaria.

72
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,180
And so I would expect there to be some,

73
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:44,420
some challenges in infrastructure and distribution and administration and so forth as well education, you know, all of these things.

74
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:52,530
Any other comments around our own DDT for a malaria before we move on?

75
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,810
OK, here it's coming, sir. Phil, go ahead of injury and then we'll come back to you guys.

76
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm curious if there's any methods that don't involve indoor spraying,

77
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,620
like maybe just spraying outside the house directly and like, you know, like not because it seems like having it, I guess.

78
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,350
And then how much time do they spend indoors versus outside?

79
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:19,000
And like, those factors are interesting, like it seems dangerous, especially where you're sleeping and everything.

80
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,260
Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to turn that question back to the groups because I think you guys had some.

81
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,380
I know you have some good background on that.

82
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:37,680
The specific mosquito actually bites more frequently at night, so that's why the indoor spraying is recommended.

83
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,420
So that's why there's like indoor nets and stuff like that, so it's very important to protect the homes.

84
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,720
So we do that or we we flip the switch and have people be nocturnal basically, right, at least during the day.

85
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,130
And then OK. But I guess they're out at night when you're, you know, working, living, doing your daily routine.

86
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,050
Yeah, but good. Good question, Andrea, and thank you, Caitlin, for that answer.

87
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:11,490
If you were going to sort of questions about why did you particularly specifically stay in interior spraying because you

88
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:19,530
think maybe just usage of DDT in general would be not as controversial or I'm curious of was the thinking of the interior.

89
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:25,620
Because I've heard a lot of controversy about just DDT in general, I guess I've never really seen that nuance.

90
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,530
Yeah. So I mean, I mean, kind of picking up on the need for the interior spraying right and in the first

91
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:38,550
place because that's when the mosquitoes are are out at the highest risk.

92
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:45,210
But it's I mean, in a very general sense, it's it's like the case with any other pollutant contaminant.

93
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:57,120
Right? And an indoor micro environment, whatever it is, you know, ventilation or lack thereof, confined space concentrations,

94
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,890
especially if the source of the pollutant is, you know, so it's being applied indoors inside the home.

95
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,700
It's not like it's blowing in from, you know, another town or something.

96
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,950
Um, it's it's much, much higher concentrations.

97
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,730
I mean, this would be the concern for the indoor spaces for forgetti, as it would be for many, for many others.

98
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:24,510
And then beyond that, you know, we're talking about children and who is at most risk for it.

99
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,730
And, you know, hand to mouth, you know, it's on surfaces on purpose, right?

100
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,090
This is how it how it works against mosquitoes. And so the you know,

101
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:44,940
there's numerous routes of exposure of concern within that confined space where it's purposefully concentrated or haze in order to be to be effective.

102
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,840
Does that sort of address your question? OK. Yeah, that's a good question.

103
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:59,890
Any other, any other comments from folks or questions?

104
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:08,320
All right, well, thanks again to both groups from Tuesday and actually all the groups, fantastic job, well done presentations, slides.

105
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,990
It was clear that everyone did a lot of a lot of homework and research and coordination to put this forward.

106
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:21,910
OK, I'm going to shift gears and see if I can get this Zoom recording to play,

107
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,220
and it might take a minute because I don't think I've attempted this in the classroom yet.

108
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:35,100
I hope our volume issue is solved from the last class.

109
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:47,820
Gosh. So currently.

110
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:58,260
Send that to me by the end of the day tomorrow. Google a Google Slides was like telling me I could just like I can.

111
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:14,530
I can make everyone a co-host and then, you know, I'll have the magical power to share screen.

112
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:21,140
So I don't know how to share screen share, and I don't want to waste any time so I can do it.

113
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,180
Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah.

114
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:35,030
And for anybody who's who's not done this on Zoom.

115
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:40,760
Well, that's a lovely image. Here you go there, and I think you so much.

116
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:47,810
Yeah, yeah. So it looks like the Pro Group is ready to get going.

117
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm going to set the timer. Does anybody want interruptions for one minute left?

118
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,490
Two minute laughter? Or are you OK to just kind of keep track of time on your own?

119
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,140
Well, no, I'm OK with a reminder. Yeah, I agree, too.

120
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:13,610
I think the reminder could be good. OK, so I'll give I'll give like a one minute warning or two minute warning.

121
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:21,530
Maybe two minute two minutes actually gives you time to kind of like catch up without OK, talking like crazy, right?

122
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,770
Yeah, I'll give you. I'll give you a two minute warning.

123
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:39,320
And if we're ready to go, I would just say with the Pro Group, just you can begin whenever you're ready.

124
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,960
OK, so we are the Pro Geo Engineering Group.

125
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,960
We have a table of contents here. So first, we're going to introduce the problem.

126
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,790
We're going to talk about a solution to the problem, which is geoengineering.

127
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,730
We will discuss the types of geoengineering, the benefits and the risks involved.

128
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,000
And then we will pass it over to you guys.

129
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:14,390
So first, we'll talk about the problem at hand, which is climate change, which is, as we all know, a huge issue that we're facing currently.

130
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:21,980
Its issue is mostly caused from anthropogenic activities, so we are the perpetrators here.

131
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:32,090
Scientists are showing that the main source of greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide, which accounts for three fourths of all of our emissions.

132
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,720
Because of the release of these greenhouse gases,

133
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:45,860
heat is being entrapped in our atmosphere and we're getting a warming effect which has effects on our our ice,

134
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,550
our farming and our human interaction with the planet.

135
00:15:49,550 --> 00:16:02,300
And so currently we're looking at large scale interventions to try and mitigate these anthropogenic effects of global warming.

136
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:12,560
And so we would like to introduce geoengineering as a solution for climate change.

137
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:24,980
So geoengineering is the anthropogenic intentional manipulation of the environment such that the Earth's climatic systems are changed widespread.

138
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:35,540
So these group of technologies came about because research is showing that even if we were to aggressively cut back emissions right now,

139
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:42,530
the world would still continue to warm and cause harm. So we need interventions that are going to reduce damage that has already been

140
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:49,670
done and that go beyond just reducing future output of harmful emissions.

141
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:55,520
So geoengineering has two main pillars to be considered geoengineering.

142
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:06,950
It has to have a large scale impact. It can't just be a localized change in the environment, and it has to be an intentional change.

143
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:20,930
And so, for example, we would want with the geoengineering intervention worldwide reduction in temperature versus just one continent.

144
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:31,730
So an example of a manipulation of the environment that would not be considered large scale would be something like ornamental gardening in your yard.

145
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:43,730
It may affect your a very small climate around you if you add trees, if you add certain plants that wildlife likes and so on.

146
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,230
But it's not considered geoengineering because it's not large scale.

147
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:57,890
The other part is intention, so it has to reduce the undesired climate change, and it cannot be a side effect of the intervention.

148
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:08,240
So a side effect that changes the global temperature would be fossil fuel combustion via the release of CO2.

149
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:16,430
We are changing the global temperature, however, that is a side effect, so that would not be geoengineering as well.

150
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:27,320
The term geoengineering is not new, although it is highly controversial, and so we don't see it on a wide scale yet.

151
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:37,910
It was first used back in the 70s when a scientist discussed possibly injecting CO2 emissions deep into the ocean became more mainstream in the 2000s,

152
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:47,120
when a Nobel Peace Prize winner talked about albedo science, which is the study of how objects reflect solar energy.

153
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:55,280
And he is a chemist, and he proposed injecting sulfur particles into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back,

154
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,610
and therefore it would cool the Earth on a large scale.

155
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:07,190
And so with his work, people really began thinking, OK, well, we could maybe change things on a larger scale than we had ever thought.

156
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,420
So currently, the technology is of interest focus on two main things either solar radiation management,

157
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:22,520
such as the sulfur particles or direct removal of greenhouse gases that are already in the environment.

158
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:28,040
So we hope to prove that although some geoengineering proposals are controversial,

159
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:36,970
like the sulfur injection and aerosolized particles in the atmosphere to reduce.

160
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:43,660
The temperature there are things that we can do that are not as controversial and that are still considered geoengineering.

161
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:51,490
So, for example, like implementing a large scale mission to replant trees, is considered geoengineering.

162
00:19:51,490 --> 00:20:03,110
So not everything has to be so controversial. And then we're going to go into the different kinds of geoengineering now.

163
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:14,690
All right. Thank you. So the two main types of geo engineering, as you said, are the solar radiation management and the greenhouse gas removal.

164
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,890
Geoengineering alone should not be viewed as an entire solution to climate change,

165
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:26,090
as it's meant to augment efforts to reduce sources of greenhouse gas emissions, not be the end all solution.

166
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,890
So the typically more controversial type tends to be the solar radiation management,

167
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:36,960
which uses tech the techniques listed below to reflect some of the Sun's energy back into space.

168
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,230
Be joining hands and references the reflective properties of the surface of the Earth.

169
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,700
The greenhouse gas removal encompasses many techniques which are used to remove carbon dioxide and

170
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:54,440
other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to decrease greenhouse gas effect and ocean acidification.

171
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,660
Some of these techniques are widely accepted as beneficial, such as afforestation,

172
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,540
which is the planting trees, while others, like ocean fertilization, require more evidence to be brought.

173
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:20,570
The accepted and thus face more scrutiny. Next, we will briefly review the potential benefits of some geoengineering techniques.

174
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:29,000
So albino enhancement can provide targeted cooling by adjusting roofing and pavement materials to reflect more solar radiation,

175
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,200
reflected payment has been shown to be to reduce ambient air temperature as much as seven point five degrees Celsius.

176
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,770
Reducing the temperature not only reduces the demand for air conditioning,

177
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,590
but decreases the rate of the photochemical reaction that contributes to smog formation.

178
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:54,500
Preliminary cost analysis studies suggest the reflective roof modifications can pay for themselves in five to seven years through energy savings.

179
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,190
This type of albedo enhancement would reduce reliance on active climate controlled

180
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,150
methods such as air conditioning and replace it with a passive method,

181
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,890
reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released from coal burning energy plants.

182
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,090
Stratospheric aerosols are a method of uniformly cooling the planet,

183
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:19,070
as was witnessed when Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991 and sent 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere,

184
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:24,440
effectively cooling the planet by zero point six degrees Celsius for 15 months.

185
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,690
Intentionally adding aerosols to the atmosphere could produce similar and lasting results to extend the time

186
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:37,190
humanity has to reduce production of greenhouse gases before the effects of climate change become disastrous.

187
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,100
Lastly, afforestation or the planting trees,

188
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:47,450
especially on land not before forested as one type of old fashioned geoengineering that stands to have a large impact regarding

189
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:54,800
the slow climate change planning one trillion trees would lead to the reduction of approximately one third of global emissions.

190
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:02,060
Planting trees is also a way to combat soil erosion, which which tends to worsen as levels rise with climate change.

191
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,380
Geoengineering stance gives humanity the greatest resource of all time. I'm sorry.

192
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:14,330
The greatest resource of all, which is time. Time to jump through the necessary political hoops for global diplomacy and resolve the public distrust

193
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:28,390
of the scientific community thinks that it looks like we won't have time for it without geoengineering.

194
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:43,200
Oh, a new, more muted. So as my as my co-presenter pointed out, that geoengineering comes with a lot of risks and it's a bit controversial.

195
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,440
So like primarily, it doesn't believe that it is very costly and it's not cost effective.

196
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,370
But like honestly, all the solutions, whether it's solar energy or any other,

197
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:01,360
the other to second, the risks involved is like enhanced ocean acidification.

198
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,850
The solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal techniques can remove the global can remove the gases,

199
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:14,650
but does it stop carbon dioxide from being produced? The answer is no.

200
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:22,180
So geoengineering approaches need to be effective. If you cut down carbon emissions, do otherwise, they won't work.

201
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:32,300
Next. Typekit. Secondly, they also claim that geo engineering can reduce plant growth.

202
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:41,090
So like if they try to reduce the sunlight or block it from entering the Earth's crust, we know that plants need sunlight.

203
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,350
So if there's no sunlight, there would be less plant growth. It would be less light.

204
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,280
But again, the situation can be mitigated by large scale manipulations,

205
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,040
like if on a station using non-native species, some species that don't require sunlight.

206
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,040
So we can at least reduce light in those areas which are not covered by plants which use sunlight.

207
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:12,530
Next slide, please. Effect on cirrus clouds, geoengineering can further destabilize weather and climatic fighting on multiple ways,

208
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,790
so that is another factor which people say geoengineering is not a good solution.

209
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,710
But considering that it can have an opposite effect.

210
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:29,210
Experts believe it's not a good solution yet. If managed properly, they can be used for nitrogen.

211
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:37,160
Geoengineering techniques, for instance, are used to eliminate or reduce the risk clouds to allow you to escape into the space.

212
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:45,260
The solution is good, but the management is the most important thing, so geoengineering technique is not back the way it is managed.

213
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,150
Like you cannot give too many injections and believe that it would stop the heat.

214
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:56,840
You need to have proper mitigation practices or to be effective mass transit.

215
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:05,540
So if we believe that we have, like we humans, are to blame that the Earth is in the state currently because of us,

216
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,650
we are trying to provide solutions to geoengineering is one of the solution.

217
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,570
It's the need of the hour. We can say it does not come with.

218
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:20,540
It does come with a lot of criticism, but it doesn't provide a lot of solutions what we are looking for.

219
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:30,760
So all the geoengineering techniques which are being mentioned of the just means they are effectively curbing the heat temperature on the edges.

220
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,820
But the main problem is how to mitigate them to be more effective.

221
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:42,110
So geoengineering is the need also. Thank you.

222
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,100
Bravo, Bravo, nice work group, number one group.

223
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,970
Thank you very much for that presentation.

224
00:26:49,970 --> 00:27:01,100
So with without any delay, let's go ahead and move on to the second group who will make their case against Geo-Engineering.

225
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:10,640
And whenever you're ready, you can go ahead and begin. OK, OK, so I'll be starting to get today.

226
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,480
Oh, OK. I didn't know. That's my story. So climate change is a very severe issue that we're facing today.

227
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,420
According to the World Health Organization, climate change is estimated to cause a hundred and fifty thousand deaths annually.

228
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,040
Climate change can lead to these deaths and other harmful health impacts in a variety of ways,

229
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,830
which are including, but not limited to, higher frequency of extreme weather or incidents of infectious disease.

230
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:41,240
Reduced air quality and changes to temperature patterns. As a result, it is clear that global warming is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.

231
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,110
Do you? Engineering seems to be the way to minimize the damage that climate change causes, but in fact, you because many negative effects of its own,

232
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,930
especially considering the magnitude of these potential impacts will be unknown until the go through watch hearing takes place.

233
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:59,150
It's clear that geoengineering is not a risk worth taking because it can lead to ocean acidification,

234
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,260
which could eliminate the seafood sector of the food industry. Ozone depletion,

235
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,640
which you call that drastically increased incidence of skin cancer destruction of the

236
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:15,860
terrestrial food chain when global warming eventually creates an inhospitable environment.

237
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,660
In fact, many climate scientists are thrilled to push back on the idea of geoengineering,

238
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:27,290
specifically because it undermines the core rhetoric that we need to significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases.

239
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:33,860
And furthermore, using geoengineering is an easy fix because delays in the push for greenhouse gas emission reductions,

240
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:40,940
which is inevitably what's needed. And as we've seen and continue to see, global warming is only getting bigger and bigger as time goes on.

241
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:47,330
It also exemplified by the global temperatures graph on the slide, which were at an all time high and still on the rise.

242
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:56,750
So taking action now as soon as we can to resolve this issue instead of attempting to use geoengineering as a buffer is the necessary way to go,

243
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,730
and it's already happening now.

244
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:08,580
Hurricanes, wildfires and infectious disease are all on the rise, and it will only prove to get worse as time goes on and we don't resolve this issue.

245
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,880
Geo engineering looks really appealing at first glance,

246
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,580
but one of the biggest concerns is that geoengineering only provides what we call bandaid effects.

247
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:24,280
It's not a true fix. Paul addresses the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

248
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,030
It doesn't address how they got there to begin with, and we can't just treat the symptoms.

249
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:34,570
We have to treat the cause. One of the reasons why geoengineering hasn't been implemented yet on a large scale is biased.

250
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:40,870
For years, climate scientists have argued that this would undermine that need for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

251
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:48,340
We're concerned that an easy fix like this would encourage delays in implementing the policies needed to reduce emissions.

252
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,660
There's also a longevity problem associated with geoengineering.

253
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:59,500
Many of the strategies currently proposed can be reversed or stopped, after which time the effects only lasts for five to 10 years.

254
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:08,440
Once we go down this road, we have to keep using these strategies, at least for several centuries, to avoid ending up back where we started or worse.

255
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,340
You can't stop a hemorrhage with a Band-Aid, and you can't stop global warming with geoengineering.

256
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,960
So, as previously stated, the geoengineering is a Band-Aid effect.

257
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,450
Some might argue the cost of it is inexpensive,

258
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:28,900
but it's not when directly comparing the upfront cost of geoengineering versus minimizing climate changes.

259
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:36,550
You will see that climate change is the more expensive solution, but you have to consider the accruing cost of geoengineering over time.

260
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,300
Once we turn on geoengineering methods, we are essentially stuck with it until we find other ways to minimize global warming.

261
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,200
Then once we do and implement those global warming reduction methods,

262
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,650
we essentially have to pay for geoengineering until we are able to adequately reduce the climate patterns.

263
00:30:53,650 --> 00:31:02,360
So is it safe to turn off the geoengineering? So you're really just going to have to end up paying double the price?

264
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:09,350
One of the biggest impacts of geoengineering is the disruption of ecosystems and the resulting negative impact on biodiversity.

265
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,060
These strategies disrupt habitats and complex food webs and endanger many different

266
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,400
species because geoengineering does little to actually stop greenhouse gas emissions.

267
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:27,050
It can't address urgent climate impacts. So like ocean acidification, many options disrupt the weather cycles.

268
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:36,200
Solar engineering can worsen sea level rise. Ocean fertilization tactics could activate phytoplankton species that release toxins toxins into the air.

269
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:43,400
Geoengineering also uses large amounts of energy. Reviews have shown that these strategies heavily impact energy production,

270
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:50,720
and the systems that support those strategies related to carbon dioxide removal need electricity and thermal energy to function,

271
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:59,180
which provides ample opportunity for them to release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, creating more greenhouse gas emissions.

272
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:07,880
Even if geoengineering did address the cause and did it negatively affect the environment, there's still a huge barrier when you look at geopolitics.

273
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,380
Global warming is an issue that only affects certain countries or regions,

274
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,880
so it begs the question who's going to get to decide who regulates the process?

275
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,120
Who decides what route to take, where it happens, how large scale happens on and how long it happens.

276
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,990
Each government is going to want to be the one to make the decisions and own the rights to the technologies.

277
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,800
It's going to lead to conflict and the cause of the conflict with negate any benefits like geoengineering could offer.

278
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Cloud seeding is known to change weather patterns.

279
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:44,630
Under the Environmental Modification Convention, the United Nations banned the use of cloud seeding or any weather regulation and warfare.

280
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:50,540
This means that if some governments decide to proceed with geoengineering without all countries in agreement,

281
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:58,700
and if that geoengineering strategy affects a region that did not agree with this process, it could be seen as an act of economic warfare.

282
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,130
The dangers and the cost of this political red tape and the precarious power dynamic across multiple

283
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:10,190
nations that would come with an attempt at geoengineering strongly outweighs any potential benefits.

284
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:18,520
And that's if advocates can even successfully get enough stakeholders to agree with the process to begin with.

285
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,740
So some of these ethical issues will have some overlap with the geopolitical barriers.

286
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,740
But one of them is distributed justice and like you said,

287
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:35,650
how are we going to divide up who gets to receive these negative benefits and who receives the positive benefits of geoengineering as we,

288
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:41,200
the protein discuss it is on a global scale. So these effects are not going to be isolated.

289
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,330
The problem with this is the countries who are currently most at risk are the ones with the least

290
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:52,150
number of resources and have the least money available to implement these geoengineering methods.

291
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:58,000
In addition, the poor and sometimes smaller countries are oftentimes the ones that are more at risk for climate change.

292
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,920
So how are we going to help them out?

293
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:07,960
In addition, there's procedural justice we have to consider, which is like Free said, who's going to be able to deploy geoengineering?

294
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,510
This is especially of concern for solar engineering, as this needs to be done on a global scale.

295
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,050
With that,

296
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:22,240
we need to consider the strains this will put on countries regarding international decision making and how this could alter their ally ships.

297
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,840
So getting consent from everyone is going to be very tricky. Lastly is the argument of military.

298
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,220
In 1977, during the Environmental Modification Convention,

299
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:41,560
a treaty was passed prohibiting military or other hostile use of environment and then environmental modification techniques to alter weather patterns,

300
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,720
also known as weather warfare.

301
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:51,250
The U.S. expressed interest recently in wanting to research weather modification for military conflict, which would violate this treaty.

302
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,900
Lastly, are some unintended consequences may need to be considering, which is,

303
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:02,320
are we adequately prepared to take on the challenges of permanently changing slash regulating the global thermostat?

304
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,610
As the protein discussed, this is something that could last for centuries.

305
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,080
So an example of this would be using stratospheric atmospheric injection and how over

306
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,910
time this could make our oceans too acidic and how we would need to solve this problem.

307
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:25,420
But that problem would lead to another problem. So we're just going down a cyclical chain of events, solving additional problems in minutes remaining.

308
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:32,200
Moving on to the health impacts. Well, I was hoping more was going to populate when doing research on the negative impacts of geoengineering.

309
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,460
Mostly what came up was a lot of uncertainty due to the lack of research because we were not able to put this on a large enough scale as a test run.

310
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,890
So some of the few health impacts I was able to find were occupational exposure hazard.

311
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:49,540
So this being to the people that are releasing the sulfur or making sulfur products.

312
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:56,590
So essentially we just if we are going to do it, we need to adequately educate and provide PPE for these people.

313
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:02,080
In addition, it's aerosol deposition in the long term effects this could potentially have in the body.

314
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,530
It is surmised it could have negative effects on the cardiovascular system,

315
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:11,620
respiratory and metabolic system and putting them at increased risk of illness for these body systems.

316
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,090
Lastly, is a concern for the decreasing amount of ozone utilizing solar,

317
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,590
your engineering and how this will increase the amount of UV radiation which will reach

318
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:29,900
the Earth's surface and then put people at increased risk of skin cancer and eye damage.

319
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,610
You're a you're muted. Yeah, sorry.

320
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:40,580
OK. So although geoengineering might be helpful in the short term, in the long term, it will bring nothing but harm.

321
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:48,680
It also offers a complex mix of many other issues that will be really hard to navigate, which include geopolitical, ethical and health issues.

322
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,580
Additionally, the future harmful impacts of geoengineering long term are unknown and will likely remain unknown until we invest in it.

323
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,780
So by only by attacking this problem through greenhouse gas reduction,

324
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:12,830
reinstallation of polar ice caps and more can we really do what's best for humanity and minimize global warming?

325
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:18,830
Bravo. Nice work the against the group. Right, right on time.

326
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:26,760
OK, thanks very much to both groups. Let me go ahead and I'm going to pause the recording.

327
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,570
And I'll invite the Pro Group to go ahead and take two minutes for your rebuttal.

328
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:44,010
OK, OK. So we talked about how the against drug use perhaps some loaded language and fear mongering tactics to argue their point, which is fine.

329
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:49,380
It's a debate, but you have to point it out. They mentioned that, you know,

330
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:58,320
how are we going to agree on geoengineering solutions the same way that we would have to agree on greenhouse gas reduction through diplomacy?

331
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:07,590
Either way, it's going to take countries working together, which has been proven difficult, but hopefully not impossible.

332
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:13,320
Also, geoengineering doesn't encapsulate like a bunch of different controversial solutions.

333
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:20,670
As we mentioned, it does include planting trees, which can help and is less of a controversial implementation.

334
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,890
But we also stated that it's not an end all solution. We do need greenhouse gas reduction.

335
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,990
But the problem is we know it's we're not having the change that we need fast enough.

336
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:41,490
We keep getting warnings about that. And so engineering is a way of stretching the time that we have to implement, ultimately our carbon reduction.

337
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:48,000
So it just seems like we can't go through the political hoops and time to make that happen.

338
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,300
Another thing that was mentioned was that, you know, we're not going to know what the effects are until we do it.

339
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:00,390
But even Mythbusters does like a small scale test, and then they move into a large scale test.

340
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:06,420
So I would say that we need to move cautiously and follow the evidence.

341
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:15,750
We don't want to cause a bigger problem, but it's not to say, you know, throw geoengineering out completely, but let's take a of a rush.

342
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,580
Not like we're not going to do the science right? But in the same way that they did the vaccine, like,

343
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:28,560
let's get everybody working on this to see if we can implement it safely to give us more time to jump through those political hoops.

344
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:38,010
So and also climate change, you know, if unchecked, could cause way more health problems like killing everybody.

345
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:44,160
You know, how's that for fear mongering, which is probably worse than anything geoengineering would do?

346
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,400
So thank you very much. Excellent.

347
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,700
Thank you. Pro Group, we'll go ahead and move right to the against group.

348
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,990
You have two minutes for your rebuttal or 80.

349
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:05,760
I think first you call it fear mongering. We call it actually talking about the weight that your choices have on the world.

350
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:14,430
Specifically, one of the things that we wanted to call out. What's the solution of using non-native species that don't need as much sunlight?

351
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:23,280
This is called invasive species, and it's actually more harmful than helpful to the ecosystems that were already damaging by using geoengineering.

352
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,030
It's not a solution. Yeah, definitely.

353
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:33,180
And also, like you were talking about in your argument that proposes a controversial and they're controversial for a reason.

354
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:43,480
If experts in the field can't even agree, what valid reason do we have for wanting to implement these strategies?

355
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:52,630
And then you talked about you brought up again about the fact that we can't do these studies on a small scale or we haven't and we should,

356
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:58,720
but they actually have tried to, but they haven't come up with adequate results and they said in the studies that they need to do

357
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:06,250
it on a larger scale scale testing field to get adequate health results to see the implications.

358
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:14,020
So I don't think it's actually a great strategy. I also think that with the idea of doing a small scale versus a large scale,

359
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,130
the whole reason we haven't tried on large scale is because they can't justify the

360
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:24,610
risks and the unknowns of how that's going to affect our ecosystems are humans.

361
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:27,700
We don't know the effects on the bodies, and that's why it hasn't happened yet,

362
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:33,070
because no one's willing to take the risk because the cost is just too high.

363
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:41,740
Yeah, yeah. Going along with that to some of these techniques have a clear possibility of having the opposite effect, and that's not really a chance.

364
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:50,600
I don't think we have. I don't think we have the time or the money to make that kind of a choice.

365
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,500
And nobody even has anything else that's all I got. I think that says enough.

366
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,730
All right. Thanks very much against Group for your rebuttal.

367
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now. That was my seat.

368
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,110
All right. So kind of following suit.

369
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,790
What we did with the previous two debates.

370
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:27,640
So just in terms of how compelling the arguments were from each debate team who thinks the Pro Group won the debate?

371
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:34,130
A couple people who who thinks the against group won the debate.

372
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,730
More people. OK, fair enough.

373
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:50,780
Now, just in terms of the issue of geoengineering as an approach to help combat changing climate, who is in favor of geoengineering,

374
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:58,190
capable hands and more hand-waving that's really cheating, you know, simply not taking a position.

375
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:04,250
Who? Who's against the geoengineering? OK, so we're split.

376
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,150
Almost 50 50 is not really knowing how to kind of put the weighting.

377
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:16,130
And um. So so what if folks think unfortunately, you know, the teams aren't here to participate in answer questions,

378
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,150
but, you know, comments questions coherently my hand.

379
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:30,080
I think there should be room for both. Right? But like, I feel like if you want to employ geoengineering on a large scale or if you want to like,

380
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:35,930
reduce CO2 emissions at a large scale, it's going to have to go through like the bureaucracy anyway.

381
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:41,390
So if you're going to have to do that, you should just be arguing for a reduction in CO2 emissions.

382
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:48,170
But like, there should be room for both. But I feel like there isn't a say on the job.

383
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:54,080
I just say my issue with you engineering. But the big I think the biggest group brought it up.

384
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,110
It's like if you don't reduce gas emissions, then you're just putting a Band-Aid over it and then say the all in base.

385
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,680
I mean, it approves. They come back like, we don't do it anymore.

386
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,150
You're bringing up all the traps gas and it's like huge exponential growth of everything.

387
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:15,140
So you don't really fix anything. You're just trying to delay it a little bit, which is exactly what we need right now anyways,

388
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:22,280
because we need something to have more time to come up with solutions to the global warming issues.

389
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,900
But there's still there's a whole lot of other issues that bring opportunities really cheering.

390
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,180
Yeah. So if you look at it, I mean, our current situation of global warming,

391
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:38,660
you could say that greenhouse gas emissions are is unintentional geoengineering and of that lends any kind of attempt to reverse.

392
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,290
It isn't so much shape or form engineer.

393
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:46,580
And so like I say, I'm against geoengineering, but like I'm for a fourth station and like these other kind of methods I would.

394
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:53,780
The one in hostility against is like the sulfur emissions or the solar reflectivity, simply because like, I think ultimately,

395
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,280
I mean, it took us close to 40 years to get any kind of consensus on climate change even being a problem.

396
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,880
And it's going to take a lot longer to even consider having a like the facility that would

397
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,820
be the global thermostat and I think even gets a little bit more desperate or terrifying.

398
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,080
If you think of it like we're it doesn't mean it doesn't need to be a global effort to cloud seed.

399
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:20,570
For example, a single country could do that. And so let's say if there's not enough action on climate change,

400
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:26,000
a island nation or a country that feels will have a lot to lose could easily try to concede or convert.

401
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,390
If there is some kind of closing operation to turn the temperature down,

402
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,930
a country could maybe try to destabilize that or stop it if they wanted water.

403
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,280
And so I feel like ultimately it's kicking the can down the road and condense future generations to

404
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:45,390
potentially a worse problem because we don't want to pay for the consequences of our own actions.

405
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:50,740
Bridget, I also think about like the forestation like aspect of X like that sounds like a great idea,

406
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:56,810
but I'm just thinking of like if you're planting a new tree that that takes so long to actually grow.

407
00:45:56,810 --> 00:46:00,770
And if you're trying to establish a new force that takes so long like so much

408
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:05,360
maintenance to actually get it into like a stable force that you don't have to like,

409
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,590
maintain yourself. So it doesn't seem like the best solution to me.

410
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,520
And I heard problems with companies like when they say they're planting trees,

411
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,070
they're really just like preserving the section of the forest, and then that ends up getting burned down by wildfires anyway.

412
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,290
So then it's kind of like, All right. Not solving the problem, really?

413
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:32,030
Yeah, yeah. Rebecca. Yeah, along the lines, I think some of the points that you get scrutiny of that like bringing in

414
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:38,750
non-native species in order to plant trees can cause a lot of other problems.

415
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:45,480
And I think like the scale of tree planting that you need to make an actual difference.

416
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:54,840
Like we don't have the land where we do this tree planting and ecosystems like.

417
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:05,070
Makes sense. Sure. Planting forests, and so I think it's part of the solution, but the tree planting is not like.

418
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:09,540
Enough. Yeah. And it's the mild defense of 3.3 million God.

419
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:15,840
And if you look at life with divorced at the top of the world and productive land like obviously some degree of planting,

420
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,650
but it's definitely not going to be the catch. All that might get us a couple of percentage of greenhouse gas emissions.

421
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,930
But when you do look at Amazon and heat rising a lot of forest it normally we're

422
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:28,950
carbon sinks are turning to sources because although the kind of stuff it's like,

423
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:34,740
it's obvious. Yeah, I think it's just often overstated how easy it is.

424
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:42,150
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Like you said, just like you're living in a lot of like tree planting properties don't actually get.

425
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:49,290
Yeah. And so I think that our efforts like we better put our efforts towards stopping deforestation

426
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:57,880
of existing like maturity systems that are already doing a lot of carbon rather than saying,

427
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:08,950
OK, you know, chop down these trees. Here's the problem we have something from the.

428
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,780
So what about what about some of the folks who were, you know, kind of firmly for geoengineering?

429
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:21,040
What are you, what are you most excited about and where do you see the, you know, the potential?

430
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,660
I just think my hope for the world is just not there anymore.

431
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,820
I'm like, Geoengineering seems like a good little Band-Aid we can kind of look forward to.

432
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:36,850
And maybe that can solve some issues. But I guess I'm kind of like, I'm like, I can see both sides past the sea.

433
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,580
There's a lot of issues that we don't know what's going on with the geoengineering,

434
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:47,410
but generally kind of seems like one thing I won't like maybe with like, not us not doing anything with climate change for so long.

435
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:54,390
Maybe we can have that for like just a little bit of hope that we could stop kick the can down the road farther.

436
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,890
But I don't see us being able to solve the issue really at all.

437
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:03,790
Yeah, yeah. You know, OK.

438
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,960
I think it looks grim to really try to reduce anything below two Celsius at this point.

439
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,370
And like I think the dangerous part of I'm talking about like a tech solution to attack the

440
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:16,660
problem almost because it's thinking about engineering and kind of gets us off scot free,

441
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:23,680
too. Well, we don't have to worry about it or we can still. I mean, a lot of junior scientists are actually somewhat funded by fossil fuel companies.

442
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:30,910
That allows them to kind of part of the narrative that we can keep. To some extent, pumping out carbon because we have this fix for it.

443
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:36,490
And yeah, ExxonMobil, all the commercials are like kind of negative now.

444
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:45,540
All the initiatives like will global carbon removal and they just kind of switch the narrative to like, look at us, we're doing all right.

445
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:51,400
If you get like the carbon budget, like we can't burn like it's something like most of all the reserves they're like.

446
00:49:51,400 --> 00:50:02,950
Currently, my fossil fuels the game itself because if we burn it for affordable countries.

447
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:08,660
Any any other comments or questions that folks have around this?

448
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:17,290
Yeah, well, I think I like paying backing off of that too, where it's like a tech solution to, you know, other stuff that I mean,

449
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:23,680
that's part of the reason why you get, like some, you know, is and you get a lot of people that are like, you know,

450
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,390
get grandstanding for like, you know, long periods of time over, like sort of like,

451
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:34,780
I think my favorite port taxes from this past year was way like Forestry Service Person was

452
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:40,150
asked about the feasibility of like change or like altering the Moon's orbit or council year.

453
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,930
So to avert climate change?

454
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,100
Yeah.

455
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:56,160
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's good that kind of situation, like you could just, you know, address the actual air problem there, you know, not, you know.

456
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:03,520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Andrea, I think it should be an area that we do put some money for research into,

457
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:11,740
like especially with like if you could include it in private agreements like maybe an aspect that we work on, like collaboratively as a nation.

458
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,470
But I do see like the potential issues for sure.

459
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:22,960
Like I think they mentioned how it can even be used by the military, potentially, which is definitely not a good thing.

460
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,960
Um, other than that, I guess I want to learn more about it nonsense.

461
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:37,590
Interesting. I think solutions like they said, sun blocking or shielding, like that's a good possible solution, but I agree.

462
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:46,380
Someone mentioned how the more extreme options sound. Dangerous, and I agree it could go wrong, and then what do we do at that point?

463
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,750
Right, right, right. Go back at Bridget. No, that's interesting.

464
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,640
They didn't really talk about like the least controversial, which is like carbon capture.

465
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:04,170
I thought that was really kind of a slam dunk for the front group. But I mean, like, I don't want technology to be proven yet.

466
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:08,820
And like I think currently some of our plans kind of based on negative carbon removal,

467
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:14,640
which is interesting but mostly interested in the program, consider what to do.

468
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:23,580
But when you mention climate agreements and pretty sure all of the scenarios for reduction do include assuming that we can do something that.

469
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:38,310
I guess we're going. Yeah, I mean, I guess I have a couple of thoughts and I mean, thanks for the discussion,

470
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:44,250
this was this was great to the companies in the debate and then everything you brought forth.

471
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:50,130
It's really considering, you know, kind of the things that we're discussing in class right here on the environment and health, right?

472
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:54,360
And the pros and cons of both sides of this question.

473
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:04,570
And you know, as I mentioned before, the debate topics were chosen specifically to be not not easy decisions.

474
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:12,780
There's there's fair arguments on both sides. So it's it's OK that, you know, varying viewpoints come in,

475
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,570
but they kind of leaving my area of expertize and just being a person who's concerned about stuff.

476
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:26,820
And you know, so you know, with the caveat that this is, you know, not where I have, where I'm admittedly well-informed,

477
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:36,330
but the the combination of the technology on either side, the fact that it's going to require huge investment.

478
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:43,530
Right. I mean, you know, we're following the news about congressional bills and like, pick your big number, right?

479
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:53,520
Like what and what impresses you? I don't know. Let's say when the legislation comes across and is signed for ten trillion dollars, right?

480
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:03,090
That seems like a big number of investment towards and then, you know, pick your side, uh, uh, renewable sources of energy.

481
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:16,530
Right. So that we can cut off that, that emissions fossett or, you know, sequestration sink geoengineering, you know, whatever it is, I and actually,

482
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:23,670
I cut off the discussion that came up last night when we were discussing when the debate ended is, you know,

483
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:33,120
and I think, Josh, you you you kind of hit it now that reducing emissions seems like a pretty low bar, right?

484
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,650
I mean, technology, right? And in terms of like, what can we do?

485
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,970
We actually have alternatives. They do cost money.

486
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:50,130
So it's basically agreeing on how much are we willing to spend right to have these alternative sources of energy.

487
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:57,180
But technology wise, like it's feasible. It's doable, but there is a lobby, right?

488
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:02,670
That's that's pouring money into the decision makers that says, Well, we don't really want to do that because,

489
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:07,140
you know, it's going to cost this job and that job and these bad things are going to happen.

490
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:11,700
And it's pretty easy, right to say, Well, yeah, we should, uh,

491
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:23,790
probably not do that if somehow the you know that money is put into geoengineering, right?

492
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:31,140
Which seems like a much higher bar, right? We don't actually have much that's demonstrated to be effective, right?

493
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:37,020
It's a huge, uh, experiment right at that point with oops,

494
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:44,870
if if the experiment doesn't go well with a potentially huge force, maybe even ramifications.

495
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:48,240
My my fear is that that entire process, right?

496
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,630
Let's say that 10 trillion legislation is being written right is, you know, that's again,

497
00:55:54,630 --> 00:56:01,710
that's where it's like heavily influenced by by lobbyists that are basically writing the text, right?

498
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:08,730
And then it's just this huge cash grab at that point, there's no, you know, what's the consequence of this,

499
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:14,430
you know, billions of dollars that are sent to this group, that group and whatnot to do it?

500
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:27,900
Oh, and it didn't work. Darn it, right? I mean, I I I'm I have uh, I have strong concerns from from that kind of geopolitical, um, dynamic.

501
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:37,780
And yeah, if we if we can actually agree with them with the low bar option of OK, we really need to turn off the emissions forces.

502
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:48,740
How would he, you know, as a as an international body, how would agreement be reached on on, you know, geoengineering approaches?

503
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,860
Because certainly some are going to have benefits regionally, right?

504
00:56:52,860 --> 00:57:00,990
Greater benefits over others. And of course, you know, whoever is putting forth, you know, most of the cash to make this happen is going to point to,

505
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,860
well, you know, yeah, at least we can't fix it all at once, but we can start to address it.

506
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:10,620
And at least, you know, this region will begin to have some mitigating benefits.

507
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:16,500
I don't know what folks think. I'm offering this up as my, you know, uninformed opinion.

508
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:21,270
What do you folks think about this? Not to say like your worst fears are coming true,

509
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:29,730
but always prefer the one trillion dollar bill that passed or the projected 3.5 bigger one can remember.

510
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:34,410
A substantial amount of the grain money or like the climate change money was put into hydrogen fuel cells,

511
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,920
which is like, I guess, a promising technology.

512
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,180
However, I'm pretty plugged in and I've never heard and it would be like hydrogen fuel cells is the way,

513
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,980
like we have solar panels and also the kind of stuff.

514
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:49,500
So kind of it's kind of a disconnect between what the scientists are saying and where our congressional money is going.

515
00:57:49,500 --> 00:58:00,740
So that's a good outlook. You don't want me to do my part to raise the question of equity.

516
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,550
And so when which nations are going to be really important,

517
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:12,680
these technologies and the one who also allocated and where those consequences ending up so I can very easily see.

518
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:19,800
Problems in nations that are less have less of that, and their health issues are more like clean water and sanitation.

519
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,490
I would like. I just had a pile on to that.

520
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:28,280
Absolutely, yeah. Great point where you end up, Rebecca.

521
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:35,280
Yeah, I just have like a weird and a totally, you know, I used to work at a social environmental research center,

522
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:42,870
but it's like it's a team of people working on feel like you not not like the engineering solutions,

523
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:49,620
but sort of like the politics around geoengineering. And they have this meeting where they did like a simulation of like what would the

524
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:55,620
to political decision making process for geoengineering look like where they like,

525
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:00,810
literally divided, but like a conference of like 20 people into two groups.

526
00:59:00,810 --> 00:59:09,510
And they had one of those an electric knife that they put before and basically went through this decision making

527
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:18,360
process until it ended in like a literal fight on the floor of plugging the electric electric knife represents.

528
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:25,740
Do you want to be able to create the point of it was that like once one country decides to do it, there's the electric knife.

529
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:34,800
Yeah, like if it was just like a fascinating story, but like that if we had inside of me just like escalating decision making.

530
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:45,070
And yeah, it's a very difficult thing to do it because it's like critically with the solar radiation, like, yeah, if one country decides to do it, it.

531
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:53,060
It is absolutely appalling record, it's likely to be published on paper with different scenarios for geoengineering,

532
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:58,720
and they came out of that fight over knife.

533
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:08,020
I think there's a book that goes the line of fear geoengineering pulled under a white sky, but I think they're in recliner.

534
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,830
Elizabeth Kolbert. I could get that wrong. And it's really interesting.

535
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:16,360
It kind of starts by saying, like, we've already engineered with a lot of features that you won't think about.

536
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:16,810
For example,

537
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:25,780
we made this recipe flow backwards near Chicago by installing one of the Great Lakes of change that an invasive species and also the kind of stuff.

538
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:33,580
And it's like, got an interested in what we agree is OK and reasonable engineering versus obviously I'm up against like that,

539
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,530
just putting sulfur into the air.

540
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:43,030
But it's very interesting dynamic of when you kind of think about what is engineering, what isn't and what helps us, what's harmful.

541
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:49,150
A lot of it's harmful indirectly. So yeah, it kind of goes back to your point, Rebecca, about the planting trees.

542
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:54,710
You know, I think it's there's a lot of that just I mean, for general citizenry, it's the fear of the unknown, right?

543
01:00:54,710 --> 01:01:00,490
Something that's a known quantity. It's just inherently less scary or fearful, right?

544
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:05,590
So the argument of, hey, we can, we can plant more trees, right?

545
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:11,500
And this is like, you know, companies, that's their green contribution, right?

546
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:16,410
And that's a very, you know, tangible and understandable. And most of the population, right?

547
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:24,320
I don't think there's I don't think maybe there is, you know, any types of groups that are really against planting trees, right?

548
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:30,790
I mean, it's like one hundred percent safe, you know, from a political perspective.

549
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:39,040
But yeah, no, it's a good point, Josh. We've we we've certainly done some things and there no one at this point, right?

550
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:47,220
And so they're accepted because of that.

551
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:53,910
All right, well, hey, thanks so much for I know this is a little bit nontraditional, you know, the Zoom recording debate.

552
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:59,000
I was super happy, though, that I was able to, you know, have this kind of.

553
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,280
But instead of being completely asynchronous to be able to meet up with this group once a week and kind of keep them in step with,

554
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,990
you know, what we're doing in class and you know,

555
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:13,950
they would watch all the recordings and all of the the discussion, just like, you know, they'll hopefully be doing right now after this one.

556
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:22,410
Um, like can we say I want to go back to this reminder really quickly on the debate instructions document?

557
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:32,100
If you haven't yet done so, please complete Page four, which is an evaluation of your debate team members and email that to me,

558
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:40,690
ideally by the end of the day today, if not, maybe early in the day tomorrow.

559
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:47,320
And I think that's it. Do folks have any questions at this point, you know, you can leave the debate topics and, you know,

560
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:58,570
anything that we've discussed over the course of this semester, you know, comments questions that are just kind of like lingering.

561
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:04,840
Are there any like logical follow up classes or like an exposure sites to class or something?

562
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:13,600
It's curious. Yeah. I mean, the easy answer is no, there's not an exposure science to course.

563
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:24,520
I know you're in the physical hazards course, Josh. There are some individual courses on chemical hazards and biological agents and physical

564
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:33,530
hazards that go off on a on a more detailed tangent on each of those topics that you could,

565
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:37,810
you know, make the case to kind of stem from the material covered in this course.

566
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:43,450
So if anyone's interested in those, I think the both the chemical and physical hazards courses,

567
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:48,250
our fall semester courses, the biological agents courses is next winter.

568
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:59,500
So if that's of interest to anyone and then I mentioned previously, you know, and this is from my own perspective,

569
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:04,360
this is a pretty good introduction to a lot of the environmental exposure issues,

570
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:09,910
you know, both in communities as well as in occupational or workplace settings.

571
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:17,620
And where it kind of leaves off in my mind is like, OK, we see where all the challenges are, what's really in front of us.

572
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:28,420
Is this how to do a better job and what most of the challenges are at that point are in policy and regulation and standards, right?

573
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:35,770
And improvements and all of them. So this environmental health policy class that I that I teach, it's offered in the winter.

574
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:40,780
You know, you might view that as a as some sort of a it's not exposure science too,

575
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:50,820
but as some sort of at least in my mind, it's intended to be kind of a logical follow up.

576
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:56,940
That's no matter. It is, yeah, it's a two credit class, it's five ninety seven.

577
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:09,530
Tuesday's one two three and I know that the whole, you know, schedule conflict is like a nightmare for all of you in terms of managing your schedule.

578
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,670
Any other quick? Sorry, did you say that every year? I do.

579
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:20,620
Yeah. So it's yeah, traditionally every winter and it's been in that same timeslot for a few years now.

580
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:29,950
You know. Any other questions about anything?

581
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:36,430
All right, so, hey, I just kind of conclude by thanking you for your for your engagement.

582
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:40,270
It's been an absolute pleasure to have you all here. I totally I've said this before.

583
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:44,620
I look forward to coming to class, right? So much better than all the other stuff that I do.

584
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:55,210
It's part of my job, so I genuinely appreciate, you know, all your effort in this, you know, still continuing craziness of the world right now.

585
01:05:55,210 --> 01:06:01,060
I know that you've all managed a ton over the course of this semester, you know, outside of your your class work.

586
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,360
And again, keep up the good work, right?

587
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,160
I hope you feel like you learned something in this course from my youth. I'm super happy.

588
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:18,070
You know, everyone has done really, really well. I wish you a successful finish to your to your semester here over the next week or so.

589
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:24,100
And a happy and healthy and absolutely well-deserved holiday break.

590
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:29,300
And I hope to see some of you in the new year. Thanks so much, guys.

591
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,771
Thank you.
