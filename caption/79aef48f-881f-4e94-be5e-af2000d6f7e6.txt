1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,710
So we are very fortunate to live.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:16,929
You go to have Christian Van Mendelsohn to speak to us not only about principles of high level

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,270
disinfection and sterilization and give you an idea of what the afternoon is with the pager.

4
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,210
Oh, Christian, I got this way. I have it on tabs.

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,590
And you can just click on that, and then I'll make this big and.

6
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,240
But we have a tour of the.

7
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,280
That's the fun. That is a fun part. How many of you seen a tour like that?

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,910
A few, yeah. Well, anyway, and I apologize in advance.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,440
So I had I was in bed most of yesterday with the cold, so I never had a fever.

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,120
But I got real tired, and I feel fine this morning, but I think I'm going to go home just to be smart.

11
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,450
It's not I do know it's not going to the attention they get you want.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,260
But, you know, a lot of your colleagues have told me that they have they woke up this morning sick.

13
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,890
So something has gone around.

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,790
Something is going on. All right.

15
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,360
Well, thanks so much for sure, everybody. I tried doing this with my new glasses that I can see you guys.

16
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,370
They also can read with fancy. Like, that's, like, really easy because all I have is reading glasses, but usually I'm going like this.

17
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,590
I like it anyway. Oh, okay.

18
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:53,799
I did that one. Too advanced, does it do I push the button or is it an arrow by the number on the top where it says page,

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,520
you can do the arrow on the screen with the mouse.

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,550
Oh, okay. Yeah, I've got it. The easiest way to do it. Okay. All right.

21
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,750
How do I go? So trying to make it so that you be able to zoom out.

22
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,770
Now zoom in. Yeah. There you go. That's a little better.

23
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:22,340
Okay. Okay, we need to be there. Okay, so I'm going to talk today about CSP.

24
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,500
Does anyone I know a few of you might know what that means, but do you know what CSP stands for?

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,540
I mean, I'm going to. Because you guys today. No, no, you know the answer.

26
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,150
I would. Okay, it's. And I know, I know, I'm know.

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,920
But go ahead. You are absolutely right.

28
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,630
Central sterile processing department, some people just call it as PDS, sterile processing department,

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,380
which is kind of probably more apt because usually there's like multiple central sterile processing departments.

30
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,590
But we're also that is one of the places we're going to go today.

31
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:12,550
And the other is the another acronym that probably almost no hospitals have is called C, e, r d, which is central and a scope reprocessing department.

32
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:22,180
So that's a really unique place. I don't think there's very many of them across the world where they just focus on high level disinfection.

33
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,640
But we're going to talk about device reprocessing.

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:34,230
And the part about the pager is what happens when device reprocessing doesn't work the way we want it to.

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,600
So we'll talk about that, too. So my name's Kristin.

36
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:46,030
I'm a project manager in Infection Prevention, and I actually am a page grad from 1994.

37
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,130
And Dr. Massoud was. I worked in Dr. Massoud's labs.

38
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:56,430
Oh, is that right? Yeah. For actually through my whole speech and actually undergrad part of it too.

39
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,560
So I worked there with. Yeah, I love it.

40
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,480
Yeah. So there's lots of issues that go go wrong.

41
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,950
The main issue we're worried about is we want to prevent infections or not cause infections.

42
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:19,330
And some of these are, you know, when they make the news, it's a really big deal.

43
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,569
There actually was one just, you know,

44
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,270
a few years ago where there was a big reprocessing problem in Detroit at one of the

45
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,429
hospitals and it was related to their central sterile processing and something going wrong.

46
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,129
And actually, I'm not remembering exactly what the issue was,

47
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,850
but there's so many things that can go wrong and a lot of them are related to endoscopies.

48
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,809
So when they say medical scope, people don't always know what endoscopes are,

49
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:55,389
but they're the things that go up one end and both ends like a colonoscopy uses.

50
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:00,549
And and so those are very, very hard to clean devices.

51
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:08,890
There are long tubes and really like kind of amazing that we actually can clean them between patient uses.

52
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,470
They sometimes some of the kaleidoscopes are like eight feet long in a small tube like that.

53
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,520
And so you have to go in with a brush that fits the whole tube.

54
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,290
So you have to go in from both ends of this scope to make sure the brush can reach.

55
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:33,760
It's really very difficult to do perfectly and not I'm not to scare you away from any endoscopies in your future,

56
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:41,590
but but one thing I do know is that we have come a long way with what we expect from our reprocessing staff.

57
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:52,120
And they have to be they have to go through a bunch of certifications, a bunch of training, and there's now mandated just starting actually this year.

58
00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:00,010
And all high risk scopes are need to have what we call post cleaning verification.

59
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,860
So that means that they have to do a test on every scope after washing it to

60
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,899
see if there's residual protein or there's different tests that are options.

61
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:17,460
But the one that we'll use is residual protein and we'll use ATP, which you will learn more about ATP in a couple weeks.

62
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,999
So and so there's a lot I could talk about.

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,569
So this is a picture of one of our speeds.

64
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,570
We're actually going to go here later. So you guys will see this.

65
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:37,750
This is my favorite CSP. It's our children's and women's hospital and it's really nice being really well organized.

66
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,350
I think it's it's a really good example.

67
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:52,460
That's what I meant to say for all the others. Some of them, though, have a lot of problems with storage and size.

68
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,910
They're trying to do more instruments than they actually have room to really manage.

69
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,750
And we always outgrow our facilities, and that's a problem.

70
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,209
We don't tend to think ahead enough and build things because you don't want to have to go back.

71
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,250
It's multiple millions of dollars to renovate a place like this with all the equipment and stuff like that.

72
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,290
But we'll go here. This is a lot of what it looks like in both the storage and this is a sterilizer right here in the wall.

73
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:27,059
So the sterilize sterilization process there's, as I said, very strict standards for monitoring.

74
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,750
There have been for forever a lot of different monitors.

75
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,740
But the new one for endoscopes is an important one because a lot of those outbreaks that you'll see in the news are related to the scopes.

76
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,090
So heat and steam autoclaves are the most common way of sterilizing items.

77
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,610
How many people have used? Inadequate. If you worked in the lab, you might have.

78
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,950
Yeah. So a lot of people say it's basically the same thing, but we have to be even more careful once we remove the things from out of clay.

79
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,890
So how you handle the things that you just sterilized is extra,

80
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,720
extra important when it's going to be used on someone during surgery or something like that.

81
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,520
We used to have gas sterilization at our hospital.

82
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,319
This is also the first year that we have no more gas sterilization, ethylene oxide.

83
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,520
So it is no more. And at U of M and there's a lot of reasons for that.

84
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:27,090
But the nice thing about gas sterilization is that it can penetrate because it's a gas in lots of places that it's harder for steam to go.

85
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,510
Just surprising that there's that much difference. But then also it doesn't require temperature, high temperature.

86
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,589
So you could do things that would melt in a autoclave.

87
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,830
You could sterilize them with gas. It's gone now because environmentally it is very hazardous.

88
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:53,130
Safety wise, it can be a hazard, although really I think I have not heard of any accidents related to the gas, but it's toxic gas.

89
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,170
So it not only kills germs, it it's really bad for people, too.

90
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,650
So it is no more. And actually, I think federal rules were going to take it away pretty soon anyway.

91
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,980
So we got rid of ours. It is decommissioned.

92
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,590
We haven't re utilized the space.

93
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:17,819
So that's the fun part is we get to actually make something out of that space where these things were and then there is plasma gas sterilization,

94
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,670
which is hydrogen peroxide with ion forming ions.

95
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:33,540
And I don't really understand how it works, but it basically I think it messes with the DNA of the back maybe,

96
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:41,429
you know, let's it you know how that would work. I don't know. You know, I know it does.

97
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,389
It kills germs. It isn't just a surface disinfectant.

98
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,260
Right. But in this case, they're actually ionizing it. So like, yeah, there's like electrical currents and stuff like that.

99
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,840
But I don't really understand.

100
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:03,030
I learned a lot about that science, but it works and we use that for certain things that also can't handle high temperature or pressure,

101
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,540
but it's usually very small pieces of equipment.

102
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,299
They I don't think they've figured out how to make giant things that you can move a lot of materials through.

103
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,010
So that's part of the problem is throughput. You can't fit a lot of things in those machines.

104
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,710
So sterilization is typically typically done in a centralized department.

105
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,649
Autoclaves are the most common. They do a bunch of things besides just use autoclaves.

106
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,490
They often wash and inspect the interim instruments.

107
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,299
They have to make sure they produce sterile sterilization.

108
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,940
Many metal instruments have to be oiled, which sounds gross, but it's like safe oil.

109
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:48,780
It's things that can touch the body even within the surgery. And that's before you sterilize they wrap.

110
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,040
And we have both paper wrapping and metal containers for sterilization and then

111
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,690
they have to check the sterilization process with our parameters and monitors.

112
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:09,720
So we'll talk some more about that. You know, I up in instruments not typically but we do have outside companies come in to sharpen.

113
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:16,800
And so they really when our PD notices something that they do inspect it for sharpness.

114
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,499
I think they actually cut things. We can have them show us.

115
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:27,240
They have like little special cutting things that test whether something is sharp enough to cut tissue or that they want it sharp enough.

116
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:33,720
So if it's not, they pull it out and they save it and they either send it out for sharpening or

117
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,170
we have people come in like on the weekend and like do a bunch of sharpening.

118
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:44,160
So it's a good question. So yeah, there's chemical monitors and biological.

119
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,500
What do you guys think is the gold standard for monitoring for autoclaves?

120
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,610
Does anybody know? I don't know if you do it. Typically in a lab.

121
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,840
I used to use the labs over in medicine or the autoclaves in med psi.

122
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,430
But I don't know. I don't know if you have to do biological monitors, but what do you what do you think that is testing for?

123
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,620
Something. I guess it's biological.

124
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,680
So checking to see that you killed something in back when I was in your shoes.

125
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,230
It took three days to grow out.

126
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,139
It was a certain type of bacteria. It's usually a bacillus sterile, three month sterile.

127
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,220
Thermopolis was the typical one. And it's a sport farming bacteria.

128
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:43,780
So you want to find the hardest to kill bacteria, one that is also very heat labial rainbird.

129
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,700
And so it's it's pretty hardy.

130
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,290
And so that's like the worst case scenario that you're trying to kill this germ that's really resistant to steam and pressure.

131
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,990
And it used to take three days. Got it. We'll talk about it. But it's shocking how fast they can do it.

132
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,870
And I don't know, they must have some test for the bacteria being able to metabolize that.

133
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,380
They're able to sense without it actually multiplying really fast, which is amazing.

134
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,599
So we'll talk about that. So we use biological managed indicators.

135
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,310
They're called to monitor the effectiveness of the Sterilizers test for the actual kill.

136
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,540
And you want to put it in the hardest to reach spot in the autoclave.

137
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:34,760
So it's like you want to find like they they come in packs and they also come in individual tubes and you want it to be really difficult.

138
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,480
You use those biological indicators for every load load of the autoclave containing an implant.

139
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:51,530
So something that might be put into a body during surgery. The other things chemical monitors do is a more visual and quick read.

140
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:57,710
So you would know right away if you pulled a load out of the autoclave and the chemical indicators weren't changed.

141
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,760
You wouldn't have you wouldn't have to do any other, you know, checking.

142
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:09,140
You could tell, right, visually from indicator color change that it did not reach the right temperature and pressure.

143
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,819
So that's nice. It's a quick check. There's multiple checks.

144
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,440
So the biological indicator usually comes in this little tube and I'll show you some pictures.

145
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,010
A chemical into indicators also called an integrator.

146
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,790
I don't know why, but it's this little teeny strip that has a thing that changes color when it's exposed to heat.

147
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,700
I don't think it senses pressure at all. Yeah.

148
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,069
And then it's, you know, it's you use it every load, every time and in every package.

149
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:51,350
So in these big giant autoclaves, you could fit, you know, maybe hundreds of instruments and maybe 20 instrument trays, potentially.

150
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:59,030
So you put an end chemical indicator inside each of those before so that when it's opened, when you open it in surgery,

151
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,809
there's that visual right there because they don't they don't see the biological

152
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,440
indicator that's someone else is checking that and central processing,

153
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,140
but they can see that this color change happened.

154
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:16,070
So it's just one extra indicator, this process challenge devices, the pack comes, we buy it as a pack.

155
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,390
It's got biological indicators and steam challenge indicators.

156
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,960
And so it tells you whether you've effectively both caused the pressure change in the heat.

157
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:34,700
So it's a it's a also a useful one. And you use that in the chamber at least once a day.

158
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,139
And I think they do it, yeah, at least once a day.

159
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:47,360
I think it's the process challenge and then you use a biological indicator with it to some places.

160
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,120
Do it now with every run of the sterilizer, definitely all implant loads.

161
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,460
And actually I think at least weekly is I need to update that it's at least daily now.

162
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,689
So it's so easy to do now that I better change that.

163
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,940
So yeah, the biological indicators at least daily, we'll have them tell us more about that.

164
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,690
And then there's another visual indicator that's on the outside of the package.

165
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:22,700
So it can either be right in the paper packaging of the as you can see down here, this well, this would have started off kind of faint blue or yellow.

166
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,320
And then the integrator is the one that goes inside the packet.

167
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,910
So those also check. I keep wanting to do the other here.

168
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,989
So the spa test is the gold standard. It's a it's non pathogenic.

169
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:46,130
So it's a certain species that if somehow it contaminated or escaped it's a vial, it's really a non pathogenic species.

170
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:54,710
Yeah. And his daily for that it again I already said that we do keep track of that and we actually now have almost,

171
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:02,090
almost all of our things are barcoded now and so they can scan the biological indicator, scan the sterilizer.

172
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:09,460
So, you know, the actual date time, the actual lot number is all in that they don't have to do very much.

173
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:17,200
Writing anywhere. We used to have these books of paper and like have to keep the books for like seven years or something and like kind of ridiculous.

174
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,929
I don't know where they used to store it, but someone's office and now it's all electronic and you can pull it up.

175
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:28,959
So like when we have an inspection with our people that come to make sure we're doing everything right,

176
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:38,590
joint commission, they can say, I want to see your biological indicator for your load run between ten and 12 yesterday.

177
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,990
Mr. Slicer And they just pull it up and it's there and and I'll have all that stuff.

178
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,580
And then they scan their badge so they know which person read the indicator and read this stuff.

179
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,580
So. So it's nice. Very, very simple.

180
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,940
So this is our new rapid biological indicator.

181
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,600
I think we use these in all of our speeds, but well, maybe we can ask them if they use this.

182
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,310
There's multiple brands, but I think this particular one is the most common super fast.

183
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,210
So it it comes back in 24 minutes.

184
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,860
They barely can move the thing out of the room.

185
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:21,370
You know, they do sometimes, but they they would hold an implant load for 24 minutes.

186
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,310
And it's feasible now that they can hold on to it until they know the final result, which is just amazing.

187
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:35,859
It kind of makes us have a lot less pager problems on Friday afternoons because what the we'll talk lot about the pager issue,

188
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,470
but it used to be that they got a biological indicator back that didn't work.

189
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:47,500
So we'd be like, Oh, we had four loads run after this one didn't do it.

190
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:54,490
So it's kill time didn't show it's kill. We have to recall all of those instruments, find where they went.

191
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,110
Some of them are already in used in surgery. We have to monitor those patients.

192
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:05,620
We have to notify the patients messy. So it's really great that they can find it out so quickly.

193
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:13,719
It almost prevents all of those potential errors. And then the boy tech tests just test for pressure.

194
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,970
And it is very specific to the pressure.

195
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:25,870
And you put it in a certain spot in the sterilizer where the pressure is most likely to be the least preferable.

196
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,459
So there's a certain spot in each sterilizer that they tell you where to put this particular test,

197
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,120
and it comes in a packet and I think it just has a color change.

198
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,290
So it's pretty nifty. Oh, and now we have I think they change these names all the time.

199
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,890
So it used to be called just bacillus and now it's geo bacillus.

200
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,700
And I'm trying to keep up on these things. There's one for dry heat.

201
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,149
So there are dry heat autoclaves that don't incorporate steam.

202
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:58,990
Steam adds, as you can imagine, another element of kill that just dry heat, doesn't it?

203
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,430
So there's a different form, different form of bacillus that's used for dry heat.

204
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:16,960
Ito had its own bacillus spores, and then for the low temperature, sterilization is still use the sterile novelist's version, a little bit of micro.

205
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,450
So I'm just trying to make sure that in our interconnectors.

206
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:31,660
Yes. So we have a lot of documenting. Everything has to be matched to its indicators, to its sterilizer, to the person who loaded it.

207
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,750
And all of this stuff is now done electronically and we just have barcodes and it's really nice.

208
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,639
Like they have barcodes on people's badges.

209
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:48,340
They just scan their badge, scan the but by strip and then it's just like goes to its place, which is pretty nice.

210
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,800
It makes it much less painful job it is. So they used to have to like it.

211
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:59,020
So when we have logbooks and there's actually like it requires you to scan.

212
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:05,440
If you don't scan, you can't proceed. Like you can't really like keep going down the line in the process.

213
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,139
So it'll tell you, like you missed a step.

214
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:14,350
You didn't scan this when we used to have to do paper locks, which I know you guys are probably like, Yeah, why would you care?

215
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:20,319
But paper logs, people skip steps, they miss filling out them and we would get in trouble all the time.

216
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,219
Probably they did everything, but they forgot to document it.

217
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,440
So it's like so much better now. A lot less headaches for that.

218
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,650
And then have you guys ever heard of I use SS?

219
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,710
Probably not. It's called it stands for intermediate use steam sterilization.

220
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:49,780
And basically what that is is is another term for what we used to call flash sterilization basically almost never should be used,

221
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,009
but it is sometimes required if you have a problem like,

222
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,030
say, during surgery,

223
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:03,819
someone drops an instrument that's critical for that particular surgery and you have no other duplicate duplicates ready and sterilized,

224
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,690
ready to be used. So we hate to think of that, but they'll wait.

225
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,380
You know, the person's on the table. Usually cut open and they're like, We dropped that.

226
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,820
Okay, go quickly sterilize it and bring it right back. So this is a shortened cycle time.

227
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,899
It would not be we would not want to use it for implants.

228
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,880
And I think for implants, they just wait longer for the whole, you know,

229
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,549
whole thing because you don't you really want to make sure it's sterile for an implant because that stays in your body.

230
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:40,860
And weird things happen over time when that if that wasn't perfectly sterile.

231
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,229
So it started as a process time and doesn't require drying.

232
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,350
So you're handing it right back to the surgical team.

233
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,850
Sometimes the instrument is still wet. Can you guess why we don't want to have wet instruments delivered to the surgery?

234
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,730
If they're still wet, they can draw.

235
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:14,140
So things kind of are drawn to that moisture. And if it's a paper wrap, it can actually whisk things through the paper.

236
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,360
So this paper is porous and it's really high tech paper that they wraps instruments in.

237
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:26,610
I am curious actually to see what it looks like on a like my electron microscope or something.

238
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:33,370
It's got little holes all through it so that steam can pass through, but once it gets hot, it closes.

239
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,090
So those holes kind of kind of shrink and so things can't fit through anymore.

240
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:49,780
So but if we wet it, certainly things can wick through just like, you know, any piece of cloth or anything like that paper.

241
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,590
So if it's still wet when you're handling it and pushing things onto it, it's not going to be sterile anymore.

242
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:08,499
When you're flash sterilizing, they always would do it in a pan excuse me, a pan that you would handle with like hot pans, basically,

243
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,950
because it's still going to be really hot and they're handing it off and then

244
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,100
they have to let it sit in the air for a minute before they can handle it.

245
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,070
So it's it's just not quite as is perfectly secure, sterile, you know,

246
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:26,950
like we're not as certain that they we try to give them the weight for that by result.

247
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:34,660
But sometimes you can't do that. 24 minutes is still a long time when a person is cut open on the operating room table.

248
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,870
So and then we get really in trouble if we do do this very often.

249
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,790
So you're really supposed to have enough backup instruments that if you drop one, you still have one on the shelf.

250
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:50,140
It's sterile. The normal way that's processed the normal way.

251
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:58,930
When we don't, it shows that you're not thinking ahead enough to know that you're going to need these and that you're just kind of skimping.

252
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:07,210
And it rarely happens. We have really good, really low rates of ICU assess, but some hospitals have a lot higher rates.

253
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,120
So here's some pictures. We're going to go see these people.

254
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,840
So I don't need to spend a ton of time, but you can see they're wearing a lot of protective equipment.

255
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,850
The top pictures are the wash line. So they have a lot of spraying.

256
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,310
We're going to try to stay a little bit away from them because yeah,

257
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,230
I don't know how busy it'll be when we get there, but we don't want to get sprayed.

258
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:36,099
Will wear PPE, but we're trying to stay back a little bit so we don't need to get in there.

259
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,470
So they're washing surgical instruments, other types of things that get sterilized.

260
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:49,000
And then these are the instrument washers, so you can put a rack up and so they hand spray everything,

261
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:56,800
put it into these special racks, and then it goes through our instrument washer, which is like a giant dishwasher.

262
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:04,299
And but it also has a very special rinse that where it rinses with extra clean water so

263
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:12,070
filtered or d ionized water because you don't want to leave a lot of like I guess just,

264
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:18,460
you know, elemental things on, you know, you don't want like hard water stains and stuff on these things.

265
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,440
Regular water isn't sterile. Yeah, it's not straight water.

266
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,510
But because they're still going to go through the autoclave, but it's extra processed.

267
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:41,330
And here's some people working in setting up the trays before they go in the sterilizer and people taking stuff out of the serialize or.

268
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,770
I put a lot of these pictures in because we didn't get to do tours last year, so it's cool.

269
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:59,659
It gets visitors. Yeah. And it also is really nice that they're taking time out to give us a tour because they are really busy at this time of day.

270
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,719
So we'll try to be. We appreciate it.

271
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,100
Yeah, no, it will will thank them many times. So a couple questions.

272
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,360
Which type of indicators go inside of an instrument package?

273
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,600
So the inside do you remember which ones I talked about?

274
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,160
It kind of goes, yeah. And there's, there's that special name.

275
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,420
So there are chemicals that are on the outside. I think this is why it's called that.

276
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,560
It's the integrator and I think it's because it's integrated.

277
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,299
That makes sense. We didn't used to call it that, but it's an appropriate name.

278
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:40,900
So it's the ones that go right. Insights was the chemical integrator. There are chemical tapes and things like that that can be on the outside.

279
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,040
Which of those indicators demonstrates kill?

280
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,350
Remember that biological?

281
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,690
Biological. We call it a BI for short. So you might hear that term.

282
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:04,500
And then which one shows the pressure word that it was what it was supposed to be and that one you kind of flew by that kind of stuff.

283
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:10,750
But we didn't. But we did. Yeah, I'm sure that it is named after whoever created it.

284
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,919
So. So we're going to talk about high level disinfection.

285
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,930
So as I mentioned, the and the scopes.

286
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:25,509
So a lot of and the scopes were almost all of them except for the metal ones cannot be cannot handle going through the autoclave.

287
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:31,959
They would melt. They have often video options or they might have like an ultrasound on them.

288
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,150
There's they're super fancy. So they've got a tip that could have an ultrasound on it.

289
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:43,450
They certainly always have a visual. I don't I don't know what they call that.

290
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,970
A lens, I guess is like a lab for school. Mm hmm.

291
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,420
So there's there's a lot of fancy features with them.

292
00:28:52,420 --> 00:29:00,100
They often have multiple channels, one for, like, flushing water through so that you can clear away the area that you're looking at.

293
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,490
Often they have a suction channel so that they can suction things out.

294
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:10,389
And then they also sometimes have an instrument channel which you can imagine they put little long things

295
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:18,610
through that often have little grasshoppers on the end so that they can take biopsies or even a really tiny,

296
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,910
I guess, knives you would call them to cut things out.

297
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,509
So pretty amazing stuff there. And they're they're not called surgeons that do this for a living.

298
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,469
They're called endoscopy or procedure lists.

299
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:38,020
But I think endoscopies is more appropriate. Pretty amazing how they do that.

300
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,709
It takes a lot of training, like, to understand what you're looking at.

301
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,920
You're in this like you're in the stomach. I mean, how do you even know what you're looking for?

302
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:53,020
You're you're looking at in through this little tiny lens where it's all wet, sometimes bloody,

303
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,250
and they and they know how to see what they're looking for and where to go, like through the different parts of the body.

304
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:09,190
It's pretty amazing. I've watched a few and watched their video screens and I'm like, It all looks the same to me, what they're looking at.

305
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,170
So it's pretty cool.

306
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:19,150
And they also do a lot of things like in the Lung, they might take cultures with the bronchoscope that goes into the lung, that's pretty common.

307
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:27,790
It's a very common one. But there are also really procedures that are we're trying to figure this out as people advance

308
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:33,820
and how they know how to use these devices and the special surgical tools that can go in them.

309
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:40,990
They're actually kind of pushing the limit of what is surgery and what is endoscopy.

310
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,340
And the question for us is where and how do we do these procedures?

311
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:53,470
Is it okay to do them in a room that doesn't have a special air handling and that people might be in street clothes with just a cover gown on or,

312
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,790
you know, you know, a cover up? And it's a really hard question.

313
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:09,070
I don't think we know the answer yet. We have a we have one procedure list in particular that is on the cutting edge of this that he's in.

314
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,750
He wants to do more and more procedures.

315
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:16,840
And we're like, we don't have enough space to do all these procedures you want to do in the type of room that you want to do them.

316
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,970
So we're trying to figure out like what the right choices, like what is the infection risk,

317
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,900
which seems to be pretty low because it's way down in the body.

318
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:35,710
There's no incision from the outside. They're going through that, the mouth or the nose or the colon through the you know, through the anus.

319
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:43,389
But there's no incision, which is part of the problem with surgical site infections, as you said, incisional infections.

320
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,910
But then you could still introduce germs down into the body, in the mucous membranes.

321
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:56,890
And then if you're cutting or even with a biopsy that is kind of cutting and you're exposing yourself to the bloodstream, which should be sterile.

322
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,639
So it's like this very tricky thing.

323
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,390
So that's one of the things that I'm struggling with with that particular doctor right now.

324
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,079
But he hasn't had any infections that we know of. So he has that on his side.

325
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,780
And I think I think it's probably safe. To do in a and under scope suite or endoscopy suite.

326
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,600
But there's there's definitely different opinions out there.

327
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:33,330
So a difference for the end the scopes is that we don't use a surgical suite, we don't have the extra error handling, we don't have positive pressure.

328
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:39,510
We don't have everybody wearing their surgical scrubs and, you know, covering all their hair and everything.

329
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:46,680
So it's a different level of clean environment and and the ventilation can be different.

330
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:54,300
So actually for most like for bronchoscopy itself, we usually would make the room negative pressure device, not negative pressure.

331
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,089
I'll talk more about that when I talk about construction,

332
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:04,979
but negative pressure means you suck the air in trying to keep any potentially infectious infectious germs in

333
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:11,490
so often historically bronchoscopy would be a diagnostic tool to see what infectious disease a person had.

334
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,780
So they would do a culture with this thing going down into their lungs.

335
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:27,510
But with this particular doctor's procedures, he's really doing not diagnostics, he's doing interventions and he's fixing things in the lung.

336
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,069
He might be changing, you know, like people get lung stenosis.

337
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,460
He's trying to expand the bronchi or something like that.

338
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,780
And he's not diagnosing an infectious disease.

339
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,110
And he's like, why do I have to do them in this negative pressure room?

340
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,859
And it's a really valid question. And I think we haven't we haven't caught up to this stuff.

341
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:56,700
So that so the personal protective equipment is a question we have a hard time getting and maintaining our

342
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:04,320
endoscope endoscopies to where all the protective equipment they need because they don't see this as a messy,

343
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,820
you know, like us procedure where they're getting exposed at least not to blood usually.

344
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:16,200
But what we do know is that especially in colon procedures, there are germs that are getting dispersed.

345
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:21,809
And yes, we don't seem to have a lot of infections happening from that,

346
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:29,070
but we want them to wear their, you know, eye protection and mouth protection, clothing protection.

347
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:33,560
They wear their clothing protection pretty reliably, but they don't, you know,

348
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,470
in masks and with COVID, we've gotten them to wear their masks a lot better.

349
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,490
But their eye protection is so so it's still, you know, kind of keeping this all everyone safe.

350
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:52,650
And we also want to make sure that the and the scopes have gone through a very rigorous cleaning disinfection process and that we're

351
00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:00,959
we're never mixing up the ones that might be in a certain like they might have been washed but not put through the disinfectant process.

352
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,460
So we really have to be careful with that because you can't tell that they're not getting wrapped.

353
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,780
There's no indicators, right? So we don't have any indicators for these.

354
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,859
So that's part of the problem. And that's why some of those outbreaks happen is there's no real there's no biological check because,

355
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:22,469
A, these aren't sterile and so you should get some organisms on them.

356
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:28,620
So if you challenge them with the spore, it's going to be there, probably especially one of those really hardy spores.

357
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:37,170
Now, we do hope it kills most of the easier to kill spores such as Clostridium or Clostridium difficile.

358
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:45,660
So that's a really big one. And most of our high level disinfectants have kill claims for that.

359
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,059
But that's one of the easier to kill spores, easier than many of the bacillus spores.

360
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,540
So at least I think so. So the question is, how do you make sure it's ready for patient use?

361
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:05,219
So we developed these green zip ties that go around the scope and that shows it went through the process.

362
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:12,660
The person who takes it out of the end discovery process or out of the vat of chemical that it was soaked in,

363
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:21,630
will do the drying and rinsing and then put that on and you can't use the scope until you get tear off this tag.

364
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:30,990
Usually there's a few scopes that that's not true. So that's our only confirming thing that shows it was processed and when.

365
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,139
And so there's a lot of question out there, too,

366
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:45,030
about whether you can store and the scopes and maintain the level of cleanliness that you want for an extended period of time.

367
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,379
And I'll show you a couple storage things as we go through it.

368
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:55,590
But yeah, it's kind of tricky, so I think we want to leave.

369
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,130
I'm not done yet, but I just want to make sure you're aware of this.

370
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,720
So right now it's 930. Okay, so we want to leave.

371
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,660
I think I said like 10.5 or something like that. You will?

372
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,170
Yeah. So we want to get there no. Later. I would like to get there about 1040 because we have a couple of things.

373
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:21,420
We. To do, and I think it'll take us 15 minutes to get over there.

374
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,100
Not too long. And so what you take.

375
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:33,690
Yeah. You guys might even know the fastest route, but I think because we're going to go to that, we're going to go down and down the hill and over.

376
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,700
It might even be 10 minutes, but we have to walk through. We have to get you guys off screen.

377
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:45,000
So you're going to have to go through the COVID screening like questions and then meet up and then split up.

378
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:50,520
And my my colleague Jeff is going to take one group to one place and I'm going

379
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,430
to take one and then we're going to switch off so you can see both places.

380
00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:02,090
So, yeah, I think if we leave, if we start mobilizing about ten, 20, ten, 25, it's probably going to be you.

381
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,440
You want to do you want to? Yeah. There's stuff to do ahead of time.

382
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:11,160
Yeah. Okay. So you said 1020 ish.

383
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,970
Begin getting the timer for you. Oh, thank you.

384
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,060
That's my. That's my thing. Yeah.

385
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:28,020
I'll set it for 1020. Okay. Sounds good. So this is some of the pictures of the scopes that would be high level disinfected and

386
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,490
the one on the far left is actually not an and the scope has an ultrasound probe.

387
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,720
And there are many different kinds of ultrasound probes.

388
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:43,650
There's the kind like you, I think a lot of people are familiar with the ones that like look at your heart or like for pregnant women,

389
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:50,250
they'll look at the baby through the belly. So it's it's a noninvasive kind of visual.

390
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,830
The ones that just touch intact skin do not require high level disinfection.

391
00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,840
But the ones that we call. And. Okay, Savitri, onward.

392
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,989
But they can go in the mouth and go in the vagina.

393
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,730
They can go in anus. Those ones all require high level disinfection.

394
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:16,440
And then this is on the right is a picture of and the scopes hanging in a scope cabinet and there's a glass door holding them.

395
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:23,310
Those ones don't have zip ties on them. There must be an old picture, probably a really old picture.

396
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:36,210
So here's a picture that you guys will see. These are called 80 hours or automated and scope three processors, and they're pretty nifty machines.

397
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:45,690
I don't know how they possibly designed the all the pieces that are required to work for soap for every different type of and the scope,

398
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,730
there's a different sized tubing that connects within that machine.

399
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,850
So along with those machines, there's a wall.

400
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:59,070
I'll try to remember to point this out to you of different connectors and the people who

401
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:04,709
reprocess the and the scopes have to match the right connectors with the right and the scope,

402
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,800
or it really won't work. Now I think the machines will alarm.

403
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,610
Most of the time they should alarm if it's not getting the right pressure and able to flush the chemicals and the water through.

404
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:22,740
But it's pretty nifty. And then they have to have ultra processed water because there's a lot of water flushing, there's water tubing.

405
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:28,920
And we want we don't want a lot of scale build up or certainly biofilm build up in these.

406
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,510
The whole system has a process where it flushes the high level disinfectant chemical through its tubing and some frequency.

407
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:44,250
But there are a lot of older outbreaks associated with endoscopes where related to old style and scope

408
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:51,450
washers that people didn't really understand how to maintain and didn't filter the water enough.

409
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,229
And so they would get biofilm. And we actually had that happen in one of ours.

410
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:00,809
And there were actually pseudo outbreaks all over the country in the eighties related to

411
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:05,850
automated on the scope washers that just didn't get maintained in the way they needed to.

412
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,630
And because there's all these little tubing water you can imagine, it's just like your pipes,

413
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,930
if you put unfiltered tap water through, it's going to get scale, it's going to get biofilm.

414
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:24,600
And then over time, that level of growth could really impact your ability to clean the things that are in it.

415
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,060
So we have a couple different chemicals. These two chemicals are used for manual soaking.

416
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:35,610
Usually that endoscope washers have their own brand of chemical that they're supposed to use

417
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,170
and all of them have indicators to make sure that chemical strength is the right strength.

418
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:46,049
So they have they do have monitors, but it's not the final process monitor.

419
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:52,770
It's a monitor to make sure the chemicals, even the right strength, because they, over time will lose their ability.

420
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,320
There's different aldehydes. Long names. Okay.

421
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:03,690
Is a common one that we use right now. There's also accelerated hydrogen peroxide, as you can imagine.

422
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,809
Other aldehydes are not so good for the environment.

423
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:16,020
So honestly, the next the next phase of this is really moving away from the aldehyde, which is a really good thing to kill things.

424
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,830
But. And it gets in your water system, too. It does, you know, has a little bit of the same effect.

425
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,620
So we really want to try to move away from these.

426
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:31,130
And there is one product, accelerated hydrogen peroxide that says it breaks down into water and oxygen.

427
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:41,870
I don't know how they really know that, but they say that and it sounds a lot better, but it doesn't work in every situation.

428
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:46,790
So it doesn't it doesn't work well with certain types of plastics.

429
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:58,160
So, yeah, so this particular picture is the tip of a certain type of endoscope called the Duodenoscope.

430
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,660
And really one of the most complicated procedures we do is called an RCP.

431
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:13,850
I don't do it a Coca-Cola angio, pancreatic goofy, but those used duodenoscopes.

432
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:20,600
And this goes in through the through the mouth, into the stomach, beyond the stomach, into the duodenum.

433
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:28,140
I think that's how they get their pressure and then they do things with the bile ducts and things like that.

434
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:35,660
It's pretty amazing. Like it's almost like microsurgery but way down in your body without cutting.

435
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:42,920
The problem with these is they have these little moving parts on the tip that are super hard to clean around.

436
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:47,540
They're like, you know, like an eighth of an inch long.

437
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,640
But you have to move them to clean out from under these moving parts.

438
00:43:53,570 --> 00:44:04,460
And they figured that out, that it's really important after many outbreaks of infection happened because people didn't clean these scopes good enough.

439
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:12,080
I think there's such a big deal out of it now that I really don't think people are doing, you know, doing as bad of a job.

440
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:20,450
They're doing a much better job making sure these are clean. And these have had to have that ATP testing done on them for several years now.

441
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:28,550
So every time you clean one of these scopes, it's supposed to be tested for protein or residual biological material.

442
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:37,160
So really making sure that they get all of these parts cleaned, the time it takes to clean one.

443
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:46,520
And the scope is shockingly long. And a lot of the people that are doing it, you know, you can imagine with turnover and stuff like that,

444
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:51,440
it's hard to maintain staffing with really skilled people.

445
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,650
And they, you know, it takes like 45 minutes per endoscope to clean one.

446
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:02,060
And that's a long time. It's a lot of staffing, it's a lot of cost.

447
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,160
And to make sure that all these people are competent and maintain competency is really tricky.

448
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,060
So that's one of our deals that we have to do.

449
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:20,270
So moving on to single use items, this was also a really big deal in the nineties and it came up a lot in relation

450
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:27,259
to HIV and hepatitis B is making sure that people were not reusing syringes.

451
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:35,930
Believe it or not, people used to think that was okay and probably in the eighties it first started

452
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,460
really being known that you shouldn't use a needle more than one person,

453
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,409
but we used to actually sterilize needles way back, like in the sixties and seventies.

454
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,799
They would actually have needles that they were put through the autoclave.

455
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,450
Now how they clean those little bitty needles, I don't know if that's what we really had.

456
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,639
You know how, you know, like we were, we were just like, so cool.

457
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:10,780
And then we put it in so that so because whenever we had glass syringes, it was plastic ones that went in the gas sterilizer.

458
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,629
And yeah, gas sterilizer probably worked a little better.

459
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:22,220
But you can imagine in those really small lumens if there was any residual dried material, really hard to disinfect.

460
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:25,460
So pretty much everything like that is disposable now.

461
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:34,400
But with hepatitis B outbreaks that there was a big deal with not reusing because hepatitis B is quite hardy as far as viruses go.

462
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,160
There was a big one, pretty recent. This was just one person.

463
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,209
Yeah, really bad practice.

464
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:53,150
I think this one particular clinic which was you know, that I always say beware of clinics that are run outside of a hospital,

465
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:58,790
like with no association with a hospital because the doctors and the staff don't have the

466
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:06,320
same level of inspection and quality checking that you would expect in the hospital clinic.

467
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:16,280
So this was in one of those and endoscopy center that did didn't have anyone like me going in inspecting them in time.

468
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,470
Telling them what to do and they just were reusing syringes.

469
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:29,360
And I don't know how they all got by that, but a huge outbreak like hundreds of people potentially infected and they had 77 cases.

470
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,080
Oh, that's horrible. Yeah. And just remember it all.

471
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,490
It sounds great about disposables, but they all cost money.

472
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,430
And, Mike, it's it's it's horrendous how much it cost to have the surgical sweep through.

473
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:51,410
And so there's tremendous pressure to always have a surgical suite operating because it's so expensive.

474
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:55,220
Mm hmm. Yeah. Just to build it. And then you want to use it once you have it built.

475
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,980
Yeah. And just to operate. And then there's a lot of cleaning of a sterile 3 to 0.

476
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:06,530
You don't want to keep them empty. So yeah, the, the incentive you have to think about that.

477
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,190
And people do cut corners often with reuse.

478
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:19,669
Reuse of medication. Vials is a big one, too. And that is, you know, there are reusable and then there's single use medication vials.

479
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,910
The single use ones have no preservative, no germ killing.

480
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,990
Of course, the needle needs to be sterile each time it goes in.

481
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:32,569
But there's still where people are using like different like.

482
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:42,380
So say you're in a procedure and you're injecting multiple pain or, you know, pain anesthetics multiple times into one person.

483
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:48,740
You go back into your vial and you draw more. The people weren't changing their needles or changing the whole syringe.

484
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:55,670
And so little main two minute bits of the people's bloodstream got back into the biome.

485
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:04,070
It stays there and that's a problem, too. So that's why we end up throwing away a lot of medication that's not used because of that risk.

486
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:11,540
So it's people want to save money and they sometimes when they do, it's has a bad outcome.

487
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:23,270
Um, so the CDC really focused on this in the early 2000s after that outbreak and actually before that outbreak and after there were other outbreaks,

488
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:31,490
lots of other outbreaks. So yeah, so when infection prevention is involved,

489
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:39,080
we do a lot of inspecting and checking and over time I've been doing this for more than 20 years and there's

490
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:46,790
greatly increased the number of expectations for the people managing all this cleaning and reprocessing.

491
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,209
Yeah, it's it's way improved, so I feel a lot safer now.

492
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,840
If I was going to have a procedure, I think you could also feel pretty safe.

493
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:02,660
Um, just a lot of focus on instrument processing.

494
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:11,120
It's a huge deal. We spend probably hundreds of well, I don't want to say hundreds of millions,

495
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:18,490
but in five years we probably, probably spend 100 million on improvements to our instrument processing.

496
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,950
That's a lot of money. It's like a new building almost so.

497
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,700
But we're changing our central sterile processing processing environment.

498
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,109
We're building new ones, really big changes going on right now.

499
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,980
So trying to really improve and thinking for the future.

500
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,409
So we have to go and check on these people.

501
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:47,270
So a lot of our time is spent checking on these spots and making sure that things are working and that they're doing all the things that they expect.

502
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,909
We also really importantly want to get involved in understanding any new purchase.

503
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,340
So, for example, this happens all the time.

504
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:06,050
Radiology buys lots and lots of equipment, so there's lots of new radiological X-rays, CT equipment, things to be used with those devices, ultrasound.

505
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:15,860
They're also usually really hard to clean because they have this really super high tech ability to see things like ultrasounds,

506
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:21,889
but they don't make them out of materials. They have cracks and crevices that can't be soaked.

507
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,550
They can't be exposed to high heat or pressure.

508
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,460
So how are you going to disinfect them between uses?

509
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:38,390
And unfortunately, we sometimes buy things that only give like one or maybe two ways of either sterilizing or disinfecting.

510
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:46,220
But we don't do that. We don't do that process. So our purchasers buy something that we have no way of reprocessing.

511
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:55,130
And then they get really mad because we tell them they can't do it and they can't use it and they spend $100,000 on this piece of equipment.

512
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,990
So it's really important.

513
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:09,200
And it's something that I get a little bit fussy about is when I work with our purchasing department, I really expect I hold them to this.

514
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:16,160
Like if you guys don't contact us, it's not on us when you can't find a way to fix to deal with this between.

515
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,610
Patience is your problem. So I've had lots of meetings.

516
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:28,470
Yeah, you have to. You have to be firm, because if there's no way to do it, how do you use it safely?

517
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,440
Now you're usually years away. But sometimes we buy these things from Europe.

518
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:39,510
And Europe has different equipment, different standards, different expectations.

519
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:46,350
We get a lot of devices made in Europe and they have a list of how to process it.

520
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:51,450
With nothing we have access to. And it's like so.

521
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,640
So I want to say they're doing better, but there's still a long way to go with that,

522
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:02,220
with international standards and international expectations of how to reprocess things.

523
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:06,060
I'm sure they have the same issue with stuff made in the US too.

524
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:15,930
So yeah, we want to have one of our roles is making sure again the competencies are are up to date.

525
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,120
We create with help of our central serial processing agent.

526
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,770
We have educators for the most part in those areas too.

527
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:30,750
We develop orientation, we develop competencies, sometimes online competencies, and then we go in inspect.

528
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:36,839
So those are all really big things that we do. So kind of, you know, every every time I go in there,

529
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:42,420
I'm looking at what they're doing and maybe we'll find something that needs fixing when we go back to it.

530
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:48,510
Not that I want to, but yeah. So here's some of the standards that that we use.

531
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:54,629
The CDC is a little slow to update some of their stuff.

532
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,200
So 2008, it's pretty old.

533
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:05,210
It's kind of shockingly old for the technology that's out there now.

534
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:09,930
I mean, it's technology is not waiting for the standards to catch up.

535
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,989
So we're trying to, you know, work with FDA,

536
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:21,400
with CDC expectations that are really not not enough for what we need with all the technology that's coming out.

537
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:28,800
So one that is keeping up is the AMY Standard Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.

538
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,830
So we follow those standards for the most part.

539
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:44,850
The problem I have with those standards, which are multidisciplinary, but usually those guidelines would get adopted by a group and say,

540
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:51,420
you're going to follow this with like the Association for Gastroenterology might adopt the AMY standards,

541
00:54:51,750 --> 00:55:00,360
but the AMY standards are written by some experts in the field, but a whole lot of device manufacturers, you know,

542
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:09,750
so I have one of my close colleagues that work with almost every day sits on the AMA, endoscopy standards revisions.

543
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:14,480
And she's a nurse and she's worked in and scope reprocessing for years.

544
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:22,229
She knows what she's doing, but she's like one of four nurses out of 20 or I don't know how many people are on it,

545
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:28,230
but she's the way minority of all these people that work for the device manufacturers.

546
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:33,740
So it's a little bit like a conflict of interest, I think.

547
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:38,340
So sometimes they'll say you have to discard something after each use.

548
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,890
And we're like, Why? And they're like, it.

549
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,150
And it could just be because then we have to buy more.

550
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:50,569
So it's like, okay, so and then we have our infection prevention.

551
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:53,670
It's actually infection prevention, but it's still called APIC.

552
00:55:53,670 --> 00:56:01,950
That's our national organization. And there's a GI Endoscopies I mentioned, there's all our nurses that all create standards for certain practices,

553
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,730
and sometimes they conflict, and especially around endoscopies, they sometimes conflict.

554
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:14,070
So we have to pick and then we're held to a whatever we decide to pick to follow.

555
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,540
We're held to that by our governing body, which is a joint commission.

556
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:28,050
And it it can be really frustrating to make it all work because from a from our from our epidemiology perspective,

557
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:37,170
there's bits and pieces of each of those standards that are really good and some pieces of the standards that kind of don't make sense to us at all.

558
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,860
And they just seem like a waste of energy or effort.

559
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:46,379
And so it'd be really nice to be able to pick and choose, but really we are not allowed to do that.

560
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:50,700
You have to pick a standard and follow it. So that's one of our struggles.

561
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,879
So yeah, I wish the CDC would come out with new stuff, but as soon as they do,

562
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,680
my life will be really busy because I have to rewrite a bunch of policies in education.

563
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:08,430
But that's okay. I want them to update. So we also, of course, have OSHA above our own pathogen standard.

564
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:12,000
That's also really old. But you know that that really hasn't changed a lot.

565
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:21,720
The virus's behavior still is. So hepatitis, HIV, hepatitis C and B and all the other hepatitis is.

566
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:30,120
That's really what those standards were written for and whatever other blood borne diseases that we haven't identified yet.

567
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,220
And so they're still pretty valid.

568
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:43,709
The FDA could use some updating as far as medical devices go because their standards only require a device manufacturer to do one test,

569
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:53,220
a one processing method. And so sometimes they'll say, oh, we tested it for this chemical and it works well.

570
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:58,620
What if you don't use that chemical and you have ten other devices that say to use a different chemical,

571
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,230
then you have to decide if you're going to bring in a chemical. We're really struggling with this right now.

572
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,100
If you're going to bring in a new process that you don't have just for this one device,

573
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:14,130
because that device manufacturer was only required to test one thing, it's really frustrating.

574
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:22,350
So I'm a little bit whining about it. But yeah, so I think this and so the joint commission is our surveying body.

575
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:26,459
We just had our joint commission inspection. Did anyone tell you about how we did?

576
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:37,170
And they told you it was in August and it was the first time in 16 years that we didn't have a repeat visit.

577
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Okay. Yeah. So it was it is a really big deal.

578
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:46,110
Wow. Yeah. You must have worked. We worked really hard beforehand.

579
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,800
It wasn't just us. We have a we have an accreditation department.

580
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,200
And I really think us working with that department round we did,

581
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:02,700
what we did was we went to all these places every three months or more to every place in the institution,

582
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,470
every nursing unit, every clinic, every reprocessing area.

583
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:12,990
Like we were going all over the place inspecting. We just did a ton of inspections.

584
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:18,660
And with each inspection you kind of get the place to be a little bit more ready and a little bit better.

585
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:23,130
And it was a ton of time and effort, but I think it paid off.

586
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,910
So that was that was good. And it's pretty normal for the joint commission to come back for.

587
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:36,030
I mean, most hospitals do they call it a conditional finding where you they want to see that you fix what they found.

588
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:41,250
And so they come back in like three, three weeks or four weeks. And that was the first time we didn't have that.

589
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,350
So that was that's nice. It's really nice.

590
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:51,970
But we can't like kind of just hang out and say we did a good job because, you know, you to keep getting better, okay.

591
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:57,820
Out of it. And then you go to the other town. Yeah. You know, and.

592
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,040
All right. Friday afternoon with the pager.

593
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:09,089
So as I mentioned, there's a lot of pages we get our pages right now often are not involving instrument processing.

594
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:14,040
And I'm happy to say that our most of our pages are having to do with COVID still

595
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:21,030
and a lot of other kinds of infection questions like infectious disease questions.

596
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:30,540
And that's okay. And these ones, we really think we should be able to get ourselves we should be able to have processes standard

597
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:36,509
enough and have people's education levels in a certain place where we don't have this happen.

598
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,630
These are kind of errors that should just not happen.

599
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:48,480
So again, here's are all of our indicators that need to happen, but you can imagine there is a little bit of room for things to get missed,

600
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:54,780
less so with the autoclaves because of all of the scanning, the barcodes and stuff.

601
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,230
Now they won't even let you get past if you didn't have.

602
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:02,760
But you know, someone could be really slacking. That could happen.

603
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:11,309
But it's harder with all of this, you know, all these requiring documentation, but we still have sterilizer issues, packaging.

604
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:14,280
So what really gets us right now is our packaging.

605
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:22,799
That is something that's hard to be perfect at, especially when you're having a person and each person has their own way.

606
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:27,570
It's like getting them to fold sheets perfectly, but even more important.

607
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:33,180
So they basically have to wrap these packages perfectly, taped them perfectly, have no gaps,

608
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:42,630
have no openings, and then handle them in a way that there's no tears, no rips, no staining, no water damage.

609
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:47,040
That packaging and management can be really tricky.

610
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,450
And then just knowing how to use the sterilizers. The loading techniques.

611
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,910
That's pretty teachable. So I think we're okay with that.

612
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:03,620
And then the equipment itself is so high tech now, except for manual high level disinfection.

613
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:12,530
So manual meaning that the person is responsible for doing all the cleaning, washing and soaking, rinsing all of that stuff inside of a machine.

614
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:22,129
So we really try to use machines as much as we can because they're so much more reliable and hopefully this remains to be true,

615
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:31,100
but yet you can sometimes get a machine that tells you an error or that it isn't identifying in here.

616
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:35,690
So a sterilization failure as any of these things we talked about,

617
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:43,520
chemical indicator didn't turn and I have a really sad I've been here long enough I've seen some when I tell Mike my newer colleagues are like,

618
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,520
why people did that? And I'm like, Yeah.

619
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:54,950
So there was one event that happened maybe ten years ago. This is like shows everything that could go wrong went wrong.

620
01:02:55,550 --> 01:03:01,520
So first. So we have to have all these indicators on this package of serial items.

621
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:10,910
What happened, we found out later was they well, so they stacked this a bunch of packages, a whole grouping of packages.

622
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:18,559
They used them in a incisional procedure, not in the O.R., but it was a very minor incision, all procedure.

623
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:28,070
But they found that these packages had gone to different places all over this system, and they opened it for this procedure.

624
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:32,330
They used it on a couple of different instrument packs, on a couple of patients.

625
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:45,530
And then when someone was cleaning up after the procedure, the second procedure, they're like, these chemical indicators aren't color changed my.

626
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:51,710
And then they asked, you know, did you guys notice that? No, somebody looked well.

627
01:03:51,740 --> 01:04:00,230
They ended up instead of running a whole like a whole huge cart of instruments, instead of putting it through the autoclave,

628
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:04,910
it went to the sterile processing room, but it never went through the autoclave.

629
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:11,180
So they were washed, you know, with like the instrument washers and package, but never autoclave.

630
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,240
So then they got distributed and out of like maybe 50 different things,

631
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:25,969
only one person noticed that these things hadn't changed color and and it was

632
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:32,840
after unfortunately it had already been used and at least a couple of people. So we had to recall all those packages, find out what was in that load.

633
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,530
And this was things were not as perfectly barcoded then.

634
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,590
And so it was a little tricky to figure out where they might have gone.

635
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:44,030
And then our department has to do a risk assessment. We do a lot of risk assessments.

636
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:51,920
And what is the risk of those patients getting a serious infectious disease from instruments that weren't sterile?

637
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:57,830
And then we had to tell them, you know, here what we here's what we think your risk is.

638
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:01,009
We we're going to offer bloodborne pathogen testing to you.

639
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:08,360
But should we give you prophylactic medication for HIV or hepatitis, which is not an easy thing to do.

640
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,660
Very expensive and hard on the body.

641
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:15,290
Not so good, although this was ten years ago. So you probably a better stuff now.

642
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:20,270
So the patient then has to decide, do I want to take this prophylactic medication?

643
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:24,709
Because I might have been exposed to hepatitis or HIV.

644
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:31,760
And I don't know. It's it it's a horrible thing to have to deal with and to have to have the the doctors explain this to the patients.

645
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,840
And, you know, usually people learn from these mistakes pretty well, but it took multiple people,

646
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:45,590
including the person stocking the person in CCPD that released this whole cart back to be stopped,

647
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,610
the person putting them on the shelves, the person taking them off the shelves,

648
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:56,300
the person assisting the provider opening up the pack and getting it all set up.

649
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:03,710
Then the doctor didn't look and then it was the second person that was cleaning it.

650
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:08,060
So and like, you know, there's multiple people that didn't do their check.

651
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:13,430
So we had, of course, a big educational event related to that.

652
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:23,930
It was a big deal. I mean, the patients sometimes the patients, the patients can sue for, you know, mental damages, even if they don't get a disease.

653
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:31,460
I don't think any of those did. But, you know, there certainly are lawsuits that we don't even find out about that relate to this kind of thing.

654
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:46,160
So it's a big deal and it's just so tricky and it's a lot of, I guess, pressure to put on us to know how to advise the providers.

655
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,090
So we of course work with our our medical directors and things like that because when you do a risk.

656
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:54,030
Is it just like a general risk assessment?

657
01:06:54,040 --> 01:07:02,380
Like like what could you have contracted and what's the likelihood or is it like specifically like do you know what those tools were used on prior?

658
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:05,430
And like, it depends on how our tracking is.

659
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,610
So some of the things we could know what like the last patient.

660
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:22,330
So for example when we have a needle stick exposure that are like we find an instrument that maybe wasn't cleaned well,

661
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:26,770
usually in the surgery we can tell who that side of instruments was used on.

662
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:32,829
And if that patient's still in the hospital, we might ask them to have either hepatitis,

663
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:40,420
HIV and hepatitis testing done so that we know that that person at least doesn't have those mean weapon pathogens,

664
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,320
which helps inform whether we give prophylaxis to that person.

665
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:48,730
That's a good scenario. A lot of times that patient's gone home.

666
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:54,249
We have we have to decide if we want to call them and say, can you come in for bloodborne pathogen testing?

667
01:07:54,250 --> 01:08:00,579
Because we extent lead in and clean your instruments and you know, like it's it's a big deal.

668
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:04,030
We do that I mean we don't call them thankfully, but somebody does.

669
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:07,870
And sure, that conversation is not fine. So it depends on which instruments.

670
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:13,510
It's it is if it's used to be if it was an under scope, we had no way of tracking.

671
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:23,230
About five years ago we implemented manual tracking or if they have an automated and a scope preprocessor, they can have barcode tracking now.

672
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:30,850
So it's gotten a lot easier to track. And so yeah, sometimes we can say, oh, and usually what we're looking for is bloodborne pathogens,

673
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:36,070
because if it is a bacterial infection that we're worried about or even C difficile

674
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:42,370
that is treatable and there's really no point in testing the patient before A because,

675
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:46,660
you know, they might not have whatever they had on the day of, you know,

676
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:51,580
like so it's it's not the same time frame that you're talking about is with Bloodborne Pathogens.

677
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:55,900
So usually we're focused on the blood borne infections, viruses,

678
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:03,490
and then we use this really crazy calculation of the risk of a blood exposure from different sources.

679
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:10,330
So like there's an oral blood exposure risk, there's a injectable blood exposure risk,

680
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:14,860
and then it is exponentially different depending on how much blood exposure you.

681
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:19,330
And so we're like trying to do these math calculations and come up with like what?

682
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:28,060
Like a real risk is. And usually it's so low. We, we do disclose almost all of those to the patient that got exposed.

683
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:34,420
The only time we went in is if the instruments were actually put through the process.

684
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:39,370
But we can't prove that they got like all the parameters.

685
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:44,860
And so we, we think they went through the autoclave, but we can't prove it for some reason, like something got messed up.

686
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:52,270
So like this one, we knew it didn't go through the autoclave, so we didn't disclose to those patients.

687
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:57,420
So yeah, good question. Maybe you'll have more questions as we go through this.

688
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:08,109
So we have a policy that if the biological indicator fails, we we halt all distribution of that stuff.

689
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:14,319
We try to hold everything and sequester it in central sterile processing and not deliver it,

690
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,640
not restock it until after those biological indicators result.

691
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:23,320
Back when it was a three day, most things didn't get restocked.

692
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:26,770
Almost everything. Now that it's 24 hour minutes.

693
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:34,299
And I actually when I asked them which ones they use, because I know they were in the process of switching on 24 minutes,

694
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:38,380
they can pretty much hold it and keep it there until you know the result.

695
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:47,850
So that's really different. It went from three days to one day and now I think and then there was a three hour one, now there's a 24 minute one.

696
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:58,240
It's pretty good. So those good chemical, biological tests people have really up their game.

697
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:02,680
So yeah, so we would have to hold those and sequester and recall.

698
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:09,879
So recall is really hard because you can imagine instruments can go a lot of different places depending on what they are.

699
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:16,060
If it's something very standard and generic like surgical scissors that are used in

700
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:22,389
all kinds of procedures or a scalpel that could be used in almost any O.R. anywhere.

701
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:28,330
So it it's really you know, it can be a lot harder to find out and to get them before they get restocked.

702
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:31,479
We should be able to track them based on the barcodes.

703
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:39,040
So but it's a lot of time and effort and it's not perfect because people so what happens is we have main staff

704
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:47,830
rooms where the person who stops could go and scan barcodes and know which date this was done on and which load.

705
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:51,100
And that's not the one they're looking for. And they're like, okay, but.

706
01:11:51,580 --> 01:12:02,650
Nurses and other staff will substack to all different kinds of procedure rooms or a cabinet somewhere, and nobody knows where this stuff was put.

707
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:08,590
They can guess, but they're not 100% certain that it didn't get put into a bunch of different places.

708
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,880
So that's when we really miss out on those recalls, and it gets really tricky.

709
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:18,590
So there's a couple of factors that go into our risk assessment. The possibility of residual tissue.

710
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:23,380
So did it get washed? Did it go through the normal wash process and can we prove it?

711
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:29,260
And usually there should not be residual patient tissue, although we know sometimes there is.

712
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:40,990
Where in the body where the instruments used. So was it a place that wouldn't have been very bloody or very highly contaminated?

713
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,320
And then the patient who had the instruments used on them, what is their immune status?

714
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:50,400
Are they particularly susceptible? And then what is the Alzheimer's?

715
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:54,220
Sometimes we'll take into account the risk of the patient that used it before.

716
01:12:55,420 --> 01:13:02,860
So like and that's hard to assess. Like, I mean, it's it's tricky to say, you know, is this person at risk for hepatitis C?

717
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:10,090
A lot of people are at risk for hepatitis C. So it's it's hard to do hard to give that a risk.

718
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:20,440
So we had this amazing flow chart that we we work with CCPD to whether they can release whether they they check things.

719
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,450
How far back in the system did the error happen? And where do we know what like they do?

720
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:28,990
We know that they check the chemical indicators and document it.

721
01:13:29,710 --> 01:13:34,090
But then did the biological not, you know, not yet and so did the chemical indicators turn.

722
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:41,230
But the biological is positive. So then we usually want to check was that biological indicator working appropriately?

723
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:48,290
Did the incubator work appropriately? The incubator, we put the little tubes, so there's a bunch of different checks you can do before you.

724
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:54,110
But in the immediate thing is you want us to stop the distribution of that whole batch of stuff.

725
01:13:54,130 --> 01:14:00,420
It's messy, it's very complicated. And when you have the biological indicator, you want to.

726
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:07,660
So we'll have the supervisor and CSP check all of their load records to make sure when was the

727
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:15,940
last time that particular autoclave had an appropriate result for their biological indicator?

728
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:22,269
So maybe it was that morning. And so they know the biological indicator from the morning worked it past.

729
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:28,840
It was good. So there might have been five loads or ten loads between now and then.

730
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,799
So you might have to recall all those instruments because you didn't know.

731
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,750
So that's a reason to put a biological indicator and every load and that.

732
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:44,380
And now that they're so much quicker and easier to get the results, it's it makes a lot of sense to do it.

733
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:55,450
So I think we pretty much do that now. So one positive biological indicator that shows you did not achieve your sterilization,

734
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:03,429
we would treat all of those items as non-sterile up until the the previous working appropriate

735
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:09,820
for that biological indicator or I guess we have the last negative positive is band negatives.

736
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:15,999
So we recall the load and as I said then we have this like almost all of these

737
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,670
steps are so much easier now because you have a lot less people to talk to.

738
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:26,920
The person on staff knows whether those instruments went anywhere.

739
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:32,560
You can even probably talk to the person who was the person doing the stocking and say, Hey, where did you take them?

740
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,380
We don't even have to look in certain places.

741
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:42,190
So like it's so much better than three days later and when you might have to like ask people to remember.

742
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:49,120
And then by three days stuff is substandard. So it's just so much better to have it happen quickly and be able to respond quickly.

743
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:53,980
But we do always have like a reporting process where we would notify our medical director,

744
01:15:53,980 --> 01:16:03,910
we would notify the clinical affairs director and the Office of Clinical Safety and Patient Relations, which is our risk management team.

745
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:09,190
And they're the ones that often besides the doctors have to call the patients and tell them what happened.

746
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:14,050
So, you know, they they like it when we don't have to get to that point.

747
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,959
So it's a pretty long process.

748
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,720
But when you can imagine when this happens on a Friday afternoon, which I have been involved in a few of them over my time,

749
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:29,870
it is no fun and you sometimes end up working really late to try to gather all the info that you can.

750
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:34,069
And so, yeah, we have a recall report.

751
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:40,820
These are all done in this year's PD now, but we work with them to make sure all these pieces are filled out.

752
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:48,980
And it's nice to have their help because they really know how their department runs and they know where to go looking for things.

753
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:57,050
So say on Friday afternoon you get a call that they released a load but now has a positive biological indicator.

754
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:02,060
What would you do right away? What is the first couple of things you would do?

755
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:15,390
This is kind of a hard question. You can guess it's okay for wrong, because I don't know that I called it out when we were talking to you, sir.

756
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:24,290
I think the first one is trying to sequester all the things that could have been in that load.

757
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:29,600
So they may have found one of the Samsung didn't have 1020.

758
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:38,510
So yet really sequestering and stop, say everybody stop, don't deliver those instruments, don't deliver any more instruments.

759
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:44,090
And if you have already delivered them, get the people involved and find out exactly where they went.

760
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:46,370
So that's the first one.

761
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:57,080
And then the second one is we call out, I think I think as we will notify our our medical director and clinical affairs about what what happened.

762
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:05,150
Sometimes we don't need to notify clinical affairs if we can recall all of the items before they were used.

763
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:10,490
So that's the first thing, is finding out if they were used and trying to stop them from being used.

764
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:19,060
That's a really important piece. And then you want to gather all the indicator information,

765
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:29,570
make sure that the sterilizer was working prior to that, and find out when the last verifiable indicators were.

766
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:35,090
And then you understand how many loads you might need to sequester.

767
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:44,930
So you you first want to, like, say, stop. And then sometimes you at the same time bit to find out which things you have to sequester.

768
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:50,180
You may have to go back to that last appropriately negative indicator.

769
01:18:51,950 --> 01:19:01,400
So yeah, those are the main things, but it can be really messy and it can involve a lot of phone calls and pages and yeah, it's can be really tricky.

770
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:09,770
We have a couple of other scenarios, but I think, you know, they're kind of all how would you go about assessing the risk of bacterial and viral

771
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:15,500
infection to the patient who had the maybe non-sterile instruments used on them?

772
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:20,870
How would you go about assessing that risk? What are some of the factors that would be involved in that?

773
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:36,190
Are they immune compromised? Mm hmm. Mm hmm. That's a big one, because that's one that we can, you know, gather from from their medical history.

774
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:45,280
Another one that's a little tricky, but is how much how much contamination would you have expected on those instruments?

775
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,750
How hard are they to clean? So say it was a duodenoscope.

776
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:58,330
It's a it doesn't have biological indicators, but say maybe somebody forgot to do their quality check on that to widen the scope.

777
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:05,439
And you found that out somehow. Those are really hard to clean because of the risk and where they're used.

778
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:11,440
That would bump up the risk to the patient and would be a very important thing.

779
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:19,870
And then if you knew which, you know, we could sometimes find out who who had those use on them last.

780
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,390
We could find out if that person has any active infectious diseases.

781
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:35,229
So looking at the person use before it, so how they're clean, how hard they are to clean, what the actual contamination risk is, where was it used?

782
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:44,140
What part of the body and then the actual the person who got them used on them what their risk is.

783
01:20:44,530 --> 01:20:46,900
So there's kind of three out there.

784
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:57,320
So the like barcode scanning system links specific devices to each patient, each firm that they're used in, like historically.

785
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:02,820
Yeah. Should be able to do that. So there is some trickiness when they exchange.

786
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:09,399
So so you have a set of instruments for a particular surgery and if you pull one

787
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:13,480
of those out and replace it with something because maybe it's not working right,

788
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,100
that's where you have a little bit of your built into that system.

789
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:23,590
And you just it's hard to be 100% certain that somebody didn't replace a non-working item.

790
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:28,330
They should document that, but it's a little harder to find that out.

791
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:35,319
So I think we're pretty good. So thank you for going through that.

792
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:42,130
And then here's what we know. So do you guys need to come or they can't leave their stuff here?

793
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:51,759
No, they can't. So it probably makes sense for you unless you have doctors, but I imagine mostly them to take your stuff with you.

794
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:58,480
And we'll start our little infection prevention office in the hospital and leave your stuff there.

795
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:07,270
It's like the lobby, as they say, and then we'll go down and meet in separate like that.

796
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:15,640
So I I'm actually I think when I get there, there's a bathroom close to that place.

797
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:19,360
But if you need to go to the bathroom, we could wait a couple of minutes.

798
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:26,140
There is a bathroom close to where we're going to drop our stuff off and wait until that.

799
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:31,630
I know. Sometimes I drink a lot of copies of these.

800
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:46,059
Wait. And you you will to go into the hospital.

801
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:49,660
You will probably have lots of that.

802
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:55,030
They'll give you that. Oh, my gosh. Thank you very much.

803
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:59,160
It's going to be very real.

804
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:05,560
And I'm like, I'm definitely going to leave on Friday evening.

805
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:11,320
I feel like we have been doing.

806
01:23:27,350 --> 01:28:54,060
I. Never heard that.

807
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:12,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

808
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:24,860
Oh, no. I feel bad. I mean, you know, I think.

809
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:43,450
Yeah, I mean, I think. Yeah, I think that's kind of clear on that.

810
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:46,559
Yeah, I think they're trying to prove that. All right.

811
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:58,290
That there's another category that I want to work for.

812
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:04,620
Yeah. Okay, cool. Cool. Well, designing for everyone.

813
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:15,000
How is it? Your work? Just go home before I do that now.

814
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:22,860
How about that? Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. I've been there.

815
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:33,620
Yeah, I. Yeah, I've heard that.

816
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:38,750
Yeah. Yeah.

817
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:46,580
Yeah. Yeah.

818
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:54,900
Any knowledge about the.

819
01:37:34,870 --> 01:55:24,829
But. I still need your support.

820
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:27,950
You know what I mean?

821
01:55:28,310 --> 01:55:33,470
I forget that he thinks about it. Yeah.

822
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:40,030
Oh, she's so beautiful.

823
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:47,400
Oh. Oh, oh.

824
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:59,110
Oh. In your life.

825
01:56:01,190 --> 01:56:04,610
What would you prefer? Yeah, I also thought.

826
01:56:24,590 --> 01:56:30,840
You just don't know that you're going to have to do that. But then I have to be honest with you.

827
01:56:37,370 --> 02:04:19,610
That. The shooting.

828
02:04:52,010 --> 02:20:59,870
Bachelor. I'm going back to bed.

829
02:20:59,880 --> 02:30:25,310
So. Quite.

830
02:34:30,190 --> 02:34:37,520
People are. Well.

831
02:34:39,980 --> 02:35:16,060
No. No.

832
02:37:37,100 --> 02:41:29,090
You know. So.

833
02:41:34,810 --> 02:41:39,010
Yeah. Right, yeah, yeah.

834
02:41:39,160 --> 02:46:29,920
You know. No.

835
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:15,120
Yeah. Look how well.

836
02:48:31,830 --> 02:48:34,840
So there's a lot of.

837
02:49:21,990 --> 02:51:39,810
Yeah. It is that place where there is a.

838
02:51:42,620 --> 02:51:46,040
You want to see this? Hmm?

839
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:50,870
Hi. How are you doing? Good.

840
02:51:55,180 --> 02:53:59,710
This. Yeah, I do.

841
02:54:00,630 --> 02:54:06,030
I do.

842
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:37,780
If she went to school.

843
02:54:40,390 --> 02:54:52,380
It is, you know, a 75 year old.

844
02:54:53,830 --> 02:54:58,300
There's nothing like that on the Internet. But I knew it was.

845
02:55:09,170 --> 02:55:12,920
It's like, Oh, man. It's like I didn't.

846
02:55:14,210 --> 02:55:19,430
Yeah. And if you want to take a drug test.

847
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:45,320
Well. But by then, you know.

848
02:55:51,470 --> 02:55:55,700
I was literally just I just for about 10 minutes.

849
02:55:56,660 --> 02:56:03,690
Why don't you try to do something that truly believed the possibilities?

850
02:56:04,100 --> 02:56:20,640
So when she recommended me, I was like, Oh, yeah, I mean, everyone.

851
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:41,850
If you look at the way he was in the news I don't that know what he was different.

852
02:56:53,640 --> 02:57:03,690
It's just so hard.
