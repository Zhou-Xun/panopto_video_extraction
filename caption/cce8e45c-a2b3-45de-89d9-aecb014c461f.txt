00:00:02,597 --> 00:00:07,133
Hello, today, I'm going to give you an overview of mutation.

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:11,084
The learning objectives, are to describe the types of mutations,

3
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:15,589
summarize how different types of mutations can have different cellular, or

4
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:17,198
molecular consequences.

5
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:20,239
And explain how mutations in a genome may arise, and

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,394
the mechanisms for repairing them.

7
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:29,367
Mutation is a major source of human variation, it's caused by changes in

8
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:33,594
the DNA sequence, and there are many different types of mutations.

9
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:38,074
This can happen in somatic cells, or the cells in your body, or,

10
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:42,070
during the development of gametes, so, eggs and sperm.

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,392
They can be spontaneous, or they can be inherited,

12
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:52,483
spontaneous mutation rates are pretty low, about 1*10 to the -5,

13
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:58,103
or 10 to the -8 base pairs, for every replication in your cell.

14
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:03,395
The, rates of spontaneous mutation, also vary dramatically across genomic regions,

15
00:01:03,395 --> 00:01:07,783
so there are some regions, that tend to have higher rates, than others.

16
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:13,139
There are a lot of types of mutations,

17
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:18,084
some of the most important ones that will talk about are nucleotide substitution.

18
00:01:18,084 --> 00:01:22,154
So, this alters the sequence of the DNA, but

19
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:26,130
not the number of nucleotides or DNA bases.

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,771
There can be insertions and deletions,

21
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:33,053
which alter the number of nucleotides, or DNA bases, in a gene.

22
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,381
There can be VNTRs,

23
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:39,389
which alter the number of times that a certain DNA sequence repeats itself.

24
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:44,388
And one common one, our trinucleotide repeats,

25
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:48,439
or repeats of DNA bases in sets of three.

26
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,094
Another one is splice site variation, so,

27
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:55,758
this occurs in the non-coding region of a gene, which affects the way that,

28
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:59,163
parts of the gene sequence are combined to make the RNA.

29
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:02,791
So, the way that the exxons are combined together,

30
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:08,000
to make the messenger RNA that's eventually translated into protein,.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,327
Remember, that, the DNA sequence, is,

32
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:17,026
formatted in terms of these trinucleotides.

33
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:19,820
So, three nucleotides together,

34
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,670
form the basis of the genetic code, the codes for amino acid.

35
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,739
So, remember, you've got your DNA here,

36
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,946
and the transcription is putting RNA bases,

37
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:39,475
pairing them, with the DNA sequence.

38
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:43,951
So, T pairs with A, A pairs with your euro cell,

39
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:49,975
RNA instead of thiamine, guanine inside ascene pair together.

40
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:55,179
So, the MRNA is made directly, through the transcription,

41
00:02:55,179 --> 00:03:00,597
of the DNA, and the MRNA is read in triplets, or codes of three.

42
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:05,720
So, each MRNA triplet, codes for a certain amino acid,

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,357
so, here, if you have UUU, on the MRNA, that codes for phenylalanine.

44
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:17,160
Each of these code for the different amino acids, but

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,931
there are a few stop code ons, so UAA, and UAG are stop code ons.

46
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:28,773
And, so, is UGA, so, when the protein is being translated,

47
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:35,075
if there's a stop code on, the protein will actually be released.

48
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:46,538
When we're talking about mutations, we can think about,

49
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:52,058
different ways that mutations affect that triplet code on structure,

50
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:57,227
so, if we have some RNA here, that is what's found in most cells.

51
00:03:57,227 --> 00:04:02,819
Let's say that the MRNA, goes five prime, to three prime,

52
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:09,193
the first amino acid that's coded for is elanin, and then glicing.

53
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:14,584
If we go and look at different types of mutations, we can see how the substitution

54
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:19,122
of different DNA bases, will lead to different types of mutation.

55
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:24,396
So, here, in the third code on, the original sequences GCA,

56
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,791
but there's a mutation, that's GCC.

57
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,801
Notice that the amino acid is still the same, both of them code for allenin,

58
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:37,990
this is called a silent mutation, because it doesn't change the amino acid.

59
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,733
If the amino acid changes, to a different amino acid,

60
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,033
it's called a missense mutation, so

61
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:50,688
here this glycerine GGA is changed to argentine AGA.

62
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:54,578
That changes the amino acid sequence of the protein,

63
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:58,556
a nonsense mutation, is when there's a stop code on,

64
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:04,012
that gets inserted, into where the protein would usually be continuing.

65
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:10,127
So, here, we have a glycerine CAA, now it's changed to a stop code on,

66
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:17,274
so that prematurely truncate the protein, and it probably will be nonfunctional.

67
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:21,442
A frame shift mutation, can happen with insertions, or deletions,

68
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:24,138
that are different than a multiple of three.

69
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:29,019
So, here you have a C base, that's been inserted into the DNA sequence,

70
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:32,169
and, now the protein, after that insertion,

71
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,589
the whole reading frame of the protein is shifted.

72
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:42,233
So, instead of the next code on being CCA, the next code on is, ACC,

73
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:47,978
which codes for an entirely different amino acid reading.

74
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:52,088
And then the next one codes for something different to arginine,

75
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:55,764
and so the entire reading frame of the protein is shifted.

76
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:59,845
These three, silent mutation, missense mutation, and

77
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:04,678
nonsense mutation, are called single nucleotide substitutions,

78
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:09,273
because they just are replacing one DNA base, with another one.

79
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,183
When we're talking about nucleotide substitution, and

80
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:20,351
other mutations in the coding region, these are the formal definitions for

81
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:24,011
missense mutation, nonsense mutation, and silent mutations.

82
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,514
The silent mutations are called synonymous,

83
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:29,348
because they don't alter the amino acid sequence.

84
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,509
While the missense, and nonsense mutations are called non synonymous,

85
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,137
because they change the amino acid sequence.

86
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:39,641
As I said before the frameshift mutations,

87
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:44,376
will disrupt the entire reading frame of the sequence, and

88
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:47,893
that will make the protein nonfunctional.

89
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:51,277
We can also have mutations in the non-coding regions,

90
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:56,031
that can affect protein structure itself, or the regulation of the protein.

91
00:06:56,031 --> 00:07:00,092
These types of mutations can change the structure of the protein,

92
00:07:00,092 --> 00:07:04,235
terminal region mutations, and splice donor and accepter sites.

93
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:08,965
The terminal region mutations, could be that you have a stop code on,

94
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:12,093
that usually would truncate the protein, but

95
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:17,570
the stop code on has a mutation that makes it into an amino acid code on, instead.

96
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,714
So, the protein just keeps going and going,

97
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,711
it doesn't stop where it's supposed to.

98
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,949
Splice donor and accepter sites,

99
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,575
can change the splicing sequence of the protein, and so

100
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:34,378
you can get different exons, or introns, being inserted, or deleted.

101
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:38,766
The types of mutations that change only the expression of the protein, or

102
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:39,838
how much is made.

103
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:43,683
The expression of the gene, are things like promoter, or

104
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:47,771
enhancer region mutations, or write his own binding sites.

105
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,941
If you have mutations, and promoters or enhancers,

106
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:54,610
that can either increase, or decrease protein production.

107
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,943
If you have a mutation in the ribosome binding site,

108
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:02,654
that will usually mean that the ribosome can't attach to the DNA as well.

109
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:07,603
And that means that the protein won't be transcribed,

110
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:10,877
or it won't be transcribed as much.

111
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:16,034
Different mutations, at different places in the gene, can have different effects

112
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:20,985
of course, so, let's say that you have a strand of DNA here, and this is a gene.

113
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:26,316
Let's say that these boxes are exons, and the lines are introns.

114
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:31,800
So, you have exon one, exon two, exon three, and the introns between them, and

115
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,909
this is upstream of the first exon, so this might be in the promoter region.

116
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,312
So, if you have mutations and axons,

117
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:44,345
you can get obviously what we've talked about the misspelling of the protein,

118
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:49,249
or the misspecification, you can get, premature stopping of the protein.

119
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:53,631
And you can also get silent mutations that have no effect.

120
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:57,379
If you have mutations in the intron region, you can get,

121
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,754
as we talked about the altered regulation of the gene expression,

122
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:04,116
or, the differences in splicing.

123
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:14,276
So, here's an example of a gene, the CFTR gene, this gene is responsible for

124
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:20,072
cystic fibrosis, the CFTR gene, has hundreds of known mutations.

125
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:26,319
So, here, this is the start of the CFTR gene, from five prime,

126
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:31,769
to three prime, which is the sense strand, of the DNA.

127
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:36,694
So, it has 24 different exon's, the introns are not shown to scale,

128
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:38,812
they're shown really small.

129
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,712
But these are the different exons and introns,

130
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:46,221
these little lines, are where there's known mutation in the CFTR gene.

131
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:52,027
So, here, you can see all of the missense mutations, so, in every exon, just about,

132
00:09:52,027 --> 00:09:56,830
there's a known missense mutation that alters the protein structure.

133
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,322
There are known set of deletions, these are showing the different deletions.

134
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:06,223
There are nonsense mutations that end the protein early, frame shifts

135
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:11,219
that mess everything up, splice sites, and other types of mutations.

136
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:16,008
Here, this is showing the different domains of the protein, so,

137
00:10:16,008 --> 00:10:20,212
these exon's here, code for membrane spanning domain.

138
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:24,855
So, this will help the protein sit in the cell membrane,

139
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:29,791
this ATP binding domain will help activate the protein, and

140
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,491
then there's a region that actually forms.

141
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:37,225
This is an inter cellular channel, and so

142
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:42,569
it forms a channel for chloride to move through in the cell.

143
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:47,480
And so that's our domain, is a regulatory domain,

144
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,851
that will help control how that channel is open, or closed, okay?

145
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:58,630
So, what you can see, is that there's lots of different kinds of mutations, and

146
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,322
that they can affect different regions, of the CFTR protein.

147
00:11:04,514 --> 00:11:10,119
Differences in the CFTR mutations, have different effects,

148
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,817
so, for example, this is a cell, here,

149
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:19,230
in this blue part is the nucleus, and inside of it is the DNA.

150
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,140
So, remember that when a protein is processed, it's transcribed,

151
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,553
in the nucleus, the messenger RNA moves out to the cytoplasm,

152
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,065
that's translated into protein.

153
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:35,573
Then the protein moves, outside of the cell nucleus, into the end of plasma,

154
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:38,186
particular where it's processed further.

155
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:44,066
And because that this particular protein, is an ion channel in the cell membrane,

156
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:49,694
it'll move up to the cell membrane, get itself situated in the cell membrane,

157
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:52,729
and be able to let chloride ions in and out.

158
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:56,774
Let's say that this is what a normal cell looks like, and

159
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:59,570
here's the functional CFTR protein.

160
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,192
There are five different types of mutations, that have been noted for

161
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:09,615
the CFTR protein, one is that there's no synthesis of this protein whatsoever.

162
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:13,977
This can happen through things like nonsense mutations, so

163
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:16,210
a particular one is G542X.

164
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,154
So, there's a stop code on, at the 542nd amino acid position,

165
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:26,896
there's a frame shift mutation, and there's different splice mutations.

166
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:33,131
So, these types of mutations actually result in no protein being made at all.

167
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:37,510
There can be a block in processing with these type two mutations, so,

168
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,015
as it's moving through the endo plasma in particular.

169
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:46,351
There's a missense mutation, that actually causes a block in the processing,

170
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:50,682
and the folded protein never makes it to the membrane of the cell.

171
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:57,147
There's also a deletion of one amino acid, phenylalanine at position 508,

172
00:12:57,147 --> 00:13:01,150
this is the most common mutation in the CFTR gene.

173
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,175
This mutation actually blocks processing entirely also,

174
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,115
there's a type three mutation, a missense in G551D for example.

175
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:16,921
The protein is processed, it gets up to the cell membrane, but

176
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,287
it doesn't open, to let the ions through.

177
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:26,635
Here's an example, for number four, which is an altered conductance, so

178
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:32,302
it gets up into the cell membrane, it lets chloride ions in and out.

179
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:35,813
But, it doesn't have the proper regulation, so

180
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:40,753
it might let too much, or too little chloride ion go through the cell.

181
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:45,966
Last, there's a type five, which is a reduced synthesis, which means that

182
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:51,110
the protein is made and it's functional, but there's not very much of it.

183
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,902
So, as you're thinking about these different mutations,

184
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:59,732
I want you to think about to how, each of these different types of mutations,

185
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:02,621
might be targeted differently by pharmaceuticals.

186
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:05,659
So, if you have a type five mutation,

187
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:11,263
you have reduced synthesis of a functional protein, so, if we can give you a drug,

188
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:15,365
that would actually just boost how much of that MRNA is made.

189
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:20,157
That could actually help restore yourself to regular function, for these that

190
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:25,177
have altered conductance, you've got a protein that works in the cell membrane.

191
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:29,711
You just need a drug to potentially aid, that conductance to get it to,

192
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:33,582
sort of open up at the right time, or close at the right time.

193
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,005
So, the reason I'm pointing this out,

194
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:40,585
is because we can see a direct link, between the mutation that a person has.

195
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:45,092
And the type of pharmaceutical, or drug that might actually help their cell,

196
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,331
function normally.

197
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,269
How do mutations happen?

198
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,648
So, we can get mistakes when we're replicating DNA,

199
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:59,054
so, for example a mistake is made about once every 10 million bases,

200
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:02,882
when the DNA of the cell is replicated to make daughter cells.

201
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:08,321
There is a function called 3 to 5 prime XA nucleus which allows the cell,

202
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:12,969
if it knows it made a mistake, as it's replicating to back up,

203
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:15,797
cut the mistake out, and keep going.

204
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:23,197
And that helps keep the integrity of our DNA sequence, correct.

205
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:25,349
Regions with repeated sequences,

206
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:30,160
like those trinucleotide repeats we talked about are vulnerable to slippage.

207
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,668
That means that they're trying to replicate the DNA, and,

208
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:41,824
the replication machinery can get ahead, or behind by a few bases.

209
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:46,108
This can lead to small insertions, and deletions, and expansion of those

210
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:50,599
trinucleotide repeats, so for example there's a disease called fragile X.

211
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:55,219
Which is the result of too many repeats of the CGG,

212
00:15:55,219 --> 00:16:00,727
set of DNA bases, in the FMR one gene, on the X chromosome.

213
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:05,677
So, if you have 50 repeats of CGG that's pretty normal,

214
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:10,132
if you have 50 to 200, repeats, that means that

215
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:14,998
pretty soon there will be too many repeats that happened.

216
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:20,086
Because once you start to accumulate repeats that slippage, happens more often.

217
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:24,168
If you get over 200 repeats on the X chromosome, and

218
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:29,672
you have a child that inherits that chromosome that has too many repeats,

219
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:32,271
it can cause mental retardation.

220
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:35,890
There are other examples of trinucleotide repeats, so

221
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,204
the CAG, repeat in the huntington's disease, and the HTT gene.

222
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:45,040
And myotonic dystrophy, can be caused by two different kinds

223
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,784
of repeats in two different genes, what causes mutations?

224
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:51,985
One other thing is radiation, so

225
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:55,051
ultraviolet light can cause thymine dimers,

226
00:16:55,051 --> 00:17:00,330
that's when you've got two T bases or thiamine bases right next to each other.

227
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:05,487
And the ultraviolet light causes them to become bonded together,

228
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:09,179
and it causes the DNA not to be easily readable.

229
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:14,931
Gamma rays, and X-ays, from the sun also can generate free radicals,

230
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:19,758
that can damage DNA bases, and also can break chromosomes.

231
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:25,173
There are also environmental toxins that can cause insertions or deletions,

232
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:29,933
altered DNA bases, or also the co violent linkage of DNA strands, or

233
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:34,052
cross-linked strands, that obviously mess up the cell.

234
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:41,446
There are a few different DNA repair mechanisms, one is excision repair, so,

235
00:17:41,446 --> 00:17:44,664
for example, if you've got this thiamine timer, or

236
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:49,546
two T's that are co violently bonded together as a result of ultraviolet light.

237
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:53,524
The cell, there's a specific enzyme that can put a nick, or

238
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:57,112
a little cut in the DNA, on the strand that's broken,

239
00:17:57,112 --> 00:18:01,104
it can release the fragment of DNA, and then fill it back in.

240
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:06,260
And then there's a ligase, or a sealer, that repairs the strand,

241
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,400
and so it's fixed, the dimer is taken out, and it's fixed.

242
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:15,160
One other type of repair is the mismatch repair mechanism, so,

243
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,653
let's say that there's a DNA strand that's being replicated, and

244
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:22,846
it has a G on the top strand, and a C on the bottom.

245
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:27,323
But, accidentally, as the replication is happening,

246
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:32,000
the cellular mechanism pairs G with T, that's a mistake.

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,726
So, the cell can actually recognize that,

248
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:41,381
excise the base that's among the T, and fill in the correct base.

249
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:45,683
The, cell recognizes which strand is correct here,

250
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:48,933
because of the methylation pattern, or

251
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:53,440
the epigenetic patterning of the parent strand of DNA.

252
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,970
So, the parent strand will have methylation, and

253
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,400
the new DNA strand will not, and that's how the cell will know,

254
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,179
that the parent strand, here the G, is correct, and the T is wrong.

255
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,227
We'll talk more about methylation, when we talk about epigenetics.
