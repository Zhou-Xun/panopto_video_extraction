00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:09,680
Hello, good afternoon. This is April calling from the pharmacy. May I speak to faith, please?

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,730
This is faith. Faith, I see that you haven't picked up your prescription this month.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,650
If it's OK with you, I'd like to talk to you about that. Are you talking about my Avonex?

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,930
Yes. Well, I haven't taken it for the last couple of weeks.

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,570
I gave it a try. I tried it for a year because my neurologist wanted me to and I did OK for a while.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,530
But lately I haven't really seen a need for me to stay on it.

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,320
It hasn't helped me feel any better and I don't even really think I'm that bad to begin with.

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,850
The fact that you can't necessarily see any difference when you're on the drug makes it hard to see its value.

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,640
Well, yeah, I know that my neurologist told me something about it slowing the progression, but I don't really know what that means.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,430
He doesn't explain things very well. And when I have questions, he never really has time to talk to me.

11
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,450
You sound a little frustrated with your neurologist. Oh, that's an understatement. My HMO chose him for me.

12
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:13,220
He wouldn't be my first choice. He has no bedside manner, and I don't even think he really knows very much about me.

13
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,450
The fact that you were given this doctor who you don't feel listens well to you and it was

14
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,950
he who recommended the ominous might be making it harder for you to stay on the drug.

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:28,760
Well, you know you could be right. I mean, if I don't like the guy, I'm certainly not going to do what he wants me to do.

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,450
It sounds like talking to your neurologist or even finding a new neurologist.

17
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,130
Understanding that this might be complicated with your managed care roles might be worth considering.

18
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,530
Yes, that's true. But I'm not really sure how to go about doing that.

19
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,710
We can go back to that in a few minutes. But if it's OK with you,

20
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,380
I want to go back to something you mentioned earlier about what you were told about the drugs slowing progression of the disease.

21
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,980
Understanding what this means and making peace with what this means can be an important part of staying on your medication.

22
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,350
So if it's OK with you, I'd be interested in knowing what your understanding is of slowing progression.

23
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:15,230
Well, I guess it means that it doesn't make my symptoms get any better, but it's slowing down the damage going on in my brain,

24
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:22,640
which I guess a means that might delay other problems from occurring, though they still might occur.

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,990
Yes. And if it's OK with you, I'd be happy to explain a little bit more about that.

26
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,460
OK, sure. It's very similar to the blood pressure medication you take.

27
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,010
You can't feel it preventing the heart disease, but we know it does. Does that help at all?

28
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,650
Well, yeah, I guess it does. It does something for me and I just can't feel it right.

29
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:50,540
So I might just have to make peace with not really knowing or feeling directly how much it's doing for me.

30
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,390
But it would be so much better April,

31
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:05,540
if someone could tell me exactly what it was doing or how much worse I'm going to feel because I just can't stand not knowing what's going to happen.

32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,330
And I can't tell anybody about that because they just tell me to stay positive.

33
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,150
Sometimes you just have to vent a little. MS can be very frustrating and even a depressing condition.

34
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:24,200
Frankly, I've kind of been down on myself lately because I feel like I should be able to cope better than I am.

35
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,210
You're disappointed in yourself for not being able to handle at all. Tell me more about that.

36
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:36,980
Well, you know, I did OK for a really long time. Then I got that scare with my walking last year.

37
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:45,230
But recently I've had problems with my speech. It's like slurring, and that has always been one of my greatest fears.

38
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:52,850
That's the reason why I hate to see so much. No one can ever tell me what's going to happen and what's going to happen.

39
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,660
And I feel like there's this time bomb ticking inside my brain.

40
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,990
I wish I could be as positive as everybody tells me to be, but I just can't.

41
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,710
These feelings you mentioned are something quite common among people with Hamas.

42
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:13,220
This feeling that at any time something new can come along and get you. Sounds like the slurred speech you're having is one of those explosions,

43
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:20,660
but you're not sure what the damage is yet because it just started and you're not sure how bout of whether it will get worse.

44
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:28,340
Exactly. It's really scary. I never know when that big one's going to come along.

45
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,490
To be honest, April, it's been 10 years of emotional [INAUDIBLE] because I'm just waiting for the next shoe to drop.

46
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:41,000
So it's been gnawing at the back of your mind. Is today the day? Is this going to be the symptom that you won't be able to handle?

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,230
That constant worry has taken its toll. Oh yeah, big time.

48
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,320
You know, is your pharmacist? I can't advise you about your symptoms.

49
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,030
That's something you'll need to talk to your doctor about, possibly your new one if you're able to swing it.

50
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:59,900
But I work with you over the past couple of years or so, and I can recall when you develop some problems walking, you seemed that you handle that.

51
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,820
Pretty well. Oh, yeah, that's true. I was able to get through that.

52
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,400
So the question is how much you pull from that experience to help you with your current concerns?

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,190
Well, I guess knowing that I can handle it could help me feel less anxious.

54
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,970
But what I really want to feel is that I'm doing everything I can.

55
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,640
I want to feel like I'm fighting this disease.

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,480
So taking the drug, despite the fact that you don't necessarily feel better physically could give you a sense of control,

57
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,530
and that might help reduce your fear and sense of uncertainty. I never thought of it that way, but I guess if it delivers what you said,

58
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,080
then maybe I should think about it that way is giving me more control over this disease.

59
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,300
And if it keeps my speech from slurring, that would be fantastic. Yes, that makes sense.

60
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,900
By taking the drug, you might feel that you're doing what you can to keep it under control, and you might be keeping your other problems at bay.

61
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,320
Well, then maybe you will consider going back on it. Thanks. Did you have any other questions you'd like to ask today?

62
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,070
No, not today, April. Talking with you is really helped. I really appreciate it.

63
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,050
Well, you're quite welcome and you take care and have a good day. Thanks. You, too.

64
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:17,051
Bye bye.
