1
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,070
We're staying for one more person, but we can get started, so.

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,440
Hello, everyone. Welcome back. I hope you guys have a nice fall break, right?

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,280
And so we are going to focus on period evaluation today.

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,550
It's basically going to be the bulk of the day. We'll just spend like an hour going over the teaching philosophy and the syllabus.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:56,390
But first, what I want to do is just quickly talk about the next presentation that you guys are going to do, which is due in two weeks.

6
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,330
And this one is based on a teaching method.

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:11,360
And so basically the purpose of it is we're going to dig around in the literature and look up a certain teaching method.

8
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:20,320
There is a list of different methods in the canvas assignment that you can look through.

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,030
And if there's one there, there should be some literature on any of those teaching methods.

10
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,330
If there's one that's not on there that you want to do, please go ahead and do it.

11
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:40,360
That's totally fine. And so you're going to dig into the literature a little bit and find some articles on this teaching method.

12
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,239
And the purpose is really just to interpret the findings and sort of make your own decision on the

13
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,860
effectiveness of this teaching method and and be able to present it in a concise manner to that,

14
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,560
to your peers. And so since I scheduled this on Election Day, I have already told you guys,

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,210
this is going to remind you that on Election Day, I am going to cancel class that day.

16
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,690
And since anyway presenting virtually or on Zoom is actually a skill we need today.

17
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:24,610
I guess it's a good opportunity just to report this via Zoom or if you have another platform you want to report it on, that's totally fine as well.

18
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,000
But just make sure you have a shareable link at the end that you can share with the rest of the class.

19
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:40,180
So that'll just be do before class. Time would have started on that Tuesday, November 8th.

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,049
And what I'm going to have you do, I actually started a discussion board.

21
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:52,390
I don't think I've published it yet, but I want you to, if you can provide your link in that discussion board and try to take.

22
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,250
Look at one or two of your peers presentations and just provide some feedback.

23
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,340
But I was just like, Great job isn't really interesting or if you're, you know, further feedback or questions for the.

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,980
Go ahead and do that. Just a way that we can all have access to this and see what I've been presented.

25
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,340
Hmm. And I've never actually used the discussion boards and canvas.

26
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,550
So if something's wrong or I'm like, I didn't set it up right.

27
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Just let. Okay.

28
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,830
Yeah. So there's a rubric. There's a very simple rubric and then a list of.

29
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,940
Any questions? I've been.

30
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,200
Person would be here by now. But what we are going to do today is pure evaluation.

31
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,770
We'll spend most of the time on the teaching philosophy and then we'll get into the syllabus.

32
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,020
But the the guide for this is posted on campus.

33
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,730
But I also have paper copies here if you prefer a paper copy of the.

34
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,410
So far the teaching philosophy,

35
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:19,860
I have the entire rubric on the first page and on pages two and three or what you will do for the actual peer evaluation.

36
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,470
And basically just read through it for each sort of component of the rubric,

37
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,010
you're going to write down something that works well, something that needs improvement.

38
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,020
And then some other reflection questions here as well.

39
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:42,090
Once I put you into pairs, I, I just you'll do your exchange, you'll do the written portion.

40
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:50,310
But I also when you guys are both done, I want but the last step here is to articulate it to each other.

41
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,350
And so just make sure if you have to wait a little bit, you know, just work on something else,

42
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,640
but just make sure you do that before you move on to the syllabus,

43
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,220
peer evaluation, and you'll just stay at the same partner for each day just to make it a little easier.

44
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,650
And then the syllabus, I don't actually have any requirement to articulate feedback to each other unless you want to.

45
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,430
But when you're done with that, we'll just we can just take off.

46
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:30,210
And I'll just check in periodically. Just. Before we get into that, I do want to just talk about the next session.

47
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,430
This is our equity minded teaching session or equity focused teaching section session.

48
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,510
DRS,

49
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:47,340
Melissa Prairie and Paul Fleming are going to be coming in and they'll talk about a project they have on anti-racist teaching called Project Heart.

50
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:57,120
But then they'll also be a discussion based around the readings provided to you guys, and I really highly suggest to do those readings.

51
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,570
There is kind of a lot, but it'll help you up just to frame your mind around equity minded teaching,

52
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,390
anti-racist teaching, and just sort of develop some of the language around it.

53
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,000
It'll be. And I think this is going to be like a laid back sort of they'll pose some questions to you guys.

54
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:26,540
Just discuss. Okay.

55
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,920
So these are the pears. It looks like I have Lindsey and Eddie together.

56
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,970
I don't know if she's coming or not. I haven't heard from her. So, Lindsey, why don't you just pair with one one of the students and.

57
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,840
Close to perfect.

58
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,820
Thank you. I think they're going to get our party together.

59
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,300
These people that they know, I'm not to.

60
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:22,700
I notice that this has become this if you want to.

61
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,510
Yeah, that's great. There are those affected. Yeah. Oh, graphic.

62
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:41,000
You know, like. You know.

63
00:07:48,300 --> 00:09:02,500
Thank you. I think so. I like to highlight.

64
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,380
So that's has. Our project.

65
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,560
It's not planning to do anything.

66
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:05,080
So first. There. What has been happening in Libya and in the way that you're describing.

67
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,910
The fact that you were. Things seem to really.

68
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:20,320
I was like oh I probably will still something her.

69
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:30,860
She's actually. If you're not offended that might say I think that I've heard to talk about this to.

70
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:38,710
I think it's not just. And then I had.

71
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,380
And you see really important concepts like to the central point.

72
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:59,280
So really, I mean for anyone who thinks. I think it would be easy to do one.

73
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,850
It's not just the material. Huh?

74
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:19,170
Do you think these figures that. So we're going to talk about them and we're going to talk about critical thinking.

75
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:26,290
And so if you're thinking critically. I recognize.

76
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:38,890
Identified as of health equity in. I was to win people for the conflict.

77
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:49,010
She was talking about. Yeah.

78
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,630
20 minutes to. And then just the specific tool, I guess.

79
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:08,170
Just like the different. And you could describe it.

80
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,460
So yeah, I think it was really useful to work on.

81
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:36,940
Yeah. Most of the time I was doing like. Really fantastic.

82
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Which is something that I hope I mean I mean,

83
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:58,150
I always want to make sure that I think that just because they won't think that I'm expecting this doesn't sound right.

84
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,010
I mean, I thought. I know, because I think it was just that.

85
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:17,810
And I. Every time you and I do something, I feel like I don't feel comfortable telling me about the way they're supposed to be doing service to.

86
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:26,780
I always say that because I feel like that happens before listening is to please

87
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:32,970
before I try to describe the contributions of those people who are here and do that.

88
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,430
Creating really nice for everybody to cry. I'm going to take.

89
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,710
I think you have a clear behavioral strategy.

90
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:51,070
And it doesn't mean that this is wrong. This is just for the first time since I got here.

91
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,340
So. I mean, does that make sense? Yeah.

92
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:05,260
You. And then I have to say, and I would really value the results of her participation.

93
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:13,470
And I've been hearing a lot about. And I think, you know, in class, you know, even.

94
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:29,270
So I guess. Okay. And then, you know, especially having something like this that you're living and I know what you're saying,

95
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:35,619
you're a physical therapist and you struggle to see this.

96
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,830
A fellow had the. That is a really powerful thing.

97
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:46,700
And I was reading about the only thing I didn't do that, like I said, frankly.

98
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,880
That type of thing has.

99
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,880
And then it was basically comments, maybe sci fi.

100
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:08,600
I went over there and when I got out, lay in his teacher.

101
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:19,890
Just to make it. I think that.

102
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,300
Yeah. They started their.

103
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,190
Why are you acting on them?

104
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,390
Yeah. Hand it to your partner. It's all for your partner. Oh, I don't.

105
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,210
Yeah. Are you done with the.

106
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:53,920
Okay. Do you mind putting for someone?

107
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,190
I hope they can. Oh, I.

108
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:09,570
That's what I need to. I think first.

109
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,810
Our series presented. And I started driving faster.

110
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,630
Otherwise you can't use that powerful.

111
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:44,410
So whenever I'm in a classroom. So.

112
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:52,060
Yeah. I know that.

113
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:01,690
Specifically mentioned how? Students.

114
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:11,080
First. I know.

115
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:27,970
I know. I know. It's like something else.

116
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,380
Everything I know about. The transcript.

117
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:49,010
O'BRIEN Yes, I know.

118
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,360
There. The diversity of.

119
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:23,390
Diversify. Is it possible?

120
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:39,900
Yeah, I. Oh, I don't mind if you didn't.

121
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,890
No, it doesn't. I mean, if you read it and it doesn't pick anything up, you just a sentence.

122
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:57,820
Yeah. There. They're not thinking about them in this country thing.

123
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:41,960
Okay. If.

124
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,340
That's great insight. I know.

125
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:02,510
Don't you find it hard to do it right then? I struggle for the first time every year and I just love writing this, just doing sentences.

126
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,320
Having and feeling pretty good, so I found it a lot harder playing.

127
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:37,220
So that's the first. Yeah.

128
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:43,220
So I. And so if we.

129
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,840
Yeah. Yeah, I'm.

130
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:29,600
I'm not. And.

131
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:15,760
Do you want to? I.

132
00:53:46,500 --> 00:55:01,450
Okay. I think it's definitely.

133
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:12,080
Yes. You.

134
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:22,980
It's biochemistry. That's. Oh.

135
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:59,100
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. But this is. Okay.

136
01:01:03,840 --> 01:02:18,540
Okay. That makes more sense. There is.

137
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:30,050
The person under. No, I think that I it because I think it's like one of the last things that.

138
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:36,740
And most of the people that are going to look like. We're not there yet, but spoken.

139
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:48,450
I don't think it's fake. I think it's concise and I like to think and I think this is actually a really positive.

140
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:53,650
But I would say the.

141
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:14,680
I do. Kenny is just an older man.

142
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:40,370
And, you know, you take. There is a market for either of these.

143
01:03:41,150 --> 01:04:00,140
It might be a keyboard. So yeah, that's all I can say about the European Union.

144
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:13,640
If you want to sell the property, you have to. You mentioned that.

145
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:49,450
If you're finished up, you're free to go. I've heard a lot about the Senate hearings.

146
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:59,190
We obviously. We didn't see anything because we don't know how much money they have.

147
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,010
Jake Gyllenhaal Yeah.

148
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:12,830
You know, that's actually, I think because like there's so many, like I said, a roster that has.

149
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:17,430
Yeah. I mean, they. How did that?

150
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:30,550
Considering it was. If you look at what it said mentioned in the.

151
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,830
Yeah. Oh, wait.

152
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:45,580
Like, I haven't heard anything outside of that. You are the one they are.

153
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:50,210
Yeah, I think that's good to know.

154
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,520
Okay. I thought I heard that. Yeah. And that.

155
01:05:53,810 --> 01:06:01,780
That doesn't mean they can't.

156
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:23,480
It's. Please. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

157
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:31,410
Just so you know what I mean is ethnicity thing is that your family values, things like that actually.

158
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:34,860
Yeah, I think, you know.

159
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:00,830
Oh no, it's great. It's really good. Feedback is appreciated.

160
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,840
Any. I have to fight for her votes, their own life, and look like each other.

161
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:12,510
But I just tell your friend that this is tough to ago.

162
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:20,600
I was like, Oh, you have this.

163
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:33,040
Adding another 15 years is like a. I that doesn't really what I've been worried about is putting an end to the original plan.

164
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:41,180
We just haven't passed the. I had. And that must be a good thing.

165
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:50,580
But like the fact that it's so painful that told me that I have be offered nothing because of this second suitcase.

166
01:07:56,530 --> 01:08:00,140
Maybe. How about.

167
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:09,430
Oh. So you think. That, really?
