1
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:13,650
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, so thank you all for attending this morning i'm calling this my zoom refresh and training, because it depends on where you're coming from.

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:24,780
Joanna Kovacevich: Whether these are refresh items, or maybe training and zoom has some new features they've enabled over the summer over the previous sort of spring and summer.

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,710
Joanna Kovacevich: That maybe you'll get to learn something new that you can incorporate.

4
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:49,380
Joanna Kovacevich: My name is Joanna Kovac of itch I work for the School of Public Health in the instructional services team my title is instructional technology consultant, so I am here to bring you some of the things you'll need to know, over the coming weeks.

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:58,500
Joanna Kovacevich: So I want to start off with just some participant information because you'll be hosting your own meetings in the coming weeks, but right now you're just a participant in my meeting.

6
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,970
Joanna Kovacevich: And so I want to set you up with sort of some parameters of how you can interact and participate in the meeting.

7
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:21,540
Joanna Kovacevich: And I would encourage you to do something similar to this during your first class meeting you know, based on your comfort level, the size of the class what sort of framework and parameters, do you want to set up for your students to interact with you.

8
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,400
Joanna Kovacevich: So during this session I would love it if you would all just feel free to either unmute your microphone to ask any questions.

9
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,740
Joanna Kovacevich: Or if you don't feel comfortable using your microphone please feel free to use the chat i'm going to try and keep my chat window open the whole time so I can.

10
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:48,900
Joanna Kovacevich: See if there's any new messages and please feel free to interrupt me at any time, because my main goal during this session is to make sure everyone is set up.

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:02:04,260
Joanna Kovacevich: To complete the items and be ready to sort of roll and jump into your courses so we're actually going to do some setup and looking into your settings and making sure all of your accounts are activated.

12
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:19,050
Joanna Kovacevich: The second option, I just want to make you aware of is the view menu in the upper right corner of your zoom window here's where you can sort of change your personal view of things going on in the meeting.

13
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:30,600
Joanna Kovacevich: You can decide whether you want to see just the video of the active speaker which right now is me, and it can switch back and forth depending on who is speaking.

14
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:47,460
Joanna Kovacevich: Or you can use the gallery view which lets you see sort of the Brady bunch squares of everyone, and this is a great group to use the gallery view with because you're all sharing your videos which is nice sometimes i've just been talking to myself on my screen.

15
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,390
Joanna Kovacevich: So this is a nice change.

16
00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:15,210
Joanna Kovacevich: And thirdly, this is my cue I want to give you the live transcript feature which is the feature of zoom so having it on this slide is my cue to actually activate it so as the meeting host I can enable what is called a live transcript, and this is an automated.

17
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:33,930
Joanna Kovacevich: artificial intelligence Ai generated transcript so it will be imperfect, but what it does do is it gives each viewer each participant each person in the meeting, the ability to opt in to see.

18
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,160
Joanna Kovacevich: An automated transcript of everything that's spoken in the meeting.

19
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:52,380
Joanna Kovacevich: And if you see us now should have a button in your zoom control panel that says live transcript and you'll have options to view it as a transcript in a side window.

20
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,180
Joanna Kovacevich: or as a subtitle that's overlain.

21
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,920
Joanna Kovacevich: You wanted to make one quick change to my.

22
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,930
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, great.

23
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:17,940
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to hide it for myself, but this is a nice feature because it allows each user depending you know, maybe they're in a loud area and they can't quite hear and maybe that text transcript would just help them kind of.

24
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:32,520
Joanna Kovacevich: stay engaged and catch up to what's happening, but it also supports you know, the creation of it is intended to support those that may be hard of hearing.

25
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,090
Chris Andrews: Joanna, can I ask a quick question about the recording.

26
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,920
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, you can.

27
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:49,380
Chris Andrews: What is recorded, is it your view so like our our cameras recorded, is it just the presentation, is it the transcript.

28
00:04:49,380 --> 00:05:02,760
Joanna Kovacevich: For my settings all of the above what I have my record settings on my zoom account set to you is it's going to record everything I screen share today.

29
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,470
Joanna Kovacevich: it's going to record the active speaker view.

30
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:27,090
Joanna Kovacevich: Which now that you have spoken it captured it would have it will record that snapshot and then I also have it recording gallery view and I just do that across the board for all of my recordings, but I don't necessarily use all of that video what I intend to actually.

31
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,790
Joanna Kovacevich: use is the active speaker primarily my teaching.

32
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:47,790
Joanna Kovacevich: If this is a good training session I will use it as the one to share out with others who may not have been able to attend any of the training sessions, but I will go in and make some edits, but it will primarily be myself.

33
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:55,110
Chris Andrews: I wasn't concerned about personal in you know this, but I was wondering when I recorded in a class what was being stored.

34
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,880
Chris Andrews: record others yes.

35
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:05,520
Joanna Kovacevich: I default what is going to record is it's going to record your screen and the active speaker view.

36
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,240
Joanna Kovacevich: And it's typically in a picture and picture, so if you do any screen sharing.

37
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:22,770
Joanna Kovacevich: It would be a little corner I believe it's in the lower right corner, that is, the video window of the active speaker.

38
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:38,730
Joanna Kovacevich: And that's what gets recorded by default, but I can show you were in the settings because that's one of the things we're going to go and look at next where you can adjust that if you'd like to make any changes.

39
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,370
Chris Andrews: Thank you.

40
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:51,960
Joanna Kovacevich: So one of the places that I would like to start is actually with zoom settings I want to show you some features, you might be interested in and a new feature.

41
00:06:51,960 --> 00:07:13,230
Joanna Kovacevich: And there's two places to look at your zoom settings The first one is the University of Michigan the web portal for zoom and we will want any visiting faculty to actually use their university of Michigan zoom account even if you have one at your home institution.

42
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:21,150
Joanna Kovacevich: So we're going to go there soon you michelle.zoom.us but we're also going to look at the zoom application settings.

43
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:31,770
Joanna Kovacevich: If you have the zoom application installed on your computer there's some features that are going to be available to you that may not be available if you're joining on the browser.

44
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:55,830
Joanna Kovacevich: Now I will note if you're using a computer from your home institution, you may run into issues installing and if you do please reach out to your institutions it department, they should be able to help give you the access, you need or give you the ability to update zoom if you need to.

45
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:05,700
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm going to switch my share so that I can show you my zoom application.

46
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:21,720
Joanna Kovacevich: And I have i've actually set up my zoom account so that you all can see zoom while i'm screen sharing, so I don't know if you just saw me move your videos off to the side.

47
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,200
Joanna Kovacevich: But it lets me away I sorry I haven't started my skincare yet.

48
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,090
Joanna Kovacevich: There you go, so you.

49
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:41,910
Joanna Kovacevich: So if you're seeing a duplicate of all of the videos because I have my zoom setting specifically to set up to let me demonstrate zoom.

50
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:52,350
Joanna Kovacevich: And to do that I needed to show all of the zoom functions, by default, your accounts will not do this, so if you are screen sharing.

51
00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:09,210
Joanna Kovacevich: It actually knows to not display any zoom menus so i'm going to move you all off to my second screen over here, because what I really wanted to show is the zoom application.

52
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:17,520
Joanna Kovacevich: And when you have the zoom application so i'm running on MAC, and so I have the zoom on my Doc.

53
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:34,650
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can locate it in my launch pad so that's how I know I have it installed on a windows computer you'd have the start menu or the windows icon in the lower left corner and it would be under your like all applications.

54
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:52,530
Joanna Kovacevich: Because I zoom use zoom regularly i've set up a profile photo and over here in the upper right corner of my zoom window when I click on that profile I get these menu options, I can verify that i'm using my university of Michigan account.

55
00:09:52,530 --> 00:10:12,600
Joanna Kovacevich: If I needed to switch to another account, I have a button to click switch account here so again, if you have a zoom account at your home institution, we would ask that you switch over to your University of Michigan account for your courses over the next few weeks.

56
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:26,970
Joanna Kovacevich: This is also where I asked you to come if you happen to catch my email before our training, this is the menu that I indicated, you could update check for updates on the zoom application, if you already have it installed.

57
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:37,680
Joanna Kovacevich: That menu item is not showing right now, because i'm actively in a meeting and it's not going to do that, while i'm in a meeting.

58
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,260
Joanna Kovacevich: But what I wanted to point out is the settings menu.

59
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:51,510
Joanna Kovacevich: here's where I kind of get to make decisions on what I want my personal meeting experience to be like.

60
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,660
Joanna Kovacevich: Every time I join a zoom meeting.

61
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:03,810
Joanna Kovacevich: And so you're welcome to look through all of these to see if they might be of interest.

62
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:28,080
Joanna Kovacevich: If you are teaching with a large class and I guess i'm thinking over 25 people there is a feature in the video menu if I scroll all the way down to the bottom, that if your computer processor, is capable, you can set it to show up to 49 video windows in gallery view.

63
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:38,340
Joanna Kovacevich: And that's smaller, by default, but I can I have mine set to show up to 49.

64
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,700
Joanna Kovacevich: backgrounds and filters.

65
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:49,860
Joanna Kovacevich: If I want to set and look at or maybe upload virtual backgrounds to us during my meetings.

66
00:11:49,860 --> 00:12:09,750
Joanna Kovacevich: To give me, maybe a little bit of privacy zoom has a new blur feature which is really nice Just to give you a little bit of personal privacy and we've also provided that information to students in sort of a zoom participant guide.

67
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,930
Joanna Kovacevich: let's go ahead and look at the recording session the recording settings because we were looking at that.

68
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:23,070
Joanna Kovacevich: location oh so these settings would actually only be for local recordings.

69
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:36,870
Joanna Kovacevich: When we go over to the web portal will look at cloud recording settings and cloud recording is what i'm going to suggest for this, particularly because the EPA summer staff.

70
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:54,270
Joanna Kovacevich: would like to be able to archive your class recordings, so that they can make them available and we won't lose them at the end of an 150 day sort of storage deadline we have on zoom.

71
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,620
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm going to talk a little bit more about that in a moment.

72
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:21,330
Joanna Kovacevich: But one item I couple of items I wanted to show you down here under the accessibility menu if you happen to have the live transcript subtitle activated you can adjust how large the captions are so if they're a little too small, by default, you can make adjustments here.

73
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:46,230
Joanna Kovacevich: Additionally, something that's really nice is you can actually increase the size of the text in the chat area and chat is often used very heavily during meetings and so sometimes it's nice to just bump it up a little bit.

74
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,170
Joanna Kovacevich: All right.

75
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,590
Joanna Kovacevich: And it also gives me a.

76
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:09,780
Joanna Kovacevich: The keyboard shortcut so that I can actually in the chat area in the text area use a keyboard shortcut to adjust this live during a meeting.

77
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:25,980
Joanna Kovacevich: Any questions about this before we jump into the web portal.

78
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,830
Siddhi Patil: A good question in life, transparent.

79
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:45,210
Siddhi Patil: Yes, send the beginning, you kind of pork chop the icon of life transfer for us that I didn't have an option showing up So could you go through how I can get it started on my day.

80
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:54,120
Joanna Kovacevich: So, in your control panel you're saying you you no longer have a live transcript by.

81
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,840
Siddhi Patil: I do.

82
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,670
Siddhi Patil: But that was after.

83
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,860
Siddhi Patil: You started talking about life transcript and I think you gave access to.

84
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,490
Joanna Kovacevich: that's right So if you click on the live transcript button on your side.

85
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,510
Joanna Kovacevich: you'll have options to view a transcript.

86
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,030
Joanna Kovacevich: or a subtitle.

87
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:24,630
Siddhi Patil: Yes, I do have it right now, but as a cool clothes for a meeting Would I be having access to it.

88
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,680
Joanna Kovacevich: I see, so this.

89
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,880
Joanna Kovacevich: feature must be enabled by the meeting host.

90
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,460
Okay.

91
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:42,960
Joanna Kovacevich: And a meeting host is the only one that will see it, in fact, let me.

92
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,150
Joanna Kovacevich: scroll up to page two on this zoom presenter guide.

93
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,530
Joanna Kovacevich: That shows a comparison of the control panel.

94
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,010
Joanna Kovacevich: between a host and co host.

95
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,380
Siddhi Patil: Right okay.

96
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:04,320
Joanna Kovacevich: And what's missing is the live transcript button when you're a Co host.

97
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,730
Siddhi Patil: yeah.

98
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,250
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm.

99
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:19,110
Joanna Kovacevich: kind of getting into the habit of meeting hosts doing that, so when I put it on my slide That was a reminder, because I completely forgot to do that.

100
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,240
Siddhi Patil: Thank you for clarifying.

101
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,590
Yes.

102
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,680
Joanna Kovacevich: alright.

103
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:51,120
Joanna Kovacevich: So in the chat area i'm going to put a link to the mish zoom web portal and i'd like for you all to click there.

104
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,830
Joanna Kovacevich: When you get there, hopefully you'll be on a page that has the University of Michigan block em logo.

105
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:05,580
Joanna Kovacevich: And three buttons the third button being sign in.

106
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:18,870
Joanna Kovacevich: Now next to sign in it says something about configuring your account if this is the first time you're logging in it will activate your account if it's not the first time you're logging in it'll just log you in.

107
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,990
Joanna Kovacevich: To access your meetings.

108
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:32,700
Joanna Kovacevich: Like what's currently on my screen.

109
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,580
Joanna Kovacevich: When you have done that.

110
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,620
Joanna Kovacevich: When you're logged in come back over to the zoom application.

111
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:53,280
Joanna Kovacevich: Look, for the reactions button in your control panel and give me a thumbs up.

112
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:09,720
Joanna Kovacevich: Where I can see your responses, I can see them in the corner of your webcam, but when nice thing is, when I click on the participants list and see all of your names it actually gives me a tally of how many people.

113
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,280
Joanna Kovacevich: gave me a thumbs up.

114
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,470
Joanna Kovacevich: alright.

115
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:34,740
Joanna Kovacevich: So one thing I want to show you so upcoming meetings, depending on whether you're actively using your zoom account your university Michigan zoom account right now, it, this may be empty for you or you may have some upcoming meetings, what I want to look at.

116
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:42,450
Joanna Kovacevich: In the left hand menu above the meetings menu item is your profile.

117
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:55,110
Joanna Kovacevich: And I want to point out a new feature in zoom that lets you set your personal pronouns on your profile, if this is something of interest.

118
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,350
Joanna Kovacevich: So, using the edit button on the far right next to your name.

119
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,290
Joanna Kovacevich: You can click edit.

120
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:12,540
Joanna Kovacevich: And there's a text box for pronouns and you can type them, however you'd like them to display.

121
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,900
Joanna Kovacevich: You also get to decide.

122
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:28,650
Joanna Kovacevich: How, these are displayed I have mindset to just always share and how i'm currently sharing it is it's a pendant it to the end of my name in the participants list.

123
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:39,300
Joanna Kovacevich: Typically, what we've done in the past is teach people how to use the rename feature in the participant list to add these if they'd like maybe you've been to an event.

124
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,670
Joanna Kovacevich: That has asked for that.

125
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:59,790
Joanna Kovacevich: Or, I can tell zoom asked me, every time because I may not want to share that for every meeting or event I attend and then do not share meaning i'm just adding it to my profile information i'm not displaying it in meetings.

126
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:05,670
Joanna Kovacevich: Once you have that set if you'd like to set it go ahead and click save down at the bottom.

127
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:21,720
Joanna Kovacevich: I have some other fields filled in for my profile that's not required I just did it because I was in there, setting up my pronouns.

128
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:30,990
Joanna Kovacevich: Returning to that left hand menu let's go down to settings.

129
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:36,390
Joanna Kovacevich: there's one new feature that i'd like to show you.

130
00:20:36,390 --> 00:21:00,360
Joanna Kovacevich: And, have you go ahead and enable on your account, just in case it's something you might be interested in now this settings area has a massive amount of settings so when i'm in this area, I like to use the command F, or on a windows machine it's control F and that's the find option.

131
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:11,340
Joanna Kovacevich: So that gives me a text box in the browser in the upper right corner that I can search for a specific word or words.

132
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:24,840
Joanna Kovacevich: And for this i'm going to have you type immersive.

133
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,660
Joanna Kovacevich: And there's a little slider next to immersive view and go ahead and slide that on.

134
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:47,310
Joanna Kovacevich: It doesn't do anything for you automatically What it does is it allows you the use of this feature in your meetings, if you decide to use it and we'll take a look at that in just a moment, so you can see what that is.

135
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:57,420
Joanna Kovacevich: So I have this on from my account, which means I now have it available in any of my zoom meetings to activate.

136
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,920
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright i'm going to close that find window and scroll all the way back up.

137
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,030
Joanna Kovacevich: to the top of my settings.

138
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:14,430
Joanna Kovacevich: Because I was just in meeting settings and now I want to go over to the recording settings.

139
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:23,880
Joanna Kovacevich: So here's where you can specify really the the nitty gritty details of what you want captured.

140
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:39,240
Joanna Kovacevich: When you record to the cloud the local recording you could make minor changes in the zoom application cloud recording has quite a bit of settings that you can look through.

141
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,690
Joanna Kovacevich: So record active speaker with shared screen or record gallery view is shared screen.

142
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:58,170
Joanna Kovacevich: You know, for class work, you might stay away from gallery view because that means you're basically recording everyone all the time throughout the whole meeting.

143
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:07,140
Joanna Kovacevich: If you did something like that you know, maybe because it's a discussion based course you might want to go ahead and let the students know.

144
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,220
Joanna Kovacevich: Just on a quick slide before you begin recording or.

145
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,240
Joanna Kovacevich: At the beginning of your each presentation.

146
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Joanna Kovacevich: So I split all of these out so that I could have different video files of each and I do this because sometimes I create a training video after the fact.

147
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:38,550
Joanna Kovacevich: And so I I want that flexibility, so I can make edits and cuts and use the screen, you know the screen DEMO without having the webcam embedded in it.

148
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:44,940
Joanna Kovacevich: So I kind of set mine up to give myself some flexibility.

149
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,960
Joanna Kovacevich: And then saving chat messages.

150
00:23:48,960 --> 00:24:02,610
Joanna Kovacevich: i've removed the timestamp and participant names from my recordings, because sometimes that's I don't want that recorded when i'm doing training videos after the fact, so.

151
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:10,830
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah and so that's are some other tools there.

152
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,400
Joanna Kovacevich: A lot of tools.

153
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:29,850
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm going to stop my screen share real quick, just so we can take a quick peek at the immersive view, and this is one of the things that you actually need an up to date zoom application to view which.

154
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:37,440
Joanna Kovacevich: If you run into issues with or something may not be updated, but we'll see.

155
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:49,230
Joanna Kovacevich: So, as I mentioned earlier in the presentation there's a view menu in the upper right corner and when i'm not screen sharing my options are speaker view gallery view.

156
00:24:49,230 --> 00:25:07,500
Joanna Kovacevich: But because I have immersive view turned on I have immersive as a third option, so i'm going to click on that and that's because i'm a host you as viewers would not have the ability to activate this.

157
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:19,170
Joanna Kovacevich: So we shall see how we do so what I all right, how does it start and we'll see.

158
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:25,890
Joanna Kovacevich: If this is visible to any of you.

159
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,500
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, I have one.

160
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:42,300
Joanna Kovacevich: Some of you are probably just seeing a white background behind everyone, yes, getting head nod yes, so that is just a cue that it's not.

161
00:25:42,300 --> 00:27:29,179
Joanna Kovacevich: The application just would need to be updated to see what we're doing so what I will do is i'm going to take a screenshot.

162
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:56,190
Joanna Kovacevich: And for our would you like to describe what you're seeing on your end.

163
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:03,240
Onyebuchi Arah: i'm seeing everybody set up looking like.

164
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,780
Onyebuchi Arah: And you're in the middle.

165
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,260
Onyebuchi Arah: So cool virtual classroom yeah.

166
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,120
Joanna Kovacevich: that's right so we're basically in a virtual classroom.

167
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:25,080
Joanna Kovacevich: We have a picture of a classroom and we're all kind of seated in chairs and i'm going to attach a screenshot.

168
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,360
Joanna Kovacevich: so that you can see what it looks like.

169
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:37,320
Joanna Kovacevich: For for the two of us.

170
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:51,300
Joanna Kovacevich: But I will go ahead and stop that just because it's really it really only works and it's fun and interesting if everyone can see it so i'm going to switch this back.

171
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,310
alright.

172
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,870
Joanna Kovacevich: But I think.

173
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:17,580
Joanna Kovacevich: You know I consider this a fight zoom fatigue tool to do something different, these little since these scenes and there's actually several you can choose from that are pre loaded by zoom one has a little bit more of a lecture hall style to it, it can fit up to 25 people.

174
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:29,179
Joanna Kovacevich: And so yeah it's interesting and so, but again, your students would need that nudge of hey make sure your.

175
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,179
Joanna Kovacevich: applications are up to date.

176
00:27:30,503 --> 00:27:34,553
Joanna Kovacevich: we've made sure your zoom accounts are activated.

177
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:52,103
Joanna Kovacevich: I mentioned briefly that the program wants to be able to save a copy of your class meeting so that they don't get lost at the end of that 150 days and how we're going to do that is we're going to activate.

178
00:27:52,103 --> 00:28:11,843
Joanna Kovacevich: Your University of Michigan dropbox account if it's not yet activated and then we're gonna set up an integration between the two what that's going to do is that every time you have a zoom recording it's going to then automatically save in your dropbox account.

179
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:21,023
Joanna Kovacevich: And then we're going to save that dropbox folder with Maria and some of the epic team, so that they can access those recordings.

180
00:28:21,023 --> 00:28:23,048
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, so to get started.

181
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:36,680
Joanna Kovacevich: dropbox dot you mesh.edu and i'm going to put that in the meeting chat.

182
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:46,673
Joanna Kovacevich: you're going to log in with your University of Michigan unique name and password that you're using for canvas and your umesh email.

183
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:58,163
Joanna Kovacevich: And this will be a one time setup thing that you can kind of set up and forget and then i'll provide you a handout in case you want to disconnect this after the Program.

184
00:28:58,163 --> 00:29:11,093
Joanna Kovacevich: For those of you that are university Michigan regulars you likely will not want all your future recordings being shared.

185
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:17,813
Joanna Kovacevich: So that we've made sure everyone's enabled and logged in.

186
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:25,223
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to jump to the future, the steps for future cloud recordings.

187
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:31,943
Joanna Kovacevich: So I have a third link that i'm going to paste in the chat.

188
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:40,493
Joanna Kovacevich: that's going to let us walk through the steps of linking your zoom account in your dropbox account.

189
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:52,283
Joanna Kovacevich: When you get to that page go ahead and click connect zoom to dropbox.

190
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:56,723
Joanna Kovacevich: A lot of these these first steps are just click click click click click.

191
00:29:56,723 --> 00:30:02,813
Joanna Kovacevich: On the next page click connect to zoom.

192
00:30:02,813 --> 00:30:15,053
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm trusting that you'll let me know in the chat or unmute your microphone if I if I am losing you somewhere.

193
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:24,743
Joanna Kovacevich: The next page go ahead and put got it.

194
00:30:24,743 --> 00:30:42,443
Joanna Kovacevich: Now, because we just had you sign into zoom you may not see the sign and step, but if you do please use the sign in with us oh that's single sign on meaning, you can use your University of Michigan credentials to log in.

195
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:53,783
Joanna Kovacevich: In fact, every time you login with zoom for the epic courses, please use the sign in with sso and then you'll just need to type you mish.

196
00:30:53,783 --> 00:31:09,023
Joanna Kovacevich: Because this is our sort of portal you mish.zoom.us.

197
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:22,583
Joanna Kovacevich: The next step is an authorized click.

198
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:29,333
Joanna Kovacevich: And the last one is copy zoom cloud recordings to dropbox and will say enable.

199
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:47,513
Joanna Kovacevich: Now this is all of your future zoom recordings it's not going to do anything about your previous recordings, if you are interested in that I do have instructions, there is a way that those can be exported.

200
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:52,103
Joanna Kovacevich: All right, and you should see connecting to zoom.

201
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:58,793
Joanna Kovacevich: are connected to zoom.

202
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:04,223
Joanna Kovacevich: It should confirm.

203
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:11,843
Joanna Kovacevich: Now i'd like you to go ahead and go to your dropbox home.

204
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:25,523
Joanna Kovacevich: It may be on a previous tab or you can use the link in the chat that's dropbox that you mesh.edu.

205
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:38,903
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm curious if you have a zoom folder there now.

206
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:45,323
Joanna Kovacevich: or no not yet.

207
00:32:45,323 --> 00:32:47,633
Joanna Kovacevich: No.

208
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,103
Joanna Kovacevich: That may be.

209
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,023
Joanna Kovacevich: Oh i'm sorry Chris go ahead.

210
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:52,343
Chris Andrews: I just said, not yet.

211
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:53,093
Joanna Kovacevich: Right yes.

212
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:58,403
Joanna Kovacevich: That could be because you don't have a recording yet.

213
00:32:58,403 --> 00:33:04,193
Joanna Kovacevich: But they will save under a zoom folder.

214
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:10,823
Joanna Kovacevich: That when I come over here to the right, I have share settings for.

215
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:21,503
Joanna Kovacevich: And then I can add Maria and Jody and the summer session team to have access to this folder.

216
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:22,643
Joanna Kovacevich: And this is your dropbox.

217
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,533
Joanna Kovacevich: Account so.

218
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:32,273
Joanna Kovacevich: For those of you who are at university of Michigan you can come in and remove this after the fact.

219
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:37,613
Joanna Kovacevich: And I will share out my full document.

220
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,983
Joanna Kovacevich: That.

221
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:51,503
Joanna Kovacevich: tells you how to backup existing cloud recordings if that's of interest, but then also I have instructions for how to turn this off in case you would rather not backup your.

222
00:33:51,503 --> 00:34:03,413
Joanna Kovacevich: Recording so I currently have all my recording saving and zoom or in sorry saving and dropbox so that when zoom sends me those emails it say you're recording for this.

223
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:12,563
Joanna Kovacevich: zoom meeting is about to be deleted, I don't have to worry about that, because I know I have it all backed up, and I can just let them.

224
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:17,573
delete.

225
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:23,213
Joanna Kovacevich: So let's talk about scheduling your zoom meetings.

226
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:27,323
Joanna Kovacevich: I can see zoom under connected Apps.

227
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:34,463
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, do you see Oh, is it under connected Apps.

228
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,173
Joanna Kovacevich: That could be.

229
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:42,833
Onyebuchi Arah: saddens I looked on a sentence.

230
00:34:42,833 --> 00:35:00,413
Joanna Kovacevich: Oh Okay, yes, so that is exactly telling you that you have the zoom connection and that's where you could remove it later after the fact, and you are looking under like settings yes that's exactly right.

231
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:04,883
Joanna Kovacevich: Connected Apps mm hmm.

232
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:09,473
Joanna Kovacevich: And so that's where you would be able to remove this later.

233
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:15,023
Joanna Kovacevich: But when you have your first class meeting that gets recorded, you will.

234
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:18,533
Joanna Kovacevich: zoom is going to give you, your own zoom folder.

235
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,243
Onyebuchi Arah: In your dropbox account.

236
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,773
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'll click on mine.

237
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:27,833
Joanna Kovacevich: Because it's going to give you a date and timestamp folder for each meeting.

238
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:35,693
Joanna Kovacevich: And it's going to name it whatever you have named your meeting, so I have a lot of my my personal meeting rooms in here.

239
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:41,153
Joanna Kovacevich: Because that's how I that's what the meeting was named.

240
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:44,243
Excellent.

241
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:50,663
Chris Andrews: Joanna is there any difference between zoom at Michigan and zoom at medicine medicine that Michigan.

242
00:35:50,663 --> 00:35:55,253
Joanna Kovacevich: Not anymore, which is great news.

243
00:35:55,253 --> 00:36:01,193
Joanna Kovacevich: We can all be on the same page.

244
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,683
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, so let's talk about scheduling these.

245
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:11,243
Joanna Kovacevich: In your canvas sites and I am going to put.

246
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:18,053
Joanna Kovacevich: The need to recall the there it is.

247
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:21,563
Joanna Kovacevich: The link to access.

248
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:31,733
Joanna Kovacevich: canvas at university of Michigan i'm going to put that in the chat.

249
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:38,633
Joanna Kovacevich: This is going to also ask for your University of Michigan login and should should take you to your dashboard.

250
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:57,083
Joanna Kovacevich: If you taught or participated last year, you may see the last year courses in the published courses, if you scroll down canvas now separates out the unpublished courses so that's where your upcoming courses may be.

251
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:01,043
Joanna Kovacevich: Go ahead and click on the title.

252
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:09,203
Joanna Kovacevich: of your upcoming course for me i'm going to go into a practice site.

253
00:37:09,203 --> 00:37:15,983
Joanna Kovacevich: So you should see a zoom menu in the left hand navigation of your course.

254
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:26,453
Joanna Kovacevich: We went in enabled those so that they're ready for you and we put it up towards the top so it's easy for you and your students to locate.

255
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:43,253
Joanna Kovacevich: here's what we're going to use here's where we're going to schedule our meetings and it's one location, that your meeting recordings are going to populate after the fact, the recordings so right now.

256
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:51,203
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm on the upcoming meetings tab, and this is sort of the default view and I have nothing here because I haven't scheduled any meetings, yet.

257
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:57,533
Joanna Kovacevich: But in the upper right corner, I have a bright blue schedule a new meeting button.

258
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:08,423
Joanna Kovacevich: If you haven't clicked on this, you may have had an authorized step before you got to the screen go ahead and click authorize.

259
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:12,623
Joanna Kovacevich: If that appeared for you.

260
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,763
Joanna Kovacevich: So the nice thing about putting this in.

261
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:25,973
Joanna Kovacevich: scheduling these meetings, through the canvas site through the zoom integration with canvas is that it's going to be very easy for your students to access these.

262
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:32,933
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm going to click schedule a new meeting.

263
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:41,603
Joanna Kovacevich: And we're going to look at this interface, and you can go ahead and set up your course meetings, right now, if you'd like or you can wait if you'd prefer.

264
00:38:41,603 --> 00:38:50,723
Joanna Kovacevich: One quick note about because your courses are currently unpublished unless you've gone ahead and publish them.

265
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:56,123
Joanna Kovacevich: If your courses unpublished, and I scheduled these zoom meetings.

266
00:38:56,123 --> 00:39:13,463
Joanna Kovacevich: that's great I can then publish the course just a word of warning if your courses currently published and you schedule these meetings every student in your course is going to get an email for every single zoom meeting that gets scheduled it's kind of.

267
00:39:13,463 --> 00:39:15,473
Joanna Kovacevich: not ideal.

268
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:26,093
Joanna Kovacevich: But it's a canvas notification i've talked to our it department about that and there's nothing we can do so, sometimes, especially when you're setting recurring meetings.

269
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:38,453
Joanna Kovacevich: You might consider doing that, while it's still unpublished, so that your students don't get spammed with you know, five, seven emails about all the meetings you've scheduled for the whole week.

270
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:41,933
Joanna Kovacevich: So go ahead, and this would be your.

271
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:47,753
Joanna Kovacevich: title and you can be more specific, if you'd like.

272
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:52,943
Joanna Kovacevich: A description, for this is optional.

273
00:39:52,943 --> 00:40:02,663
Joanna Kovacevich: The Wednesday you'll want to set this to your very first meeting the date and the start time of the meeting.

274
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:07,043
Joanna Kovacevich: The duration.

275
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:09,953
Joanna Kovacevich: And for the time zone.

276
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:25,853
Joanna Kovacevich: This is going to depend on what your zoom profile is set to and we didn't look at that, in the profile settings but go ahead and set that to be Eastern time since our program is kind of structured around the eastern time zone.

277
00:40:25,853 --> 00:40:34,613
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, if you'd like to reuse the same meeting link, you can set this up to be a recurring meeting.

278
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:54,713
Joanna Kovacevich: You check that you kind of get options to whether is this meeting, take place at the same time, every day or every other day weekly, and I believe these are every day so repeat every one day, and then you can set the date of the last class meeting.

279
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:59,963
Joanna Kovacevich: or just by how many meetings, there will be.

280
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:07,133
Chris Andrews: This affect how it's recorded and that, if this goes on for five days you get five separate recordings regardless or.

281
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:10,373
Chris Andrews: The recurring meeting stacks them all up.

282
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:17,933
Joanna Kovacevich: that's correct a recurring meeting would give you a new recording for each day.

283
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:29,663
Chris Andrews: Is it a better practice to have shorter one hour meetings and then a break and then another meeting or just have a meeting all afternoon and then.

284
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:45,353
Joanna Kovacevich: I would say meet all afternoon yep in the same meeting yep because then I guess what this affects more is that the meeting ID numbers, the same for all of these meetings.

285
00:41:45,353 --> 00:41:52,223
Joanna Kovacevich: that's probably a bigger impact.

286
00:41:52,223 --> 00:42:06,623
Joanna Kovacevich: registration is not required, but security will be required University of Michigan has implemented a requirement that you must pick one of these security options.

287
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:12,293
Joanna Kovacevich: For mine, I must have waiting room set as my default.

288
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:32,093
Joanna Kovacevich: But pass code is actually a good option for Class meetings, and that is because, when students joined through this zoom menu item in canvas it automatically sort of enters in the past code for them.

289
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:36,323
Joanna Kovacevich: So if you check past code you get to.

290
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:49,553
Joanna Kovacevich: Type in a number.

291
00:42:49,553 --> 00:42:55,703
Joanna Kovacevich: And for this program we won't use only authenticated users.

292
00:42:55,703 --> 00:43:11,813
Joanna Kovacevich: So we'll do pass code or waiting Chairman waiting room is basically you sort of get to screen all of the names of everyone who's joining and choose who to admit, which can be a bit time consuming.

293
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:12,893
Daowen Zhang: question.

294
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:19,973
Daowen Zhang: Yes, um my media sister has already created.

295
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:20,903
Daowen Zhang: The meeting for me.

296
00:43:20,903 --> 00:43:22,973
Joanna Kovacevich: schedule for me so.

297
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:27,173
Daowen Zhang: So we can go back to do any editing.

298
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:31,043
Joanna Kovacevich: You can yes absolutely.

299
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:36,593
Daowen Zhang: And then we had to start a meeting or something like that which button, should we play.

300
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:39,923
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, so I will show you that as soon as we finish this.

301
00:43:39,923 --> 00:43:44,153
Joanna Kovacevich: you'll see what it should look like in the course.

302
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:55,973
Daowen Zhang: I also I want the students to be able to kind of like a go there and then to me and to interact with themselves.

303
00:43:55,973 --> 00:43:56,273
Joanna Kovacevich: Oh.

304
00:43:56,273 --> 00:43:57,983
Joanna Kovacevich: I see okay mm hmm.

305
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:06,173
Daowen Zhang: So, and so the time that we specified in in time and time and it's not fun right.

306
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:13,523
Joanna Kovacevich: Right that's correct so that would create the designated meeting times.

307
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:23,033
Joanna Kovacevich: But this setting here under meeting options this last set of checkboxes enable join before host.

308
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:31,523
Joanna Kovacevich: That means that students could join, even if the host, which in this case, it sounds like your media assistant is.

309
00:44:31,523 --> 00:44:34,943
Joanna Kovacevich: The formal meeting host.

310
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:42,353
Joanna Kovacevich: You might ask them to double check that that checkbox is enabled.

311
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:57,023
Joanna Kovacevich: So that students can go in and interact whenever they would like what I might also suggest is to not set meetings to record automatically.

312
00:44:57,023 --> 00:45:02,963
Joanna Kovacevich: I would recommend doing either or on this.

313
00:45:02,963 --> 00:45:10,163
Joanna Kovacevich: So you could do record meeting automatically and not allow students to join.

314
00:45:10,163 --> 00:45:22,973
Joanna Kovacevich: What you will get with both of those activated it's going to start a recording every time somebody clicks on the meeting link and sometimes students are just clicking on the link to make sure it works for them.

315
00:45:22,973 --> 00:45:25,103
Joanna Kovacevich: so that they can successfully get in.

316
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:29,873
Joanna Kovacevich: And so we don't we don't need that.

317
00:45:29,873 --> 00:45:41,573
Joanna Kovacevich: So it'll be sort of on there might be a checklist of things to do before starting the class and one of them might be start the recording.

318
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:51,083
Joanna Kovacevich: Another thing I would suggest for the this the summer session programs is utilizing this alternative hosts option.

319
00:45:51,083 --> 00:46:00,683
Joanna Kovacevich: For media assistance that are scheduling the meeting, they should put the faculty members University of Michigan email address in here.

320
00:46:00,683 --> 00:46:18,383
Joanna Kovacevich: And for faculty that are scheduling the meetings they should put their media assistance email address in here, and what that does is it automatically will give the other person that co host ability when they connect into the meeting.

321
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:26,063
Joanna Kovacevich: Now, which of you gets host ability and co host ability depends on who joins first.

322
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:31,673
Joanna Kovacevich: But that function is very easy to pass back and forth.

323
00:46:31,673 --> 00:46:36,323
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can demonstrate that.

324
00:46:36,323 --> 00:46:40,253
Joanna Kovacevich: But that is the settings on here.

325
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:59,063
Joanna Kovacevich: If I scroll down at the very bottom and it actually doesn't even let me see any more to make this higher up, there are some poll information but i'm going to say, if you want to create polls, we won't do it here i'll show you how to do that in the web portal.

326
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:13,463
Joanna Kovacevich: But i'm going to scroll back up to the top and use this what's called i'm going to back up on the breadcrumb trail to the course meetings, and now you can see, in my upcoming meetings.

327
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:19,733
Joanna Kovacevich: It is added one for every day at one o'clock based on my settings.

328
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:26,093
Joanna Kovacevich: If I need to make changes to this i'll click on the topic title.

329
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:33,563
Joanna Kovacevich: come down to the bottom and Edit.

330
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:54,503
Joanna Kovacevich: scroll back up and if I back out again so because i'm the meeting host and the instructor of this course, when I come to the zoom menu, I now have a start button next to each meeting and because I scheduled these meetings I could also delete them.

331
00:47:54,503 --> 00:48:01,223
Joanna Kovacevich: When your students come to this page they're going to see a join button.

332
00:48:01,223 --> 00:48:09,383
Joanna Kovacevich: And they just have to click on that in order to join the zoom meeting.

333
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:15,293
Daowen Zhang: i'm in my schedule, I could not click the title.

334
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:22,133
Joanna Kovacevich: In years that could be because your media assistant set the meetings up.

335
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:22,943
Daowen Zhang: I see.

336
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:27,353
Joanna Kovacevich: So you don't have that access.

337
00:48:27,353 --> 00:48:33,923
Joanna Kovacevich: So if there are if there's anything specific you want to make sure.

338
00:48:33,923 --> 00:48:37,163
Joanna Kovacevich: That they have set up for you.

339
00:48:37,163 --> 00:48:43,793
Joanna Kovacevich: You might want to meet with them or ask them to check certain settings.

340
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:57,323
Joanna Kovacevich: Including that enable join before host.

341
00:48:57,323 --> 00:49:05,003
Joanna Kovacevich: Along these tabs the last tab is cloud recordings.

342
00:49:05,003 --> 00:49:15,563
Joanna Kovacevich: When you record the meetings that you've scheduled in this canvas site they're going to appear here.

343
00:49:15,563 --> 00:49:20,033
Joanna Kovacevich: But they appear as unpublished.

344
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:37,673
Joanna Kovacevich: When when your recordings are now in this list you'll actually get an email from zoom that says your recording is ready to view and it's talking about your recording is ready to view on the on can on i'm sorry zoom but it's also going to appear here.

345
00:49:37,673 --> 00:49:48,293
Joanna Kovacevich: So that should be your cue to come over and if it's a you know class meeting you want the class to be able to see click on this slider.

346
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:50,573
Joanna Kovacevich: to publish it.

347
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:58,583
Joanna Kovacevich: which will allow your students to come to this cloud recordings tab and view.

348
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:09,233
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, your media assistant for yours, in particular your media assistant will need to come and publish those.

349
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:19,343
Joanna Kovacevich: So that's kind of Nice, it takes pick that off your plate.

350
00:50:19,343 --> 00:50:26,753
Joanna Kovacevich: Any questions before we move on.

351
00:50:26,753 --> 00:50:33,503
Joanna Kovacevich: So what we've done is we've made sure your zoom accounts are activated we've linked them to your dropbox account.

352
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:43,673
Joanna Kovacevich: we've scheduled your zoom meetings, and now I want to jump into actually running your zoom meeting.

353
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:58,283
Joanna Kovacevich: I do want to note that, along with that zoom email that the host to the person who scheduled the zoom meeting will get they'll get an email from zoom saying your recording is ready to view or share.

354
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:25,043
Joanna Kovacevich: they're going to get a second email if you've done the dropbox integration you're also going to get an email from dropbox saying your zoom recording has successfully copied so just a good confirmation that all of these things are working as expected.

355
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:33,113
Joanna Kovacevich: So I want to go through some of the tools that you can use for teaching.

356
00:51:33,113 --> 00:51:48,113
Joanna Kovacevich: And I will be begin with the security, but let me make an adjustment over here and bring my window over.

357
00:51:48,113 --> 00:52:00,143
Joanna Kovacevich: So hosts and co host will have this security button in their control panel that opens a menu of security items and zoom implemented these.

358
00:52:00,143 --> 00:52:06,833
Joanna Kovacevich: primarily as a response to the zoom bombing phenomenon that happened when we all switch to remote.

359
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:18,713
Joanna Kovacevich: Basically what it lets you do is implement really quick reactions if something's happening that shouldn't be happening now, we are not as susceptible to the.

360
00:52:18,713 --> 00:52:36,533
Joanna Kovacevich: To a zoom bomb situation because of the way we've had your meeting scheduled through canvas and that's how we have students joining, so they have to have a university of Michigan login they have to be enrolled in your course we already have some security.

361
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:42,413
Joanna Kovacevich: parameters in place, but I do want to go over these just so you're aware of them.

362
00:52:42,413 --> 00:52:51,593
Joanna Kovacevich: locking the meeting means nobody can enter this meeting after I enable this the downside of this is if one of you were a.

363
00:52:51,593 --> 00:53:05,633
Joanna Kovacevich: Maybe something happens with your Internet connection and you get kicked off the zoom meeting you wouldn't be able to join in, it would say this meeting is locked and no one is allowed to join so for classroom environment it's not an ideal setting.

364
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:15,863
Joanna Kovacevich: I could, I could manually enable the waiting room meaning i'm not expecting anybody else to join everyone who's supposed to be here is here.

365
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:29,783
Joanna Kovacevich: And so what it would do is it would sort of hold off anyone who's trying to join the meeting they wouldn't automatically be dropped in it would give me a notification that says the name of the person.

366
00:53:29,783 --> 00:53:48,533
Joanna Kovacevich: Is in the waiting room do I want to admit them or remove them, and so you kind of get to pre screen anyone who's coming in, but again I will see the names of people who may be dropped off kicked off the zoom meeting, for whatever reason, and are trying to rejoin.

367
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:54,863
Joanna Kovacevich: high profile pictures is another option, and it would just show people's names.

368
00:53:54,863 --> 00:54:19,943
Joanna Kovacevich: The next set is an interesting list of what participants are allowed to do and so anyone who's not a host or co host so mine all have check marks next to this meaning you all, can do these things in this in my meeting participants have the ability to screen share chat rename themselves.

369
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:23,183
Joanna Kovacevich: unmute themselves.

370
00:54:23,183 --> 00:54:34,853
Joanna Kovacevich: show their video start their video and annotate on shared content that's kind of a little hidden tool that I can show you.

371
00:54:34,853 --> 00:54:49,763
Joanna Kovacevich: You can remove the parts, you can remove a participant by name, so when I click on that I have my participants window open, so a quick remove button just appeared next to each of your names.

372
00:54:49,763 --> 00:54:52,373
Joanna Kovacevich: But I don't want to remove anyone.

373
00:54:52,373 --> 00:55:04,883
Joanna Kovacevich: And then I can also activate this to spend participant activities which would disable all of these things, which is a tool that I would definitely use if I were in a.

374
00:55:04,883 --> 00:55:14,213
Joanna Kovacevich: You know, public meeting, and that was being zoom bottomed I would want to kind of shut everything down.

375
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:21,233
Joanna Kovacevich: i'll hit cancel to take those removes off and get all these other menu items back.

376
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:27,263
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'll show you the rename and annotate on shared content.

377
00:55:27,263 --> 00:55:32,513
Joanna Kovacevich: So rename is something that can be done at any time.

378
00:55:32,513 --> 00:55:41,603
Joanna Kovacevich: When a user has the participants panel open and you can open it just by clicking on the participants.

379
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:44,213
Joanna Kovacevich: menu on your control panel.

380
00:55:44,213 --> 00:55:51,143
Joanna Kovacevich: When I hover over my own name and click the more menu.

381
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:54,533
Joanna Kovacevich: One of the options is to rename.

382
00:55:54,533 --> 00:56:04,343
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, prior to being able to tell them your personal pronouns I could go in and type these in manually basically add them to my name.

383
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:16,403
Joanna Kovacevich: at university of Michigan the names, you see, in the zoom meetings are our formal names, that is what our primary name is registered as in the employee system.

384
00:56:16,403 --> 00:56:37,583
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, sometimes I want to go in there, and maybe modify that so it's not you know used to have my pre married name as well, so I had this just ridiculously long name and I didn't want that, in so I would rename it and manually edit it.

385
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:49,853
Joanna Kovacevich: Just for your awareness, I want to show you the annotate on shared content, so at the top of your zoom window, you should see a little green bar that says.

386
00:56:49,853 --> 00:57:00,443
Joanna Kovacevich: Joanna come back of which is screen sharing or you are viewing Joanna come back of it just screen and next to that is a view options menu.

387
00:57:00,443 --> 00:57:08,483
Joanna Kovacevich: And I believe in that drop down menu is the annotate Chris founded already.

388
00:57:08,483 --> 00:57:10,823
Joanna Kovacevich: And it's hidden.

389
00:57:10,823 --> 00:57:14,783
Joanna Kovacevich: But the zoom bombers know that is there.

390
00:57:14,783 --> 00:57:18,563
Joanna Kovacevich: A very.

391
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:22,373
Joanna Kovacevich: unfortunate.

392
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:37,193
Joanna Kovacevich: Time where this came in was poor student was defending their dissertation on zoom really early during the pandemic and assume bomber was in the meeting and drew on his presentation and quite a disruption, but.

393
00:57:37,193 --> 00:57:49,403
Joanna Kovacevich: I just want to let you know that that's always there, unless you turn that off.

394
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:53,933
Joanna Kovacevich: And I think that I, as a host have the ability.

395
00:57:53,933 --> 00:58:13,283
Joanna Kovacevich: To clear all of those when I go to my floating toolbar and I open my annotate toolbar I have a trash can it says clear all the drawings.

396
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:28,013
Joanna Kovacevich: let's see what else under participants, I talked about being able to switch co host and host position so again, I can do that because i'm the meeting host I can do that, from my participants panel.

397
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:45,683
Joanna Kovacevich: I get menu options next to each of your names, whereas you are only going to have options next to your own name, so if I click the more menu next to any of your names, I have the ability to promote you to the host.

398
00:58:45,683 --> 00:59:04,703
Joanna Kovacevich: or make as Co host so depending on how you and your media assistant, or you in the Faculty Member you're supporting want to designate, your roles, you can switch them here if needed.

399
00:59:04,703 --> 00:59:21,863
Joanna Kovacevich: The chat so the security area, it was a quick way by default participants are allowed to chat if that's something I wanted to disable which I have in some cases when, during the academic year when.

400
00:59:21,863 --> 00:59:29,243
Joanna Kovacevich: A faculty Member had all the students join on zoom to take an online quiz together we disabled chat.

401
00:59:29,243 --> 00:59:35,633
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can control that when my chat panel is open.

402
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:39,833
Joanna Kovacevich: down in the message bar.

403
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:54,443
Joanna Kovacevich: And the far right lower corner, I have three dots and anytime you see three dots it kind of means more means they're hiding more options from you that you can go look at So when I click on that.

404
00:59:54,443 --> 01:00:03,593
Joanna Kovacevich: I have the ability, and all of you have the ability to save the chat so say you wanted to save these links.

405
01:00:03,593 --> 01:00:10,883
Joanna Kovacevich: That we've posted here, so far, you could click the SAVE chat and basically save a text file.

406
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:23,873
Joanna Kovacevich: And so that's available to your participants now I as a host have set up my settings to just save a copy of the chat after every meeting that i'm a host for.

407
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:37,343
Joanna Kovacevich: But here I can designate cool participants can chat with no one meaning chats just disabled host only meaning they can only chat with me.

408
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:44,123
Joanna Kovacevich: Everyone publicly meaning anything everyone types, everyone can see.

409
01:00:44,123 --> 01:00:48,683
Joanna Kovacevich: or everyone publicly and directly.

410
01:00:48,683 --> 01:00:59,663
Joanna Kovacevich: So you'll notice this everyone button actually expands and I could be private chatting with one of you.

411
01:00:59,663 --> 01:01:03,623
Joanna Kovacevich: You can pick someone to private chat with.

412
01:01:03,623 --> 01:01:23,333
Joanna Kovacevich: Now, when you save a chat transcript it will do all of the everyone the public chat messages and your private messages, but you won't see other people's private message.

413
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:30,473
Joanna Kovacevich: Unless there are any questions about those I want to share some screen share tools, Chris got.

414
01:01:30,473 --> 01:01:41,393
Chris Andrews: Just a quick question about that, when you say save the chat does it save everything that's happened since you've joined and all the way till the end of the meeting, or only at that time.

415
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:45,863
Joanna Kovacevich: that's a great question it's capturing what exists.

416
01:01:45,863 --> 01:01:51,143
Joanna Kovacevich: Up until that time and only what you've been present for.

417
01:01:51,143 --> 01:02:08,213
Joanna Kovacevich: So it's not going to save any chat messages that took place before you join the meeting so basically everything you can see, at this point in time in this chat box is what gets saved when you do the manual save.

418
01:02:08,213 --> 01:02:14,723
Joanna Kovacevich: Now, as a host for me, it does an automatic save at the end of the meeting.

419
01:02:14,723 --> 01:02:25,973
Joanna Kovacevich: So that I make sure I capture everything.

420
01:02:25,973 --> 01:02:28,943
Joanna Kovacevich: So the screen share tool.

421
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:48,863
Joanna Kovacevich: Is what we commonly see us we either see discussing and talking with video or maybe using the screen share to put up some slides or we're working on a Google Doc or looking at a report of some sort, I want to show you just a couple of things.

422
01:02:48,863 --> 01:02:59,963
Joanna Kovacevich: When I click the screen share button and i'm going to bring my window over just wanted to a quick overview of some screen share basics.

423
01:02:59,963 --> 01:03:02,273
Joanna Kovacevich: When you're deciding.

424
01:03:02,273 --> 01:03:15,893
Joanna Kovacevich: Which so when you click the screen share button you get all these buttons of what to share and I have a lot here because I must have a lot of windows of program different programs open.

425
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:34,403
Joanna Kovacevich: So I would advise you to think about what am I sharing for this portion of the course Am I do, I only have one program I need to use is everything I need in my PowerPoint deck so that that's, the only thing I really need to share.

426
01:03:34,403 --> 01:03:42,593
Joanna Kovacevich: Or is everything I want to show I have lined up on my Google chrome tabs is everything online would that work.

427
01:03:42,593 --> 01:03:59,813
Joanna Kovacevich: Or do I need to switch between applications, I have a couple of PowerPoint slides, but then I need to jump over to an excel document and maybe show something in SAS, for instance, in that case, if you're switching between different programs.

428
01:03:59,813 --> 01:04:13,163
Joanna Kovacevich: it's going to save you time if you just choose the desktop function to share so we're going to see everything on your screen regardless if you change programs.

429
01:04:13,163 --> 01:04:17,273
Joanna Kovacevich: Which is what I have been showing for most of this.

430
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:23,933
Joanna Kovacevich: And you can see here, I have desktop one and desktop to I have a dual screen setup.

431
01:04:23,933 --> 01:04:40,283
Joanna Kovacevich: This is also where you could show a whiteboard if you want some brainstorming time or maybe you've got an icebreaker activity planned that a whiteboard works for that's where you can implement that.

432
01:04:40,283 --> 01:04:45,623
Joanna Kovacevich: And up at the top here you'll notice this basic tab.

433
01:04:45,623 --> 01:04:56,903
Joanna Kovacevich: But if I switch over to advanced, I have a really interesting feature, and it says it's in beta and that's slide is virtual backgrounds.

434
01:04:56,903 --> 01:05:06,743
Joanna Kovacevich: And in this case, what it's going to let me do is upload basically upload a PowerPoint file or a keynote.

435
01:05:06,743 --> 01:05:12,353
Joanna Kovacevich: file to use as my background, unfortunately this doesn't work with Google slides.

436
01:05:12,353 --> 01:05:19,973
Joanna Kovacevich: Because it has to be a file that saved on your computer, but I would love to demonstrate that for you all so i'm going to click on that.

437
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:30,833
Joanna Kovacevich: Now, if I had video in my presentation it wouldn't work here, but if I needed to screen share video file, maybe we're going to watch a YouTube clip.

438
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:37,463
Joanna Kovacevich: there's a little checkbox down here in the lower left corner that says share sound.

439
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:48,623
Joanna Kovacevich: If you have any video or audio clips i'd recommend checking that button, so that it broadcasts, the sound through the meeting really clearly.

440
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:54,113
Joanna Kovacevich: Mine doesn't have any sound so i'm going to skip that and i'm going to click share.

441
01:05:54,113 --> 01:05:56,993
Joanna Kovacevich: Then i'm going to locate.

442
01:05:56,993 --> 01:06:04,373
Joanna Kovacevich: Where I have my PowerPoint file again it has to be a file that saved on my computer.

443
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:08,003
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to open that.

444
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:13,733
Joanna Kovacevich: it's doing some things in the background it's opening up my PowerPoint slide.

445
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:19,463
Joanna Kovacevich: And now it's inserted it basically into the meeting.

446
01:06:19,463 --> 01:06:27,113
Joanna Kovacevich: And it's made my slides basically my virtual background.

447
01:06:27,113 --> 01:06:33,833
Joanna Kovacevich: Additionally, I have controllers here in the bottom Center of the screen.

448
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:41,123
Joanna Kovacevich: Where I can click through my slides.

449
01:06:41,123 --> 01:06:47,663
Joanna Kovacevich: So I kind of get to live in my slideshow to speak, so to speak.

450
01:06:47,663 --> 01:06:58,403
Joanna Kovacevich: But it doesn't one nice thing about this is having these controls, and I still have all of my meeting controls at the bottom of my screen instead of in that screen share floating toolbar.

451
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:08,453
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can still see all of your videos and these are all things that are a struggle when we're screen sharing.

452
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:20,243
Joanna Kovacevich: So one little nice feature to is that if I click on my video I can actually relocate myself to a different area of the slides.

453
01:07:20,243 --> 01:07:26,873
Joanna Kovacevich: Maybe all of my my slide format has a blank spot.

454
01:07:26,873 --> 01:07:35,423
Joanna Kovacevich: And then I can also resize myself this one, I like better I like less because i'm just cut off at the bottom.

455
01:07:35,423 --> 01:07:37,973
Joanna Kovacevich: But that's Okay, too.

456
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:45,023
Joanna Kovacevich: But this is a feature that if you haven't come across it or seen it might be interesting to experiment with.

457
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:50,303
Joanna Kovacevich: And this is one i'm guessing you are all seeing Is that correct.

458
01:07:50,303 --> 01:07:53,453
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm seeing head nods Thank you.

459
01:07:53,453 --> 01:08:10,433
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah so this doesn't didn't require that APP update everyone can kind of see it, and everyone can have the same experience, unlike what we encountered in the immersive view.

460
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:21,353
Joanna Kovacevich: So I will turn that off so that I can switch back to my full screen.

461
01:08:21,353 --> 01:08:28,133
Joanna Kovacevich: So that's sort of a neat something different.

462
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:35,963
Joanna Kovacevich: let's talk about polling.

463
01:08:35,963 --> 01:08:40,643
Joanna Kovacevich: So.

464
01:08:40,643 --> 01:08:46,163
Joanna Kovacevich: I probably could have left my slide up because I did have.

465
01:08:46,163 --> 01:09:00,143
Joanna Kovacevich: So there's a couple ways to do polling before I talk about the actual polling button you'll see in zoom I wanted to offer up there's also informal polls, maybe using the reactions.

466
01:09:00,143 --> 01:09:04,133
Joanna Kovacevich: And so here's just an example that i've put on a slide.

467
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:14,123
Joanna Kovacevich: This is one way you might do it and provide parameters of how you would like everyone to respond so just as a sample question, I was able to check and update my zoom APP.

468
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:25,763
Joanna Kovacevich: Go ahead and open your reactions on your zoom menu, and she was yes, the checkmark or X, no, I was not, and this could be anything, this could be.

469
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:36,143
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm able to see the screen share yes or no, or are you all hearing me Okay, yes or no, and so again, if you open your.

470
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:59,573
Joanna Kovacevich: Participants list you too can see the tally so it's a good quick check the nice thing about using yes or no, as opposed to the thumbs up that I used earlier, is that the top this top row of reactions, the clapping the thumbs up those disappear after just a few seconds.

471
01:09:59,573 --> 01:10:06,915
Joanna Kovacevich: And the yes or no actually stay in place unless you turn it off or I go in and clear all of the reactions.

472
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:20,687
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, so I will use my powers to clear all feedback, thank you for testing now with me.

473
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:34,127
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to back up for just a moment because, while we were talking about screen sharing I forgot to mention the annotate tools that you'll see as a host.

474
01:10:34,127 --> 01:10:40,427
Joanna Kovacevich: So, and I think is sometimes if somebody else's screen sharing you have fewer.

475
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:50,027
Joanna Kovacevich: annotation tools, but when you're the host you have several So this is the floating toolbar you see when you are screen sharing.

476
01:10:50,027 --> 01:11:07,757
Joanna Kovacevich: And you can click and move that this this little bar tends to get in the way so feel free to move it around as needed, and when I click the annotate it keeps popping my menus up, on the other, screen, so let me bring them over here.

477
01:11:07,757 --> 01:11:11,927
Joanna Kovacevich: I have this really long menu of annotation tools.

478
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:25,517
Joanna Kovacevich: from left to right, I have mouse, which I need to switch it back to you if i'm on any of the drawing tools i've got to re enable my mouse, to be able to click on things, instead of draw on them.

479
01:11:25,517 --> 01:11:43,067
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'll show you a couple that I like to use I like to use the options on this spotlight, and I haven't been using them during this presentation, but if I click the spotlight it basically turns my cursor into a laser pointer.

480
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:56,267
Joanna Kovacevich: And one thing I often like to do with this is follow, along with bullet points so show your webcam we're going to look at polling next.

481
01:11:56,267 --> 01:12:00,317
Joanna Kovacevich: There I have added zoom has added a new feature.

482
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:02,234
Joanna Kovacevich: called the vanishing pen which is really nice because I don't have to do that mouse switch.

483
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:19,159
Joanna Kovacevich: And I look at my format it's going to color in draw in blue, I can see that, and I can adjust the line thickness.

484
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:33,289
Joanna Kovacevich: What it's going to allow me to do is click and draw anywhere on my screen and then just going to disappear after a few seconds.

485
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:44,989
Joanna Kovacevich: So this might be good if you're you know, looking at charts and tables and excel you just want to highlight something for a second.

486
01:12:44,989 --> 01:12:58,309
Joanna Kovacevich: The arrow is available, the arrow was an option when someone else's screen sharing and I really like to use this when i'm working on demonstrations, because I can move my mouse and click.

487
01:12:58,309 --> 01:13:10,639
Joanna Kovacevich: anywhere on the screen and I typically use that to ask people you know to when i'm walking through something with somebody like all right, do you see the share button in the upper right corner.

488
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:21,259
Joanna Kovacevich: or let's go to the file menu and notice somebody just popped an arrow on there, because you can see the name on it, so it lets all of us.

489
01:13:21,259 --> 01:13:26,119
Joanna Kovacevich: click on there together.

490
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:29,209
Joanna Kovacevich: Although it seems to be fighting back and forth.

491
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:33,889
Joanna Kovacevich: it's possible.

492
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:44,059
Joanna Kovacevich: We one person can do it at a time trying to think, maybe with a whiteboard scenario, more than one person can do it.

493
01:13:44,059 --> 01:13:49,549
Joanna Kovacevich: But it's one way to bring attention.

494
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:54,229
Joanna Kovacevich: All right, i'm going to clear all that and stop the annotation.

495
01:13:54,229 --> 01:14:02,419
Joanna Kovacevich: So that now we can talk about pulling in one thing we like to do is kind of setup poll questions that can be.

496
01:14:02,419 --> 01:14:20,869
Joanna Kovacevich: pushed out to participants, and this is great because it's it's a it's an engaged Community engagement tool to all right i've been talking for a bit let's let's make sure everyone's following and everyone's with me or tell me these things about yourself.

497
01:14:20,869 --> 01:14:29,329
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, how we do that, we will initiate the poll using this polling button.

498
01:14:29,329 --> 01:14:34,909
Joanna Kovacevich: But we will create our polls in the zoom web portal.

499
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:42,079
Joanna Kovacevich: And that's umesh that zoom.us.

500
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:50,209
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'll go to my meetings menu item.

501
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:59,299
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can see all of my upcoming meetings and click on the title.

502
01:14:59,299 --> 01:15:03,679
Joanna Kovacevich: And if I scroll down to the bottom.

503
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:12,469
Joanna Kovacevich: I should have a tab that says pull.

504
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:18,199
Joanna Kovacevich: So I already have a poll that's ready to launch.

505
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:27,169
Joanna Kovacevich: But maybe I have one, I want to do at the end of class, just a quick little multiple choice knowledge check before we leave.

506
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:31,069
Joanna Kovacevich: I can use the create button.

507
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:38,479
Joanna Kovacevich: we'll do knowledge check.

508
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:49,309
Joanna Kovacevich: And I just clicked on the text to turn it into an editable text box.

509
01:15:49,309 --> 01:15:57,859
Joanna Kovacevich: In over on the right it's a single choice, meaning participants can only pick one of the answers.

510
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:15,109
Joanna Kovacevich: or they're using the term multiple choice to basically mean multiple answer I can check multiple responses.

511
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:19,279
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can add options.

512
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:26,629
Joanna Kovacevich: You can add up to 10 options.

513
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:42,529
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright hello, how I have this set right now, this would be a one question poll, but I could add a question, so that when I launch the poll participants are actually responding to two questions so that's an option.

514
01:16:42,529 --> 01:16:47,179
Joanna Kovacevich: it's also the ability to let people respond anonymously.

515
01:16:47,179 --> 01:17:07,939
Joanna Kovacevich: Now, when you're in the meeting all of the responses are basically anonymous your name is not attached to how you responded to the pole it's after the fact, as a meeting host I can view a report of how each individual by name responded to the polls.

516
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:10,789
Joanna Kovacevich: So it's more about.

517
01:17:10,789 --> 01:17:24,229
Joanna Kovacevich: Are you telling your students, this is an anonymous poll you won't be graded on it, and in fact I as the host will even see how you answered, whether or not you want to enable that.

518
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:26,839
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm going to click save.

519
01:17:26,839 --> 01:17:31,789
Joanna Kovacevich: And so now, you can see both of the polls that i've set up.

520
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:52,699
Joanna Kovacevich: The nice thing about using so the again going back to have recurring meetings, the polls that you set up are going to be available, every time you meet when you use the recurring meeting.

521
01:17:52,699 --> 01:17:55,939
Joanna Kovacevich: So let's try a poll.

522
01:17:55,939 --> 01:18:01,489
Joanna Kovacevich: let's try the one i've set up.

523
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:05,869
Joanna Kovacevich: So we're going to do polling.

524
01:18:05,869 --> 01:18:14,269
Joanna Kovacevich: And right now, your screen seeing my screen so you're going to see the backstage area, as well as.

525
01:18:14,269 --> 01:18:18,319
Joanna Kovacevich: Your personal poll response window.

526
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:40,129
Joanna Kovacevich: Now, because I have more than one poll, I actually have a drop down carrot that lets me pick which poll, I want to post so i'll do this one and I get a preview of what the question is and i'll collect launch poll.

527
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:47,419
Joanna Kovacevich: So each of you should have a poll window that has popped up on your screen.

528
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:59,839
Joanna Kovacevich: And you also get a preview of what's happening for me as host behind the scenes, I can see the responses that are coming in.

529
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:13,309
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can see, this has been open for 25 seconds five of five people have voted so there's no reason to keep it open everyone's responded so I have the option to end the poll.

530
01:19:13,309 --> 01:19:19,309
Joanna Kovacevich: Now for me as host I get a preview of those results.

531
01:19:19,309 --> 01:19:24,709
Joanna Kovacevich: And I could share them with you, which i'll go ahead and do.

532
01:19:24,709 --> 01:19:32,449
Joanna Kovacevich: so that everyone can see the results.

533
01:19:32,449 --> 01:19:39,649
Joanna Kovacevich: And then I can stop sharing to basically remove that from your screen.

534
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:59,779
Joanna Kovacevich: If I were using reusing this poll in different class meetings, maybe it's a general question that I could use over and over again, I have a relaunch button, which will be basically clear out all the previous results, and let me launch launch it as a fresh poll.

535
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:07,849
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, as I mentioned, I could download a report of who gave what answers in the poll if that's important.

536
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:15,769
Joanna Kovacevich: And then I have just a little X up here to close the poll to all.

537
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:29,989
Joanna Kovacevich: Any questions about that and using polls.

538
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:39,709
Joanna Kovacevich: We are nearly at time and my apologies, so i'm going to blaze through breakout rooms real quick.

539
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:43,069
Joanna Kovacevich: i'll briefly touch on this live transcript.

540
01:20:43,069 --> 01:20:47,659
Joanna Kovacevich: Because, as I mentioned it's in the host only menu.

541
01:20:47,659 --> 01:20:53,359
Joanna Kovacevich: And this live transcript this button before said enable.

542
01:20:53,359 --> 01:21:00,109
Joanna Kovacevich: Which is what made that live transcript button up here on each of your screens.

543
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:09,319
Joanna Kovacevich: And click on the breakout rooms button, which is now available to co hosts in addition to host which is fantastic.

544
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:21,259
Joanna Kovacevich: Meaning your Th your media systems can now assist you in creating breakout rooms, the first thing you're deciding is how you want your breakout rooms created.

545
01:21:21,259 --> 01:21:36,769
Joanna Kovacevich: Do you want everyone randomly pushed randomly assigned it doesn't matter let zoom pick who goes in what group or assigned manually I specifically need these groups of people to work together.

546
01:21:36,769 --> 01:21:52,699
Joanna Kovacevich: A newer feature, and this did require an application update in order to use is let participants choose their room, so this would be a case where I maybe I create three breakout rooms.

547
01:21:52,699 --> 01:22:09,649
Joanna Kovacevich: And when the setting is a sign automatically in the lower left corner, it gives me an estimate of how many people are going to be in each room, which is helpful to help me determine how many breakout rooms, I need.

548
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:17,329
Joanna Kovacevich: But let's say i'm going to create three breakout rooms and i'll let participants choose.

549
01:22:17,329 --> 01:22:34,999
Joanna Kovacevich: And what they could do when I hit that create button is, I still have my staging area to set up my breakout rooms, I can rename the rooms and I can delete the rooms and it always gives me ability to assign people into that room if i'd like.

550
01:22:34,999 --> 01:22:43,579
Joanna Kovacevich: But if students were choosing their own room I might consider renaming these with the actual discussion topic.

551
01:22:43,579 --> 01:22:59,719
Joanna Kovacevich: Alternatively, what I could do is create a slide in advance that says Room one is this topic room to is this topic and I could be screen sharing that slide when I open all the rooms.

552
01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:05,179
Joanna Kovacevich: And I just accidentally added I can add a new room here.

553
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:18,799
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, when I hit open all rooms in this case and i'll go ahead and test it with this when I hit open all rooms each of you will be given a breakout rooms button on your.

554
01:23:18,799 --> 01:23:21,259
Joanna Kovacevich: screen control panel.

555
01:23:21,259 --> 01:23:31,429
Joanna Kovacevich: so that you can see the available rooms see who's in those rooms and join it so just a note that if you are using the browser.

556
01:23:31,429 --> 01:23:52,189
Joanna Kovacevich: Anyone using the browser would not have the ability to do that so you'll want to set up a backup of use the chat or unmute your microphone and let us know if you don't see the ability to join a breakout room, so that the media assistant can do that.

557
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:55,519
Joanna Kovacevich: When I open all rooms.

558
01:23:55,519 --> 01:23:59,419
Joanna Kovacevich: You should now see a breakout room menu.

559
01:23:59,419 --> 01:24:09,289
Joanna Kovacevich: And you should see a window that's similar to mine on screen to actually join the room, and this is something you may need to direct your students.

560
01:24:09,289 --> 01:24:15,019
Joanna Kovacevich: on how to do this is next to each room title is a number.

561
01:24:15,019 --> 01:24:22,369
Joanna Kovacevich: And you have to hover your mouse over the number in order for it to.

562
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:28,909
Joanna Kovacevich: Say join and that's how you would join the meeting.

563
01:24:28,909 --> 01:24:33,169
Joanna Kovacevich: When my breakout rooms are open.

564
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:45,199
Joanna Kovacevich: As the host or co host I can type A broadcast message that gets posted at the top of all of the breakout rooms so that's how you will communicate.

565
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,619
Joanna Kovacevich: With your team.

566
01:24:48,619 --> 01:24:51,619
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to go ahead and close those.

567
01:24:51,619 --> 01:25:04,459
Joanna Kovacevich: and say, I have a second portion where I need breakout rooms, but I need a different type of breakout room I could then switch those initial settings to be automatically.

568
01:25:04,459 --> 01:25:06,559
Joanna Kovacevich: or manually.

569
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:19,849
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm going to just recreate to manually, and this is where zoom just scattered you and notice that you're all still in the main room because again i'm just still working in my staging area.

570
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:29,059
Joanna Kovacevich: I would have to open all rooms for you to actually sort of begin the process of joining your breakout rooms.

571
01:25:29,059 --> 01:25:36,439
Joanna Kovacevich: But, again, I have the ability to rename these rooms, if I wanted to delete the room.

572
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:53,359
Joanna Kovacevich: When these rooms are open you as the host, if you like, to join the breakout rooms, to see how everyone's doing again, you would hover over this number of people, right now, it says, a sign, but when the rooms are open, it will see join.

573
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:58,249
Joanna Kovacevich: And that's how you move between the rooms.

574
01:25:58,249 --> 01:26:04,729
Joanna Kovacevich: And I can modify what zoom has sort of assigned.

575
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:11,899
Joanna Kovacevich: Or maybe I can trade.

576
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:23,149
Joanna Kovacevich: And then down here in the lower left is a settings gear icon you might look through some of these settings to see if they're useful to you.

577
01:26:23,149 --> 01:26:29,989
Joanna Kovacevich: So that's breakout rooms fast and furious so we didn't get to spend much time there.

578
01:26:29,989 --> 01:26:46,819
Joanna Kovacevich: What questions you have, as we are winding down.

579
01:26:46,819 --> 01:26:56,929
Joanna Kovacevich: I will be sending out some recording some additional materials there'll be a contact email address to our SP ah instruction team.

580
01:26:56,929 --> 01:27:02,509
Joanna Kovacevich: so that you can get assistance and media assistance available on.

581
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:13,609
Joanna Kovacevich: Google chat if, in the moment you need assistance during a live zoom meeting and then our team also assist with canvas.

582
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:18,619
Joanna Kovacevich: If there's any canvas questions you need help with.

583
01:27:18,619 --> 01:27:24,589
Joanna Kovacevich: So, again I want to thank you all for coming, and I hope you all have a great class.

584
01:27:24,589 --> 01:27:28,909
Over the coming weeks.

585
01:27:28,909 --> 01:27:30,169
Chris Andrews: Thank you, I was great.

586
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:32,569
Onyebuchi Arah: Thank you, that was great.

587
01:27:32,569 --> 01:27:34,489
Joanna Kovacevich: Excellent Thank you.

588
01:27:34,489 --> 01:27:38,119
Brittney van der Woude: Thank you.

589
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:38,669
All right.
