1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:13,490
I don't know what happened three months ago. How do you not see eye to eye with your son?

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:21,990
We're just having a lot happened.

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:30,860
So you see what he meant by that?

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:40,060
Okay, I want to get into world.

5
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:59,210
I like that. Can you just talk about what's going on here?

6
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:16,770
We want our public defender as opposed to, you know, earlier she said she's definitely here.

7
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:38,370
Yeah. And, you know, it's like, I can't you know, that's not going to happen.

8
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,070
It's just like, that's right.

9
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,810
So I'm gonna bring the up here.

10
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,830
And it's not that I like to pretend it's not like your name.

11
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:13,670
Meaning to qualify as you just heard.

12
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:39,720
Yeah. I mean, he's saying, look, I know, I know, I know, I know.

13
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,630
You know what? I'm do whatever you call her.

14
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,959
She's like, I'm sorry. What?

15
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,880
He's starting to sound like eating breakfast.

16
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm relieved. So I guess that's the way he sees if he was going to get the perfect guy thing here.

17
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,370
Because it's not like people are saying what the original.

18
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:48,990
It's interesting. I mean, do those people you know, it's like when you're trying to she's like, oh, you know, you heard.

19
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:59,220
No, no. I just want Reuters tells me that.

20
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:19,350
Oh, yeah. You know, I guess I need to be somebody who makes me anxious.

21
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,670
Like, I think one thing.

22
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,850
No, no, no. Let me just say, I feel like I can read that.

23
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,990
So every second we get closer.

24
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,100
Are you doing it now? Oh, no.

25
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,839
I have to stay committed. Right. Listen to me.

26
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:07,520
To just about all of. And according to my research, a good part of the work that's been done.

27
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:20,480
So that's great. That's when you bring it up, you know.

28
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:31,030
Now I'll show you that it's not the case for everyone.

29
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

30
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,720
I remember that case and it happened in 2017 in Massachusetts.

31
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:59,570
Just the banks are going to show up at that place, you know, and everybody has a movie and go, those of you who know me and I think, you know, I have.

32
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,780
Ten for ten witnesses for brownies.

33
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:24,419
And then I have brownies. You know, they're so proof's still in there, so I will send you an email right after class.

34
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,760
So with then and then I'll put it in my office.

35
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,530
Then they have office hours to just come pick your room.

36
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:45,320
Sounds like a plan. Now, I will give you periodically over quizzes, and they are going to be increasingly more physical.

37
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,010
So. So you can practice. This is.

38
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,000
This wasn't bad. It wasn't bad.

39
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,150
But we did well, it was another next one.

40
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,610
So I don't think we got.

41
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:15,940
So your sense made sure that you remember, you know, you know how many populations this is as much as I doubt that we're going to get off my thing.

42
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,070
So but now what we have to do is solve homework, number one.

43
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,839
And everything we need to do is download.

44
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:42,950
The data set is called a small business and I am going to also open did file the pdf file with the little problem.

45
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:57,920
In. You need a lot more than I did.

46
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,920
And the wrong me is 11.4, five, six and eight.

47
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,470
And then this. Let's do that now. You probably can do this in your sleep.

48
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:20,210
But we're going to do this together. And the first one is watching them perform, preparing line graph of these data.

49
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,720
Do the data appear to be a stationary or normalization?

50
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:37,660
So I am of the first thing I'm going to do is how do I know if the data is stationary and not right?

51
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:47,450
So I have the data here. So I'm going to make a copy of the data and then I'm going to call that have program.

52
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:04,340
11.4, then I'm going to need to use highlight.

53
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:13,970
I will actually select the data set so as control kicked down arrow and do the right

54
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:25,969
thing and then this is waiting to insert and I want to use note the note the line graph,

55
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:37,090
not this line, but the problem with the line graph in Excel is that we don't have a the x axis is not up to a scale is not scale.

56
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,510
And so there is use ordinal. This feels like one, two, three, four.

57
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:52,159
So if I have a 5.5 in the axis is not going to upload that and we can only get a 5.5 in the x axis.

58
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:04,640
So I will go in to is going to plot this one, then I can select the with a three lines.

59
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,300
So I have my data here.

60
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,540
Right. So that's my sense. So it does appear to be a stationary or not.

61
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,270
No, no, no. That's not a station that he has clearly has trained.

62
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:31,060
Right. And, you know, he said that.

63
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:38,630
And if we go into the concert and the bed bugs and you.

64
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,330
Are we your lungs or something like the.

65
00:10:45,550 --> 00:11:00,650
I'm serious. This word thing is not in.

66
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,100
If you want to make it bigger so everybody can.

67
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:23,860
That's really good and in little red.

68
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,510
And then I can see your eyes. So that's question number one, 11.4.

69
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,780
We're making good time. All right.

70
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,390
So let's get to question number two.

71
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:52,290
And what's your number two is? But this is fight, right?

72
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,640
Question five is compute the two period and four period moving average predictions for the data set.

73
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,880
A line graph comparing the moving average predictions and then the data.

74
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:13,950
And then do the moving average tend to overestimate or underestimate the actual data on Y and

75
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,809
then compute forecasts for the next two years using the two periods and for the moving averages,

76
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:26,280
then click. Okay, so we are going to have A, B and C.

77
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:36,840
So I'm making the very line graph and then for that and then I'm going to answer those that it was right.

78
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:51,990
So it said two period and therefore the really know because in the end what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy the data in the.

79
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:04,010
And then I'm going to get money to rebuild the building again.

80
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:16,750
I made 4,000,000,000 million mortgages. And then I'm going to.

81
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,790
So what? This is simple movie narratives, right?

82
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,690
Yeah. You zooming in a little bit. So.

83
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,690
Thank you. Okay. Right.

84
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,890
So. So first thing is, this is a non stationary time series.

85
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,030
Should I be using moving averages to forecast these times.

86
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,250
To. No.

87
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:58,350
Right. We shouldn't, because what we now bring is is a need for stationary intentions.

88
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,040
So what we're going to do here is demonstrate.

89
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:10,980
You know, why is it that you to forecast a non stationary time series with moving averages.

90
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:21,210
And so remember, if we the first thing we do is look at the Time series and decide whether it's stationary or not.

91
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:28,680
If it is stationary, that mean if it is flat on average, you can see it goes on trend.

92
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:36,660
Then we use either weighted moving averages or exponential smoothing right there.

93
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:44,910
This simple moving average like we are using now is a special case of the weighted moving average where all the waves are using.

94
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,200
So we use that law to forecast when we have a calculator.

95
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:58,740
I don't have Soledad to optimize weights, but if we have something to optimize that way, we don't need to know a simple moving average.

96
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,460
We just increase the weight.

97
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,630
Right. So but we are just following practicing what we learn.

98
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:19,850
And the first thing I'm going to do with these time series is create them to be moving average will in effect fake forecast.

99
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:27,180
So the first period for which I can produce it focuses on number three.

100
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,560
Right. Okay. So I have PDR, number one observation of opinion, number two observations.

101
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:42,720
And I'm going to use the average of these two observations to forecast P three and then I'm going to compare the video,

102
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,190
my forecast sales, and then I will get an error.

103
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:58,350
And then I am going to use the E to in order to look at the before and after and so on, so forth.

104
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:04,979
So I'm going to do two things. I'm going to forecast with a two year moving average,

105
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:11,670
but I'm also going to figure out how well the two period and therefore period moving average are doing.

106
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,090
I am going to compute later on. That means wherever.

107
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,130
Okay, so now let's do this. This is going to be the average.

108
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:28,350
We do all caps. I love.

109
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,180
These two observation one and two year one two.

110
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,990
And then I am going to.

111
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:56,060
Drank that formula. And how about if I don't I don't have a decimals in my observation, so let me get rid of the decimals in the observation.

112
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,450
I want to write Klingon for them. That needs to be known verse.

113
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,040
We know this involves and we're going to do this out set.

114
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,960
I even know that I got. And the alignment is going to be sent to.

115
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,340
All right, so now I have my two period movie.

116
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,919
Now I'm going to repeat the whole thing with the 4 p.m. moving average.

117
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,860
So that first observation, the first period for which I can focus, is be a number.

118
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,270
Hi. Hi. So I have PDA.

119
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:42,230
Number five is here. So I'm going to use the average of the first four observations to forecast you.

120
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:54,520
Right. So this is equal to the average. One, two, three and fourth.

121
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:07,270
Right. And then I'm going to call the format that I have in the video and I'm going to drive this formula.

122
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,350
And I have my four P in the movie now. Okay.

123
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,060
So I'm going to plot that.

124
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,830
So so I have my four P and two period moving averages for people in average.

125
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:40,330
So that's done right. And then this is programing 11.5, right?

126
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,870
And then what else are we supposed to do here?

127
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,340
So the eight represent graph comparing the moving average predictions of game theory data.

128
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:58,270
Okay, let's let me let me go create the graph.

129
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,490
And in this case, I can just select the whole thing from here.

130
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,080
Throw him an arrow to the right.

131
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:18,520
Right. And then I am going to go to insert and then I'm going to take my blood.

132
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:28,210
And then I'm going into the sky with straight lines and the set.

133
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:37,120
Right. So I. So I don't see.

134
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:51,740
Certain notes in those are observations.

135
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,810
To think we now reaching for video in show whatever you want that that lake into the east.

136
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:11,320
And if you want to see a little bit more definition let's go and change the scale to start at 200.

137
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,980
More information on the turning point now.

138
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:31,130
What do you think? Which one do you think is a better forecast than 2 million will be an average of 44 billion inches.

139
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:40,850
Look, look, look at that graph. So you just close to 2 million moving out of the right?

140
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,630
Yeah, it's closer than that to the to the original data.

141
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,879
And so any idea why that would be?

142
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,520
A moving average is better than the 4 billion. In this case, although both of them are are right.

143
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,230
Is so low is always.

144
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,100
Both of them are always underestimating the data.

145
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:10,010
So you forecast on your own. They are always below what the data is going to be.

146
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,680
So right now, you know, you see this observation.

147
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:25,430
Okay. And then with this observation, then you produce these forecasts and then you get these these real observations.

148
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:32,120
And then you produce these for some something. You get these observations and then you produce the forecast and you get these observations.

149
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:44,660
You see that you're always underestimating the data and and one station because.

150
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:52,520
Right. We are taking averages there for, you know, more or two or four more recent observations.

151
00:21:53,290 --> 00:22:02,090
And when you have it and going of the average of the previous information is always below date, what's going to be the what is coming in the future?

152
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:14,629
And because you are loading up so the average of 1 to 3 and four, they have to be lower than five, which is where your trend is going to be.

153
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:26,960
So you are always trying to catch up and. So the issue that we are thinking an average is either either weighted average or or seems a lot reduced

154
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:35,450
mean that we cannot be we can not forecast higher than the than the largest of the observation.

155
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:45,170
Right. And because we have a trend we will be able to catch up and with the observation that's why they're

156
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:53,060
moving averages are not it is not a good technique to forecast station a non station any time soon.

157
00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:03,379
The same thing is going to do it is going to happen if you have a declining or decreasing time series that if you take moving averages,

158
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,000
you are always going to be above, you know, the time series.

159
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,290
You're going to be overestimating, you know, over forecasting all the time.

160
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,320
So in this case, the question is.

161
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:37,570
A and B is do the moving averages tend to overestimate or underestimate the actual data?

162
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:54,010
Why? What do you think? Because they tend to underestimate the news so we can get things turned and textbook.

163
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:17,660
The forecast. You understand the.

164
00:24:37,090 --> 00:25:04,480
I'm sure he's thinking you should wait for me in the observations.

165
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:22,900
Oh. We almost. The water will move.

166
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:42,000
You either use. And.

167
00:25:46,960 --> 00:26:04,060
In theory we are all of this thing and I can say so you can make it a little bit more.

168
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,990
I'm eloquent when you want that, but, you know, that's that's what I'm looking for.

169
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,750
So we have to figure out a different for, you know,

170
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,980
who you want to make sure that you understand that there to be a moving average who's better than the 4 billion average.

171
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,150
And the reason in this case is this,

172
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:38,149
that the 4 billion moving average is is carrying the weight of two more

173
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,820
observations into the past that are farther and farther away from the upward trend.

174
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,400
So he's driving down the forecast. Right.

175
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:55,730
And so the median moving averages is closer to where the trend is going to be because they are closer to who they are and to the price of.

176
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:04,879
So those two observations are even though they are no, they're not going to be predicting what's going to happen in the future.

177
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,160
They are going to be closer right than they did before than the average of the

178
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:16,670
portfolio moving average that is actually dragging down the the the forecast.

179
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:25,909
So what you can even though is not we were not asked to move this we can compute

180
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:31,760
them as useful route measure and figure out what they may see for a 14 years.

181
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:43,910
And at least if we're building a moving average and it is going to work at the very end they see.

182
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,100
I'm going to. You may see.

183
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:11,340
For people in the street. The NSC yielded nothing to reverse the movement.

184
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,230
To. The aim is to.

185
00:28:24,490 --> 00:29:05,310
It's. And then compared to some of these some of the White Square, I think this is I think I am going to do these sales from 3.8.

186
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:17,490
James Comma. When you compare that to the sales in your property, that work has to be to pick 20.

187
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:32,860
And then I'm going to divide that by the count of the number of submissions for reaching out to write an account of these interviews.

188
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,780
And then I have a 27.5.

189
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,250
I wonder, does it mean and we don't know, we get one platform pairs with them for people with that.

190
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:56,040
So, you know, by itself is not when I tell you to like you said, the MSE is 800 or MSE is 2000.

191
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:02,160
The immediate the aim is see depends on the level of the series.

192
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,300
So if you are dealing with a B number, then this is going to be pretty big.

193
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:13,420
That doesn't mean that it's bad or loosely depends on the level of information in the series.

194
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:27,020
What what is important is when you compare one in one mental with another mental, they may see that in smaller business, that's the one that use it.

195
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:40,210
So we have 827 and we are able to use this knowledge right to it makes me feel that we have right we know exactly what we're doing.

196
00:30:44,620 --> 00:31:02,200
So 828 let's let's go for a four period movie now which then this is equal to the sum of X minus Y is equal to your open parenthesis.

197
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:08,290
And then I'm going to compare the sales with the quantity of moving average.

198
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:20,350
That's from field five. So like I said, length observation profiles of winning in a think on the three groups.

199
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:32,520
He's going 5 to 20 and then the whole month.

200
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:42,370
And then it was all from the forecast from Benue State to be at 24.

201
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,570
This is I mean, I, I by the count.

202
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:59,320
Of the observation. But we do have go to the.

203
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:15,940
And then and when you have, you know, 1258 so and so each one has been paid to do video.

204
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:23,660
We now train and so we have the MSE for the 4 million moving average use.

205
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:34,380
1259 So the average of the square ed is this is 1259 and the average of the square ed for it to be the moving average is 828.

206
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:40,680
So smaller is is said to be a moving average which is closer to the observation.

207
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,530
So they produces less of fewer, you know, and 90.

208
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:53,309
Right. So it's closer to nothing. Yeah, we didn't have to do that.

209
00:32:53,310 --> 00:33:04,080
But it's a good measure just to know, just to look at the graph, but also analytically, you not prove that your intuition is correct.

210
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:24,260
Okay. So. So now let's see what is what we need to do.

211
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,390
We need to produce forecast, right? We need to produce a forecast for.

212
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,120
We need to preserve cash for the next two years using the 240 billion moving average.

213
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:48,640
So let's do let's do what we are going to be one, B, one and two.

214
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,030
Right. Those are the 2/1 grade of gas that we're going to produce.

215
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:03,840
The other, we're faith forecasters to see how the Time series, how the daily momentum will perform with that and series.

216
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,780
Right now, I'm just simply going to where to begin moving average.

217
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,980
I'm going to drive this Formula One. I think you'll see it.

218
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:24,440
I think I'm going to. I think the average you'll be looking what I'm going to do.

219
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,470
So these 530 that that.

220
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:37,350
B 21 on B 22. So slides that you can add 515 to the average of these two numbers.

221
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:45,480
Now, what happens with the next forecast, how they produce the next forecast for video 22?

222
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:53,980
I would need to take the average of these to observation, but I don't have any observations here.

223
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,170
So instead of this observation one way you. Right.

224
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:12,370
So this is going to be up to the average. I think the two of them.

225
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:22,320
It's an issue that the workers that I have been working at 21, which is in the C 23 indenture.

226
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:31,899
I mean, they have it by 47. And even though you make you read.

227
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:40,110
So we understand that this is a forecast for the four period moving average.

228
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,750
I'm going to do the same. The first one is going to be simply the average of these poor believers.

229
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,840
So I just need to track this for me now. So I got 534.

230
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,180
The next one will be the average of these four numbers.

231
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,420
But I don't have any any longer here. Right?

232
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,350
I don't have any number, any observation in opinion 21.

233
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:14,440
So I'm going to take the average Joe 528 five 3 to 552 and 534, the average of these four.

234
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,440
So when I use the work assets and the real automation in period,

235
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:38,350
when you want something to do average all three parentheses is for three and then put a comma and then finally go to the 23,

236
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:46,719
which is when I have the four guys working in one parentheses and that's 536.

237
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:54,020
That's going to be my forecast and. I want to replicate the format.

238
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,830
So we have these signs that if we're on fire, 30 seats are there for gas.

239
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:13,760
If I work to produce for 44 periods for people with average and they're 542 and I'm 547.

240
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,720
If I were to forecast, we're going to be moving up.

241
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:27,690
And so if we if we were to forecast, we, you know, then to work it forward, we will use that to write.

242
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:34,490
Those are probably not what you think needs are not appropriate for a stationary time.

243
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:40,080
But if you have to pause not to use one, you use that two people.

244
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:49,220
We're not the best. If you are using moving averages, what would be the best forecast if you have to use moving averages?

245
00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:00,950
If you say, okay, no, you cannot use anything else but moving and you have to take the,

246
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:07,309
you know, the average of whatever number of observations in the past to predict the future.

247
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,740
So how many would you use to workshops if you could? You have a growing trend.

248
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,300
Two two, period. Come on.

249
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,350
Is that a moving average? Yeah, well, the average of one is that average, right?

250
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,239
To give yourself the best word, guys.

251
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,820
In this case, it would be whatever you see. Now, that's what you have the ideal.

252
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:40,950
You hope to have two more. Right. And and that's a lot of organizations, believe me, use that.

253
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:50,430
And so they are no doubt, you know, very keen are using forecasting techniques and the best forecasting they have or whatever we produce,

254
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,370
whatever the amount we have this year,

255
00:38:53,370 --> 00:39:01,230
we are going to have one year for next year and then they will correct that next year and then they say whatever we have this year going to make,

256
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,600
you know. They, you know, about 50% of the organization, not all better.

257
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:16,530
They are using more sophisticated techniques like the ones that we are going to practice here.

258
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,560
But that has been common practice. So.

259
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,500
All right. Okay.

260
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,900
So you know how the problem goes.

261
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,440
Right. Let's let's blog that blog as an extra point.

262
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:42,450
So we have 21 committing to these two one and four moving averages.

263
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,799
So I am going to select all of these numbers.

264
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,910
And then I was hoping who's going to be my.

265
00:39:54,110 --> 00:40:02,719
I'd rather then activate the graph and I wanted to be special and then I have.

266
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,350
Okay, these are new points. Yes, non-U.S.

267
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:13,660
And I'm going to put new points in the in the forecast and the forecast.

268
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:19,940
And the points are in columns. Yes. And then the categories are in the first column.

269
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,710
Yes. We don't have any names in the first row because they're just numbers right now.

270
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:32,540
So I have those are my programs. And so those so I just pasted those two numbers.

271
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:38,370
Those are two external activities and then you see how they work out.

272
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:55,550
I look like I'm very likely that times is going to be here when one of these is under forecasting in these wars under forecast.

273
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:10,460
I want to know where that happens. So we have, you know, the problem element y things such as anything.

274
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,880
So we have 11.4 but push things.

275
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:33,210
11.6 use solver to determine the weights for a three weighted moving average that minimizes the MSE for the data set.

276
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:42,810
What are the optimum values for the weights? Prepare a line graph here a weighted moving average predictions against the original data.

277
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,550
And what are the forecasts for the next years using this technique?

278
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:54,150
All right. Let me ask you this. Without doing all this analysis, what are going to be the weightings?

279
00:41:54,390 --> 00:42:07,070
The only one going to the level three? Whether you think the best waves are equal to the last one, the last one is going to be one week.

280
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:16,310
So we have w one is the weight assigned to the most recent observation that nobody took one observation in the past 32 observation in the past.

281
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,410
And you were saying that w y is equal to.

282
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,350
Yeah, but what's the value of w11.

283
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:31,580
Exactly, exactly. So it's going to happen that everyone is going to be one on the way into one of these.

284
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:39,390
They are going to be zero. Right. Because you want to give the most weight to the most recent observation because you want to calculate the trend.

285
00:42:39,840 --> 00:43:00,790
Well, let's see if that true. This is like a thriller that you know what's going to happen to me, and then I have to go.

286
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,680
Oh. And in.

287
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,290
This is his problem.

288
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:42,820
11.6. So I wanted to give you 5 minutes to do this by yourself.

289
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:49,430
So if you find that there's something that is not working and come see me in my office hours.

290
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:58,660
For 5 minutes and then we'll do it again. They just want to make sure that you know how.

291
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,450
Just remember, as simple as this sounds, people value money.

292
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:52,410
You lose. You.

293
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:26,620
Percent. I'm going to give you two women.

294
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:49,270
This seems.

295
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:23,680
Background. These beautiful trinkets.

296
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:39,160
Just like. Okay.

297
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:47,380
So if we're doing waited long enough, everything I need is wait.

298
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,210
So I'm going to create that. Wait over here.

299
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,819
I'm going to go hold these.

300
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:04,900
W two is the wait time assigned to the one video before and rolling one is the weight that they assigned to the most recent observation.

301
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:14,220
I know that this some of these numbers the numbers must be aligned so and then we do PS

302
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:23,920
So we think that numbers mean only 1.5 is only 2.5 whatever number instead of three,

303
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,380
not three. So it's just.

304
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:41,230
You to tell you three.

305
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:51,420
Is equal to 2.35.

306
00:48:51,780 --> 00:49:04,990
Okay. So there's some we have be me that I remember the one used for me to check that that formula is always going to do one, two, three.

307
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:12,400
So some three, three. There is one.

308
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:26,720
And then we are going to conclude a messy. And made me go into the 3 billion weighted moving average.

309
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:47,090
We did movie reviews and this is going to start with observation for everybody and this is going to be this some product.

310
00:49:51,850 --> 00:50:04,120
The weight and the weight have to be throughout weight responsible for the weight and multiply that times the three for the first three observations.

311
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:15,450
So I had my 1st of August. I'm going to copy this format so you have the same format as in the observations.

312
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:21,320
And then there are things for me to tell you.

313
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,940
In the format that I wanted to.

314
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:55,390
You see, if I if I apply the same thing to this mosque here in four months, these these numbers as I go through the proposal.

315
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,170
So they may see three.

316
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:15,970
There's some. It's minus y squared and then open parentheses and highlight the first column and highlight the second one.

317
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:33,290
Those parentheses divided by the count of the number of contributions they have in their field.

318
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,410
And you have a 65 as my name is seen.

319
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:48,970
And what I want to do now is minimize the misdeed and change the way I show linguistic data.

320
00:51:50,320 --> 00:52:08,960
So I want to minimize the tendency at length to be one, two and three subject to the in some of the ways.

321
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:16,970
Suppose 1 to 2 times as that sorry is on the way.

322
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:31,489
Thank you. Some of the reads see for the one and I think so I agree with your comment that I don't need

323
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:39,889
any more constraints because they've been the three constraints that they have to be greater

324
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:44,480
than or equal to zero is going to be zero less than or equal to one is going to be automatically

325
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,750
satisfied because they have that they saw me go to one and then they have to to that.

326
00:52:49,950 --> 00:53:00,680
So let's get the lesson and then I want to clean the cylinder and then I have to zero zero on what you are right now.

327
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,950
You are starting an area that's pretty good.

328
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:16,549
So so we have zero zero and one that means that the the most recent observations what do you need in order to predict the future?

329
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:20,960
So we looked 21 and 22.

330
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,339
The forecast is going to be by 52 and then the same one.

331
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:38,210
By the way, the most recent observation, what happened is that in this case is going to be integer 22 is going to be two zero

332
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:46,679
times 532009 553 one times these observations we didn't have these observations,

333
00:53:46,680 --> 00:54:08,600
these activities is simply equal to zero and we're just going to have recycling for the week in order for different reasons.

334
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:17,690
That's that's my advice. My because my forecast within three weeks away, we now return this time because we want to plot it.

335
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:30,350
And now the whole thing in the third going in to go to yourself.

336
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,440
And somehow to equal one.

337
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:52,620
Yeah. Let's say you want to change the laws.

338
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:15,490
You make the movie every. That's just so not a great forecast but you know, that I wouldn't do is simply whatever I see today.

339
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:22,480
That's what I forecast that's going to happen tomorrow. And if I want to forecast in the future, I just repeat the last one.

340
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:30,730
I just think, could you hover over the first weighted average here and immediately.

341
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,210
Oh, no, like the. 336 336 okay.

342
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:51,830
So is is, is that some of these weights and the three observation is good.

343
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,950
Look at those three. I know.

344
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:07,920
We thought you had a quick question. Could you repeat how we got the 22nd?

345
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:13,650
Yes. So so these 550 to the 21st.

346
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:19,590
Right. Is the weight and, you know, applied to this observation.

347
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:26,410
So it's going to be zero times five, 28, zero and five three, two plus one time size using two.

348
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,150
And that's why you can try to do the second one.

349
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:38,100
The 552 will be zero times 453205 plus one.

350
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,230
These observations and I don't have that observations or I use these for passive.

351
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:54,090
So there's one thing that you can do just that you in this case because I can't even forecast the base forecast

352
00:56:54,090 --> 00:57:02,910
cases whatever you see this build with that forecast for the next period is you always just repeat the last one.

353
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:11,340
Okay. Here. What?

354
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,820
Yeah. I miss you too. Anything. You.

355
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:32,110
And anything you say gives me hope for.

356
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:46,990
Kings. Yeah.

357
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:55,480
Because you go over how to change the weights to series or something and you know, that's how you change the weights to 001.

358
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,120
Oh yeah. So how I change the weight I use optimizer.

359
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,680
Right. So I use solar.

360
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:23,070
So what I did was I go to the apps and then over and then I minimize the MSE by changing the weights subject to some of their weight.

361
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:26,370
Which is this this formula here? I'm sorry.

362
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,310
These formula here has to be equal.

363
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:43,920
I usually add another constraint which is redundant, which is okay, and the wings have to be less than or equal to one in the end.

364
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:57,030
So change those things as far as what you're eating in the as pointed out as a result.

365
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:11,190
Because if I have that because some of the wage is equal to one and they have to be greater than what is.

366
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:20,080
You're on the C. I just used that for completeness.

367
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:30,140
There's definitely. Okay.

368
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:53,090
So this is this is so you have an idea of how I would like to work and then we're going to, you know, do your homework.

369
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:56,649
We're going to work with you in class.

370
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:06,740
And then you have to look your your workforce in groups or individually to someone by yourself.

371
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:10,960
But it's going to be always something that will be of some help.

372
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:22,239
So we're going to use that timing class to make sure that you are patterns because there's something that you get from to us,

373
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:32,680
like a little bit more important for the student and you have a more practical knowledge or skills for that.

374
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:38,560
Now, last question.

375
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,249
The last question is,

376
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:57,090
is it really an exponential smoothing model that minimizes the MSE or dataset use solver to determine the optimal value of alpha?

377
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:04,290
What is the optimal values of the party line drawn from the index splitting variations in the original data?

378
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:12,390
And what are the forecasts for the next two years? Using this technique and go for it?

379
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:19,690
You get a few minutes in.

380
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:43,100
A. I thought I was.

381
01:01:45,790 --> 01:03:09,770
She's. Israel.

382
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:40,220
Okay. Most of these schools.

383
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:29,270
It's something I'm still in.

384
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:36,290
So what? So we want to do the exponential this morning.

385
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:39,619
So exponential smoothing.

386
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:44,479
Remember that it says isn't this another moving average?

387
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:52,700
But it has this certain structure. So we always assign the same weight to the most recent observation.

388
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,860
And that is equal to Alpha. I'm going to I'm going to zoom in this.

389
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,560
So the exponential moving model.

390
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:18,299
So we need and the weight that we assigned to the most recent observation,

391
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:25,710
we feel that the fun of a single move between zero and one, we're not thinking number one five.

392
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:34,670
And I'm going to give the these these cell, they mean alpha.

393
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:42,240
You don't have to, but it'll be easier for me to to get the formula on.

394
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,780
We don't have any forecasts for the first year.

395
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:59,429
So the second year we start with the first second the first forecast is equal to the observation in the previous year.

396
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:10,710
So it's going to be B three, that's how we initialize the the momentum and then we can start applying it for an explanation this morning.

397
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:20,550
And then I'll say that they weren't gas for opinion three is going to be alpha times the observation post one minus times the forecast.

398
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:31,079
So we forecasted 23 we so we still have to wait and then we're going to get a weighted average between these two numbers.

399
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:37,920
The work has been a longer three, so this is going to be equal to alpha volumes.

400
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:55,140
The observation imperial two laws in parentheses one minus five times then forecasting period to a one day forecasting two is here see for.

401
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:06,030
Now we love. When we get rid of decimals.

402
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:20,960
When you do interviews and when you do an informant.

403
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:31,790
In theory, these three. Then they can just write these notes.

404
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:38,160
Those are going to. Those are my my fake forecasts for exponential is moving.

405
01:09:38,160 --> 01:10:00,750
So I'm going to create them and see. And then it seems to me it's some of it's kind of like square open parentheses and highlight difference

406
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:14,530
on the illustrations and then compare that to the forecast disease and divide by the total count.

407
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:33,640
Both for cash that they can't give the average on day they get 1065 and then 66 is my MSE.

408
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,400
Now I want to minimize.

409
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:42,970
They're busy just simply going into one.

410
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:47,630
How about if we call these MSE they can cancel.

411
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:56,570
So these are go out the far right and leave these in this scene.

412
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:00,790
And now I'm going to go in to silver the.

413
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:08,640
I want to. And the end is the same thing.

414
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:21,000
Like King Oliver. Subject to the constraint that outside the country would.

415
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:35,040
Right. And now, besides greater than or equal to zero, and that's going to be imposed with this check here.

416
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:41,679
And so that tells me that they are to be, as we expected, one.

417
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,090
So the most recent observation gets the weight and also the issues that you're asking.

418
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:48,760
And because we have an overall trend.

419
01:11:49,750 --> 01:12:02,140
So again, this is reaffirming the fact that, you know, we are if we want to use export and moving averages or stationary,

420
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:07,390
what we can do is think in that of and forecast the future.

421
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:15,820
So that's why next week we are going to practice with a specific the things that we were

422
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:23,230
able to try to predict the trend and we've got to use different and carbonated drinks.

423
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:39,250
So we'll have one event forecast. And so, you know, we want to forecast figure 21 and to show you what is driving this one.

424
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:51,850
And if you if you if you figure this out, these forecasts are going to be all of our times, this observation plus one minus of these forecast.

425
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:57,790
So it's going to be one family's information flow, zero times the forecast.

426
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,330
But I don't have these observations of these observations.

427
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:07,200
And they look at this 91 times and focused mostly on people.

428
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:13,420
It's going to be simply the forecast. So now.

429
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:27,990
I have many forecasts for this movie.

430
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:36,770
I want to. And you want to create a.

431
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:45,330
Simply insurance companies will look to.

432
01:13:48,480 --> 01:14:01,730
He's got a lot. And we have my we have the date on which I was voting for right now.

433
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:06,170
You see them on Monday or Tuesday.

434
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:10,680
We are going to start working with em, I think, Nick,

435
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:20,390
that will allow us to figure out what the trend is and then extrapolated 2019 better forecasting instead of forecasting in this region.

436
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:38,150
I will be forecasting in these regions. But as you walk through how you adapted the message again to change Alpha.

437
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:54,500
Sure, I draw data and being sober and then I said I want to minimize the ABC because I had already called that set them as these images.

438
01:14:54,920 --> 01:15:00,680
Right. So these cell I mean, let me tell you, this is a formula here.

439
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:13,040
What I call that cell chemistry. You see that most and these cell is my alpha, what I call that cell, Oliver.

440
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:17,990
So I can go straight through that as, as I can put the labels on.

441
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:26,450
That is like a name of the variable. And I say, Oh, I don't have to put the dollar sign since I name it.

442
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:28,430
They don't have a license anymore.

443
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:43,130
So now if I, if I want to minimize them as he is simply going, okay, I want to minimize the MSE, which is this cell here.

444
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:47,720
I can gain Alpha. I could just click on this.

445
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:56,900
I I'll, I'll, I'll make the strain is going to be that the outback is greater than or equal to one,

446
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,750
but also alpha is greater than or equal to zero because that change here

447
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:09,020
guarantees that all my unrestricted variables are greater than or equal to zero.

448
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:15,230
Right. So this is huge. So can we solve it?

449
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:21,890
Well, it is going to take me. He's going to give me the best possible MSE, which is, in this case,

450
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:43,940
188 just so I can put it when you sequence is you'll see one equals you know for for here for for the 21st is going to be alpha.

451
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:48,260
And so the summation is one way to solve crimes if one guy's right.

452
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:53,450
So there's going to be one times this number of zero times this one.

453
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:00,850
So this is going to be here for four and the 27 is going to be 1000.

454
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:11,240
This number is zero transitional. If we don't have these in them, so we use these number here if we're passing the state of the observation.

455
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:18,740
So it's going to be 195052, which is two.

456
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:29,800
And if you want to talk has been three 2324 he's going to invite you to do that.

457
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:34,290
And so if you're, you know,

458
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:39,579
doing these this kind of analysis with moving narratives is never a good idea

459
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:48,910
to form fast music videos in the future because you are going to be losing.

460
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:55,030
You don't have enough information to know what's going to happen, particularly in the stationary time series.

461
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,920
So stationary type series do not carry a lot of information.

462
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,750
They just tell you where it's all calling, meaning. So you are staying around a lot more.

463
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:14,080
When you have training like in this case I use it in non stationary time series, then you have more information the series is going on.

464
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:19,380
So part of part of my workouts is going to see weird.

465
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:26,370
We can see this is going to be, you know, extrapolating that through.

466
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:34,650
Right now. We will finish a wonderful one.

467
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:41,720
Do you have that? I'll give you more things to do.

468
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:47,010
But one of the one is that you think we are done with it.

469
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:59,800
So the question is, I think the issue is not about, you know, presenting and giving me the homework is actually understanding what we need to do.

470
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:05,150
You have to do it by yourself. 36 issues here.

471
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:13,340
You know, this is this is why if you analyze these, this problem is quite simple.

472
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:18,350
You know, that a plus be equal to eight.

473
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,010
Right. And the losses equal to eight.

474
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:26,420
That means that A and C are have to be the same thing.

475
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:35,990
C A blows B isn't going away these days is way to than A and C you have to eat out the same, right?

476
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:40,460
So we don't do A here. And then you can say, okay.

477
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,810
C A-plus. D is 13.

478
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:58,950
So you have. He knows the thing is, which is a theme.

479
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:18,900
And then class B minus eight, which is six in the house is 36 is 19.

480
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:29,880
So basically for. So that means that a minus a zero so to the is equal to 19.

481
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:35,110
So that means that the is equal to 9.5.

482
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:51,500
I don't know that you have implied that it's easy because you know that 13.5 is 3.5, and then these have to be 3.5.

483
01:20:51,670 --> 01:21:01,580
So and then and then the 3.5 and then something is equal to eight.

484
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:10,550
So in the next, so is it.

485
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:14,299
You can use a lot of different ways to do this.

486
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:19,640
But that said, get your mind and do so.

487
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:25,220
We will probably I'll give you more of this one.

488
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:30,470
I so another phone for today. Have a good weekend.

489
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:35,870
And remember, I'll send you an email shortly.

490
01:21:35,870 --> 01:22:03,930
And there's a lot of ways I think that goes, if you know what I yeah, you actually go back to one of the worst that's going to excite me.

491
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:08,860
I don't know.

492
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,709
I don't. Wake up. Come on.

493
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:17,240
It's always I.

494
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:44,780
What are your plans for the box office sales?

495
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,350
I think.

496
01:22:54,545 --> 01:22:57,575
Oh. Oh, yeah.

497
01:22:58,595 --> 01:23:28,755
Oh, yeah. I'm glad I got your emails or whatever a text I can see there.

498
01:23:29,055 --> 01:23:57,495
Okay. If I try to go all the time, I might be able to be so nice guys.

499
01:23:58,305 --> 01:24:09,625
I mean, I'll get a chance to.

500
01:24:12,145 --> 01:24:29,535
To you. You don't have to go to the shop.

501
01:24:32,325 --> 01:24:38,085
I'll see you later. I don't. I didn't even go.

502
01:24:41,385 --> 01:24:50,075
It's like, oh, I decided to stop.

503
01:24:50,765 --> 01:24:53,205
And if you can't, you know, it's.
