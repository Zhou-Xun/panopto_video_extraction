1
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:02,515
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:06,922
I'll be covering a quick review for glycolysis.

3
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:10,101
So I'll also be skimming through this real quick.

4
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:15,485
So basically we've discussed how digestion is happening and everything.

5
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:19,679
And now we really wanna know what happens to the sugar inside the body after it's

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,240
been absorbed.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,118
So definitely there is some disposal by which the muscle

8
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:28,831
can use up a lot of the glucose.

9
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:30,300
This is in controls.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,124
The brain uses some of the glucose as well, because it's the main source for

11
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:34,796
its energy.

12
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:37,064
The adipocytes used a bit.

13
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:39,826
And by use I don't really mean use,

14
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:44,991
it's more as some of the glucose is stored then in the adipocytes.

15
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:49,502
And that's phrenic as well over here.

16
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:53,241
So there's definitely individual differences in glycemic responses.

17
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:56,072
So remember the glycemic index that we talked about.

18
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:59,101
It really doesn't take into account the individual differences.

19
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,917
And as I mentioned, someone can eat a banana and

20
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:04,461
have a huge spike in their glycemic index.

21
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:08,782
Whereas that same person can have a cookie that's full of sugar and

22
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:12,111
absolutely have no spike in their glycemic index.

23
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:16,020
So it's really a personal tolerance.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,375
So we'll be talking about this part over here from

25
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:26,482
glucose all the way to pyruvates, basically.

26
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:31,410
So it's important to keep in mind that glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm.

27
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,441
And then we start with a glucose molecule, which is basically a 6-carbon molecule.

28
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,790
And then we end with the pyruvate, which is 3-carbon molecule.

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,272
But since we started with the six and now we're ending with the three,

30
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,291
then we have two 3-carbon molecules.

31
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:52,040
So two pyruvates from one glucose.

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,441
So end products over here.

33
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:56,564
This will make more sense as we go through this again.

34
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:59,361
Basically, so you have two pyruvates under aerobic conditions.

35
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:02,490
So when oxygen is present.

36
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,294
So in the presence of oxygen and in the presence of CHO.

37
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,668
So you have acetyl acetate.

38
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:12,240
But you need energy, then you'll go through the TCA cycle to make more energy.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,564
Because full glycolysis that goes into the TCA cycle and

40
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:22,360
the electron transport chain, yields the most energy which is 32 ATPs.

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,030
As compared to almost anything else that definitely yields less energy than that.

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,564
If you have CHO, so you have acetyl acetate in the TCA cycle, but

43
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:32,080
you do not need the energy.

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,310
Then logically you're gonna store the excess glucose,

45
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,401
since you don't need to make any energy.

46
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:43,740
So you'll just store it for later if need be.

47
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,899
And then in the absence of CHO, so you do not have any acetyl acetate,

48
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,699
then basically what's gonna happen is that,

49
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,960
you're gonna make some ketone bodies, basically.

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,178
And then gluconeogenesis, we'll talk more about it.

51
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,363
Now under anaerobic conditions,

52
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:03,900
basically what will happen to the pyruvate is that it becomes lactate.

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,002
And the net ATP produced by lactate is basically 2 ATPs.

54
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:14,528
So this is really inefficient.

55
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,566
So, but this is what happens and there are anaerobic conditions.

56
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:22,839
And we'll talk more about this.

57
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:27,358
So basically glycolysis is trying to provide energy for

58
00:03:27,358 --> 00:03:30,345
whatever organ it's occurring in.

59
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,931
So if you look at glucokinase versus hexokinase.

60
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:38,332
So those are two very major enzymes that play a role in different parts.

61
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:42,367
So glucokinase is in the liver and in the pancreas and

62
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:45,770
its cooperatives, and it's really fast.

63
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,604
And it works close to the physiological range of glucose.

64
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,000
So if you have low glucose, glucokinase is not active.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,203
If you have higher glucose, glucokinase is activated.

66
00:03:56,203 --> 00:04:03,440
So it's activated as you increase your glucose concentration.

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,865
And this is important, because I'll tell you that in a minute actually.

68
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:15,591
Hexokinase which is in the muscle and in the fat, it has high affinity to glucose.

69
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:20,720
So as soon as it sees glucose, even at the most minimal levels it is active.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,699
And you can see it here in the graph in blue.

71
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,664
Basically it's active even at very low concentrations of glucose,

72
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:31,923
and then it reaches its v max fairly quickly.

73
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:37,348
So whether you have high glucose or low glucose, it's equally active.

74
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:39,981
Whereas glucokinase on the other hand,

75
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:44,100
increases incrementally as you have more glucose available.

76
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,715
And then eventually hexikinase is blocked by G-6-phosphate,

77
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,527
which is downstream of glucose.

78
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:53,063
So after glucose has been acted on by hexokinase,

79
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:56,104
it's transformed to G-6-phosphate.

80
00:04:56,104 --> 00:05:00,928
So logically, in the muscle if you have a build up of the product,

81
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:04,551
then you will ask the reactant to stop coming in.

82
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:08,029
So if you have a build up of G-6-phosphate,

83
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:13,204
hexokinae will know that this is time to stop undergoing glycolyis,

84
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:17,860
and this is the perfect time to reduce my function basically.

85
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,065
So this is really important because,

86
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:25,882
think of the muscle as an organ that always needs energy.

87
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:29,965
And so if hexokinase can work at very low levels of glucose,

88
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:35,041
then this is an advantage because then the muscle can always have energy.

89
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:39,507
You can always move your arm or your leg if you're running or anything.

90
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,449
So this is very vital.

91
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:45,778
Whereas the liver, think of the liver as being someone who can sacrifice for

92
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,868
the greater good.

93
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:49,780
And here the greater good being the muscle itself.

94
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,747
So the liver can sacrifice not using a lot of glucose when it feels that

95
00:05:54,747 --> 00:06:01,640
the supply is really low, so that the muscle can use it.

96
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,000
So basically we'll be talking more about each of those pathways.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,465
But if one pathway is blocked, you can only imagine that

98
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:14,843
glucose will be overwhelming the other two pathways.

99
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:19,253
So let's say that glycogen and this pathway is blocked, then PFK1 and

100
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:25,860
G-6-PTH activities will be up regulated and the other way around.

101
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,076
So now that we're past glucokinase and hexokinase,

102
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:34,674
the next step is PFK1, which is very tightly regulated.

103
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:35,641
And we'll talk about it.

104
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:38,864
So now we have glucose 6-phosphate, and we need to,

105
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:41,680
we convert that to fructose-6-phosphate.

106
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,284
And now this fructose 6-phosphate needs to become

107
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:51,626
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate under the action of PFK1.

108
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:53,662
And we'll talk more about this in a bit.

109
00:06:53,662 --> 00:06:58,950
So Tarui's disease basically has a loss of PFK function.

110
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:04,238
So if I'm telling you that PFK is here,

111
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:09,220
and PFK1 activity isn't working.

112
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,986
Then everything above PFK1, all their reactants basically,

113
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:19,294
should increase and everything downstream of PFK1 should decrease.

114
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:24,441
Because PFK1 can't do its function to produce the products, basically.

115
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:27,684
So if we can't undergo glycolysis,

116
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:32,817
because this is a disease where we have a defective PFK1.

117
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:34,398
Then there is muscle weakness and

118
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:36,659
definitely increased glycogen in the muscle.

119
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,691
So why do we have increased glycogen in the muscle?

120
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,250
It's because if PFK1 is not active, then this pathway and

121
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,680
the other pathway will be up regulated.

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,220
So more glycogen synthase activity, and

123
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,493
by default this means more glycogen is being stored.

124
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:56,099
And it's being stored in the muscle, because this is a disease in the muscle.

125
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,883
And also myopathy, because the muscle keeps on storing more glycogen and

126
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:04,752
then this exceeds its natural glycogen storing capacity.

127
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:08,640
And then that leads to muscle death and degeneration.

128
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,672
So PFK1 is regulated interestingly by F 2,6- bisphosphate,

129
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,701
which isn't in the normal glycolyptic pathway.

130
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:17,850
It's like a branched pathway.

131
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,902
We'll talk more about it.

132
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:23,276
And AMP, AMP signifies having low energy levels.

133
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:27,835
ATP will negatively regulate it,

134
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:33,030
because it means that you have energy.

135
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,239
So you do not need to undergo glycolysis.

136
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:40,162
And citrate, which is metabolized in the TCA cycle, also down regulated.

137
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:45,205
Signaling that the TCA cycle is up and running and

138
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:52,219
we do not need more stuff to feed into the TCA cycle or to make energy.

139
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:57,061
So how exactly is PFK1 activity up regulated by F 2, 6-bisphosphate?

140
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:00,759
So think of it this way.

141
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,511
Assume that PFK1 is a cashier.

142
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:11,033
And if you have a lot of F 6-P, so you have a lot of,

143
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:15,030
basically a lot of things coming in.

144
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:22,680
But let's think of F 1, 6-bisphosphate as being a customer, okay, for example.

145
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,350
So if you have one cashier, but there's a lot of customers coming in.

146
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,915
Then F 2, 6-biphosphates, you need to think of it as like a passive aggressive

147
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:36,376
customer who sees that the cashier is full.

148
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,462
And decide to form another line on the side.

149
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:44,073
So this line is really kind of, so they form a line on the side and

150
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:45,990
they keep staring at you.

151
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,122
Think of it that way.

152
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:50,368
So they're forcing you to work faster,

153
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:55,240
because they eventually want to join this line as well.

154
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,970
So this is exactly what F 2, 6-bisphosphate does.

155
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,513
So it's formed from F 6-phosphate by PFK2.

156
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:05,221
And it doesn't go anywhere.

157
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:06,831
This is like a dead end over here.

158
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:11,160
It just serves as an allosteric activator of PFK1.

159
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,000
So think of F 2,6-bisphosphate as being the passive aggressive customer who

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,639
stands on the side, but is really looking at you to speed up.

161
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,664
And that's exactly what's happening over here.

162
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,743
So this is all that is.

163
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:28,481
It's just an activator for

164
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:33,720
PFK1 to tell it that this pathway is really jammed,

165
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,661
so you need to speed up and work faster.

166
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:42,241
And so, PFK2 which is on the side, the part that's assessing the passive

167
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,108
aggressive customer over here, it's activated by insulin.

168
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:53,385
Because after we eat a meal, insulin will want you to undergo glycolysis and

169
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:59,764
absorb all the glucose using GLUT4 or another GLUT transporter.

170
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:02,769
So insulin would want to up regulate PFK2.

171
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,853
So that more F 2, 6 biphosphate would be on the side.

172
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:11,082
So more customers on the side, which means that PFK1 needs to work faster.

173
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,616
And there is more glycolysis, basically.

174
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:17,748
On the other hand, adrenaline, which is also epinephrine,

175
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:22,202
if you're trying to run from a bear, it's gonna be up regulated.

176
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:26,596
And that would inhibit PFK2, because if you're trying to run from a bear,

177
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:29,838
you do not really want to undergo the whole glycolysis.

178
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:34,120
You need glucose to remain in the blood so that your liver can use it.

179
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,489
So this works on the liver.

180
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:42,127
On the other hand, glucagon, which is up regulated when you're starved, for

181
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,770
example, or you haven't eaten for a while.

182
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:50,157
It will also ask the liver, as we said, to sacrifice for the greater good.

183
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:56,218
And to not undergo glycolysis and use the little glucose that's available.

184
00:11:56,218 --> 00:12:02,460
So that, that glucose, whatever glucose is available can be used by the muscle.

185
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,598
So think of those as asking the liver to sacrifice for

186
00:12:06,598 --> 00:12:12,923
the greater good, so that the muscle can use the energy.

187
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:18,288
So basically, citrate as we mentioned, it slows down glycolysis through PFK1.

188
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,602
If you have some energy needs,

189
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:26,042
definitely ATP will also play a major role in down regulating TCA cycle.

190
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:29,846
AMP will play, sorry, not down regulating glycolysis.

191
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:32,687
AMP will up regulate it because you need energy.

192
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:36,493
So you're asking glycolysis to happen at a faster rate.

193
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:41,747
F 2,6 bisphosphate, the passive aggressive customer, it will ask PFK1 to speed up.

194
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:45,961
So this is a positive feedback to undergo more glycolysis.

195
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:50,018
And then PFK2 inhibition, by default, if it's inhibited,

196
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:53,940
it will reduce the production of F 2,6-bisphosphate.

197
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,622
So if you do not have this passive aggressive customer on the side,

198
00:12:57,622 --> 00:13:00,338
then there is no need for you to speed up anyways.

199
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:05,582
Because there is not that many customers to begin with.

200
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:11,310
So this adrenaline and glucagon over here, they do not really work on the muscle.

201
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,221
Because the muscle doesn't have the ligand to really respond to them.

202
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:17,623
So the muscle has PFK2, but

203
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:22,741
it's irresponsive to basically glucagon and adrenaline.

204
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:26,416
So it doesn't have that chunk on it that allows for

205
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,574
phosphorylation and inactivation of it.

206
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:32,130
Which makes sense, because think about it this way.

207
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,164
So if adrenaline is up and you're trying to run from a bear,

208
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:39,972
you want every single muscle in you to be up and running.

209
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:42,140
Because you're running for your life.

210
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,808
But do you really need your liver to be consuming energy at the moment?

211
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:46,457
I think not.

212
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:52,071
The liver can just rest and decide and provide energy for

213
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:57,240
other organs like the muscle which needs them.

214
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,636
Obviously for more major reasons and causes to run from the bear.

215
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:04,260
So think of the muscle as always needing energy.

216
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,791
You never want to deprive your muscle from energy, but

217
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:14,460
the liver can always give up its own energy for the greater good.

218
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,511
So now the third step that's regulated is the pyruvate kinase.

219
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:20,570
So pyruvate kinase is over here.

220
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,740
And that's the last step that will change phosphate in all pyruvate II pyruvate.

221
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,420
So this is how pyruvate kinase is regulated.

222
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,832
So now we basically, we're done with PFK1 over here.

223
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:39,360
So we've made fructose 1,6- bisphosphate.

224
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,571
And then all of those are kind of passive reactions.

225
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,900
So they're not regulated.

226
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,730
And then the last regulated step over here is the PK.

227
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,299
So just remember we've had glucokinase and the hexokinase up here,

228
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:55,080
transforming glucose into glucose 6-phosphate.

229
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,206
Now we've had the PFK1 transforming fructose 6-phosphate into 1,

230
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:00,430
6-bisphosphate.

231
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,421
And now we have pyruvate kinase changing PP into pyruvate.

232
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,553
So if you have a build up of ATP,

233
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:11,501
naturally ATP is telling you not to undergo glycolysis.

234
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:14,150
So it will try to inhibit everything it can inhibit.

235
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,426
And in this case it's PFK1 or pyruvate kinase.

236
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,441
Because you have energy.

237
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:23,507
So ATP is trying to tell you not to make more energy by not undergoing glycolysis,

238
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:24,782
which makes sense.

239
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:29,128
F 1,6-bisphosphate will feed forward to pyruvate kinase and

240
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,739
cause its activity to be up regulated.

241
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:35,507
So now F 1,6-bisphosphate is the customer who is trying to get

242
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:37,229
through the rest of the line.

243
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,531
And the only officer he sees is pyruvate kinase.

244
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:45,162
So he tries to make pyruvate kinase go faster, basically.

245
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:48,172
And then alanine only in the liver, keep that in mind.

246
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:53,371
Alanine in the liver will prevent the activity of pyruvate kinase.

247
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:57,975
And this is because alanine can interchangeably become pyruvate under

248
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:02,587
the action of alanine, I believe it's transaminase or transferase.

249
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,509
Probably transferase.

250
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:12,441
So if ALT is functioning and it's running, you can convert alanine to part of it.

251
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:16,830
So if you have a source of pyruvate, do you really need an extra source in here?

252
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,491
Not really.

253
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:20,797
And this is what the alanine is trying to tell the pyruvate kinase.

254
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:24,339
I can become pyruvate so I do not need you to do my job for me.

255
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,331
And so it blocks it, basically.

256
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,721
And that's only in the liver.

257
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:33,000
And alanine is an amino acid over here.

258
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,187
That will ask glucose oxidation to stop by preventing pyruvate kinase and

259
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,040
that's only in the liver.

260
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,940
So this is the summary we've been over it.

261
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,731
So another thing that can happen if you're hypoxic, so

262
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,403
you're under very low oxygen levels.

263
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:51,942
You're either at a high altitude or you've been running for so long.

264
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:56,011
So hypoxia would cause glucolysis to be up regulated.

265
00:16:56,011 --> 00:17:03,088
And this is because glycolysis yields a net ATP of 7 ATP.

266
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:08,302
So if you're a hypoxic and you can't really go through the TCA cycle, because

267
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:13,685
you do not have oxygen as a final electron carrier which we'll be talking about.

268
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:19,247
Then the only way to make a lot of energy is through going through glycolysis,

269
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,890
which yields 7 ATPs.

270
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,283
And your body is happy with that,

271
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:27,230
because under hypoxia this is the only thing it can do.

272
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,930
So more glycolysis is happening to try and

273
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,262
yield the maximum ATP that it can yield under hypoxic conditions.

274
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,042
Also you have ChReBP sensing over here, and chronic glucagon.

275
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,410
So chronic glucagon would actually,

276
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,078
remember the PFK2 situation where we said glucagon would inhibit PFK2.

277
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:50,598
Thus decreasing the production of F 2,6-bisphosphate,

278
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:55,698
which will ultimately decrease pushing PFK1 forward.

279
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,447
So PFK 1 will shut down.

280
00:17:57,447 --> 00:18:02,221
And this is how chronic glucagon will cause glycolysis to

281
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,613
really go downhill as well.

282
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:08,790
And it seems like it also plays a role in glucagon, I mean,

283
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,620
glucokinase as well, by eventually.

284
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,355
So those are transcriptional.

285
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:17,997
And they have different effects on different, so

286
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,129
this acts on pyruvate kinase in the liver.

287
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:22,476
This act on glucokinase.

288
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,064
So they act on different aspects.

289
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:30,697
But hypoxia acts on glycolysis as a whole to be sped up,

290
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:35,600
so that you can produce as much ATP as possible.

291
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,623
And this is the net ATP which we've just covered.

292
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:45,501
So basically 7 ATP is being produced from glycolysis by itself.

293
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,940
So all the way from glucose to pyruvate you make 7 ATP.

294
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,871
You actually make 9 ATP, but

295
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:56,921
you used 2 ATPs over here to activate the process.

296
00:18:56,921 --> 00:19:01,621
So this leaves you with a net of 7.

297
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:03,070
If you go to lactate,

298
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:08,314
remember we said under anaerobic conditions pyruvate will become lactate.

299
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:14,041
Then in this case, basically this will use 5 ATP.

300
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,959
So you're left with a net of 2.

301
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:21,294
And then if you go through the TCA cycle and you make CO2 towards the end,

302
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,795
because this is the full oxidation of glucose,

303
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:29,278
then you yield 32 ATP, which is the best thing basically.

304
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:30,359
Fructose and galactose.

305
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:34,640
Basically fructose feeds, so you need aldolase B, of course.

306
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,190
And then it feeds and pass the PFK1 regulatory step.

307
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,101
So it's not tightly regulated.

308
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:44,531
So if you eat a lot of fructose and a lot of fruits,

309
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:49,391
then they are bound to feed into your glycolytic pathway immediately

310
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:53,099
without being regulated or asked anything kind of.

311
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,801
Because they're skipping a major regulatory phase.

312
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,140
They skipped PFK1.

313
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,247
They skipped glucokinase and hexokinase.

314
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:03,347
So you just have to let them end basically.

315
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:07,656
Aldolase B is really needed to change fructose

316
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:12,240
1-phosphate to glyceraldehyde and DHAP.

317
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,575
So basically think of fructokinase.

318
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:19,999
If you have fructokinase deficiency, then you can't really transform

319
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:24,651
fructose into fructose 1-phosphate, which is no big deal, basically.

320
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:28,527
This means that you're gonna have more fructose in your blood, and

321
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,321
it can't be transformed into F 1-phosphate.

322
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,509
So this isn't a pathological.

323
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,341
It's fine, you can live with it.

324
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:39,343
On the other hand, if you have aldolase B deficiency,

325
00:20:39,343 --> 00:20:42,564
this is really pathological, basically.

326
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:46,706
Because this means that fructose can go into the cell,

327
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:52,301
it can become fructose 1-phosphate under the action of fructokinase.

328
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,751
And then it really can't go anywhere from there.

329
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,722
This step is irreversible.

330
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,528
So it cannot become fructose again and go into the blood.

331
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:04,378
And it cannot really be metabolized by the action

332
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:09,000
of aldolase B to go into the glycolytic cycle.

333
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,831
So you're just stuck with fructose-1-phosphate and

334
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,760
the cell which is not ideal.

335
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,200
And it causes a lot of problems.

336
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,041
This is a nice schematic of the controls over here.

337
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:27,982
Citrate, as mentioned, also citrate we said

338
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:32,174
it sends a negative feedback to PFK1.

339
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:36,031
Because it's telling PFK1 that, hey ,we have a lot of TCA cycle intermediates.

340
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:39,049
We do not need you to add to it anymore.

341
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,436
But since we're skipping PFK1 when fructose is going in,

342
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:45,020
then really citrate can't do much about it.

343
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,076
So fructose just keeps adding to the energy and

344
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:54,380
keeps causing more energy build up by making more pyruvate.

345
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,300
Even if the body doesn't want it, it's just gonna go in there.

346
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,357
So those are the disorders we talked about.

347
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:04,826
Galactolysis is for galactose.

348
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,901
Galactose feeds in at the G-6-phosphate levels.

349
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:11,771
So it skips glucokinase and hexokinase, but that's okay.

350
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:15,320
Because PFK1 is a really major regulator.

351
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,150
And so the answer here is yes.

352
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,971
And so since it regulates it, then that's really good.

353
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:24,551
Because you can decide what to do with the galactose.

354
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,800
It doesn't just go in uninvited.

355
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,349
You can decide whether you want it to go all the way to pyruvate, or

356
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:36,000
to go up through gluconeogenesis, which we can talk about later.

357
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,321
That's it.
