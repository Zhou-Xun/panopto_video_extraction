1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
Hey, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,730
Apologies once again, the room's pretty warm, and it looks like this is going to be what we have to deal with for the time being.

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,040
Like the thermostat back,

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,180
there is one of those pretend things like that make to give the illusion that you have some control over the temperature here, but you really don't.

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:37,740
I'm happy to keep the doors open as long as it's not too noisy in the hallway, just to get some extra ventilation going on here.

6
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,190
The Panopto is running and it seemed to work.

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,820
I don't know if anybody checked out the recording, but hopefully it was successful throughout.

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,670
Josh, I'm going to ask you, did you happen to tell you the recording all the way through?

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,710
And it was OK. I looked at a couple of pieces just to kind of confirm they were good to hear.

10
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,850
Good to hear. Yeah, I'm still getting used to this classroom.

11
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,020
There's not like a podium to stand out, right? I'm really happy with walking around, but there's like a lot of depth going on here, right?

12
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,650
Like instead of like maybe a wide classroom or even like a little bit of surround going on.

13
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:25,870
And if I'm recording in Panopto, like it doesn't work for the person watching the court recording for me to be standing here pointing at the screen.

14
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:32,190
So I'm going to try to remember to use the mouth and I'll probably be sitting and standing kind of throughout.

15
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:41,490
So bear with me if I look like I'm a little bit handsy up here and I'm going to try to figure it out before we actually get going.

16
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:50,380
We spent the first class session doing like really brief introductions for anybody who wasn't here.

17
00:01:50,380 --> 00:02:01,140
The first class give me a quick hand-raised. So two of you, if you wouldn't mind, just in like like less than 60 seconds each.

18
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,040
Go ahead and just state your name. What?

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,460
What program? And maybe year in program.

20
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:17,520
And if you have a particular reason to share why you decided to take this class, and it could be because you're really,

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,970
really interested in it for any number of reasons or because it's like a requirement and you had no choice.

22
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,490
So how about if we start in the back and then come up here, a friend? I didn't have my mind on that.

23
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,700
And the undergrad program,

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,810
I'm interested in taking this quite unlike most interested in learning to all this kind of specialization and the undergrad program.

25
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,180
But I'm also interested in my policy, and I hope you like health administration for like a degree,

26
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,090
and I want to connect Health Administration policy to my environmental health coverage.

27
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:59,940
Fantastic. Thank you so much. Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a first year MPH environmental promotion policy of the druckerman,

28
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,100
and this class is required for me if I were taken anyways because environmental policy has come back.

29
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,610
It's in the name of my program, so I'm interested in that and the word of mouth.

30
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,810
Awesome. Thanks again to both of you.

31
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,990
And you know, part of the rationale there is I'm going to try to promote and facilitate as much discussion as possible in the class.

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:26,400
And, you know, the more comfortable we feel with each other and our backgrounds and so forth that hopefully the easier that will be a few

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,920
nuts and bolts to start with before we get into the material and I'll sit down and point at the using the cursor here.

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:45,390
Here we are on the 18th next week. On the 25th is when I'm asking you to submit your term project topic.

35
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,600
It can be a phrase. It can be kind of a draft title, but or if that's too difficult, you know,

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,940
you can write a sentence or two to describe what you are thinking about focusing on.

37
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:03,180
I'm not going to create any special assignment, you know, to submit to you through canvas.

38
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,630
Just just send me an email and say, This is what I'm thinking. I can give some feedback, you know, right off the bat.

39
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,570
And if you're even at the stage of this is what I'm thinking,

40
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,940
but I'm not really sure to go in this direction or that direction or to go broader or more narrow.

41
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:26,010
You know, I can begin to give feedback as well. So please don't be afraid to kind of talk to me with any questions you might have in that regard.

42
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:38,630
Any any questions, I guess right now about that project and working towards developing at least the topic at this point.

43
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,880
Yes. If we don't really know what we want to do because there's a lot of ways to go.

44
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,620
Do you have any suggestions for places to look for inspiration, I guess.

45
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:59,240
Um, let's see. So yeah, there's a couple of different ways you can approach it.

46
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,580
I'm actually going to talk about something here in a minute that I want to implement into the class from this point forward,

47
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,220
and I have a pretty good example. It's called environmental health policy in the news.

48
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,460
Actually, let me talk about it and I'll circle back around that. We're probably more efficient to your question.

49
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:25,010
So the first light I have prepared is on a popular press news article from yesterday.

50
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:33,920
They just came out, uh, in, uh, in Nature Intercom, which publishes, you know, peer reviewed journal articles,

51
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,850
but then also has special feature articles and write ups and videos and so forth that are often really good,

52
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,740
really good quality, really reputable source, highly regarded journal.

53
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,510
And so what I'd like to do is to invite all of you.

54
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,770
And, you know, I'm not really keeping track or keeping score. This is just part of like general class participation.

55
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,900
I know you have, you know, have new streams. You're on listserv.

56
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,950
You might just be out looking at stuff because you know you're interested in this topic.

57
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:12,740
If you see cool or interesting articles, popular press, I'm not asking to go, you know, searching in the latest New England Journal of Medicine.

58
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,150
You know, peer reviewed articles, just popular press.

59
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,620
If you see something that's of interest, that's kind of relevant to this course.

60
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,810
Go ahead and share it with me. Send me a link or send me a PDF or whatever.

61
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,820
It is easiest and I will do something like this.

62
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,510
All kind of prepare a slide for our next class period.

63
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:42,470
And at the beginning of the class period, we could spend a couple of minutes discussing it and again, with the rationale being that like,

64
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:49,250
yeah, so and with apologies, you had a ton of reading to do this week, right from the text chapters and so forth.

65
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,690
Oh my gosh, that's like a slightly painful right. It's a ton of material.

66
00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:00,410
It's a little bit all right. It's based on stuff from like at least 10 years ago or more.

67
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:08,780
And so what I want to do and we really get into this in the second part of the class in the case studies is have things be much more applied, right?

68
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,240
So we're even looking at case studies from a historical perspective looking at we're right now where

69
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,430
we're going into the future and what lessons we can learn and how we can apply them to other situations.

70
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:26,720
So along those lines, this environmental health policy in the news, I want to invite you just to see something like,

71
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,550
Hey, you know, this sounds like something relevant to the class right now. Send it to me.

72
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,550
I'll prepare a slide like this. We can spend a couple of minutes discussing it, and I'll even invite you.

73
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,780
It's not a requirement. Instead of me spending a couple of minutes introducing the article, you have that.

74
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,700
I'll invite you to do it if you'd like and just come and you know, hey, I think you can explain it to the class.

75
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,420
If found, this article thought it was interesting because of X, Y or Z.

76
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:01,250
And, you know, maybe we have a few minutes of discussion around it. So I'm going to tell you how I found this article.

77
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:13,790
I went out to Google and I typed environmental, health and policy, and then I clicked on news as like the.

78
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:22,100
The way to narrow it by topic, you can click on images or videos or whatever any one of them is news and like a ton of things come up.

79
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,090
You might even if you really have no idea what what to pursue,

80
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,640
you could start as broad as that just to kind of get you thinking about like, Oh, OK, so you know what?

81
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,130
What issues are considered to be environmental, health and policy type issues?

82
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:44,290
And you know, all it takes is often a click here or click there, and you just kind of continues to kind of open you up to different things.

83
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:52,610
Uh, I'm also happy to to work with anyone who just wants to have a discussion about it or writing and start over email.

84
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,920
But I'm also happy to meet individually after class before class.

85
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,200
Some other day over Zoom. Whatever works, if you want to, whatever, have a little bit more feedback and you know,

86
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,060
you might be able to get to the point where I'm interested in these general topics,

87
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,190
but I don't really know what to focus on in terms of a term project.

88
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:21,650
I'm happy to help you, you know, kind of refine that. Does anybody else?

89
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,730
I'm going to actually turn that back around because I'm going to try to do in this class as much as possible.

90
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:33,380
Does anybody else have suggestions for what maybe has worked for you in the past if you've kind of been posed with you?

91
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:41,570
You have the freedom right to kind of come up with the topic on your own and how to better explore that.

92
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,100
Are there specific ways that folks have found useful or helpful in doing that?

93
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,910
Yeah. And another policy school and sometimes and I've heard papers and can't come up

94
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,440
with topics all look like policy think tanks and just go to the environment,

95
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:02,990
and they have a bunch of articles about different topics that they like and kind of activist or interest groups like Sierra,

96
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:10,610
one of the Environmental Defense Fund or anything like that, because they have a bunch of topics just kind of on the front page.

97
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,100
Excellent. Another great suggestion. Yeah. Both of my other courses as well.

98
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,670
So that there's an interesting topic here that I want to read more about,

99
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:26,910
like classrooms down South Asian American diaspora and there was a professor.

100
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,850
About it, and I was like, Oh, my, my father for sure.

101
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:38,520
Yeah, yeah, that's that's a fantastic idea. And you know, I know some of you are really passionate about very specific topics, right?

102
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,400
And so another class, you know, I don't know,

103
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,210
maybe you had maybe with like a web based or database and you had to do some sort of analysis or something, right?

104
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,870
But you didn't have the ability to take a step back and look at, you know,

105
00:10:51,870 --> 00:11:00,150
policy implications or where are the shortcomings in research and data to better inform policy?

106
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:06,100
Absolutely. You know, consider those types of options if it's something that I'm interested in.

107
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:11,410
That's great. Those were way better answers than I had. Thank you so much. All right.

108
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,750
So that was the answer, and we go back to our dates here.

109
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:28,940
So, yeah, so work towards at least a topic for next week and send it to me at any point in advance of next week's class.

110
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,050
Going back to this one.

111
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:38,660
So the class discussion preference, there are still almost all of you except for just a couple, I haven't gotten this information to me.

112
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:49,290
And so if you can, so that's uh, it's been attached to a couple of canvass announcements and it's the the canvas say up here for.

113
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:54,770
And on last week's class under assignments, this word document just go ahead.

114
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,320
It'll take like, I don't know, maybe a minute.

115
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:08,630
Uh, out of these topics list, uh, in preference your your top three, your number one choice, your number two choice number three choice.

116
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:15,320
Save the doc and just send it to me as an attachment. If you haven't done that yet, please go ahead and do it as soon as you can.

117
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:23,450
And that will allow me to whatever are going to go through and hopefully assign people to topics that are actually of most interest to them.

118
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:32,180
And I can kind of get that distributed so that everybody knows where they stand for this, uh, student led class discussion.

119
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:41,510
Any any questions on on that one for anybody who hasn't had a chance to complete it yet, or maybe you completed it and you still have a question.

120
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:51,820
OK. And I think that was it in terms of dates and nuts and bolts.

121
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,840
So let's go ahead and get to this article. Oh, I actually posted it.

122
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:05,890
So that would be the other thing that I would do if you find an article, uh, let's say tomorrow or the next day, you know, like, shoot me a link.

123
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:14,590
Hey, professor, I thought this might be interesting for class. I would like this make a slide for next week's class to discuss.

124
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:23,260
But I would also, you know, PDF it or distribute the link through canvas or something to the class for today's article.

125
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,500
The one that we're looking at a summary of now, I actually posted it over here called Meet your article.

126
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:37,300
So I'll try to prompts people in advance of class. It's not completely required if you have a minute to actually check it out.

127
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:44,840
Go ahead and do so, but to make sure that it's there for a reference going forward.

128
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,510
All right. So let's get into the slide deck a little bit.

129
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,270
So, yeah, so this one jumped out at me.

130
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:03,870
It's probably, uh, pretty far ahead of where we're ready to actually the level that we're ready to discuss things in this class.

131
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:15,150
But it's totally relevant. And, you know, I can't leave it alone, either the way that it starts, uh, the article here around Sharpie Gate.

132
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,820
Does anybody know what Sharpie Gate is on hand?

133
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:31,890
All right, I'm going to use our friend Google because this is just way too good to pass up.

134
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:44,010
Sharp, you didn't. Images and then here's a bunch of them.

135
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,030
This one is going to be best. OK, so you can see all these, you know,

136
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:53,060
have President Trump sitting in the Oval Office with this kind of poster board talking

137
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,820
about a hurricane that was approaching the southeast US coast in which one is going to be?

138
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:07,620
I guess I have to click on, click on a couple. Yeah, so you can you can see, so this is kind of standard.

139
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:17,020
Noah. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association with all of their guidance is this is Hurricane Dorian.

140
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:25,870
And, you know, it kind of has a legend down here that talks about whether it's a warning or what, you know, category of storm winds.

141
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,710
And then they forecast the storm track, right? So at the time, the center of the storm is out here and then, you know,

142
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:38,650
the next day they think the center is going to be here the next day here, the next day here and so forth.

143
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:48,010
And then the the bounce and East Side are kind of an indication of the uncertainty associated with the path of the storm, right?

144
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,470
So by the time you get a couple of days out this, they forecast the storm center to be here.

145
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,230
But it really could be as far south as here or as far north as up here.

146
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,280
And then the furthest that it goes,

147
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:10,510
I think this is like a five day forecast from the National Hurricane Center is about as far as the models are even reliable to go out and forecast.

148
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:16,480
And then, you know, kind of at the end is like this big bubble of like what could be impacted.

149
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,600
And, you know, it's pretty much the whole state of Florida, a little bit of the southern kind of Georgia coast here,

150
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,570
right as the area that that might be maybe most concerned.

151
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:39,310
And so there was a, I guess, like a press briefing in the Oval Office and prior prior to this briefing, the president had said,

152
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:50,290
We're really concerned and we're deploying, you know, FEMA resources and so forth to be available to respond.

153
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:59,770
You know, as the storm hits and damages and getting help to people and those that really need to be most concerned are people in Florida,

154
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:07,030
people in Georgia and people in Alabama. Those are the ones that withstand the biggest chance of being impacted.

155
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:14,740
And the forecast and you can kind of see it here. The normal forecast, you know, didn't really say anything about Alabama.

156
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:23,290
Typically, for people in coastal Alabama to be threatened, this storm is coming up through the Gulf of Mexico and hitting, uh,

157
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,070
down here from the south or as the storm was kind of coming across and it was hitting, you know, more the Atlantic coast at some point.

158
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:37,180
It could still continue and impact Alabama, but usually hurricanes are weakened quite a bit once they travel that far.

159
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:46,960
And so Sharpie Gate was this black line that showed up the kind of extended the area of concern.

160
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,220
Perhaps on this poster,

161
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:57,530
I'm going to click on a different image of the union on it because it becomes pretty obvious How do I make this poster this thing?

162
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:05,530
No. All right, hopefully it's big enough.

163
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,050
But anyway, you can see it went from being like this really nice.

164
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:15,700
No agency generated graphic that they put into like a poster board for the purpose of this press conference.

165
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,640
It was kind of obvious that someone grabbed a Sharpie. There's no such thing as a white Sharpie, at least as I was far aware of, right?

166
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,530
And probably at least not one that people have handed. People have a. a black sharpie typically.

167
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,660
So someone took a black sharpie and physically drew on the board.

168
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,750
This, I'm sure, what kind of shape that is,

169
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:41,890
but something just to take it into a larger geographic area so that it barely caught a little bit of the state of Alabama

170
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:49,900
to kind of justify the comments that the president had made a couple of days before in advance of this press briefing.

171
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:58,030
So that was a long winded explanation of what it is, but it's kind of it's the leading to this article,

172
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:09,700
which is focused on a report that just came out, uh, called Protecting the integrity of Government Science.

173
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:22,090
And it's the point of it was appointing a task force for review of scientific integrity policies within federal agencies.

174
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:28,690
Specifically, that sets out how trust in the government can be restored around science through

175
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,110
the increase in science integrity and in subsequent evidence based policymaking.

176
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:43,270
Right. So if things like this happen with Sharpie Gate and people who understand the science behind it and say, OK,

177
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:53,350
we like to rely on Noah or the National Weather Service to give us, like, really important timely information and guidance on a pending hurricane.

178
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:59,320
And you know, who might be in harm's way and what could be done preventatively for it.

179
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,500
And then to have like a black Sharpie drawn on to kind of justify the comments that

180
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:12,970
the president made really cuts into the credibility of the agency in the first place.

181
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:25,390
Right. That's one kind of easy to see example, but this article goes into some more specifics that the press gives me specific examples around it.

182
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:33,220
The photo here on the left is of Linda Birnbaum, who who previously led.

183
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,680
She was the director of an agency to the National Institute for Environmental Sciences.

184
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,800
Very accomplished tons of government agency, service and leadership.

185
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,490
And you know, she talks about how she was basically prevented,

186
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:57,160
sometimes from speaking to the press on specific topics around around environmental health.

187
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,880
And so it's kind of this this task force and actually I can.

188
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,250
I pulled up this document as well. I don't think I'm going to post this one.

189
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,980
It looks like a deep read, but the information is there for anybody who's interested.

190
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,960
Sixty seven pages. That's kind of a lot.

191
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:24,880
But anyway, this is the full report that just came out a few days ago around Scientific Integrity, Fast Track Action Committee.

192
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:37,010
And, you know, kind of what they came up with and what what improvements they identified could be helpful in terms of increasing or replacing

193
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:48,430
some of that lost or missing trust in government agencies and kind of the messaging and policymaking that comes from it.

194
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:55,100
I'm going to leave it, I'm going to leave it there because again, it's we could go into a ton of death,

195
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:06,460
maybe we can even revisit this a little bit later in the semester as we get into some of the more specific and depth of the material.

196
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:15,580
I don't know anybody have any any comments or questions about it.

197
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,120
OK, I didn't expect this was going to launch into a big discussion,

198
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,470
but it was it was too big a news to pass up as being a great example of the environmental health policy in the

199
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:32,860
news that I wanted to kind of illustrate and then invite you to kind of set my way from this point forward.

200
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:42,560
Over the course of the semester. All right. So let's take many, many, many steps back.

201
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,300
What is environmental health policy? All right.

202
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:55,790
It's a legitimate question. We're going to go through some definitions, but then we can talk about what it what it means to us,

203
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,980
and we're impacted in many different ways as groups, as individuals.

204
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:12,400
However, we define ourselves right citizens of a country, members of a university community, right, whatever it might be.

205
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,630
So there are some real definitions, just starting with policy.

206
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,790
What's what's the definition of a policy?

207
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:28,420
This from the Oxford Dictionary after I use my cursor here, up here, keep myself out of the way of the screen,

208
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:38,590
of course, or principle of action adopted or proposed by a government, party business or even an individual right.

209
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,260
So this is just a policy in itself, a definite course or method of action.

210
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:55,150
Selected from among different alternatives in light of given conditions that guide and determine present and future directions.

211
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:07,330
So using these as kind of definitions of what a policy might be, let's let's kind of apply, uh, what some examples of that could be.

212
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:15,040
So using that definition or those definitions provided to our policymakers,

213
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:27,360
what are some examples that you can think of and specifically that affect you in your daily life, what you might do?

214
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:35,010
Any kind of grew from like a homeowners association, the like. I mean, a school would take a whole tax policy or policy.

215
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:42,410
There you go. Absolutely. Good example. What else?

216
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:51,950
These don't have to be like elaborate or eloquent yet about the federal level, like state representatives and Congress are absolutely policymakers.

217
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:59,390
Sure, people in the county level who have mandating that we were not ever in the county.

218
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,030
Absolutely. Yeah. Or even at the university level, right?

219
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:08,610
I mean, we all have a mask on it right now, primarily because there is a university level policy for mask wearing.

220
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,770
But I saw hand further back and now.

221
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:20,640
And the others, yeah, it's also like the city level like I think about in our reporting and how there's a lot of really specific Yes.

222
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:32,580
Can't park here. Excellent example. So at the city level, for sure.

223
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:39,100
Any other? All right, good.

224
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:46,940
So, OK, so kind of taking it a step further. How would you environmental policies affect us?

225
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,800
Right. So we talked about some levels, some policy makers.

226
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Uh, what are some specific policies around environmental, health or environmental policies that affect us?

227
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,920
We we already talked about masks. That's a good specific example.

228
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah, I feel like this might not sound as one like, you know, smoking policies in public places.

229
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:17,830
Absolutely. Yeah. So smoking bans in a restaurant. And again, the university is not a good example, right?

230
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,520
In university buildings. That's a great example. That's right.

231
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:30,010
And then in the back. I'm just going to say that like air pollution limitation requirements and how much companies can

232
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,540
emit and that influences just air pollution in the city and how much people are exposed to it,

233
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,250
for sure. Great example.

234
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:44,650
Yeah, back here, you're not going to really enjoy just preventative things that we don't think about a company like fluoride and like water, for sure.

235
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,730
So fluorinated drinking municipal drinking water. Great example.

236
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,210
And then I was going to say fluoride. Okay, perfect. That's great.

237
00:26:53,210 --> 00:27:01,720
Yeah, because it's too like on food safety or like sanitation standards like when you go to a restaurant, you see that there's some level of quality.

238
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:10,410
Hopefully, yes. No, absolutely. You're right. There's there's quite a bit in terms of policies and regulations before for food safety.

239
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:17,940
Yeah, like land use rules in some places where you can't bring us to school, obviously.

240
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:27,540
Absolutely. No, but you're right, there's in many places, there are very well-intentioned and appropriate policies in place.

241
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:36,630
All right, great. OK, so then we talked about, you know, and the definition here, we've had some really good government examples.

242
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:42,090
We've had some non-government examples. Um, what about individuals, right?

243
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:53,160
So what what are our personal policies, I guess for me to kind of piggyback on one of the topics already, uh,

244
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:00,930
the mask wearing university says we have to wear a mask indoors here in the classroom, and I have one idea for that policy.

245
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:06,480
But my personal policy is when I go in the grocery store, I'm going to continue to wear a mask.

246
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:17,340
And again, it's in light of, you know, given conditions is the basis for why I went developing that, that personal policy.

247
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:23,970
We don't need to stay on the topic of masks. But do people have other other thoughts around kind of personal policies?

248
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:31,440
You don't even have to give your phone. It could be, you know, just a person. Yeah.

249
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:40,620
That it's like I don't need for review because it like carbon represents the restrictions because of their own personal.

250
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,970
Absolutely. So there's a lot of guidance right there that's out there from government agencies

251
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,890
or other non-government agencies around whether it's nutritional reasons,

252
00:28:52,890 --> 00:29:00,120
whether it's greenhouse gas emission reasons, right? But it's a personal policy on which choices you make.

253
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:09,880
Great example. Any others that folks they can think of like deciding to wear sunscreen and go to the beach like no one's making you do it,

254
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,880
but you might do to protect yourself? Absolutely perfect.

255
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,330
And any others. Yeah.

256
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,940
TerraCycle, sure, decisions are required if you're in your house.

257
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,620
Absolutely, yeah. Another good one.

258
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:36,560
So separating waste right here at the university, we've got a couple of staff writers, composers recycling or so forth.

259
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,650
Yeah, but those are those are in the end, those are kind of personal policies that inform our choices in our actions.

260
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:51,110
Great job. All right. So I'm going to go through I'll uh, I picked out this particular example.

261
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:57,000
So a lot of organizations have have the guiding principles.

262
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:07,580
Um, so this is not necessarily policies. They may be true policies where they kind of range into something that's more of a of a guidance.

263
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:15,770
And I pulled this one from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which is in London,

264
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:21,830
and they list on my website these these guiding principles of their organization.

265
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,810
So I'm just going to read them quickly.

266
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:31,010
Concerns for human health and well-being and the desire to improve this through appropriate environmental change and intervention

267
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:38,030
equity and the wish to promote the benefits of the environmental health approach to all members and sections of society,

268
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:46,700
including the most disadvantaged precaution, because it's believed that prevention of harm is better than cure.

269
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:56,720
A holistic approach because of the linkage between environmental, social and economic factors and their collective impact on health and well-being.

270
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:05,270
There's a couple more here. Sustainability and recognition of the need to create and maintain future conditions that will secure

271
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:11,360
health and well-being civic participation because of the requirement in environmental policy.

272
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:19,250
Recognize the role of public concerns and the need to maintain openness and transparency in decision making processes.

273
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:29,930
And then the recognition of the forces of globalization and the fact that environmental health problems don't respect borders that we make.

274
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:34,400
So these are verbatim from the organization's website.

275
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:43,310
I thought it's a great example. It kind of touches on a lot of the topics that we might be addressing in this course.

276
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:50,510
But it's not. It's not just this organization that has taken on these types of guiding principles.

277
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,410
These topics are more and more common. They're more and more in the forefront.

278
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:04,550
And more and more ranked as priorities and how organizations operate, regardless of what their role is in society,

279
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:12,770
what product they're producing, and in the case of a company or a corporation, what service they're providing, whatever it might be.

280
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:20,190
So health and welfare, right? And importantly, not only the absence of disease or illness, right?

281
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,650
Like, we've really worked hard to make sure to remove anything that's bad for you.

282
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:35,630
That's important, and that's admirable. But more broadly, just a general issue of social welfare equity,

283
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:42,140
as more and more prominent now in terms of considerations for guiding principles of organizations,

284
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,530
it ranks higher on the agenda of policymakers than it has previously.

285
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:59,570
This holistic approach? Right. So recognizing that there are direct links between the environment and social and economic factors, sustainability?

286
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,640
Right. Another one is very commonly now a higher priority.

287
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:18,440
So broadly, the consideration of the long term viability of something, a service of product, a plan or a principle and then civic participation.

288
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,760
So recognizing what's important to the public? Right.

289
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,440
Risk perception and risk communication, which we'll talk about later in the course,

290
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:35,400
are important and needed considerations with regard to civic participation.

291
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:46,890
So the Environmental Health Policy Framework comprises actions that are intended to eliminate the effects of exposure to environmental hazards.

292
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,870
One way to consider this kind of policy is to consider it's not only its uses,

293
00:33:51,870 --> 00:34:00,270
but its users and non-users, and it yields these by following considerations.

294
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:12,210
So directness, which applies to some policies that directly address environmental health and myriad,

295
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:18,720
gave an example of this a few moments ago where she talked about air quality standards that are in place very direct.

296
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:27,270
In that case, simply the level of government and policies span the spectrum of government.

297
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,310
You all gave various examples. People talked about a federal policy.

298
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:38,820
There was a state policy. We talked about a city policy and county policy.

299
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,960
Actually, we did a really good job. We went through and hit it right most of the common levels of government.

300
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,480
But this is a really important consideration around framework.

301
00:34:51,480 --> 00:35:03,150
The primary strategy and these these can vary, but the goal might be to, for example, directly reduce the hazard and its effects.

302
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:16,020
Or it may simply be around awareness rate like health health information that's promoted considering the prime factor in the policy,

303
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:24,090
and there are often several of them around most environmental, health and policy issues.

304
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:31,260
This almost always includes a government agency component, but also private parties.

305
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:42,360
A lot of times it's like it's industry or private companies, but it might be something like a professional society or even an individual person.

306
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,640
Especially when we get into areas of expertize, we'll talk about that here in a minute as well.

307
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,430
And then another important consideration is what doesn't get regulated.

308
00:35:53,430 --> 00:36:02,070
And as we're going to learn in this class, there's actually quite a bit with with strong contention or argument that it should be regulated.

309
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:10,590
But there's a really big list of stuff things, items, so forth, processes that aren't regulated.

310
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,080
And the example here is just residential indoor air.

311
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:23,530
Right. We talked about the homeowners associations or some policy in an apartment building that you live in and so forth.

312
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,320
For the most part, you don't you don't have a choice right under those kind, especially if you are renting it.

313
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:37,590
You can't make alterations, but you could be exposed to what you see as unsafe levels of poor indoor air quality.

314
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:48,980
There aren't standards in place for him to protect people in residential settings in terms of air quality levels.

315
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:58,490
Any questions on on these last couple of slides in terms of guiding principles and then kind of the framework around it?

316
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:03,500
And and apologies if it feels like we're going to bounce around a little bit.

317
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:10,580
And if you feel like the dots are not connecting, try not to be too anxious or worry about it.

318
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:16,530
My goal is that once we get them laid out that they will start to connect and kind of make sense.

319
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:22,780
But but back to back to this. Any questions on these last few slides?

320
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:33,100
All right, good. So let's move on specifically to those roles of government with regards to environmental health policy.

321
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:39,190
So in the U.S., and we're going to also bounce back and forth.

322
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:44,650
A lot of examples and applications are going to be within this country within the US.

323
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:55,930
But we will look at a global or international organizations, whether it's other countries or other entities that exist internationally.

324
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:07,420
In the U.S., we've got three levels. We've got basically we consider it a triad, federal level, the state level and then local governments, right?

325
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:19,300
Whether they're depending on where you're where you live or where you're at could include county, city, township and so forth.

326
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:33,780
But in the U.S., all three within this triad are essential in order for an effective environmental health programs and policies.

327
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,110
So for the US federal government,

328
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:47,910
it's actually interesting local and state governments in many cases pre-dated federal involvement in environmental health policies.

329
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,500
So, for example,

330
00:38:49,500 --> 00:39:00,090
there were small villages they took action to protect their water supplies before there was any type of federal policy or regulation in place.

331
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:06,780
Another one is and we have some specific examples that we're talked about in this course is the state of California.

332
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,250
Anyone from California by chance? No, OK. Often there is.

333
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:18,030
Um, California just historically has been, you know, much more progressive on many,

334
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:27,480
many issues around environmental health in terms of identifying problems, addressing them and developing policies and regulations to address them.

335
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,090
And in many cases, are ahead of federal policies at the national level.

336
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:44,460
And so coming back to air pollution, so air pollution control programs existed in California specifically before they did at the national level.

337
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:52,470
Over time, the federal government has basically achieved primacy or basically kind of ultimate

338
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:59,640
control or oversight over these environmental health policies at the national level.

339
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:10,500
It it took a while, but it was through this slow recognition that environmental hazards don't respect local boundaries, right?

340
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:17,070
Whether they're state boundaries. And again, the really easy example is air pollution.

341
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:23,230
So this is where and we'll talk about some of these legislative acts that have come into play

342
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:30,060
that control and address and develop policy standards and regulations around these issues.

343
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,820
So it's federal primacy that's in place.

344
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:42,600
That's where the oversight is, but it's working really closely in cooperation with individual states, and that's the only way that it works.

345
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:50,580
Federal programs have more recently recently been in the last couple of decades,

346
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:57,300
directly coordinated with international environmental organizations around.

347
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:05,220
And again, with the same concept recognizing that many of these environmental threats don't recognize national borders,

348
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:15,220
either in the same way that they don't recognize state borders. All right, so moving to state level governments, so state governments.

349
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:25,480
Do you have a really important responsibility for controlling environmental hazards for states, even though there's federal policies in place?

350
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:34,240
The states are the ones that are tasked with the responsibility to actually implement those federal standards.

351
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:44,740
And the example here is the federal Clean Air Act. So there are air national air quality standards that are in place through the Clean Air Act,

352
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:56,380
but it's up to individual states to actually monitor their air to make sure that the levels of air quality are meeting the federal standards, right?

353
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:02,290
There's no one from the federal government that's going around checking in various states around the country.

354
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:13,600
The responsibility is is lies with the states to actually implement those national level clean air standards.

355
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,250
There's other specific state jurisdictions.

356
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:28,780
A really easy one here, for example, is the allowable limit of blood alcohol for drivers of motor vehicles.

357
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:34,360
This varies greatly from one state to the next.

358
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:43,600
And then we're going to talk about this in a minute. But at the state level, where you will find most of these programs that that implement policies,

359
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:49,630
address policies are found either in like a state health department,

360
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,340
maybe a division of environmental health,

361
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:59,830
even more specifically within a state health department or in something that's called like a the Department of Environmental Quality in Michigan.

362
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,880
It's really confusing.

363
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:12,550
We have something like the latter, and it's called Acronym Eagle, the Department of Great Energy, Great Lakes and the environment.

364
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,740
Something like that, right?

365
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:25,480
And it changes every whoever the governor comes up with a new name, they call it, and they change all the signage and letterhead and so forth.

366
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,950
But anyway, that's usually where when it comes to environmental health policy at the state level,

367
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,390
it usually lies within a state health department or within a Department of Environmental

368
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:40,390
Quality or even in Department of Natural Resources and then local government.

369
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,690
Right.

370
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:51,220
So this is going to be, generally speaking, county and city health departments that might handle a suite of various environmental health problems.

371
00:43:51,220 --> 00:44:03,970
They similarly to state and federal level coordination, a county or a city is coordinating with that state that they're within to coordinate programs.

372
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:11,980
As John mentioned, food and sanitation inspections generally happen at this very local level at a county or city level.

373
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,660
Things like pest control, um, regular audits, right?

374
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:24,650
Like inspectors, these types of things are happening very much, though at the local level.

375
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:36,380
And then here are some specific examples, actually, of the types of programs or issues that are directly managed at the local level.

376
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:44,210
So 91 percent of the time issues around food protection are handled at the local level.

377
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:50,270
A high percent of nuisance control. Things like sewage treatment, private, well, testing, right.

378
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,920
We talked about municipal drinking water.

379
00:44:51,920 --> 00:45:00,230
And there's also people that have private wells on their land as their source of drinking water swimming pool inspections,

380
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,480
right, and emergency response.

381
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:15,840
You know, generally speaking, these are handled in good examples of local level services or implementation of policies and programs.

382
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:24,390
All right, so let's go ahead and move on any questions about the concept of this trial of government, federal, state,

383
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:38,080
local and kind of the interplay of all three and how they as a framework coordinate across in order to implement policies or comments even.

384
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:45,280
Yeah. Are there consequences of the state governments aren't following the federal programs,

385
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,070
like for the Clean Air Act, like making sure that they're actually doing great question.

386
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:57,400
Yeah, really good question. And it's that's a good example to I'm going to answer with that example.

387
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,770
So there's a federal Clean Air Act.

388
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:11,440
Let's say there's six different national, uh, criteria pollutants that have air quality standards associated with them.

389
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,790
I talked about some of my research on the first day of class around particulate matter particles that are in the air,

390
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,770
so their air quality standards for ppm that need to be met.

391
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:29,170
And if the levels, let's say, in Ann Arbor are above that level,

392
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:35,470
it's up to the state to be monitoring in Ann Arbor to make sure that the levels are below the standard.

393
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:46,300
But if they happen to go over that level, it's up to the state to come up with something that's called a state implementation plan or a sip.

394
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,590
And I'm really going to as much as I can avoid the acronyms because we'll kill ourselves

395
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:55,480
and this class on this topic if we allow ourselves to go too crazy with acronyms.

396
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,040
But there's a lot for them. So the state implementation plan, the federal government EPA in this case,

397
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,710
the Environmental Protection Agency requires the state of Michigan in that case to submit

398
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:10,990
an implementation plan that says these are the levels of air quality in Ann Arbor.

399
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:21,550
The PM is above this standard and this is how we're we're going to reduce the levels of PM to meet that air quality standard.

400
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:26,180
It might include vehicle testing, emissions testing.

401
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,700
Right. So in order to get your car registered annually,

402
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:40,990
you need to go to a certified auto distributor auto shop to have your vehicle tested to meet the emission standards.

403
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,250
Without that, perhaps, and this is actually the truth.

404
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:51,280
Cars run inefficiently. Their emissions control is not working very well.

405
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,270
And so there's higher levels of pollution being emitted, resulting in local levels of higher concentrations in a city like Ann Arbor.

406
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:05,980
So that might make sense. There might be other restrictions that the state is going to put on.

407
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:12,850
If someone is, let's say, proposing, I don't know, a waste incinerator near Ann Arbor.

408
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:17,620
Part of that plan might be to specifically identify proposed land use.

409
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,690
This kind of gets back to land use, right?

410
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:27,640
We're not going to allow any new industry to be built that's going to contribute to those ppm levels because we're trying to get,

411
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,440
you know, get the levels below. So this might all be part of a state implementation plan.

412
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,630
And it's often not immediate, right?

413
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:43,240
This is maybe like a multi-year plan to try to reduce the pollution levels to come entertainment with the standard it submitted to EPA, EPA reviews.

414
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,350
It gives feedback and either says, Yeah, that looks good.

415
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:56,380
Get to work or says, You know what? Uh, we have a bunch of expert scientists here and we've all reviewed it and you're never going to.

416
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:01,030
You're never going to make it. You need to do more than this. So that would be kind of the process.

417
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,280
And then the monitoring continues.

418
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:13,120
So there's monitoring in Ann Arbor of the quality of the air to track to see if that if that implementation plan is being effective or not.

419
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:20,800
Great question. Any others?

420
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,360
All right, how are we doing on time?

421
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:29,200
Let's see a couple of minutes and then we'll go ahead and do our break that I promised you we would have class period.

422
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,710
So environmental health policy. There are a lot of factors that can influence it, right?

423
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:44,650
And there's a lot of different ways that we might consider identifying or quantifying which factors can can influence that.

424
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:49,150
And hopefully, some of this material is looking familiar from the reading list.

425
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:57,040
You know, I'm I'm not having you read stuff just for the heck of it. But as you can imagine, we can't cover everything just within our class period.

426
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:04,600
So I'm trying to to present on the most important issues, but that I think are important around these topics.

427
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,840
But the readings, that's actually a good point.

428
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:16,480
I had a question after class last week and then some questions from folks since last week about the readings.

429
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,400
Kind of like, you know, do we have to do them? How important are they? Are they going to be on the exam, that kind of stuff, right?

430
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,870
Which are great questions and that's specific to this class, right?

431
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:33,340
So yes, please do the readings and they are part of the way the course is designed.

432
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:40,600
I can't present everything in the, you know, the two hours that we have each week really do the readings.

433
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:49,720
They should help you to learn and understand the material that is being presented and being discussed in class.

434
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:55,270
Am I going to write on the, you know, write an exam that says, OK,

435
00:50:55,270 --> 00:51:04,150
the only person that could possibly come up with the ratings and answer to this question is someone who read Chapter five age twenty seven.

436
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:09,070
The last paragraph at the bottom of the page happened to mention some random factoid.

437
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:15,910
That's not my goal, and that's the reading assignment is that I'm going to test you on random things.

438
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:20,050
I'm hoping that they are supportive of the material that we're discussing in class.

439
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:29,260
So yes, it is. It is really important to get through those readings kind of prior to class, similarly, which we get later into this semester.

440
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,980
Into our class discussions are student led class discussions.

441
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:38,620
There's going to be a group of students, is leading the class in a discussion and are going to be prompting the class with questions,

442
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:48,130
right or some similar sort of activity. And if the rest of the students haven't done the readings, that discussion is not going to go very well.

443
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:59,440
So, yeah, totally try to come prepared, do the readings more for comprehension and not for memorization of of, you know, random fact.

444
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,970
All right. So with that, I've gone long enough with with gathering. Let's do our our five minute break.

445
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:13,030
OK, I've got one fifty three on my phone. Let's let's round up and say, let's meet back in the classroom.

446
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,910
You can totally stay here. If you want to take a break, that's fine.

447
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:59,689
Let's meet back and reconvene right at two o'clock and we'll continue on with the material.

448
00:53:07,115 --> 00:53:11,255
All right, let's go ahead and get started.

449
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:20,315
So when we talk about these factors, we put them into groups and they're represented up here in this very basic, uh, diagram.

450
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:25,715
Seven factors specifically. And we're going to go ahead and step through each one.

451
00:53:25,715 --> 00:53:32,835
And importantly, try to identify some, some examples of what of what these might be.

452
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:42,385
So starting with the public's concern, right, so in general, people who make policy, uh,

453
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:50,835
at least want to be open or responsive to concerns shared from the world, from the public.

454
00:53:50,835 --> 00:54:06,515
So what are some examples in this case in this topic of public concern and how it might be a contributing factor influencing policy making?

455
00:54:06,515 --> 00:54:12,495
I feel like nowadays we're not very concerned, but like example, my food safety is like Upton, Sinclair wrote The Jungle,

456
00:54:12,495 --> 00:54:19,125
which is not like Chicago meatpacking industry, which then everyone freaked out about pass legislation.

457
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:28,155
OK. So in response to right up to food safety of the people that are in the position to make policy are,

458
00:54:28,155 --> 00:54:33,855
in this case, responsive right to concerns that were shared from the public, for example.

459
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:38,115
What else can folks think of that water crisis? Yeah, flint water.

460
00:54:38,115 --> 00:54:39,225
Absolutely right.

461
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:49,095
So that was actually the public holding up, you know, clear bottles of water or glasses of water and saying, Look, we just want the color of it.

462
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:56,655
And of course, led to much else that triggered, um, policy, uh,

463
00:54:56,655 --> 00:55:02,385
assessments of whether standards are being met and then actions or reactions in that case.

464
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:10,155
So we're going to we're going to talk quite a bit as a whole case study and student led discussion on the case of Flint Water.

465
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:15,645
A really good example. Any others an area foul on that same?

466
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:27,925
No. Just like a movie like Dark Waters highlighted by an issue in like West Virginia, where a lot of my girls.

467
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:39,675
But they were affected also by a lot of water issues and contamination from the chemicals out of.

468
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:48,285
Right. Great example, again, where it's really the public right citizenry, that's bringing this issue to notice.

469
00:55:48,285 --> 00:55:54,185
And the others. All right, those are good.

470
00:55:54,185 --> 00:56:06,845
So, yeah, so public concern concerns from the public are one factor for sure that can influence ultimately how environmental health policy is shaped.

471
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:16,395
Ideally, it's an important factor, right? Not always the case, but we hope that it will be special interest.

472
00:56:16,395 --> 00:56:24,755
Right. So this is a lot of times with the negative component to it or connotation to it and for good reason.

473
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:38,525
But it's actually a necessary component. There are specific points of view relative to a particular issue where special interests come into play.

474
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:43,295
So what would be what would be some examples that folks can think of around special

475
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:57,165
interests and how they might impact or influence environmental health policy?

476
00:56:57,165 --> 00:57:02,635
Yeah. Oil companies. That's for sure.

477
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:16,195
So a lot of, I guess, is industry industries through lobbying and perhaps right might be influencing how policy around a particular environmental

478
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:28,225
health issue is shaped because that's the direction of that policy could directly impact the profitability of a company,

479
00:57:28,225 --> 00:57:32,245
something like that. Yeah, it's trying to think of a more positive example.

480
00:57:32,245 --> 00:57:36,535
Maybe this is a bit like PETA. Unlike animal rights.

481
00:57:36,535 --> 00:57:41,605
I'm sure the food industry or even, I guess, like individual species.

482
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:45,145
And maybe it's not great, but it's a it's a very good example.

483
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:53,125
Yeah. So there are many advocacy organizations of all different types, right?

484
00:57:53,125 --> 00:58:00,535
That that's their focus, right? Is a particular topic. And so almost by definition, that's their special interest, right?

485
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:05,665
So when there's an environmental health policy issue in that topic?

486
00:58:05,665 --> 00:58:06,445
Absolutely.

487
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:17,545
That organization is going to have special interests that can that can be a factor in shaping how that environmental health policy comes out.

488
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:25,375
Yeah. Where the farm organizations that are focused on promoting equity for disadvantaged people, would that be considered special interest?

489
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:33,775
Absolutely. Sure. It if you went to their web page and read, you know what they're about, what their mission is,

490
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:39,595
they're going to define it, basically saying that that that our interest is in promoting this.

491
00:58:39,595 --> 00:58:46,725
Uh, so yeah, that's almost by definition what a special interest group is.

492
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:57,235
Those are good examples. Yeah. It means our organization says something like this men and women, organizations and Typekit and stuff like that.

493
00:58:57,235 --> 00:59:01,215
We're like countries. Sure.

494
00:59:01,215 --> 00:59:08,255
Absolutely. So that could be, um, give you an a couple of different directions.

495
00:59:08,255 --> 00:59:16,945
Yeah. What were you thinking? Water quality, deforestation like ecosystem diversity in San Francisco?

496
00:59:16,945 --> 00:59:22,545
Yeah, so those are great. So as a as an industry, right,

497
00:59:22,545 --> 00:59:31,245
the health of the fishery system is that industry is reliant on that healthy fishery system in order for them to have to be,

498
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:33,405
you know, profitable, right?

499
00:59:33,405 --> 00:59:44,005
And to have it be replenished and managed successfully and their policies in many cases to help maintain the health of that fishery.

500
00:59:44,005 --> 00:59:52,235
In. And the others, he's a really good.

501
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:56,555
All right, moving on to the next factor. This is a fun one.

502
00:59:56,555 --> 01:00:05,855
News and social media uh, and you know, historically, even traditionally, uh,

503
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:12,305
news agencies, social media serve a really important role in informing the public.

504
01:00:12,305 --> 01:00:17,195
Uh, and have the ability to shape opinion.

505
01:00:17,195 --> 01:00:24,995
They can have a very direct, subsequent and or direct effect on an environmental health policy outcome.

506
01:00:24,995 --> 01:00:38,455
What are some examples that come to mind with regards to news, indoor social media and.

507
01:00:38,455 --> 01:00:46,855
Yeah, first use of Agent Orange and like look like more balls and used in Oregon as like an herbicide.

508
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:56,225
And I know that there is a lot of controversy around activists who are like releasing information and trying to get accountability for so.

509
01:00:56,225 --> 01:01:00,215
So that was a very, very good example.

510
01:01:00,215 --> 01:01:04,265
Yes. Yeah. It's like a very local example,

511
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:13,605
but in my town there's a landfill right by the elementary schools and our like local paper always like report something like updates about it,

512
01:01:13,605 --> 01:01:21,485
like any sort of legal action that's been going on for sure, really mobilized a lot of people to try and like, regulate the emissions more.

513
01:01:21,485 --> 01:01:25,295
But yeah, there's another great, great example, right?

514
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:31,025
And I kind of like the examples you gave are are the more traditional newspaper?

515
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:41,975
Right? And so, you know, going back decades prior to the internet, basically, you know, traditional journalism included investigative reporting.

516
01:01:41,975 --> 01:01:47,375
Right. So there are journalists who you typically have some education or some background right around different

517
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:55,415
topics and you dig in and you identify and kind of connect dots and raise issues to the public.

518
01:01:55,415 --> 01:02:04,025
Right. And this is where it does help to to shape, to inform as well as to shape opinions.

519
01:02:04,025 --> 01:02:07,505
What about some examples of examples? Go ahead. Do you have another one?

520
01:02:07,505 --> 01:02:11,145
Oh, you're involved in social media? Yeah, that's what I was going to prompt is like what?

521
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:16,625
What are some specifically around social media get a bit more modern day for better or for worse?

522
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:19,715
There's a lot of good examples of people being concerned about climate change and social media.

523
01:02:19,715 --> 01:02:28,985
But then there's like people who are worried about like chem trails or like 5G cell towers, which like, I guess, is environmental health.

524
01:02:28,985 --> 01:02:34,875
If you consider, like, not quite there. Yeah, so absolutely.

525
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:41,675
So those topics and there's a lot actually right now on social media,

526
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:51,395
this isn't even one that I think it was late last night or this morning that every airline has basically backing the Biden administration

527
01:02:51,395 --> 01:03:03,545
to step in right and hold the launch of 5G there and surrounding airports because of concerns around aviation safety influencing or,

528
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:12,755
you know, adversely impacting the ability of of aircraft to land and take off and the altimeters and all of these things that they rely upon.

529
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,705
Two things for me for news.

530
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:20,825
I think a big part of it, too, is where you get your news because some sources, you know, being full after looking to the right.

531
01:03:20,825 --> 01:03:24,335
So I feel like that is a big influence. And then also, as we've seen that,

532
01:03:24,335 --> 01:03:29,135
a lot of fake news that spread around and that can create issues and a lack of like a

533
01:03:29,135 --> 01:03:32,945
disconnect between what's actually happening and what they think is happening now.

534
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:37,655
And that's a that's a great thank you for bringing that forward.

535
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:39,845
Right? This is not in your text.

536
01:03:39,845 --> 01:03:52,745
Uh, in what you're reading through from any traditional historical source or a knowledge base on this topic, that's a very recent problem, right?

537
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,535
Just in the last few years. Um yes.

538
01:03:55,535 --> 01:04:03,605
The way you prefaced it and kind of your prior comment, as has always been the case so that an investigative journalist,

539
01:04:03,605 --> 01:04:08,105
right, already has kind of like their own interest in their own slant on something.

540
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:12,875
So what they investigate and what they bring to light and what they highlight is a little bit

541
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:17,795
shaped on like their own views of what they what they think is most important around this issue,

542
01:04:17,795 --> 01:04:22,685
right? So it's going to be impacted and you're going to have one journalist come up with one

543
01:04:22,685 --> 01:04:27,125
viewpoint and you might have another journalist come up with a different viewpoint.

544
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:35,305
And both of them are legitimate, right, and deserve to be consumed as information.

545
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:47,015
I mean, recently, we have very purposeful distribution of information that is purposely false and misleading.

546
01:04:47,015 --> 01:04:56,765
This is a huge challenge to any policy making, but but very clearly to policy policymaking around environmental health.

547
01:04:56,765 --> 01:05:04,265
And so, you know, I'm going to invite you to you guys probably are even better informed than I am about, you know,

548
01:05:04,265 --> 01:05:14,195
what type of misinformation or disinformation is is out there in large quantity and how it's

549
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:20,495
impacting specific to this class issues that are on policy related to environmental health.

550
01:05:20,495 --> 01:05:27,155
So thanks for raising that one there. Any other any other examples or comments?

551
01:05:27,155 --> 01:05:30,015
Yeah, just kind of all on social media.

552
01:05:30,015 --> 01:05:36,785
It's interesting how it starts to branch into like public public concerns, experts inputs and then special interest groups,

553
01:05:36,785 --> 01:05:43,025
all of those just because of people's ability to just go online and start to share their own stories.

554
01:05:43,025 --> 01:05:49,725
Like, at least I have to take time, which we can touch on them reasonably well.

555
01:05:49,725 --> 01:05:55,605
Like I follow native or First Nations folks who are talking about safe water.

556
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:58,905
Things like that. And so they're not technically experts,

557
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:06,015
but they are like public members of the public who have a certain level of knowledge revolution that you do this and so forth.

558
01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:10,335
So that's like, on the one hand, it's like they could be spreading false information,

559
01:06:10,335 --> 01:06:15,485
but also these folks who have not be able to get out their voice nowadays.

560
01:06:15,485 --> 01:06:19,705
Yeah, yeah. That's a great a great context.

561
01:06:19,705 --> 01:06:26,565
I mean, thanks for presenting it that way. You're making your statement that way because it's 100 percent true, right?

562
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:36,165
And I think you would ask that of any designer, of any social media platform, as they would say, that was the purpose of creating it, right?

563
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:41,685
Is that what we can? We can get good stuff out there that spreads more quickly and the people have

564
01:06:41,685 --> 01:06:51,405
access to you and can share and have it evolve even through online discussion.

565
01:06:51,405 --> 01:06:56,745
And it's all for public good, right? And individual good.

566
01:06:56,745 --> 01:07:02,145
But right, as we've as we've discussed it, you know, it doesn't always go in that direction.

567
01:07:02,145 --> 01:07:11,115
But yeah, thank you. That's great. Any others and we don't we're not, you know, we're kind of introducing these right as components,

568
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:14,745
different kind of classification of factors that influence environmental policy.

569
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:23,825
We're going to be discussing them all semester long. Next up is experts input,

570
01:07:23,825 --> 01:07:31,085
so our findings and recommendations from experts that can contribute to or

571
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:35,075
influence the formation of environmental health policy or what it looks like.

572
01:07:35,075 --> 01:07:44,445
What are some examples that come to mind in that regard? Yeah,

573
01:07:44,445 --> 01:07:50,205
I think about how like a lot of times the experts and sort of in terms of like researchers

574
01:07:50,205 --> 01:07:56,055
are like maybe like medical professionals will testify to Congress about different issues.

575
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:59,685
And that's like how the policy is shaped based on what they're saying.

576
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:05,325
And most important, I like why it's an issue in the first place that needs to be addressed in the policy.

577
01:08:05,325 --> 01:08:08,535
Sure. Right. So and you gave a great example for the mechanism, right?

578
01:08:08,535 --> 01:08:18,915
For how, uh, how expert input actually is facilitated or able to be contributed to informing policy.

579
01:08:18,915 --> 01:08:23,205
Great example of just kind of more unique than just like a journal.

580
01:08:23,205 --> 01:08:31,965
But as part of the settlement with I believe DuPont was a big people's exposure in Pennsylvania.

581
01:08:31,965 --> 01:08:41,745
I could be wrong, but the Great eight science panel, and so they pretty much funded these five researchers give or so like for the next like 10 years,

582
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:47,625
do studies on CIA people and like they've kind of been slowly releasing all their findings,

583
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:53,685
which I think is kind of unique, quiet, like get an expert. And but yeah, great example.

584
01:08:53,685 --> 01:08:59,925
That's awesome. Yes. So they might want to try and give me an idea like the classic example and original versions.

585
01:08:59,925 --> 01:09:10,215
But once I was really sure like, um, like writing and producing books that people can read right to understand information.

586
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:13,495
Yes. No. That's that's a perfect example, right?

587
01:09:13,495 --> 01:09:23,115
So it's information from an expert, but it's distributed purposefully right for a more general audience.

588
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:31,985
Great example. And the others that come to mind.

589
01:09:31,985 --> 01:09:37,145
All right. Domestic economic policies.

590
01:09:37,145 --> 01:09:46,325
So how does this come into play so impacts and considerations for free market economies?

591
01:09:46,325 --> 01:09:54,595
How would these be factors that could influence the outcome of the environmental health policy?

592
01:09:54,595 --> 01:10:01,465
Yes, I want to play the. I mean, like the whole economic policy is kind of like the sea that we all this.

593
01:10:01,465 --> 01:10:05,545
This is the context for, like a lot of any kind of culture of analysis.

594
01:10:05,545 --> 01:10:12,415
But I think a lot of the original like led guidance, they originally wanted to set a much lower level,

595
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:18,565
but for like federal housing and like indoor paint lab limits.

596
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:25,705
And they wanted to set a lower level than what it is, but they realized that the seven to a zero or like slightly less than zero.

597
01:10:25,705 --> 01:10:30,525
They would not be able to spend the money to repaint old buildings and hit the unattainable.

598
01:10:30,525 --> 01:10:34,975
So sure. Yeah. So there's there's uh.

599
01:10:34,975 --> 01:10:40,555
And this this is a challenge in a lot of implementation of scientific data,

600
01:10:40,555 --> 01:10:44,845
like when you talk about data driven policies that relies on real scientific research,

601
01:10:44,845 --> 01:10:50,545
um, it's actually pretty common going back to our our particulate matter standard.

602
01:10:50,545 --> 01:10:56,935
We have a national air quality standard for levels of ppm that's allowed in the air.

603
01:10:56,935 --> 01:11:04,195
There's a huge scientific literature showing adverse impacts on health from exposure to ppm.

604
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:14,215
That's well below that standard level, right? So, yeah, so your example around when it should be zero because there is no safe exposure, right?

605
01:11:14,215 --> 01:11:19,615
Even at a very low level, we know that it's going to have adverse impacts.

606
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:24,025
But what's what's economically practical to implement as a policy?

607
01:11:24,025 --> 01:11:29,665
Really good example. Any others that folks can think of?

608
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:35,335
One, two three. Go ahead. I'm pointing almost in the same direction.

609
01:11:35,335 --> 01:11:41,275
Sorry about that. I think for renewable energy and stuff, an issue is that it's not really profitable.

610
01:11:41,275 --> 01:11:47,665
It's self-sustaining, which is the point. But then, you know, the good gas and oil, if they have profits that come from that,

611
01:11:47,665 --> 01:11:52,375
but there's not really profits, which is why is like even harder to implement that policy.

612
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:58,525
There's no incentive. Sure. Yeah. Great example going back here.

613
01:11:58,525 --> 01:12:06,325
Kind of look at the weak national policies. So like I was thinking of like those limits you're talking about on automobiles,

614
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:11,815
of how many politicians like I know in Massachusetts, I have very specific policies around that.

615
01:12:11,815 --> 01:12:21,865
But you wouldn't really be having someone in Michigan because the impact you can have on industry here is actually even further back when.

616
01:12:21,865 --> 01:12:26,365
Yeah, yeah, it could be crippling local economy. Excellent. Excellent point.

617
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:34,645
It's going to talk about workplace safety standards even in the workplace themselves, like exposure to chemicals,

618
01:12:34,645 --> 01:12:41,375
but also like obviously going back like, you know, with child labor, like age limitations.

619
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:47,395
Just like. Great, great examples, and actually,

620
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:55,785
that reminds me I have some natural bias like my my research interests are more on kind of the community environmental side,

621
01:12:55,785 --> 01:13:03,255
right, and less on the workplace side. And generally speaking, I don't want to assign people.

622
01:13:03,255 --> 01:13:10,155
For the most part, student interest often lies more as well and that kind of community environmental space.

623
01:13:10,155 --> 01:13:14,745
So I might challenge you as I challenge myself to try to be mindful.

624
01:13:14,745 --> 01:13:19,875
And when we're thinking about different examples on all of these considerations throughout the semester,

625
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:29,025
don't forget about the workplace, whether they're occupational health policies that might be in place to protect workers.

626
01:13:29,025 --> 01:13:33,345
But we do have a case study specific on that that we're going to tackle over the course of this semester,

627
01:13:33,345 --> 01:13:42,135
and we'll talk about some, some agencies and bodies that directly inform our workplace health and safety.

628
01:13:42,135 --> 01:13:46,495
But yeah, thank you for that. That's a really good example. All right.

629
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:52,905
And then I think this is the last of the seven free trade policies.

630
01:13:52,905 --> 01:14:00,825
So the in this case, the impact of free trade on environmental and public health protections.

631
01:14:00,825 --> 01:14:15,515
So how could this come into play as a factor that could influence an environmental health policy outcome?

632
01:14:15,515 --> 01:14:20,165
I've given a lot of cases we end up outsourcing our pollution in the sense of, I mean,

633
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:26,765
obviously it's good for us to pass like stringent environmental quality so that we're not poisoning ourselves

634
01:14:26,765 --> 01:14:31,775
but doesn't solve the problem of established manufacturers stuff here we manufacture in another country.

635
01:14:31,775 --> 01:14:38,825
A lot of people are exposed. Yeah. And that, I mean, you just distilled it in like a 30 second explanation.

636
01:14:38,825 --> 01:14:44,515
But that in itself is like an entire course, basically as a topic to tackle.

637
01:14:44,515 --> 01:14:50,225
It's it's something that's evolved again over the last couple of decades, primarily.

638
01:14:50,225 --> 01:14:57,365
This country is a great example, right? We used to manufacture a ton of stuff that was really dirty to produce.

639
01:14:57,365 --> 01:15:01,295
Right? It might be an occupational exposure hazard.

640
01:15:01,295 --> 01:15:03,695
It might contaminate communities.

641
01:15:03,695 --> 01:15:12,875
And because of environmental statutes, standard regulations that are put in across the board, it costs more to do that here.

642
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:20,585
So as companies are going from smaller companies to being like multinational corporations,

643
01:15:20,585 --> 01:15:29,285
just from a cost perspective that much of that production and manufacturing has been outsourced to other countries where those

644
01:15:29,285 --> 01:15:37,925
protections are not in place either from a worker health and safety perspective or from a community environmental perspective.

645
01:15:37,925 --> 01:15:44,165
And so, yeah, so that term kind of outsourcing the pollution, it's still there.

646
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:50,825
It's still affecting, in many cases, the global environment. It hasn't really changed anything on those equations,

647
01:15:50,825 --> 01:15:58,505
but it's shifted to the local communities that are impacted or the worker communities that are impacted.

648
01:15:58,505 --> 01:16:07,895
Great example. Any others that come to mind? All right.

649
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:12,935
That was that was great. I think we are now sorry, there's one more. Darn it.

650
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:23,405
Form of governance. So the amount of public input might vary depending on the type of government that's in place.

651
01:16:23,405 --> 01:16:43,725
Right. So how what are some examples of how a form of government might influence environmental health policies?

652
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:52,545
And the easiest example is coming from looking at different nations, basically.

653
01:16:52,545 --> 01:17:03,055
Yeah, I guess it depends on like the question of individual choices among those who were out so heavily.

654
01:17:03,055 --> 01:17:07,395
Even like Indian health services here or indigenous communities and.

655
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:15,465
Speak out and look at the people themselves. And how will it even.

656
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:22,135
They are actively violent towards indigenous communities like an individual political access pipeline,

657
01:17:22,135 --> 01:17:31,575
something that felt like if that's something different, if it's like state governments or state governments contribute.

658
01:17:31,575 --> 01:17:37,185
Indigenous. We need to talk about Native Hawaiians and the rest.

659
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:41,535
Sure. Yeah. Those are often examples.

660
01:17:41,535 --> 01:17:47,565
Thank you. Yeah, yeah. Anything else that comes to mind?

661
01:17:47,565 --> 01:17:54,165
As an example. Yeah, I think that type of leadership to it, if it's like a dictatorship or an older democracy.

662
01:17:54,165 --> 01:17:58,575
Yeah, that was when I was what I was trying to give give hints on.

663
01:17:58,575 --> 01:18:04,785
I think that's the easiest example, right? Is whatever we call it, a free country and open society.

664
01:18:04,785 --> 01:18:17,085
There's more opportunity for for that input, for that discussion to help influence policy, whereas in other government frameworks,

665
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:22,395
that is very much the way the government operates, is to is to kind of it,

666
01:18:22,395 --> 01:18:29,415
to squash any discussion, any mention, any attention to a particular issue and so forth.

667
01:18:29,415 --> 01:18:33,075
All right. Now I think we've made it through. Thanks for that. That was great.

668
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:40,185
Really good engagement, really great examples and ideas. Thanks for helping me work through that.

669
01:18:40,185 --> 01:18:45,855
So this is our summary. We kind of talked about we can try to classify, right,

670
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:48,915
instead of just randomly coming up with all kinds of things that we think try

671
01:18:48,915 --> 01:18:54,975
to classify them into groups of influence around environmental health policy.

672
01:18:54,975 --> 01:19:04,725
All right. Our last piece for today is looking at one specific, very specific model around environmental policy making,

673
01:19:04,725 --> 01:19:13,575
and we'll spend less time discussing it and have learned more through kind of a breakout session and some discussion here.

674
01:19:13,575 --> 01:19:25,515
So it's the P ACM model P ACM standing for pressure action, change and monitoring, right?

675
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:34,695
So this is a simplified flowchart of environmental policymaking, and it's a little bit circular, right?

676
01:19:34,695 --> 01:19:40,275
So we talked about some of these groups right now might be a special interest group.

677
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:46,695
Government agencies and making public concern that prompts in the first place

678
01:19:46,695 --> 01:19:54,135
brings attention to an issue and prompts some sort of monitoring data collection,

679
01:19:54,135 --> 01:20:00,975
information gathering of some sort to begin to address an issue.

680
01:20:00,975 --> 01:20:07,155
Based on that. The next step in this process is pressure, right?

681
01:20:07,155 --> 01:20:17,655
So it might come from environmental organizations, community based organizations or groups like the business interest rate where companies,

682
01:20:17,655 --> 01:20:28,065
corporations and the private nature come into play to put pressure that results in some sort of action.

683
01:20:28,065 --> 01:20:32,745
The action might be very formal statutes, ordinances,

684
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:43,995
volunteerism that if they're implemented effectively resulting in some sort of change right might be a change in health practices.

685
01:20:43,995 --> 01:20:55,305
Changes in the quality of different environmental components could be related to gains politically could be improvements in cost of operations.

686
01:20:55,305 --> 01:21:02,145
Um, different perceptions could be changing along the way in terms of in a public in the community.

687
01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:07,065
And it's a little bit circular, right in a kind of comes back around to, OK,

688
01:21:07,065 --> 01:21:16,935
we need to continue to monitor and document that, uh, real improvements where change is actually happening, right?

689
01:21:16,935 --> 01:21:19,755
So it's a little bit cyclical in this way.

690
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:28,305
And so instead of just trying to understand it based on a model, let's take a little bit of an activity here and whatever.

691
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:32,715
And we already kind of talked about it just in that initial diagram.

692
01:21:32,715 --> 01:21:41,595
Pressure is often coming from different organizations or groups. Business insurance change monitoring.

693
01:21:41,595 --> 01:21:46,575
Here's the exercise. So and this is, you know, relatively low bar.

694
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:56,115
I'm hoping to be able to work through this and understand how this model could be applied to a specific example.

695
01:21:56,115 --> 01:22:04,855
So we're going to use the model described in the figure, and we're going to break out into groups here in a minute.

696
01:22:04,855 --> 01:22:11,085
And as part of your group, you are serving as community environmental activists.

697
01:22:11,085 --> 01:22:18,455
And how would you organize a campaign in your county to recycle household trash?

698
01:22:18,455 --> 01:22:27,885
Uh, you're all in Ann Arbor right now, and you probably realize that there are actually, um, residential recycling programs in place.

699
01:22:27,885 --> 01:22:37,005
There are many, many counties cities across the US that do not have residential recycling programs in place.

700
01:22:37,005 --> 01:22:41,085
So pretend you're in one of those and even where you're originally from, that's the case.

701
01:22:41,085 --> 01:22:47,605
Um, and kind of work through this specific model.

702
01:22:47,605 --> 01:22:59,095
Around how you would organize your campaign and how you could see this process benefiting your cause.

703
01:22:59,095 --> 01:23:10,675
OK, so I'm to looking at the time, it's 2:30. How about if we break into groups of one two, three three groups of four?

704
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:15,895
I'm going to let you self-select and have it, so you'd have to move around too much, right?

705
01:23:15,895 --> 01:23:20,695
So maybe like the four up here, the four in the back before over here, something is going to turn.

706
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:25,465
If you need to move a little bit, you're welcome to. But my goal wasn't to have you completely rearrange.

707
01:23:25,465 --> 01:23:30,175
Take 10 minutes as a group of four and kind of work through this.

708
01:23:30,175 --> 01:23:38,275
See what you come up with and we'll spend the last 10 minutes of the class giving each group a time to kind of report out with what they came up with.

709
01:23:38,275 --> 01:23:42,535
Any questions before we start? All right.

710
01:23:42,535 --> 01:24:07,951
Ready, set. Go. You know, I do like.

711
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:19,241
There was like a vulnerability remove wrappers sometimes, he said, All right,

712
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:26,151
let's go ahead and see where folks came up with and what if we go, at least from my vantage point clockwise.

713
01:24:26,151 --> 01:24:39,031
So start over here and kind of work our way around. So what your ACM model approach for tackling recycling of household trash?

714
01:24:39,031 --> 01:24:45,391
So we kind of focused on business involvement and using businesses to incentivize public.

715
01:24:45,391 --> 01:24:49,801
So we focused on first other happened in the coupon system,

716
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:58,341
the origin system that will incentivize to recycle more or having also recyclable or reusable take out materials from business.

717
01:24:58,341 --> 01:25:02,171
What kind of a restaurant? And then in regards to action,

718
01:25:02,171 --> 01:25:06,711
and we're talking about there being a statute from the county government that gives ratings

719
01:25:06,711 --> 01:25:11,721
for environmental friendliness of those restaurants and then not being publicly accessible,

720
01:25:11,721 --> 01:25:18,051
maybe not even making it sound like the restaurant has to put up a sign that just that people can go there easily.

721
01:25:18,051 --> 01:25:25,311
And then in regards to change, we focused on it. Community members have higher levels of recyclability, support poundage.

722
01:25:25,311 --> 01:25:30,801
And if there's more business going to companies with higher sustainability levels and then for a long term monitoring,

723
01:25:30,801 --> 01:25:34,731
we talked about a collaborative local business group and local government organization

724
01:25:34,731 --> 01:25:41,131
that allows for there to be feedback and communication between businesses and.

725
01:25:41,131 --> 01:25:48,651
Excellent. Nice work. Thank you. Let's come up here to this group.

726
01:25:48,651 --> 01:25:53,721
I guess we got to with more of like a traditional kind of grassroots activists kind of model.

727
01:25:53,721 --> 01:26:03,111
And so the monitoring to be like either just the realization that there isn't any kind of recycling in the group in the area or actually going out and

728
01:26:03,111 --> 01:26:11,331
comparing like a our city doesn't have recycling and sending over does would save X amount of trash being diverted from landfill by doing recycling.

729
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:16,791
And the pressure could be generated by solely organizing from either kind of just a Facebook

730
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:22,251
group kind of thing and actually creating a coalition through the table in general,

731
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:27,711
this kind of outreach efforts and then kind of the the action would be pressuring like

732
01:26:27,711 --> 01:26:31,821
the local city council to either passed an ordinance or create a recycling center.

733
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:38,661
And so you'd want to individually lobby them and also grow your political capital and your organization and actually get the action,

734
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:42,561
which would be like new recycling center, which ideally would work.

735
01:26:42,561 --> 01:26:45,591
But I'm kind of thinking you wouldn't want to immediately disband his stuff.

736
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:50,151
And so a lot of cities have, like a friends of the library, kind of dirty.

737
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:53,511
And so you probably may want to transition into like friends at the recycling center

738
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:57,291
group because oftentimes there's like backlash a couple of years down the line of like,

739
01:26:57,291 --> 01:27:05,061
Hey, my taxes are high. Let's define the recycling center. And so if you kind of build this band, you lose on a political organization.

740
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:09,551
And so you're monitoring back and saying there is X service working.

741
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:13,521
Right, right, right. Right. OK. Awesome. Thank you so much.

742
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:19,161
And last but not least, let's go to the group in the back. What all did you come up with?

743
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:22,251
Yeah. Our group have initiated a different approach.

744
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:27,651
We wanted to kind of monitor other communities to see if they were operating their own recycling process,

745
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:37,941
and we would then approach our local businesses, community members and our neighbors and kind of demonstrate that are you for a second program?

746
01:27:37,941 --> 01:27:43,411
And then with that, we found the pressure in the community are excitement.

747
01:27:43,411 --> 01:27:53,461
Instead of putting those ideas and recycling policies that the from for things to change their.

748
01:27:53,461 --> 01:27:58,561
And we continue to monitor the changes and hopefully improvements that result from it.

749
01:27:58,561 --> 01:28:07,721
I'm hoping to be able to encourage more people to participate in our program and also demonstrate that our.

750
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:15,101
Yeah, that's great. That's cool. Great. So thanks again for that, for working your way through that.

751
01:28:15,101 --> 01:28:15,881
I know that.

752
01:28:15,881 --> 01:28:24,731
I mean, the way that your background and the topics that you're studying, you know, you're well beyond recycling of household trash at this point.

753
01:28:24,731 --> 01:28:31,271
But, you know, taking it as a as an application for this model and you know,

754
01:28:31,271 --> 01:28:34,511
a lot of what a lot of what you're reading and a lot of what we're discussing in class over

755
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:41,381
the next couple of weeks is stuff that's maybe not necessarily new to you as a concept,

756
01:28:41,381 --> 01:28:51,371
right? It's more as a discipline. How do we kind of formally classify and organize as frameworks, right?

757
01:28:51,371 --> 01:28:59,471
And this is what helps us to actually tackle new problems that we don't have good solutions to.

758
01:28:59,471 --> 01:29:05,891
But if we can take a bit of a systematic or scientific approach to them following these frameworks,

759
01:29:05,891 --> 01:29:15,281
following these models, it can often lead to better outcomes in the end in terms of a final policy.

760
01:29:15,281 --> 01:29:27,981
So with that, we can go ahead and conclude before we do any questions about any of the material that we just discussed today in class.

761
01:29:27,981 --> 01:29:35,691
Either the presented material or pretty much anything else, the schedule and so forth.

762
01:29:35,691 --> 01:29:42,781
Yes. When we're spending on topics you want us to email to or surface on campus, if you guys are OK with that, just email it to me.

763
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:51,111
We're a small enough group that I don't want or whatever. I'd rather not complicate the canvas component.

764
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:58,401
I will. I'll stop posting announcements. I don't know. At first, it's like emailing 16 people as a group.

765
01:29:58,401 --> 01:30:05,511
Um, yeah, you mentioned for the US in the news, potentially posting up on the candidate himself.

766
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:11,811
Is that something that you want for us to do? Like as the default artist wants to bring it, you can just email it to me.

767
01:30:11,811 --> 01:30:18,861
You've got your email. Whatever it is, it doesn't have to be a certain day of the week or in advance of glass whenever you come across something,

768
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:29,391
if it looks like it's worthwhile. Send me an email. And I mean, depending on how or what form of media it's in, you know, send it to me.

769
01:30:29,391 --> 01:30:35,631
It might be an attachment. It might be a link. Whatever it is, it's been sent to me through email.

770
01:30:35,631 --> 01:30:41,931
I will go ahead and kind of take the responsibility of preparing a slide for the next class.

771
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:45,501
And then it's an open invitation. If you if you're comfortable and willing,

772
01:30:45,501 --> 01:30:56,241
you can actually take a couple of minutes and present that that article to the class and we can have some discussion on it or I'm happy to as well.

773
01:30:56,241 --> 01:31:05,641
Any other questions? All right, guys, thanks again, so much for your attention and your engagement.

774
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:12,632
Enjoy the rest of your afternoon.
